      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 7 (all Stages), 8 (all Stages), 9 (all Stages) and 10.  By agreement it is also proposed that, notwithstanding the resolution made on 15 December 1982, the sitting shall be suspended from 1.30 p.m. to 3 p.m. and business shall be interrupted accordingly.  Questions shall be taken from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. Private Members' Business will be No. 18.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the co-operation received from the Ceann Comhairle and the Opposition parties in allowing the change in business today in order to facilitate attendance by staff and Members of the Oireachtas at the interdenominational service of peace and reconciliation in Saint Anne's Church, Dawson Street at 2 p.m., organised by the women TDs and Senators of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Yes.  On this side of the House we were very glad to fall in with the arrangements whereby Members will be enabled to attend the special service that is being held today.  It is our wish that as many Deputies as possible would <Col N="1680" /> attend at this service.  I should like it to be clear from the Order of Business before us that the Opposition as usual in their constructive way are facilitating the Government in the passing of a number of items of legislation at very short notice.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the people to decide in a referendum whether the Constitution should be amended to enable the right to vote at Dáil elections to be extended to persons other than <Col N="1683" /> citizens by legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983, proposed to confer on British citizens resident in this country the right to vote at Dáil and Presidential elections and referenda on conditions identical with those applying to Irish citizens.  The President referred the Bill to the Supreme Court and the court ruled that the Bill was repugnant to the Constitution.  Following that decision I announced that the Government had decided to bring forward a Bill to amend the Constitution to enable the right to vote to be determined by legislation.</P>
    <P>The right to vote at Dáil elections is conferred on citizens of Ireland by Article 16.1.2º of the Constitution.  The Bill proposes to replace this provision by a new subsection.  The new provision, while retaining the citizens right to vote, will make it possible to extend this right to such other persons in the State as may be determined by law.</P>
    <P>If the amendment is approved by the people the Oireachtas will be empowered to enact legislation granting the right to vote at Dáil elections to such categories of non-citizens in the State as it may decide.  The selection of categories will be a matter for the Oireachtas which may extend the categories concerned from time to time by fresh legislation.  It will be open to the Oireachtas to take account of special circumstances.  It could, for example, decide to grant the right to vote at Dáil elections to citizens of any country which granted reciprocal rights to Irish citizens living in that country.  At the present time Irish citizens resident in Britain have full voting rights at parliamentary and other elections.  None of the other EEC member states grants the right to vote to Irish citizens at parliamentary or local elections but this position may, of course, change in the future.</P>
    <P>The constitutional constraints which apply in relation to the grant of the Dáil vote to Irish citizens will apply also in relation to non-citizens.  In other words, a minimum age of 18 years will apply; there can be no discrimination on grounds of sex; the persons concerned <Col N="1684" /> must be free from legal disqualifications in relation to voting and they must comply with the provisions of the electoral law.</P>
    <P>A definite connection with this country will be an essential condition of the grant of the Dáil vote, to non-citizens.  It is considered appropriate that this should be a constitutional requirement and should not be left to statute.  For this reason, the proposed amendment prescribes that the vote may be extended only to those non-citizens actually in the State.  Non-citizens will, of course, be required to comply with the normal statutory provisions relating to voting and to registration as electors, including the requirement to be ordinarily resident in a particular constituency on the qualifying date for registration.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the Constitution proposed in the Bill does not extend to granting voting rights to non-citizens at Presidential elections and referenda.  The import of the advice available following the Supreme Court decision on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983, is that the basic concept of a Constitution is that of a fundamental law given by citizens to themselves.  To give non-citizens the right in the Constitution to change the fundamental law enshrined in it would be contrary to this basic concept.  To do so would be inappropriate and could constitute an in-built contradiction in the Constitution itself.  Similar considerations apply as regards Presidential elections. The right to vote at such an election, which is a special election of the Head of State under the Constitution, is a right appropriately reserved to the people who gave themselves the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I feel sure the House will welcome the proposal contained in this Bill.  The principle of extending the right to vote at Dáil elections to persons other than Irish citizens has already been endorsed by the House in approving the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983.  That measure applied only to British citizens.  Now that it is clear that an amendment of the Constitution is required, I am sure the House will agree that the amendment should be couched in such terms as will allow the <Col N="1685" /> Oireachtas to extend the vote to such categories as it may consider appropriate from time to time.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is approved by both Houses I would propose that the referendum be held on 14 June which is polling day for the European Assembly elections.  The Referendum (Amendment) Bill, 1984, which is also before the House, will enable steps to be taken to assist voters in their understanding of the issues involved as is customary in the case of constitutional referenda.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983, was before the House I, as Fianna Fáil spokesman on that occasion, expressed my party's serious reservations regarding the constitutionality of the proposals contained in the Bill which, as the House is aware, proposed extending the right to vote to British citizens living in Ireland.  In fact it would have extended the right to vote to British citizens in Dáil elections, Presidential elections and any referenda held here.  We seem to be spending quite a deal of our time straightening out mistakes which the Government have been making when bringing forward legislation which has subsequently to be altered.  The circumstances surrounding the introduction of the Bill are unusual to say the least and, in view of the provisions of the previous Bill which was declared unconstitutional, it is important that it is stated clearly at the outset that what is proposed now is not the holding of a referendum to ask the Irish people whether they want to give the vote to British citizens or not.  That is not the proposal and it is important that that is fully understood outside.  It is important that the people understand that the Bill which was passed here with the support of the Government parties extending the right to vote to British citizens has fallen and that no such right exists or is being proposed by the Government.  That proposal has been completely withdrawn and all that is provided for in the Bill proposing the constitutional amendment is to give authority to this House to extend the vote to persons other than citizens if and <Col N="1686" /> when it so desires.  There is not any commitment to do so.  The Bill will not allow the Oireachtas, if the constitutional amendment is passed, to extend the vote to non-citizens in the event of a Presidential election or referenda but only in the case of Dáil elections.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will support the proposal to amend the Constitution to give power to the Oireachtas to extend the right to vote in Dáil elections to persons ordinarily resident in the country but who are not Irish citizens.  In agreeing to the holding of a referendum to give this new power to the Oireachtas, and in the event of the referendum result being in favour of the proposal, we are reserving our right to oppose any such legislation when introduced if we are not entirely satisfied with all of its provisions.  Fianna Fáil believe that the only case that can be made at present for extending the right to vote in Dáil elections is to citizens of other EEC countries in which a reciprocal right has been granted by such countries. Fianna Fáil therefore will support future legislation extending voting rights in Dáil elections to citizens of other EEC states only where a similar right has been extended to Irish citizens living in those states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, this Bill does not require any long dissertation from this side of the House.  Most of the arguments regarding a measure of this kind are on the record of the House since the Electoral (Amendment) Bill was being discussed, the principal difference now being the exclusion of the right to vote in elections for the Head of our State and any change in our constitutional laws.  In view of their proposal in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, it is clear that the Government have in mind the introduction of legislation extending the vote to certain categories, but as these have not been spelled out I do not think that this occasion would justify any further consideration of which categories should be included, other than the broad statement of principle which I am enunciating on behalf of my party, that citizens of EEC member states who are ordinarily resident here and whose home countries have extended the right to vote on a reciprocal basis should have the right <Col N="1687" /> to vote in Dáil elections.  Fianna Fáil would consider favourably this proposal, but <i>in toto</i> we are reserving our position until we see the proposals the Government will bring forward if and when the people accept the referendum and the constitutional changes proposed.</P>
    <P>When proposing the extension of the right to vote to non-citizens who are living in the State the Minister suggested it might create difficulty for some persons who would be entitled to postal votes.  I should like him to clarify that.  Does it preclude the extension of the vote, in the event of a postal voter qualifying &mdash; a non-citizen who is a member of the Army serving abroad, in the Middle East, for instance?  Would that person be deprived of the vote?  It is merely a detail which we can deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The only other point I wish to make is that the Government have shown in the speed with which they have brought forward this Bill that it is possible to introduce legislation when the Government decide that circumstances warrant it.  It is a matter of serious concern to us that despite the fact that a long debate took place here on the extension of postal voting to certain categories more than 12 months ago, no legislation of any kind has been prepared by the Government in the intervening period to allow certain categories of Irish citizens who are entitled to be registered but who, due to their personal circumstances in many cases are unable to exercise the franchise.  The Government have not seen their way to bring forward legislation to extend the postal vote to those people.</P>
    <P>That is a disgrace, a dereliction of duty, because there is a serious responsibility on the Government to face up to their duty in that matter.  When a short Private Members' Bill was brought before the Dáil recently the Minister made a very lame excuse that he had not had sufficient time.  I do not accept that.  Deputy Kavanagh may not be very long in this Department but he has been in the Government since 1982 and the leader of his party and Deputy Quinn spoke here in the debate on the extension of postal voting and gave very clear commitments that <Col N="1688" /> consideration would be given to the preparation of legislation.  That commitment was given a long time ago but nothing has been seen since then in that regard.  I do not think the Government have a very proud record in this.  It was not a justifiable excuse to say that the Minister did not have time to bring forward the legislation. I would remind the House that a member of a previous Coalition Government, Deputy Tully, extended postal voting in local elections in 1974.</P>

      <P>It proposes to authorise the Oireachtas to extend the vote to certain categories of people who are not at present authorised to vote in Dáil elections. I have been saying that there are categories of people who are entitled to vote in Dáil elections but because of physical disability and other disabilities are unable to exercise that right.  We have as great if not a greater responsibility to our own citizens first and then to extend it to other citizens.  I regard it as right and proper to speak of the Government's ineptitude in not bringing forward legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, but amendments of the Constitution cannot take place without this House passing legislation.  I am arguing that the Minister has shown his ability to introduce legislation of this kind in an emergency but that he has failed to introduce legislation which would have provided for another important category of persons who are citizens, who are registered to vote, who are fully entitled to vote but who are unable to vote.  The Government stand condemned on that issue.  We had a full and frank discussion on the report of the review of postal voting.  It was a waste of time because the Government took no action whatever on the suggestions made.</P>

      <P>The short life of this Dáil must be somewhat unique because this is the second time in less than a year that we are asking the people if they want to change the Constitution.  We must all be very relieved that this time the atmosphere is very different from the acrimony and distrust which marked last year's unhappy episode.  I am puzzled by the attitude of the Opposition spokesman. Are his party capable of being straight-forward about anything?  The earlier Bill was designed to give voting rights to British citizens resident in this country.  It was based upon a commitment given by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in a very successful meeting with Mrs. Thatcher.  The whole purpose of that Bill, and this Bill, is to make it possible to extend voting rights to British citizens in this country.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why Fianna Fáil will not, for once, come out and say clearly if they are for or against something.  Are they building in reservations at this time so that if it suits them, whichever way the wind is blowing, when the enabling legislation comes in <Col N="1691" /> they can say they were never in favour of this?  Is this a ploy to ensure that this legislation does not achieve the purpose for which it was intended?  I do not understand the mentality of the party opposite because they cannot be straightforward about anything, they always have to be politically cute and ensure there is a way out if it is expedient.  It is clear to everybody that the purpose of this Bill is to extend voting rights to British citizens living in this country.  If we do not accept that, there will be no point wasting the people's time with the referendum on 14 June.</P>

      <P>If the Oireachtas decide later that voting arrangements can be extended to other countries under a reciprocal arrangement, well and good. Deputy Molloy knows that the only country which gives Ireland this reciprocal right is Great Britain.  It is disingenuous on his part to say that his party are reserving their position on this while at the same time building in the principle of extending it to British citizens.  Why not be clear and straightforward about this?</P>
      <P>This Bill is non-controversial.  Its provisions are generous and fair.  The thinking behind the Bill is that it accepts and builds into law a recognition of the fact that the relationship between this country and Great Britain is not an ordinary one. Everyone knows that; our history ensures it; the existence of Partition, the unresolved problems in Northern Ireland and so on are daily reminders.  It must be a matter of regret to everybody who supports this Bill, which is a very positive step, that it should appear at a time when through carelessness, arrogance or insensitivity, or all three, on the part of the RUC, relations between the two countries are far worse than they should be. Enough has been said about the outrageous and indefensible cross-Border incursions.  The firm stand taken by the Government, backed by the Opposition, should put that matter into its proper perspective and ensure that there are no further repeats&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is concerned with two issues.  The first is reciprocal arrangements which should exist for the citizens of both countries.  Over the years millions of Irish people have settled in Great Britain.  For most of them Britain offered a home, work, a chance to lead a full life and, most important of all, it offered them the chance to participate fully in the political process of their adopted country at both local and national levels.  Many of them have made their names in local and national politics. The Labour Party in particular showed the extent to which this has been done. The important thing is that the law as it existed, and then practiced, allowed our people to assimilate fully into their new environment without losing their sense of being Irish or giving up their right to be Irish citizens.  They were able to give loyalty to the new country without losing their identity.  It must be said in fairness that successive British Governments of all colours, in spite of pressure from racists, Powellites, bigots and a wide variety of sources, have resisted the temptation to change the law and take the right to vote from Irish people living in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an ancient phenomenon. One has only to go back over the past couple of months to read through the columns of the <i>Sunday Express</i> and the <i>Daily Express</i> to see how persistent this ranting is and how strong the pressure is for the British Government to do something which could placate the wild men and women on the right of the Conservative Party; it could be a very easy gesture for a British Prime Minister to make at a time of other difficulties.  We have seen Governments, especially Tory Governments, resist this pressure.  This is something we should bear in mind today. Deputy Molloy says this Bill does not specify that but if this Bill is about anything, it is about this.  We are according to British nationals living here the same rights as our people have in Britain &mdash; no more, no less.  We are proposing to give a right to those people who are living <Col N="1693" /> here and paying their taxes the same right that our people enjoy in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The second point about this Bill is that it is a manifestation of goodwill.  I have had a fair bit of post in recent times saying this Bill is unnecessary, that we are being too soft in our dealings with Britain, that we are giving away far too much and that we should take our time before making this move, but nothing could be further from the truth.  This Government have shown over the past month that they can be tough and that they will be tough where vital national interests are concerned. We were tough on the superlevy, we are being tough on the question of Border incursions and we will be tough on every occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The background to this Bill is based on very specific recent events and anybody who followed them would be clear in his mind that this is relevant, but I accept the ruling of the Chair on the matter.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a manifestation of goodwill, something which is very important and we must at all costs work to ensure that there is full understanding and co-operation, based on genuine equality which can help to solve our present difficulties.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is making it possible to extend voting rights to citizens of other countries if they give rights to our citizens.  This could be a very important development as far as creating better relations in the European Community are concerned.  It is right that the Minister has made this possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill which has the support of <Col N="1694" /> all parties.  I regret that the Opposition party cannot come out fairly and squarely and support the basic reason for the introduction of the Bill in the first place.  The idea was at first supported by that party and I cannot understand why the Bill must go through the House clouded in ambiguity on the part of the Opposition. I hope that the very ungenerous view of the Opposition spokesman will not be shared by many others in his party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The President of Ireland did a service by referring the earlier Bill to the Supreme Court.  I wonder why, in putting this referendum before the people, we are excluding some offices from election by these people.  What offices in the United Kingdom are Irish citizens residing there prohibited from voting for?  There are none.  Irish citizens have the same voting rights as British citizens and the whole purpose of the legislation initially was to reciprocate the very generous rights given to Irish people in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>In determining who can or cannot vote in elections I cannot understand why we are attempting to divorce the three constituent parts of the Oireachtas.  Already United Kingdom citizens living here have an input to the election of the Seanad because they can elect county councillors. Thus they have an input to the nominating procedure for the office of President, yet they cannot vote in a Presidential election.  That seems totally illogical and I do not see how this proposed legislation can give them power to vote in Dáil elections but not in Presidential elections or on constitutional amendments. A person given the franchise in parliamentary elections should be able to participate in any Oireachtas election and to vote on proposed amendments to the Constitution.  Is this House to be equated with a county council?  Is there to be some distinction between the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Each part of the Oireachtas has a constitutional function.  How can we give people the power to vote in elections to one House and then prohibit them from voting in Presidential elections or in constitutional referenda?  It is most unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> On what basis are we establishing the principle of the right to vote?  There should not be taxation without representation. If people have been permitted to reside within the jurisdiction for a certain number of years and have been paying taxes, surely those two things give them a right to participate in political life. A Scottish couple in my constituency have been living here over 25 years and paying their taxes.  They are United Kingdom citizens and we cannot expect them to give up their citizenship.  No Irish person living in the United Kingdom has been asked to surrender his or her citizenship. Why should this couple not have a vote in Dáil elections?  If they are given this right, why should they not also be entitled to vote in Presidential elections? I cannot see the distinction.  It is a nonsense. I mean no disrespect to the Minister and I understand the Attorney General has advised that there may be some difficulties.  A Constitution is the ultimate law made and voted on by the people and it cannot be altered without the consent of the people.  We are proposing to include in &ldquo;the people&rdquo; citizens from certain countries who are to be given the vote in Dáil elections.  I cannot see any distinction between Dáil elections, constitutional referenda and Presidential elections.</P>
    <P>I would pose a technical question.  If we extend the right to vote in Dáil elections to UK citizens, does that mean, given our constitutional claim on Northern Ireland, that a group of people from Newry could challenge in the Supreme Court their right to vote in a Dáil election?  It is an interesting question. Presumably prior to this they would have been excluded on the grounds that they were British subjects or citizens.  I wonder what the position will be in the light of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of the Government's being hard or soft on people in giving the right to vote is neither here or there. Anybody who makes a case on a constitutional amendment should do so on the basis of the principle of the amendment, not on the basis of whether the Government are being hard or soft.  It is true that <Col N="1696" /> the purpose of this exercise is to enable a reciprocal arrangement with the United Kingdom but now that we have started on this road we must look at other areas. There are many Irish people who hold American citizenship, particularly in County Donegal.  These people went to America and lived there for many years. They took out American citizenship because they were employed by the state or for other reasons but have now retired to this country.  The position may have changed recently but certainly they were not in a position to vote in Irish elections because if they did so they renounced their American citizenship and therefore their American pensions.  In extending the right to vote we should not think only in terms of British citizens.  Irish people who made their living in America but have retired here should also be given the right to vote.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manning made the point, although not in a serious vein, that we were not trying to give the power to vote to Albanians or Czechoslovakians.  If such people have lived here for a certain time and paid taxes I do not see why they should not be able to participate in the political system.  Perhaps the argument is that we could be flooded by Albanians or Americans and that this would undermine the sovereignty of the State.  The point of control need not be the Constitution because the Government decide who will or will not be allowed to reside here.  If the Government decide to let some Vietnamese people reside here, why should they not have the right to vote in Dáil or Presidential elections, in Seanad elections if they happen to be county councillors or in constitutional referenda?  I have not heard any reasoned argument against that point and I would welcome the Minister's views.  I welcome the whole idea of extending the vote to persons in that category.</P>
    <P>The parents of a young lady living in my constituency are Irish.  She was born in the United Kingdom.  She speaks with a very broad Dublin accent.  She can vote in local elections only.  I never heard such nonsense.  We should give the House the freedom to decide who can and who cannot vote.  This should be done on a principled <Col N="1697" /> basis rather than on an emotive basis.  The question of the length of time a person has been residing here has to be a consideration in determining who can and who cannot vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is overdue.  It has long been my view that people resident in Ireland and taking part in the life of the country for a number of years should not be disenfranchised on the basis of nationality or citizenship. When the Bill was going through the House earlier in the year to extend the vote to British citizens, it was my view that it should not have been as narrow as it was, and that it should have provided for the possibility at least of extending the vote to other EEC nationals residing within this jurisdiction.  The Supreme Court stated that we could not deal with these matters in the way proposed in that Bill without a referendum.  I am pleased that this Bill does not seek to confine the legislative powers to extend the vote to British citizens or EEC citizens, but confers a general power on the Oireachtas to extend the vote to people living within the State.  In a sense that is the only true, proper and democratic way to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>When the Bill comes into force it will confer a wide ambit of power on the House to extend the vote to people of all nationalities living within the State.  It is important that that message should go outside the House.  It will not merely permit the House to extend the vote to people of British nationality living within the Republic of Ireland.  It will permit the House to extend the vote to other nationals from EEC countries and, indeed, to nationals of countries from further afield such as the United States and Pakistan. Deputy Flynn, who is not in the House this morning, frequently pleads the case of the small Pakistani community in Ballyhaunis. I have no doubt that Deputy Flynn will be delighted to know that, under this legislation, if people of Pakistani nationality residing in Ballyhaunis continue to reside in Ireland this House will have the power to extend the vote to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a well-known principle of taxation, <Col N="1698" /> and it goes back to the last century and the philosophy of Adam Smith, that you should not have to pay taxes without being granted the vote.  It should always be remembered that all of those people living and working in Ireland who are not Irish nationals are normally taxed under the Irish taxation system.  They are affected daily by legislation passed through this House.  It is only right that we should extend the vote to them.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's view in saying that, upon this measure being adopted into our Constitution as a result of the forthcoming referendum, the bias would tend to be to extend the vote only to those nationals of other countries whose countries have also sought on the basis of reciprocity to extend the franchise to Irish citizens living in those countries.  In other words, if we were to extend the vote to nationals of the United States of America, the tendency would be to do so only on the basis of reciprocity to ensure that Irish people living in America and who retained their Irish nationality would be allowed to vote in the major elections there.</P>
    <P>Although my personal bias has always been in the context of extending the vote only on the basis of reciprocity, I would hope that we will not be mean in extending the vote, and that we will not use this power simply as a means of foreign policy to seek votes for Irish citizens living elsewhere. We should be generous in extending the franchise to people who have established their roots in Ireland, who have lived in Ireland for many years and been involved in the business community in Ireland.  We should not refuse to extend the vote to non-nationals purely on the basis that the country of their origin is unwilling to extend the vote to Irish nationals and has no intention of doing so.  The criterion must surely be that, if people have lived here for five years or more and have the intention to continue to live here while wishing to retain their original nationality, we will seek through legislation in this House to extend the franchise to them in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister correctly referred to the fact that, at the moment, even within the <Col N="1699" /> EEC the only country in which that level of reciprocity exists is in Britain where Irish nationals can vote.  In other EEC countries at present this power does not exist, although there are moves afoot in other countries to deal with this issue.  I hope that, when we come to enact legislation following the passage of the referendum, we will not merely seek to extend the vote to British nationals as we sought to do in the Bill which was found to be unconstitutional.  I hope we will extend it to all the EEC nationals who have lived in Ireland for in excess of five years.  By doing that we will encourage other member states of the EEC to grant reciprocal rights to nationals of this country.</P>
    <P>The problem is that, if we wait for them to grant reciprocal rights and they wait for us to grant reciprocal rights, there will be a stand-off situation and the franchise will not be extended beyond British citizens. In saying that, I welcome the fact that it will allow us finally to extend the franchise to British citizens.  In the context of non-Irish nationals living within the Republic of Ireland the greater number are British citizens.  Many of them live in my constituency.  They also live in other constituencies.  For many years they felt aggrieved because they were prohibited from voting.  Spouses and children were allowed to vote, but others who wished to retain their British nationality were refused permission to take part in the electoral process to elect members to this Parliament and to elect the Government of the day.  That has been an injustice.</P>
    <P>The passage of this measure enabling the vote to be extended to them will be welcome.  Also nationals of France, Germany and Holland have been living here for many years.  In fairness and in equity the legislation which will be introduced on foot of the enactment of this measure into our Constitution should make provision for them.  We should not refuse to extend the vote here because the countries of their origin are not sufficiently far-sighted to be willing to extend the vote to Irish nationals living in their countries.</P>
    <P>In this context I should like to refer to <Col N="1700" /> the wording of the amendment.  I know this can be dealt with on Committee Stage but I think a reference to it is relevant.  I find the wording a little bit curious. The intent of it is clear from the Minister's speech, but in the amendment which we are inserting in the Constitution which will, in effect, reiterate the fact that all citizens of the State are entitled to vote in a general election to elect members to Dáil Éireann, we go on to extend the vote to such other persons in the State as may be determined by law.  That means as may be determined by this House.  From the Minister's speech the intention effectively is to extend the franchise to people living in the State.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand, although I do not think that it creates a major difficulty, why we simply extend the vote to persons in the State.  In theory, although this House presumably will not pass such legislation. it would be within the powers of this House, due to the phraseology of that amendment, to pass legislation saying that anybody in Ireland whose name is on the electoral register can vote, but that might be taking the meaning of this amendment to absurdity.  I have no doubt that the Minister's explanation would be that while that could happen in theory, in practice we pass legislation presumably requiring a minimum period of residence, together with the requirement of the names being put on the electoral register.  Why not get the semantics of the amendment correct? Why not simply say that we are extending the vote to such other persons resident in the State as may be determined by law? I can see no legal, semantic or linguistic difficulty in at least being that little bit more exact.  If that created the argument that someone going on a week's holiday at election time might not constitutionally be entitled to vote, why not talk about extending the franchise to such other persons as are habitually resident in the State?  That is a phrase well known in international and private international law.  By that means we would be doing what we intend to do, extending the vote to people habitually resident in the State.</P>
    <P>It is a minor point and I do not mean to nit pick but all too often in the past <Col N="1701" /> and the more recent past in the context of constitutional amendments we have not always been as exact in our language as we should be.  As a lawyer who has been involved in a number of constitutional cases, who is interested in constitutional law and has written something about it over the years before becoming a Member of this House, there is no harm in my pointing out that the language of a Constitution should be exact and clear and the meaning and intention of Parliament when putting a proposal before the people to amend the Constitution also should be clear.  I have no doubt that legislation subsequent to the amendment will deal with the point which I am making and that there will be no likelihood of legislation being passed entitling people flying in on a short holiday to vote and leave the country again with no other association with it.  This amendment should have stated that such other persons habitually resident in the State as may be determined by law may have the vote extended to them.  That is more exact language, copperfastening the intent of this proposal.  I should be interested to know the Minister's reason for the amendment not being more exact in its language.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage debate, it is worth making another point in this context with general relevance to the rights of non-nationals living in Ireland and to the Constitution itself.  Since the Constitution was enacted, various fundamental and constitutional rights are expressly stated by the Constitution to extend to citizens of the country.  Over the years cases have come before the courts &mdash; although I do not think that the matter has been finally decided &mdash; which have raised doubts as to whether some of the fundamental rights conferred on Irish citizens actually extend under our Constitution to non-nationals residing in Ireland.  There have been doubts as to whether some constitutional rights can be used by the courts to extend protection to non-nationals living here.</P>
    <P>In that context, one of the most fundamental provisions in the fundamental rights section of our Constitution expressly refers to the fact that all citizens <Col N="1702" /> shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law &mdash; Article 40.1 &mdash; and it goes on to add a qualification.  It appears that that legal equality which the Constitution confers on citizens does not extend to non-nationals.  It would be logical, if we now intend to extend the Dáil Eireann franchise to non-citizens, to take the opportunity to tidy up this constitutional anomaly and ensure that all persons living here are entitled to the same fundamental rights, freedoms and civil liberties as extend expressly to Irish citizens.  The fundamental rights provision under Article 40.3 of the Constitution under which the State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen have been utilised as a very fundamental constitutional protection of civil liberty in a great many constitutional cases of considerable importance before our courts, which seem to confine their ambit to Irish citizens.  Again, Article 40.4.1º refers to the fact that no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very fundamental constitutional provision which again has been mitigated in the courts in many instances and has afforded a protection to the human rights and civil liberties of people living in this country.  There can be no valid or justifiable reason for not extending these rights to non-nationals. We now recognise that we should extend the vote and that in extending the vote we should do so on the basis of no discrimination on the basis of sex or age. We have to deal with non-nationals and <Col N="1703" /> Irish citizens in an identical fashion constitutionally.</P>
      <P>I should have liked the opportunity to have been taken in this legislation to extend the fundamental rights, provisions and safeguards which were conferred on Irish citizens when our Constitution was enacted in 1937 to all persons living within this country.  Indeed, there is a suggestion that if we do not do so at some stage we shall be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which seeks to extend basic human rights to all people living in Europe without discrimination on the grounds of religion.  Taking advantage of this opportunity would not have posed any major administrative, social, constitutional or political difficulties for this House or any political party herein. It would have been seen as a welcome extension of human rights and an acknowledgement of the need to ensure that a constitution keeps pace with modern thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason for welcoming the extension of the franchise, having made my criticisms, is that a number of constitutional amendments have been referred to the people, some of which have been favoured and some opposed.  It indicates that the 1937 Constitution as a constitutional document has often been criticised. There are aspects of that document I should like to see reformed, indeed there are some items in it I wish were not there and I should like to see removed. Members on the opposite side of the House, indeed colleagues in my own party, might disagree with me on some of these issues.  But what is important is that a constitution is not regarded as such a fundamental document that it is unchanging. The bringing into this House of proposals to amend the Constitution, the debates that take place in this House and the putting of issues to the people in referenda indicate the relevance of the Constitution as a growing document, as a changing document keeping pace with changing social conditions.  In dealing with our Constitution it is important that we view it like that, that no particular provision in this Constitution should be <Col N="1704" /> regarded as sacrosanct and safeguarded from criticism, that none of its provisions should be regarded purely on the basis that it was enacted in 1937 and that, therefore, it should remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Constitution remains a living, vibrant, fundamental legal and constitutional document providing the political and social framework for the basic functions of this State.  It is important also that aspects of that Constitution seek to accord with social realities. Indeed, if some aspects give rise to social problems or seek to prevent this House tackling major social issues of the day, they should be the subject of review, of debate and should be put to the people for the purpose of their being given an opportunity to take decisions on issues which they have not been given an opportunity to do so far during their lifetime.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the electorate, all citizens of this country, in this context, will be given an opportunity to amend the Constitution in the area of the extension of voting rights to take into account the realities now of our having a large number of people living in Ireland who are not Irish nationals but who regard themselves as being part of this country, as playing a leading part in the social life of the country and who wish to participate in the democratic process.  Indeed in the context of the Constitution and updating it over the years one of the problems has been that all too often it has been left to the courts to update it by new interpretations in the light of modern, legal and social conditions.  This House has not always been as active in introducing constitutional amendments or providing constitutional protections. Certainly in the sixties and seventies this House, to a great extent, delegated that responsibility to a dynamic and reforming Judiciary in the Supreme Court.  That is not often sufficiently acknowledged by Members of this House.  The fear would be that if we do not tackle other social issues and problems &mdash; which it would not be appropriate for me to mention in any great detail in this debate because I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would stop me if I did, but as a general comment &mdash; if this House is not prepared openly and <Col N="1705" /> properly to tackle other social issues and problems in the light of modern conditions, of existing conflicts, of international political debate, indeed in the context of major social and economic difficulties confronting this State at present, no doubt the courts will within the confines in which they can do so by way of constitutional interpretation.</P>
    <P>But there are many issues that can be dealt with only by way of legislation passed through this House or further and other constitutional proposals and amendments.  It would be my hope that within the next 12 months we would have another Bill before this House seeking a referendum on other issues that need to be resolved and tackled, some of them being issues that this House has for too long ignored or sought to ignore because of the possible political controversy that would arise if they were issues brought into this House.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a tribute to the Minister and his Department in the sense that it indicates how a Minister with the political will and desire to implement a given policy can very rapidly introduce the necessary legislation in this House with the co-operation of the officials in his Department and the parliamentary draftsmen. I can only say that I wish a similar determination was apparent in some other areas where legislation is required.  Certainly it indicates to me that if the political necessity to introduce a measure is recognised it can be done.  The problem we have in many other areas is that the legislative process is suffering from what could be best described as legislative paralysis, when frequently promises are made to produce legislation in all sorts of areas and on all sorts of issues but we are told that because they are terribly complex and difficult it is very difficult and time-consuming and a great deal of time will expire prior to the measure coming before this House.</P>
    <P>In the context of constitutional law &mdash; and I intend to make a passing reference to it only &mdash; and in the context of constitutional reform a problem we have at present is that it is suggested by some lawyers, though it is a view I do not share, that, for example, to extend adoption to <Col N="1706" /> legitimate children who are permanently abandoned by their parents, who are in either foster or institutional care, would be unconstitutional.  I do not believe it would be but some people suggest it is or could be.  As a result, for over ten years now we have had successive Ministers of different Governments investigating, looking at, considering, wondering about, receiving reports on this issue. Some people have told them that would be unconstitutional, some people have told them it would not be.  I only wish that the political will existed to tackle that issue.  I have no doubt that if similar determination existed to tackle that issue, even if we accepted the argument that to so extend the adoption process would be unconstitutional, the response would be why do not we have, as this Minister has done within a short time of being in his Department, a constitutional Bill seeking to amend the Constitution if that is a problem in dealing with this area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine my remarks to that issue.  I compliment the Minister on his speed in introducing this Bill.  In conclusion let me revert to the question of extending the vote.  Recently, in the context of the right of citizens to vote, there was a constitutional action brought before our courts in which it was sought to extend the vote, through the courts system, to disabled or handicapped people.  The courts held that that was a matter to be dealt with by the Legislature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>All I was going to say was that the courts held that that was not a constitutional matter, that it was a matter to be left to this House.  The only point I was going to make on it was that, when this Bill is passed and becomes part of our Constitution, when the Minister introduces legislation, pursuant to this Bill, to extend the vote to non-nationals, I would ask him very specifically to include within its provisions to enable disabled persons to have the benefit of postal voting.  I see that as an issue just as urgent, if not more so, than that of extending the vote to non-nationals.</P>
      <P>The lesson is there with this measure, that is, that if the political will exists to tackle a problem, if the political will exists within the Department of the Environment, there is the expertise to draft the appropriate legislation.  If we are to have, as we must ultimately, very soon after this Referendum is held, legislation to extend the vote to non-nationals, there is then no rational or logical reason why we cannot at the same time provide comprehensive and satisfactory measures for a system of postal voting for disabled people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I unreservedly support the intention behind this Bill and I wish it well.  It is well overdue and we should reciprocate the rights given to Irish people living in Britain in particular. I hope this will be the first legislation which will come from this change in the Constitution if the people decide to support it on 14 June, as I hope they will. After all, British people, particularly, who live in Ireland vote in the European and local elections.  They pay their taxes here and in every way have been part of the State for many years.  It has not really been very sensible to regard them as second class citizens in a State to which they are entitled to feel that they have given long service and that they are very much like everybody else, or to deprive them of being first class citizens of Ireland. They feel that they contribute to the State in every other way and it does not make sense to discriminate against them.</P>
      <P>This Bill brings our voting legislation into the twentieth century and I hope it will be seen as enlightened legislation. The Bill is an enabling Bill in that it enables a constitutional referendum to be held.  It does not really do anything and it is important to get that message across. The Government tried to do something with a previous Bill which was shot down by the Supreme Court.  This document in front of us is enabling legislation which allows the people of Ireland to give power to Dáil Éireann and the Oireachtas to bring in legislation, and that is the view taken by our party.  We reserve our right to see the shape of that legislation.  We cannot on this side give a blank cheque in regard to future legislation.  Any Opposition who would do that would be seriously lacking in their duty as an Opposition, which includes examining legislation to see if it fits the day.  The view we are taking is that we support this Bill but reserve our right to criticise and suggest alternatives and improvements to the various items of the legislation which will come forward once this is passed by the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making a special appeal.  This is <Col N="1709" /> a fundamental piece of constitutional work and it would be a pity if in the glamour and excitement and the large sums that are usually thrown around with regard to the European elections a fundamental entitlement, a fundamental proposal to the Irish people was put in second place and did not seem to be getting the attention it deserved.  While we have some reservations, there seems to be general agreement amongst the Members of the House that we would extend this right.  I make a special appeal to all sides of the House to make sure that their various constituencies and the Government use their resources to make sure that the fact that it is a constitutional referendum is explained clearly to the people between now and June and that they get an opportunity to consider all the items in the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>It would not be consistent with our membership of the EEC if we did not take the view that all people living in our State in whose country reciprocal voting rights exist should be given the same privilege in this country.  In that regard I see this as enlightened legislation.  Overall, I appeal to the Government to make sure that this is not put into second place.  I support unreservedly the intention behind this legislation which is to make first class citizens of the thousands in this country, mainly British I suppose but many others also, who for many years have given a sensible, dedicated service to the Irish State, financially, physically and mentally.  It only makes sense that in choosing the Government under which they live they would have a vote.  This Bill shows that the Irish nation has reached a certain level of maturity in seeing that people who live in our State and serve it are not necessarily &mdash; because they may have a different tag &mdash; in any way opposed to our State, that they are valuable contributors to the development of the Irish State.  In that regard, with the reservations expressed by Deputy Molloy, I totally, fully and unreservedly support this Bill before the House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Members <Col N="1710" /> of the House who have contributed to the Bill for their enlightened contributions. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Opposition for allowing us to proceed as quickly as we can with the passage of this Bill.  There is an urgency in that if we are not able to take it in this session it would perhaps be difficult to have this referendum held on the same day as the European Assembly elections. The time-scale for holding a referendum would have been very difficult to meet if this Bill had not been taken in this session and we had to wait until the next session to take it.  I accept that every side of the House, the Opposition particularly, realise the necessity to have this Bill in this session in order to proceed to hold a referendum on 14 June next.</P>
      <P>In my opening remarks I indicated the need for the Bill, which arises from the fact that the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983, which proposed to give full voting rights to British citizens only, is now unconstitutional.  This new Bill will widen the scope to include citizens of other countries and in one respect will be more acceptable to the House and the people in this country in that this right can be extended to any group of citizens according to any legislation which is passed subsequent to the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy in his contribution was in full agreement with the general thrust of the Bill.  He made a point about postal votes for non-citizens.  In that respect and without any introduction of another Bill dealing with a postal vote it is unlikely that non-citizens would have the right to postal votes at present.  Members of the Garda Síochána and the Army who are citizens of this country are allowed postal votes.  That right does not extend beyond those categories and the postal vote aspect of the Bill subsequently would not be extended to any other categories.  I give the House the assurance that we will be bringing in a Bill dealing with the extension of postal voting to other citizens and not simply the disabled who are probably the largest group who would benefit by the extension of postal voting rights.  I am very well aware of the need to extend the postal vote but, as I said when a Bill was brought before the House <Col N="1711" /> by The Workers' Party, they were not simply the only people to whom the extension of the postal vote could be made.  A great many other categories were demanding that they be considered for the postal vote and in that respect all categories will be looked at.  I would like to bring in legislation to deal with the views of other categories and I would like the House to consider several other categories who are making their demands for a right to the postal vote.  I assure the House that there will be no delay and I will look at other categories in the next session as soon as I get an opportunity to do so.  I have given that assurance to the House and I assure the House &mdash; which is aware of my record since becoming Minister for the Environment &mdash; that the Department of the Environment have probably introduced more legislation in that period than have any other Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised the point that the amendment might be framed differently. In order to be eligible to vote a person must comply with the electoral law and this law requires a person to be ordinarily resident in the State.  There is no question of someone coming here on holidays or merely spending a fortnight here and then being eligible to vote.  The ordinary law which applies to present citizens will apply to non-citizens.  Therefore, the fact that someone had been here for a very short time but was here on the day when registration was taking place would not entitle him to voting rights.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell inquired about the position of people in the North.  Again, people from that area would have to comply with the electoral law and this of course would include the residency qualification. Because of previous laws most of the citizens from the North would be entitled to vote but if they are not ordinarily resident here they will not be entitled to vote in our general elections.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell made the point, too, that this Bill will not confer on non-citizens the possibility of voting in Presidential elections and in referenda in the future.  I explained in my opening <Col N="1712" /> remarks that the constitutional Bill deals only with the Dáil vote whereas the electoral Bill which was thrown out by the Supreme Court went further.  I explained, in the light of the Supreme Court decision, that it was not considered appropriate to provide in the Constitution for voting by non-citizens in Presidential elections and in referenda.  The basic concept of the Constitution is that of a fundamental law given by citizens to themselves.  It follows that only the citizens have the power to amend the Constitution. If there were provision for the Constitution to be amended by persons other than our citizens, there would be a basic contradiction in the Constitution itself.</P>
    <P>I think I can say that the Bill is totally acceptable to the House and I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I hope that today we will conclude the Bill so that it may proceed to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister indicate the number of non-citizens who are resident here and who would be likely to qualify in the event of legislation being introduced to extend the voting rights to them in Dáil elections?  I take it that these are recorded as local authority electors only in the registers compiled in the various constituencies so I assume the Department would have statistics on the number of people we are dealing with.

      <P>Basically, the Deputy is correct in saying that the up-to-date information is not available to us as to the numbers involved.  In regard to the 1981 Census of Population, which provided for the collection of data regarding the country of birth of the population, according to the Central Statistics Office the required information in regard to some of the data we would like to have processed will not be available for some time.  However, the total number of persons on the 1983-84 Register of Electors, the latest we have, who are not entitled to vote in Dáil elections but who are entitled to vote in European Parliament <Col N="1714" /> elections is 13,691.  This total includes all EEC nationals.  It is estimated that about 10,000 British citizens are included in that total.  The number of persons entitled to vote at local elections only &mdash; these are people from outside the EEC &mdash; is 6,125 according to that latest count.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to contradict the impression given by Deputy Manning in his contribution that there has been some change in the basic position of Fianna Fáil in regard to the extension of the vote to non-citizens &mdash; and this includes British citizens &mdash; in respect of Dáil elections.  If the Deputy had listened carefully to what I was saying he could not possibly have come to the conclusion that there was any change in our position.  I said that we were supporting this amendment to the Constitution, that it is merely an enabling provision granting powers to the Oireachtas to extend at a later date the voting right to non-citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had to put down a marker that we could not possibly commit ourselves in advance to give full support to any legislation which would be brought forward after the passing of a referendum of this kind without having seen that legislation <Col N="1715" /> in advance.  I fail to understand how Deputy Manning can attribute a sinister meaning to that simple, straight-forward position which is one that any Opposition would adopt.  It was disingenuous of him to try to create that impression.  We are dealing with legislation before the House, we cannot deal with hypothetical legislation which we have not seen and which obviously has not yet been prepared.</P>
    <P>When legislation was introduced here some months ago proposing the extension of the vote in certain circumstances to British citizens we stated clearly that our party supported the extension of the right to vote in Dáil elections to British citizens residing here.  We pointed out the valuable contribution which they had made to the development of society in the Twenty-six Counties.  We emphasised our appreciation of the fact that Irish citizens residing in Britain have been granted the right to vote in British elections. I went into some detail in putting on record the historical context in which that right continues to be exercised by Irish citizens living in Britain.  It had nothing to do with generosity on the part of the British authorities in extending that right to us, it had more to do with their colonial activities in the past.  However, that is all on the record and we are supporting the proposal before us.  We wish to make it quite clear that we will examine any legislation brought forward by the Government subsequent to the passing of this referendum and we will decide what attitude we will take on such legislation, depending on the merits of the proposals contained in it.</P>

However, what he has just said is much more straightforward and unambiguous than the terms in which he couched his earlier sentence which was not very clear.  I am very happy to hear the assurances he has given now. I should like to ask the Minister if any thought has been given to the fact that French people living here have the right to vote in their own national elections? <Col N="1716" /> Is it possible that there might be double voting and that foreigners may be entitled legally to vote in two sets of national elections?</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to assist voters at the referendum by making available to them a statement explaining the issue on which they are being asked to vote.  It also proposes that the poll at the referendum be taken on the basis of counties and county boroughs instead of Dáil constituencies to facilitate the taking of the Assembly elections on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill has dealt fairly fully with the purposes and content of this measure and it does not appear necessary for me to make a lengthy statement on the matter.  Briefly, section 1 provides that a polling card, containing the statement <Col N="1717" /> set out in the appendix to that section must be sent to every elector, including postal voters.  The statement will also be displayed on posters in and in the precincts of polling stations.  Presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters by reading out the statement to them, where necessary, and asking whether they wish to vote in favour of or against the proposal and then marking the ballot paper in accordance with the voters' answers. These arrangements are identical with those made in relation to previous referenda on Bills to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for the taking of the poll at the referendum on the basis of counties and county boroughs instead of Dáil constituencies. This change will apply only to the forthcoming referendum and is being made because the referendum is to be held on the same day as the European Assembly election which is being organised on a county and county borough basis.  Having the two polls taken by reference to the same area will facilitate the work of the returning officers.</P>
    <P>The information arrangements provided for in this Bill are additional to the permanent provisions of the referendum law under which copies of Bills to amend the Constitution are made available in post offices for inspection, free of charge, and for sale at a price not exceeding two-and-a-half pence.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a technical one, identical in form with previous similar measures.  The important part of the content is the statement set out in the appendix to section 1. I am sure Deputies will find this a reasonable description of the proposal contained in the Ninth Amendment of the Constitution</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This Bill deals with matters of long standing practice, one being the issue of polling cards.  Another section refers to arrangements for the taking of the poll in county and county boroughs instead of Dáil constituencies which have different boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of polling cards I am pleased that the Minister is making <Col N="1718" /> arrangements to ensure that every voter receives one, but in view of the fact that the European Parliamentary elections will be held on the same day I ask the Minister whether he intends to issue two separate polling cards.  To do so would be to involve the State in unnecessary expense.  Surely the instructions could be printed on one polling card and delivered on one postal delivery rather than duplicating the effort.</P>
    <P>The provision regarding presiding officers is something which is of great interest to me.  On a number of occasions I have sought to establish the exact rights of presiding officers when dealing with illiterate voters.  I have raised questions previously in the Dáil and have had correspondence with the Department concerned and with the returning officer in the Galway West constituency but have failed to establish the legal position. I would like the Minister to set out in detail the procedures to be followed by presiding officers when an illiterate voter enters the polling booth to cast his vote.</P>
    <P>What amount of money will be allocated to the returning officer in each constituency to enable him to carry out the poll in an effective and efficient manner? It has been brought to my notice on a number of occasions that the reason the results are slow in appearing following an election is due to the inadequate number of staff employed by returning officers to carry out the count.  The reason for the lack of staff is that the Department do not provide sufficient money to the returning officer to enable him to make adequate provision for a speedy and efficient count.  I think it would be in the interest of democracy if the Minister would take a personal interest in this. This might have greater relevance in the event of a general election where the full complexity of the proportional representation system comes into play with the subsequent transferring of votes involving inevitable delays.  Where there is only a small counting staff employed the delays will obviously be longer.  It surprises me that certain constituencies can produce results much more quickly than others, and there is a need for tidying-up in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> Everyone is impressed with election systems in other countries where results are announced almost as soon as the poll is over.  We have had occasions in my time in the House where results have still not been received seven days after election day.  That was the famous long count in Longford-Westmeath.  I am not talking about that in particular because it was exceptional, but it is not exceptional to have counts going on for two days.  This should not be allowed to continue, especially when one considers the rigours of an election campaign and the time and effort involved by the personnel concerned. It is not right that once the poll is over and the counting starts it will take another 48 hours before the work is completed. This does not make sense.  If it is not possible to have a mechanical voting system, which obviously will not be possible for some years, we do have a sufficient number of unemployed who could be available to count votes.  They would be very pleased to have a day's work counting votes.  As it is, a small staff are involved in a long count over an extended period of time and when they become tired the returning officer is obliged to adjourn the count.  It would make more sense if a larger number of staff were employed initially and in this way the results would be known earlier.  We would also be seen to be capable of providing quick and efficient results.</P>
    <P>In the forthcoming European elections which will take place over the same period other member countries will be holding their elections at the same time. It will look strange to them if the Irish votes take longer to be counted.  It is not beyond our capacity to have the votes counted quickly but the underfinancing of this important aspect of the election process is the cause of the slow returns. The niggardly attitude which has prevailed in the Department of Finance or in the Minister's own Department is the cause.  It is wrong and there should be a rethink from those concerned.</P>
    <P>In the event of both elections being held on the same day would the Minister inform us whether two separate ballot boxes will be provided?  If not, there will <Col N="1720" /> be confusion in separating the referendum votes from the European election votes, which will be of a different colour. Would it not be more sensible, if the referendum votes are counted in the county constituency, that arrangements be made that the vote in each county also be counted at the same centre and the results sent to the returning officer at whatever centre point this officer is located?  The returning officer could then make the tot from each county rather than transfer all these votes after they have been brought to an assembly point in each county, checked, the ballot count carried out and then sent to a central point where the actual votes will be counted.  It seems a cumbersome and unnecessary exercise.  If the staff were all assembled under one roof with an official in charge it would make sense to proceed with the counting of the European Parliament election votes at the same location rather than having a fleet of transport travelling around huge constituencies &mdash; for example, the Connacht-Ulster constituency. It is ludicrous to think of all these little boxes from all these little polling stations being brought to a centre point in the county, being checked there and then being transferred to a counting centre.  It boggles the mind to think that we cannot carry out this exercise more efficiently and speedily and I ask the Minister for his comments.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister whether presiding officers at polling stations on 14 June will be entitled to cast their vote at their officiating station.  I understand that on a previous occasion presiding officers were denied that opportunity and were therefore obliged to leave their officiating station to travel to their home station where they were registered.  It meant in effect that they were denied their personal vote. This occurred because the Department did not make the necessary provision.  I trust that provision will be made in advance to ensure that the same thing does not happen at the forthcoming elections. I ask the Minister to confirm that?</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for making the necessary arrangements, which will assist the voters.  It is very important that poll cards should be issued and we do not <Col N="1721" /> consider it an unnecessary expense. Unfortunately some people think that if they do not receive a poll card they are not entitled to vote.  The percentage of such people is very small but it has caused some confusion over the years and therefore I suggest that when the Minister is placing advertisements covering the elections he should make it quite clear to the electorate that polling cards are merely for the guidance of registered voters and are not in themselves an entitlement to vote.  The entitlement is contained in the actual registration itself.  I will come back later to the role of presiding officers when dealing with illiterate voters.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Molloy for his helpful remarks on this very short Bill.  He made a number of interesting observations.  The first one was whether there would be one or two polling cards.  As he suggested there will be one polling card so that there will not be any confusion and there will be a saving by having one polling card referring to the two elections.  In my opening remarks I said that presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters by reading out the statement to them where necessary and asking them whether they wish to vote in favour or against the proposal and then marking the ballot paper in accordance with the voters answers.  The Deputy may wish to know the even more detailed requirements for a presiding officer when dealing with illiterate voters. If he would allow me to give him the relevant information by post I will send it to him.</P>

I would like to tell him that it is part of the law <Col N="1722" /> and is usually part of the booklet sent out to every presiding officer in each area and this gives him his duties in carrying out the vote on that particular day.  There is not any great secret about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We know a lot of things about this.  The Deputy and I have been in many elections.  With regard to inadequate staff at counts there are occasions when it struck me, particularly when the count for my constituency was usually the last in.  It was for many years a three-seat constituency.  I have to agree with the Deputy that I often thought there was an inadequate number at the count.  I find now that this is not the fault of the Minister for the Environment where finance is concerned.  It is the Department of Finance who make money available for elections and in that respect the money provided has to be divided among all the various constituencies on the basis of the number of seats and the number of electors in the particular area.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a very complicated form of elections in the single transferable vote system.  That requires a great deal of accuracy in checking.  Some of us on the outside of the count often cause delays by demanding that every vote be scrutinised very closely.  Obviously, with the multiplicity of figures on a voting paper there can be some problems in that respect.  In recent elections the number has been increased at the count stations and the results have been a little speedier. In the past there were some very long delays basically because of an insufficient number of counters in the count centres. I accept that the single transferable votes system is a slow system to count and cannot be compared with the single vote system in Britian or the mechanical methods of voting on the Continent or in the USA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the requirement to have the EEC count centre in one area in the constituency but there will be one ballot box into which all the papers will be put from the referendum and the European Assembly elections.  These will be sorted <Col N="1723" /> out in the constituencies of the county boroughs in which the referendum votes will be counted.  I said on the European Assembly Elections Bill that there will be an opportunity when this sorting process is carried out for observers to see the face of the ballot paper and to make &mdash; as they usually do &mdash; a very close assessment of what way the count is going.  This will take some of the tension out of having to wait until the following Monday or Tuesday to find out what the eventual result of the European election will be.  Counting for this particular referendum will obviously take place in the county boroughs the morning after the polling stations close and that result will probably interest a lot of people while they are waiting for the European election count to take place.  I will see if it is possible to give the Deputy a little more information on the presiding officer situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the instructions given to presiding officers.  In the booklet which is sent from the Minister's Department I understand that the instruction says that when an illiterate voter enters a polling station to cast his vote the presiding officer has to make sure that certain persons are not present in the polling station and he clears the polling station.  The instruction says that the only person entitled to be present is the presiding officer.  If that is so what is the status of the poll clerk and what is the status of a member of the Garda Síochána who is present in the polling station for the purpose of maintaining the peace?</P>

      <P>Under section 75 of the Electoral <Col N="1724" /> Act, 1963, the provisions are as follows:</P>
      <P>...the presiding officer shall, in the presence of the personation agents (if any) and no other person, cause the vote of the voter to be marked on a ballot paper in the manner directed by the voter and shall forthwith place the ballot paper so marked in the ballot box.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been read out <i>ad nauseam</i> and the interpretation any ordinary person will put on that is that the poll clerk is not entitled to be present in the polling station and has to leave.  I have asked these questions and the Minister has not answered them yet.  What is the role of the Garda Sióchána?  Can the presiding officer instruct a member of the Garda Sióchána to leave the polling station? Does he put his clerk outside the door?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to move from the voting area.  That may mean in a very large hall where there are several booths that they move to an area where the conversation is not overheard.  The agents from the various political parties would be allowed to remain and listen to the presiding officer asking the illiterate voter what he requires done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about a large hall.  I am talking about a country school-house where they are in the room. There is a polling station there.  The presiding officer and the poll clerk are appointed by the returning officer and I take it that they have some standing in law.  The member of the Garda Síochána is there for his purposes and each candidate is entitled to have an agent present. As the instruction is written, if an illiterate voter comes in to vote the presiding officer must instruct the poll clerk and the member of the Garda Sióchána to leave the polling station.  What is the point in having poll clerks if they are not allowed to remain in the polling station when the vote is being cast?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 75 of the Electoral <Col N="1725" /> Act, 1963, states that no person other than the presiding officer and the agents for the parties may be in the polling station when the vote is cast for an illiterate voter.  If that is adhered to strictly, they will be the only people allowed to remain in the polling station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that instruction is reasonable?  This has been causing some concern in my constituency where a large number of illiterate voters participate in the election process.  There is also a problem with regard to language because a large part of the constituency is in the Gaeltacht and it is not always the case that the presiding officer is fluent in the language. Problems can arise in regard to that matter. For whatever reason, there is a high percentage of illiterate voting &mdash; or &ldquo;shout&rdquo; voting, as it is called.  If that rule is to be applied rigidly I could see a situation arising where it might not be possible to carry out the poll.  If that procedure were adopted it could take five or ten minutes for each illiterate voter to cast his vote and this could lead to a large queue of voters.  If a number of illiterate voters came to the polling station at 6 p.m. there would be no hope of all of them casting their vote.  To my mind, the instruction is not reasonable: to tell the truth, it is daft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my knowledge it was never applied up to the time of a recent election in County Galway where it caused consternation. When the returning officer was called from his office in Galway to the polling station where the rule was being interpreted and applied in the fashion as enunciated, he was surprised at the interpretation put on it by the presiding officer. He consulted the Department and was told that what was in the instructions was in the instructions and he was told to interpret them for himself.  He could not get a clear indication from the officials or the Minister as to whether the presiding officer was within his rights. The instruction, as read by the Minister to the House, cannot be intrepreted in any way other than the presiding officer must remove the poll clerk and the member <Col N="1726" /> of the Garda Síochána.  Only the presiding officer may be present.  If that is to be applied rigidly in every polling station in my constituency on the next occasion it will cause absolute havoc, as it did previously in the polling station I mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is more to this than meets the eye.  It was used by members of a political party in that area who had very little support.  It was used as a device by their election agent to disrupt the voting of people whom it was well known would not vote for that party.  It was a device that was employed to try to intimidate those people from casting their vote and in some cases it intimidated them to the extent that people were reluctant to cast their vote because of the attitude that was adopted.  I am amazed the Minister is standing over the instruction and I ask him to change it.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Deputy Molloy.  A poll clerk has duties and obligations laid down which are known to him.  Is there anything in the Act or in the instructions deriving from the Act that states how these duties are to be performed in the absence of the poll clerk? It is simple enough if there is only one individual involved but in the circumstances mentioned by Deputy Molloy there could be five or six such people one after another, thus delaying the proceedings.

      <P>The provisions of that Act have been accepted in many general elections.  I accept some of the criticisms made about the situation.  There was an easement in the Act to allow companions to vote for people who were incapacitated or who had bad sight and this was a considerable help.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not make sense.  In the case of a physically incapacitated person, a companion can go with him or her and mark the ballot paper but this cannot be done for an illiterate voter.  The instructions as laid down in the booklet from which the Minister read&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that he is right.  It is not because I am sitting on this side of the House as Minister for the Environment that I have every section of the electoral Acts in my head but I accept that it is the practice in most polling stations that the presiding officer and the poll clerk remain when illiterate voters are casting their votes. The position is that if somebody challenges that situation under the law then only the agents and the presiding officer must remain.  I have never heard of it happening in my constituency but that is <Col N="1729" /> the law.  I will consider what the position of the poll clerk should be.  In the Act his position is to assist the presiding officer but whether the poll clerk should have a statutory position in the polling station is a matter for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>What is the role of the Garda officer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the Garda officer is to come to the assistance of the presiding officer if the presiding officer feels he needs such assistance.  If a problem arises or if there is some truculence in the polling station and the presiding officer feels he cannot handle it he is entitled to call on the member of the Garda to assist him in carrying out his duties in the polling station.  We all accept that a garda of his own volition cannot interfere in the carrying out of the poll or the marking of ballot papers, it must be the presiding officer who requires and requests his assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the presiding officer is a political animal he can ensure that his action will not be observed by the member of the Garda Síochána because he has the authority to tell the garda to leave the polling station.  As we now see, he also has the power to tell the poll clerk to leave the polling station.  In fact, he can proceed to do the devil and all while he has those two people outside the door. There is nobody to observe him except an agent but agents are not always present. Surely the electoral system here operated by the Government of the day should not be dependent on the presence of a candidate's agent to ensure that the procedures are proper and correct and are adhered to in all cases.  It would seem to make sense that the necessity for having two persons in an official capacity at the polling station is to ensure that one can observe what the other is doing, and that one can report if the other is acting improperly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While those two people are outside the room with an illiterate voter inside the polling station I can visualise a situation where large numbers of the ballot papers <Col N="1730" /> would be drifting down into the ballot box at a hell of a rate.  That would not be observed by anybody other than an illiterate voter who in many cases might not be quick enough to understand what was going on.  The Irish voting system can be seen now to be open to all sorts of hookey carry-on.  Now that this has come to light the Minister should give an assurance to the House that he is concerned about this.  It is an extraordinary admission for the Minister to have to make &mdash; I recognise that he was honest enough in making it &mdash; that it seems that many of the votes cast by illiterate voters here in the past were illegally cast because the provisions of the law were not adhered to if the law states that the poll clerk was not entitled to be present.  The Minister has admitted that to his knowledge the poll clerk has remained in almost all cases where an illiterate person was casting his or her vote.  Now we see that that is illegal and that the official should not have remained.  What is the status of the votes cast on behalf of such illiterate people by presiding officers?  We are getting into an extraordinary contortion if one follows the strict interpretation of the instructions and the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in saying that this idea of having these officials removed from the polling stations was never implemented. I have been participating and helping in elections for the last 25 years and it was only on the occasion of the last general election that I observed this provision being availed of.  It was availed of for a very vindictive reason.  It was part of an organised campaign by the Fine Gael Party in the Galway West constituency to create difficulty for elderly illiterate voters who were known not to be of their persuasion that this device was thought up and used rigidly.  It brought the presence of the Superintendent of the Garda and the returning officer to the area.  It was the cause of many phone calls to Dublin and general confusion was created.</P>
    <P>That was the deliberate intention of the people behind the use of this device. To a certain extent they may have succeeded. Certainly, many of the voters I met felt imtimidated by this action.  I <Col N="1731" /> appeal to the Minister, in the interests of fair play and now that this matter has been exposed, to inform the House that he will agree to amend the law and restore the position to what it has always been, that the poll clerk will remain to observe what his presiding officer is doing, to assist him and to be in a position to give evidence in the event of anything untoward happening.  An officer of the Garda Síochána should, if he decides it is proper for him to do so, be allowed to remain in a polling station.  Nobody should have the power to have him removed particularly when there is the anomaly whereby any citizen can go in with a physically incapacitated voter but a citizen may not go in with an illiterate voter.  Why is so much made of the distinction between them?  It does not make sense.  It is our job to ensure that common sense is seen to apply in all cases and that if we come across such anomalies they are changed.  It is better to make such changes now in the calm of a referendum which is non-contentious and a European election which is held in huge constituencies and may not raise blood temperatures to the same extent that a Dáil election may with a big number of candidates contesting in smaller constituencies.  I appeal to the Minister to give an indication that he will remove this anomaly from the system.</P>

      <P>I would not like the impression to go abroad that returning officers for constituencies are in any way slack about the people they select as presiding officers.  I insist that presiding officers are usually people chosen because political parties over successive elections accept that they carry out their duties in a fair and honest manner.  Presiding officers can be objected to if they are known to be politically biased one way or another or if it is suspected beforehand that they may do something in favour of one party or another which is not in keeping with the law.  It would be unwise of us to say that the results of elections in the past may have been somewhat askew because of the provision referred to by Deputy Molloy.  That provision <Col N="1732" /> is contained in the 1963 Act which was introduced by the Deputy's party and it has remained unchanged since.  I will look at the problem but I do not think it will necessarily be solved by saying that the garda and the poll clerk should remain.  The Deputy may feel that it would meet the problem he encountered in his area.  I will look at it to see if that is necessary.  It is unclear to most Deputies why poll clerks have to leave their polling areas when they are challenged.</P>

      <P>In case the Minister may have thought I was casting a slur on any presiding officer and that I was referring to a situation in the Galway West constituency, I wish to point out that I was not casting any slur on that presiding officer who was seriously embarrassed at having to interpret the law in the strict sense, and it had never been interpreted in that way before.  The presiding officer was a first-class official in the last general election.  It was the election agent for the Fine Gael candidate who insisted that the presiding officer interpret the law in that way, the way in which it was written.  The presiding officer then had to remove the people I am complaining of.  I have said the whole thing was part of a political attempt to cause as much confusion and difficulty as possible in an area where the voting strength was strongly against Fine Gael.  These tactics do not do anything for democracy and, in the long run, they did not do anything for Fine Gael in that area.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Oireachtas, through the Minister, to make the necessary changes to ensure that that kind of interpretation will not have to be made in future so that people will not be susceptible to the whims of vindictive election agents who want to create as much difficulty as possible.  This law had never been interpreted in this way previously and the validity of the votes cast by all illiterate voters in the past must come into question, even on the Minister's admission. Can I take it from what he has said that he will have a look at this and that he will take power to remove the anomalies from the instructions as they are written at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to extend from £15 million to £45 million the limit on the amount of borrowings by Irish Shipping Limited which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance. The enactment of this Bill is necessary in order to make provision for the probable financial needs of Irish Shipping Limited over the next two years.  The opportunity is also being taken to extend to Irish Shipping Limited certain statutory controls <Col N="1735" /> relating to remuneration, allowances for expenses and superannuation. As Deputies are aware, Irish Shipping Limited was originally established in March 1941 to ensure the availability of vital supplies during the Second World War.  In addition to its deep sea shipping operations, it has since diversified into other areas including insurance, car ferry services, property development, stevedoring, ship management services and other activities.  These ancillary activities over the years have provided the company with a profitable cushion against losses incurred periodically in the very volatile deep sea shipping business.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Group had enjoyed 15 consecutive years of profit to 31 March 1982 but in the following year, 1982/83, incurred net losses of £14 million.  Losses on the deep sea sector, which is the company's principal sphere of activity, amounted to £20.1 million, offset to the extent of £6.1 million by profits on the sale of ships and from ancillary activities. This compares with a profit of £3.3 million in the previous year.  Further substantial losses of the order of £22 million are estimated in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 1984.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited is, therefore, in a very critical financial position, due primarily to the collapse of the world deep sea freight market.  The tramp shipping market has always been subject to cyclical slumps.  Following the world oil crisis of 1973, uneconomic freight rates were a feature of the years 1975 to 1977.  Rates improved in 1978 and this trend continued through to January 1981.  Rates commenced to decline in February 1981 and later in the year the market disintegrated completely.  By December 1982 average rates for a &ldquo;handisize&rdquo; vessel of 27,000 tons had fallen from $8/9,000 per day at the peak to about $3,700 a day and for a Panamax vessel of, say 65,000/70,000 tons from $18,000 per day to $3,500 per day.  Paradoxically, the rates for the larger vessel had not only been more severely hit but in many cases had even declined below the actual level of rates for the smaller &ldquo;handisize&rdquo; vessels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> The catastrophic decline in freight rates is due basically to the world economic depression, resulting in a growing excess of shipping supply over demand. The market situation throughout 1982 and 1983 has been one of worldwide heavy losses by shipowners, bankruptcies, debt rescheduling, deferred delivery of new vessels and increased laying-up of vessels.</P>
    <P>Even if the activities of Irish Shipping Limited had been confined to the operation of their wholly-owned fleet of four vessels totalling about 153,000 tons deadweight, the collapse of the freight market would have posed serious problems for the company.  These problems have been seriously aggravated by the fact that the company had chartered-in nine vessels, foreign owned and with foreign crews, totalling 393,000 tons deadweight to cater for expected increases in coal, steel and lumber shipments which never materialised. The vessels, which were chartered-in under separate agreements terminating on various dates from 1986 to 1990, comprise four Panamax type bulk carriers of from 59,000 to 64,000 tons deadweight and five &ldquo;handisize&rdquo; vessels of from 27,000 to 32,000 tons deadweight.</P>
    <P>The company's decision to enter into long-term charter agreements for nine vessels has proved disastrous.  The agreements, which were entered into without the knowledge or consent of either the Minister for Transport or the Minister for Finance, were made on the assumption that market freight rates would be significantly higher than the fixed rates at which the ships were chartered.  But instead, the market collapsed leaving Irish Shipping with nine vessels earning only a fraction of the cost to the company under the charter agreements.</P>
    <P>Since 1973 Irish Shipping Limited have been a partner with the Cardiff shipowners, Reardon Smith Line, in an operating pool or consortium of vessels known as Celtic Bulk Carriers.  The creation of the pool enabled Celtic Bulk Carriers to quote for business which neither party alone would have had the capacity to handle.  Celtic Bulk Carriers were successful in obtaining substantial <Col N="1737" /> time-charter business for bulk cargoes, particularly steel &mdash; Europe to the east coast of the United States &mdash; and timber &mdash; west coast of the United States to Europe &mdash; and before the world freight market collapsed were the biggest single operator in these two trades.  Unfortunately, the Reardon Smith Line have themselves run into financial difficulties. This has compounded the financial problems of Irish Shipping Limited, because Reardon Smith are not at this time in a position to meet their share of the joint commitments they had entered into with Irish Shipping under the Celtic Bulk Carriers pooling agreement.</P>
    <P>Faced, therefore, with an increasingly critical financial situation, Irish Shipping Limited recently entered into negotiations with the foreign owners of the nine chartered-in vessels with a view to seeking some reduction in the financial burdens of the long-term charters.  I am glad to be able to say that as a result of the negotiations significant concessions have been obtained from the owners concerned. For obvious commercial reasons, the details cannot be disclosed but I can say that they mean very substantial cash savings to Irish Shipping in the period up to 31 December 1985.</P>
    <P>It was part of the agreement with the largest shipowner concerned, from whom the greatest concessions were obtained, that the company would purchase for $42 million two of the chartered-in vessels, the <i>Slaney Venture</i>, a Panamax vessel of about 62,000 tons deadweight constructed in 1982, and the <i>Celtic Venture</i>, a &ldquo;handisize&rdquo; vessel of about 32,000 tons constructed in 1983.  The company's position is such that they have little choice but to purchase the two vessels under long-term financing arrangements if their short-term financial commitments, which are at present extremely onerous, are to be reduced to tolerable levels.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited also find it necessary, as a temporary expedient, to continue the foreign crewing of the two vessels as at present.  The company have informed me that the replacement of the foreign crews by Irish crews would involve the company in conversion costs <Col N="1738" /> amounting to about £500,000 and additional operating costs of £1.6 million a year.  The company simply cannot afford these additional costs at the present time. When things get back to normality, however, the company's intention is that Irish crews will be employed on the vessels.</P>
    <P>The loan on the two vessels being acquired by Irish Shipping Limited will be secured partly by way of a mortgage on the vessels and the balance by way of a guarantee of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Following the negotiations with the foreign shipowners the board of Irish Shipping Limited submitted a report to me in relation to the company's overall financial situation and having taken account of the substantial concessions secured from the shipowners, have requested limited support from the Government by way of Exchequer guarantees of borrowings.  As already indicated, the company require an Exchequer guarantee of $12.5 million, or about £10.7 million at current exchange rates, towards the cost of purchasing the two vessels.  In addition, the company estimate that they will need further guaranteed borrowings of slightly more than £12 million to meet their projected cash deficit in the period up to the end of 1985. A recovery of the shipping market in the meantime would, of course, reduce the size of the projected cash deficit.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that Irish Shipping Limited face a very difficult time over the next few years.  There is no point in my speculating at this stage on market rates in 1986 or beyond or on what the company's financial position will be in those years.  There are too many imponderables involved such as the progress of the world economy, future oil prices, and so on.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been a slight improvement in market freight rates due, some experts believe, to the upswing in the United States economy, but it is as difficult to predict when a real improvement will occur as it would have been to envisage three years ago the depth of the present shipping recession.  It has to be assumed that the present recession will not continue indefinitely and that rates will return to commercial levels in due <Col N="1739" /> course.  The problem faced by shipping companies during a recession is that of staying in business in order to be able to benefit when the inevitable upturn in trade and market rates occurs.  Irish Shipping Limited believe that the market will have recovered sufficiently by 1986 to enable them to resume viable operation.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited had an enviable record of profitable operation in the past in one of the world's most competitive market places.  The company are now facing the most serious challenge in their history and the Government believe that they should be given the limited Exchequer support they are now seeking.  Before this can be done, however, it is necessary to extend the statutory limit, which has already been reached, on guaranteed borrowing by the company and, as already indicated, that is the main purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, it is intended that the level of remuneration and allowances of the chief officer of Irish Shipping Limited, will in future be subject to my approval, in consultation with the Minister for the Public Service.  This is in line with Government policy since the acceptance of the recommendations of the review body on higher remuneration in the public service &mdash; the Devlin Report &mdash; and has been implemented for most State bodies.  Alterations to the company's superannuation arrangements are also being brought under control in line with the position in other State bodies.</P>
    <P>The company are also being required to adhere to Government guidelines and policy on pay and conditions of employment and to comply with directives in this regard.  May I say a word of thanks to the Opposition for taking this Bill at short notice because it has to be passed before the end of this month?</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is traditional to welcome Bills which come before the House in aid of semi-State bodies, but I do not know if I can welcome the Bill because there are a number of questions to be answered.  In order to set the whole <Col N="1740" /> business of Irish Shipping in its historical context I took the trouble of researching all the legislation from the first Act in 1947.  I was very impressed by the speeches of the then Minister, the late Mr. Seán Lemass.  His speeches were short and to the point and incorporated his policies, philosophy and beliefs with regard to Irish Shipping.  The present Minister has in his way paid tribute to the people who operated Irish Shipping, particularly during the war.  In passing I might commend a former Member of this House, Mr. Seán Moore, who busied himself with establishing an area to commemorate the sailors of Irish Shipping who lost their lives during the war bringing in essential supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Lemass's speech to which I referred is at column 1736, Volume 108 of the Official Report for 1947.  His vision, strength of purpose and firm grasp of the realities are all evident in that speech.  When he brought the first Bill before this House he was giving statutory effect to something that was in existence from the war period by right of emergency powers orders.  He paid tribute to the people who did the work during the war and saved us from economic collapse. He indicated how under emergency powers orders the company got into the business of marine insurance.  It was a case of necessity because it was impossible to get anybody to insure Irish ships at that time.  This started a business in insurance and Mr. Lemass welcomed the premium income from abroad which was generated by the existence of marine insurance cover.  He also indicated that the whole business of marine insurance got a fillip from the existence of Irish Shipping.  He pointed out that another allied employment-creating company started a ship repairing business which was very important during the war and the Cork Dockyard Company were involved.  The authorised capital in 1947 was £200,000 and seven new ships were under construction.  They were all small ships and the tonnage is mentioned in the speech.  Mr. Lemass wanted to make it clear that he had asked Harland and Wolff in Belfast to tender for these ships. Some rumour had been put about that <Col N="1741" /> they were not asked but he denied that and said that Harland and Wolff could not tender because of &ldquo;heavy commitments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the original Act it is important to realise that provision was made for subsidies. The then Minister indicated that there were powerful shipping organisations which before the war, in the thirties, had combined to fight on a price basis against smaller companies and put them out of business.  He saw the possibility of difficulties arising which would require subsidies.  In a later Act that section was removed.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Irish Shipping was to enable a reasonable degree of self-sufficiency. The very words used are important to contemplate.  There is no way to guarantee complete self-sufficiency but a reasonable degree of self-sufficiency was and is a desirable objective in many fields in which semi-State bodies are involved. It is important to realise that this whole business cuts right across all the activities of semi-State bodies.  I will not refer to the anxiety of various Governments with regard to oil refining and so on.</P>
    <P>My admiration for Mr. Lemass grows each day as I read his biography and the speeches he made, particularly on transport. His philosophy was one of providing services &mdash; employment is an important aspect &mdash; and the reasonable degree of self-sufficiency I have mentioned which would enable us to stand up and say we had something for ourselves.</P>
    <P>In the first Act of 1947 the capital limit was £5 million.  There was provision that the Minister could sell shares in Irish Shipping and the guarantee was to a £2 million limit.  Section 12 also indicated that the Minister could borrow from any person any sum or sums and was given power in the Act to do so.  The 1959 Act raised the capital limit from £5 million to £12 million and the guarantee from £2 million to £5 million.  Section 10 of the 1947 Act regarding subsidies was removed.  In the 1980 Act the figure of £22 million was substituted for £12 million in the 1959 Act and the guarantee on borrowings was raised from £5 million to £15 million, an expressly stated limit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> Section 2 (2) of the Irish Shipping Limited Act, 1982 states:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall not so exercise the powers conferred by subsection (1) of this section that the amount, or the aggregate amount, of moneys which he may at any one time be liable to pay pursuant to a guarantee or guarantees given by him under this section and for the time being in force, together with the amount of moneys (if any) which he has previously paid pursuant to any such guarantees and has not been repaid by the Company, exceeds an amount equivalent to £50,000,000.</P>
    <P>I am a little puzzled as to how we have the figure of £45 million in this Bill while the figure in the 1982 Act was £50 million. Perhaps the Minister would explain that discrepancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I put down this question to the Minister for Communications, but it has been transferred to the Minister for Labour.  I should like to know the reason.</P>

      <P>Fortunately or otherwise, the Chair does not have any say or control as to who answers the questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that matter? Was there an original announcement that the hotels were being put in the care of CERT?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may take together the Deputy's two supplementary questions, he will be aware that these hotels were previously in the ownership of CIE under the subsidiary OIE and, consequently, were the ministerial responsibility of the Minister now for Communications.  A Government decision was taken back in the autumn of 1983 to transfer ownership of the hotels from CIE, to transfer OIE from the parent company to the ownership of CERT.  I was given the responsibility of appointing a board to run the new&mdash;restructured, if you like&mdash;OIE, which is what I have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister let the House know what is the relationship between CERT and the board?  Are the board agents of CERT or independent of that body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is quite a complex one and I should like to be as helpful as I can to the Deputy.  As I understand it, the shares are owned by CERT.  The board of directors were appointed by me.  The board and the chairman of CERT were involved in that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says that the shares are owned by CERT, does that mean that the funding of the board came from the funds available to the Department of Labour and voted by this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the urgency which the Government had in relation to this matter was to restructure the OIE hotels in the advent of the current tourist season.  The final details in relation to the financing will come before this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say at this stage is that the additional funds required to restructure OIE, as indicated by me in my first reply, are being made available by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it then, that this will be from voted moneys, or will there be any funding from the European Social Fund, or what is the source of the funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It will come out of general Exchequer funds.  In that regard, it will be accountable fully to this House.  Secondly, as to whether the existing allocation for CERT will in some way or other be directly affected, the answer is no. The allocation for CERT will be independent of whatever financial structuring is necessary to put OIE back on a sound basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give the Deputy a definitive answer in relation to that.  The debts which were accumulated in relation to various aspects of these companies are in the process of being paid.  It is the intention that they will be paid.

We shall come back to this House on this matter and I shall be happy to do so, but all I can say now is that the Government are making provision for the financial restructuring of OIE.  As a consequence, naturally any of the moneys which the Government make available are, and will be, directly accountable to this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put a composite question to the Minister which perhaps he would answer?  Am I correct in assuming that CERT actually own the shares, that a new board have been appointed to run the hotels and that that new board do not report to CERT but directly to the <Col N="1747" /> Minister?  Further, am I correct in assuming that the amount of the debts of the hotels of over £12 million at date of transfer, or a figure of that order, has recently been provided by the Minister's Department to clear the debts?  Would I be correct in saying that the shares have been transferred to CERT at no value? Would the Minister be prepared to say that, in effect, all he has done is replace the existing board of OIE by a new board of OIE with the added requirement that it be on a commercial footing, as if that were the only requirement?  Would the Minister comment as to whether those general assumptions are accurate or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's composite question, broadly speaking his description is reasonably accurate.  The desire of the Government in their decision was that the OIE hotels should be retained in public ownership, that they should be rationalised and restructured on a sound financial basis and provided with adequate funds to ensure financial viability.  The new board have been appointed by me to that task.  They have commenced their work accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that we have had detailed discussions with CERT in relation to this.  The arrangement I have described, and to which the Deputy has referred, is one that was arrived at in full consultation with the board of CERT, with the chairman of CERT and their chief executive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told me that the money was not paid.  He has now indicated, in answer to a question from Deputy S. Brennan, that £11 million has been paid.  Has the money been paid or has it not been paid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two very fast supplementary questions to ask. Would the Minister explain to the House clearly and in detail &mdash; he has said that CERT holds the shareholding; he has appointed a political board, a political board appointed by himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>CERT, for the most part, is a body nominated by the interests concerned.  Will the Minister explain to the House, first of all, why the necessity for this type of politically appointed board between CERT who hold the shareholding and the hotels themselves and where does the responsibility of CERT now lie with regard to the operation of these hotels?  My second question is: would the Minister now give <Col N="1749" /> an undertaking to the House regarding the former OIE employees, as they probably now are, in Killarney, Galway and elsewhere, that they will be retained in employment and that their jobs will not be placed in jeopardy as a result of this new board politically appointed by him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The structure I have described to the House is one that arose following discussions with CERT, the Government and my Department.  It was considered by all of the participants that it was the best and most effective structure to be devised, one of the reasons being that CERT consists of a representative council and is a very successful training organisation.  What was required in this instance, and perhaps what was sadly missing in the past, was a commercial State enterprise with a commercially-orientated board.  That is not the function of CERT and CERT were at pains to make that clear in their opening position.  Therefore, following discussions with CERT, with the Government and the various Departments directly involved, it was not &mdash; as both Deputies will readily agree since they have had some experience of this matter &mdash; a simple or non-complex issue.  The structure I have described, in reply to an earlier question, was considered by all of the parties involved to be a satisfactory one.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will direct the National Manpower Service to prepare and establish a national centralised register of unemployed people from its own present registers and from the Department of Social Welfare's unemployment benefits and assistance sections; if he will ensure that all future applicants for jobs, irrespective of age or experience, will have to register with the National Manpower Service and after the necessary assessment, unemployed people would be (1) placed in jobs if possible, (2) referred to AnCO for the necessary training, (3) referred to the Youth Employment Agency for temporary youth work, (4) referred to the Department of Social Welfare for the payment of unemployment assistance or benefits; and if he will make a statement on the entire unemployment registration situation at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Close liaison is maintained between the National Manpower Service and the employment exchanges/offices of the Department of Social Welfare.  All persons under 25 years of age claiming unemployment compensation payments are automatically referred for registration with the NMS and it is intended that the over-25 age group will also be registered in due course.  Many of the over-25 age group register at present of their own volition.</P>
      <P>Registration for employment with the National Manpower Service is not compulsory and it would not be practicable or desirable to insist that all applicants for jobs register with the service.  Neither are employers obliged to notify vacancies to the NMS.  Most employers recruit staff directly and many job seekers and job changers obtain their employment through their own efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons registered with the service who are unemployed at the time of registration are assessed by placement staff and every effort is made in the first instance to help them secure employment.  Persons not placed are considered for suitable <Col N="1752" /> training or other opportunities; if necessary, advice and occupational guidance are provided.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for consideration of applications for payment of unemployment compensation benefits are governed by the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, and any changes in procedures in that regard would require amending legislation, which would be a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The possibilities of further developing liaison in the matter of registration arrangements between the National Manpower Service, the Department of Social Welfare and other agencies concerned with employment, training etc. are under active consideration at present. The Deputy, through his membership of the Committee on Public Expenditure, will be familiar with the investigations of that committee into the arrangements for recruitment of staff to the public service, including the possible establishment of a centralised agency for registration and recruitment purposes.  The establishment of a centralised register would give rise to a large variety of legal, technical and administrative problems but it is an issue which will be given attention in the further consideration of the whole matter.</P>

I am sure the Minister will agree that the biggest problem at present confronting this country is unemployment, that we are in a situation in which, because of the atmosphere and problems of our time, people leaving school or leaving jobs have no alternative but to register with the Department of Social Welfare and that we must now create a situation in which at least the first place a person will go&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If you will allow me an opportunity, a Cheann Comhairle, I want to be as fair as possible to the Minister in asking the question.  Would the Minister agree that we must create a situation, a system, indeed provide an opportunity for people so that the first thing they will do is seek a job?  Furthermore, would the Minister agree that the National Manpower Service is the agency most suited to register people for jobs and is now equipped to place them in jobs and, if necessary, to refer them for further training? Furthermore, would the Minister agree that over £250,000 was paid out in 1983 as a result of falsification of unemployment applications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not permissible to make a long statement and ask the Minister if he agrees with it.  That really is not a question; at best it is giving information rather than seeking it.  The Deputy must ask a question in order to seek information and not just put some views he may have on the record.</P>

      <P>Certainly I agree with the sentiment and spirit of what the Deputy has raised in his supplementary question. I might refer him to the answers given yesterday in relation to the co-ordination exercise in which the Minister of State, Deputy George Birmingham, is involved.  I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of that exercise, but certainly I personally would see a central role for the National Manpower Service in that exercise so that people do not find themselves going in different directions seeking employment.  There is some merit in the idea of a centralised agency but, beyond that, I am not in a position now <Col N="1754" /> to give any definitive or firm answers to the question the Deputy has raised.</P>

Those receiving dole have another number and if they are receiving unemployment benefit they have a third number.  If registered with the National Manpower Service they have a fourth number. Would the Minister agree that the time is now opportune to control this situation and to know exactly the position within the job market, whether people are drawing unemployment benefit or assistance, are seeking a job or have a job, and that it is time that the National Manpower Service were in control of the situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1980, there has been an upward trend in the level of unemployment and at the end of March 1984 there were 214,013 persons on the live register.  This compares to 189,404 people at the end of March 1983 and 148,004 people at the end of March 1982.</P>
      <P>The seasonally adjusted average monthly increase was lower for the year ending December 1983 at just over 2,300 than in 1982 when it was just over 3,200: So far in 1984 this lower rate of increase has continued and during March seasonally adjusted unemployment decreased slightly.  While this is a welcome development the high level of unemployment is still of serious concern to me.</P>
      <P>The Government are concentrating on creating an economic climate conducive to economic growth and the creation of sustainable employment.  In line with this objective the National Planning Board have been working on a draft mediumterm economic plan, which will be available shortly.</P>
      <P>The various employment schemes in operation including those funded by the youth employment levy are also contributing to the creation of employment. These schemes include the enterprise allowance scheme, the employment incentive scheme, the grant scheme for youth employment, the work experience programme and the various programmes of AnCO, CERT and the Youth Employment Agency.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's supplementary question is a broad one and, in order to do justice to the spirit in which it was asked would require a long reply.  The causes are multiple.  We are the most open trading economy of any in the EEC on which we depend and to which we sell 50 per cent of our gross product, more than any other country.  That is a major factor.  We are much at the mercy of fluctuations in world trade.  There are other factors of the impact that an open economy must endure in relation to competition from other EEC countries and third party countries.  The Government through the Government Task Force on Employment, the National Planning Board and the various studies to which reference has been made already in this House are attempting to do that.  I am not trying to forestall the Deputy, but <Col N="1760" /> this House will have an opportunity, as it has had in the past, to attempt to answer what is a complex question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disturbing to the extent that it confirms what the statistics have indicated already, namely, that there are limited jobs available for many people at present.  It is a positive trend in that young people are taking the decision to acquire further education and skills. The evidence of the various studies available indicate that a workforce that is not well educated and well trained will not have the real potential to earn their keep in an open economy.

      <P>My understanding is that the trade union involved locally is aware of what is happening.  It was through their agency that I met with the representative of the company.  At this stage I do not know if other State companies are involved in the discussions.  When discussions between the local company and the parent company in France are finalised and possible options precisely identified, I undertook that the resources of my Department and related agencies would be made available.  I can tell the Deputy that that same facility will, no doubt, be available from other State agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have not received any notice of redundancy on forms RPI from the company concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a dispute in this case as to whether the employees are on &ldquo;lay-off&rdquo; or &ldquo;redundant&rdquo; as defined in the Redundancy <Col N="1763" /> Payments Acts.  In this situation the proper course of action is for the employees to appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal to establish their entitlements under the Redundancy Payments Acts.  I understand that 172 of the company's employees have appealed to the tribunal.  The tribunal has indicated that it should be possible to list these appeals for hearing within a month.</P>
    <P>Fifty of the employees have served notices on the company concerned claiming redundancy on the basis that they have been laid off.  The company has not opposed these notices and has paid the employees concerned their statutory redundancy entitlements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the IDA have some involvement with Snia in Sligo?  My understanding was that the company would ask their creditors to forego their claims on the assets of the company and that the money thus saved would be used to pay redundancy to the employees.  Has the Minister any information as to whether Snia have done that?  What part are the IDA playing, either in trying to salvage the company or assist them in getting redundancy payments made to the employees?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the IDA are outside the Minister's remit.  I take it he is aware that the company are supposed to inform employees two weeks prior to their being made redundant.  The company has been closed for more than two years.  There is supposed to be a penalty of £300 imposed on a company who fail to supply the RPI forms.  Are the Department pursuing the company to ensure that employees are not losing out as a result of what appears to be fairly underhand treatment of the workers in this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is complex. With regard to the IDA, I do not have information regarding what action they might take.  I am aware that the company <Col N="1764" /> wrote to the Department in October 1983 stating, as they were required to do under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, that they intended to cease operations and to make the employees redundant. The matter has been subject to discussion and negotiation between representatives of the company and the employees' trade union, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, since the Italian Government are a major shareholder in the parent company of a firm (details supplied), the Government have made any approaches to them regarding the non-payment of redundancy payments to the workers who have been laid off from the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider it necessary to make an approach on the lines suggested by the Deputy in order to secure payment of any redundancy lump sums to which the workers are statutorily entitled.  If the company refuse or fail to pay such lump sums, the workers concerned are entitled to claim payment from the redundancy fund, administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in reply to the previous question, the point at issue in these cases concerns the entitlement at this stage to statutory redundancy payments. This matter is the subject of a number of appeals to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which will be decided shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This question relates to the same situation and the same company as the previous question.  I am sure the Minister will accept that on the face of it this company has been closed for two years.  Promises have been made from time to time that it was going to re-open but the latest information is that it is not going to re-open.  Will the Minister take it upon himself to intervene directly to encourage Snia to pay the workers the redundancy to which they are entitled and to ensure that the affairs of the company are properly wound up so that at <Col N="1765" /> the very least workers, some of whom have given ten years of their lives to the company, will not be left high and dry?</P>

      <P>The matter is to be decided within the next month by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.

The President of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union has written to me in relation to this matter.  I am aware of the concern that has been expressed by that union.

Should that situation arise will the Minister agree that through his own office, or that of his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, he will make the appropriate representation in ease of the Irish taxpayer so that an Italian Government institution will honour their responsibilities to their workers here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a series of discussions with the major economic interests on social and economic matters and in particular employment, the Government issued guidelines on pay.  In the <Col N="1766" /> present economic situation the Government considered it essential to state their views on the criteria to be taken into account by all parties to pay negotiations if moderate pay increases are to be achieved so as to secure a favourable impact on employment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may recall that Government statements on pay were made in the early stages of last two pay rounds.  It is my hope that in the emerging round, terms will be agreed with due regard to the need for pursuing and increasing employment and without recourse to industrial conflict.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They were issued with particular emphasis on the question of employment and in an attempt, in the absence of a pay agreement, to establish a frame work or climate within which the most favourable economic conditions would prevail which would maximise the possibilities for containing existing jobs and creating new ones.  To that extent the three matters mentioned by the Deputy are inter-connected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of job creation I should like to state that the <Col N="1767" /> Minister in the course of the guidelines referred to the desirability that enterprises with surplus resources should invest such resources in activities which would benefit employment.  I presume that means the money saved if employers do not increase pay should be invested in their industry.  Is the Minister taking any steps to ensure that if employers save money on the pay issues it will be invested in industry in accordance with the guidelines?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the full document he will realise that there is also reference to the call for an adequate disclosure of information between employers and employees which would enable the employees' representatives, the trade unions and the workers directly involved, to identify the surplus capacity that might exist and, in addition, to identify in conjunction with management possibilities for net additional employment creation.</P>

      <P>The Labour Court is an independent body established by statute.

      <P>Training of such persons is carried out by AnCO and CERT.  In 1984 AnCO and CERT plan to cater on their training courses for about 8,160 unemployed persons over 25 years of age at an estimated cost of £18,455,000, which includes aid from the European Social Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the extent to which the EEC Directive on equal pay (75/117/EEC) of 10 February 1975, which provides for equal pay for men and women for work to which equal value is attributed, has been implemented in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Equal Pay Directive was implemented by the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, which came into operation on 31 December 1975.  That Act lays down detailed procedures to ensure compliance and for investigation of complaints.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of the directive in question are generally being implemented.  The European Commission, which has specific responsibility for ensuring that the directive is implemented in all member states, has introduced legal proceedings in relation to the directive against a number of countries, but not including Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to AnCO's Community Youth Training Programme.  This programme is designed to give basic training, coupled with work experience, to young people &mdash; under 25 &mdash; who are unemployed and are registered with the National Manpower Service for employment.</P>
      <P>The projects on which the young people are trained are designed to improve local amenities.  Voluntary and non-commercial groups and bodies can put forward projects for consideration. The promoters are required to provide the necessary raw materials as well as information confirming that the work in question could or would not be undertaken except under the programme &mdash; in other words, that contracts for work are not lost by local employers.</P>
      <P>Trainees receive appropriate training allowances from AnCO during training. AnCO also pays a grant to the sponsor towards the cost of employing a foreman. I would suggest that the voluntary organisation involved in this case should pursue the matter with the local AnCO training centre in Cork, the local authority and the Department of the Environment.</P>

AnCO are willing to start the project as soon as the sponsors are ready to go ahead.

      <P>I have learned with regret this company's proposal to restructure their operations with a loss of some 130 jobs.  I am informed that this has come about because of a fall in worldwide demand for the product of the group of which this firm forms a part.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company have been, and will remain, in close contact with the firm and every effort will be made to minimise job losses and to find alternative employment for those affected.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that this high technology industry has <Col N="1782" /> been in Shannon for some time and has given very good employment.  The sudden and unexpected difficulties there have shaken the confidence of the people in the region and their prospects for the future.  Can the Minister give any indication what special efforts he is making, in view of the importance of this type of industry for the region, to avert this crisis?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is a high technology industry and as such would be viewed by my Department as very important to developing the industrial structure of the country.  However, I want to emphasise that the problems are international in nature rather than related to the actual plant itself which I understand is operated efficiently.  I hope the restructuring of the plant will be successful but the Deputy will understand that I would not wish to say too much in this House or to make any comment that would jeopardise the possibility of a restructuring of the company at this time.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that this is an international company with branches in Florida and Puerto Rico and there are two plants in the United Kingdom, one in Wales with 500 to 600 employees.  The difficulties being experienced by this company do not appear to be shared in proportion among the people in different projects.

      <P>I am aware that the company have a plant in Wales.  They also have plants in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Hong Kong and New Zealand. I understand the company commissioned a consultants' report which to my knowledge is not as yet finalised and that report may recommend rationalisation internationally.  I am concerned that it be realised that there are two alternatives: one is a complete shut down, which we would not like to see, and the other is a restructuring of the company which was referred to in the company's press release <Col N="1783" /> today.  The Deputy will appreciate that this is a delicate matter and I do not want to say too much in the House, but he can be assured that I, the Industrial Development Authority and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company will also be very closely in touch with developments in the days ahead.</P>

    <Title>Irish Shipping Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1984: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke earlier I placed in its historical context the financing of Irish Shipping Limited and indicated how the changing demands were met by legislation, starting with the 1947 Act and going on through the Acts of 1959, 1980 and 1982.  I asked the Minister about the £50 million guarantee in the 1982 Act and its relationship to the £45 million mentioned in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The company had a very good record in profit-making to the end of the financial year ending on 31 March 1982 but in the following year net losses were £14 million.  Deep sea tramp operations are now in a parlous state throughout the world.  The Minister gave statistics and answered beforehand a question I have on the Order Paper about relative rates for this kind of activity.  They are nothing short of shocking.  We have been reading that there is an upturn in the world economy and specifically in the economy of the United States.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know whether there has been a progressive improvement, even in actual dollars, with regard to rates in the deep sea areas.  Certainly the US economy is experiencing an upturn, although it may be artificially induced by the fact that there will be a presidential election at the end of the year.  Has the Minister any assessment as to how the US recovery will affect the activities of Irish Shipping and can there be any reasonable estimate as to what effect it will have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must ask whether there was a question of bad judgment with regard to chartering.  Was it bad luck or bad judgment or a combination of both?  In any business of this kind there is a problem of assessment.  If everybody knew a recession was coming they would take remedial steps beforehand.  It looks as if judgments regarding charter rates may not have been as soundly based as they might have been.  As the Minister indicated, <Col N="1826" /> there is a heavy carrying of the company by the ancillary activities.  It is really shocking to hear the report to this House that substantial losses of the order of £22 million are estimated in respect of the financial year which ended on 31 March last.</P>
    <P>The purchase of ships is again a question of judgment.  Was the original chartering in of nine vessels soundly based?  I know it is easy to talk with hindsight.  The Minister stated that a total of 393,000 tonnes dead weight was chartered in and the horses backed were coal, steel and lumber.  We do not have to mention what has happened to the steel industry all over the world.  We know from the EEC that Luxembourg, which depended almost totally on steel, had some people unemployed for the first time.  Our own steel enterprise has had to be shored up and buttressed to a very great extent by Government subsidy.  There has been trouble in all the great steel-making areas, including the UK and the US.  The Minister does not give any judgment and simply says that the chartering in at that time has proved disastrous.  It would be as well if we made some kind of assessment as to whether for the future this kind of project should be entered into.  If it had come off, if the slump in the world economy had not taken place, we would all be clapping.  The track record was so good that nobody would have challenged the judgment of the directors at that time. If there is any lesson for the future, then we should try to learn that lesson.  The hope was that freight rates would be much higher.</P>
    <P>The link with the Cardiff ship owners seems to have been a wise move at the time and this was borne out by the fact that they could undertake projects which neither the one nor the other would have been able to undertake on their own. However, that company is in trouble and I should like to know if any losses suffered by Reardon Smith have rebounded on Irish Shipping, if they actually lost by the combination.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the negotiations with the foreign owners of the nine chartered-in vessels have been, at least to a limited degree, successful and that <Col N="1827" /> concessions have been obtained.  Could the Minister say who the owners are and how many ships of the nine each company owned?  I am not asking for any of the commercial details, because there is no point in letting competitors know what you are up to.  This is also emphasised by what I read out from Mr. Lemass's original speech in 1947 when that Bill was being discussed in this House.  There is no guarantee that a number of companies will not engage in a conspiracy to down the smaller companies.  Even though it is a State company, this is a small company in that league.</P>
    <P>The company are purchasing for $42 million two of those vessels, the Panamax with 62,000 tonnes deadweight of 1982 and the Celtic Venture of 32,000 tonnes, constructed in 1983.  The House will be able to judge what value has been got by comparing that with the price of the ship which is being constructed now in Verolme (Cork) Dockyard.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say if the other seven are still in fact under charter to ISL? Did Irish Shipping get out of any of their obligations on foot of this bargain and their buying out of the one large vessel and one medium to large vessel? It must be said in the House that the purchase of the two vessels would not be seen to be wise at this juncture if the well based assessment of the situation did not indicate that profit making was up front &mdash; and not too far away up front, either.</P>
    <P>As the Minister rightly says, he cannot speculate but there must have been a cold, calculated assessment in the boardroom before the company came to the Minister.  They must have given argument on which to base their plea that it would be wise to do this.  What were the spin-off benefits with regard to the other seven ships?  The main purpose of the Bill is to deal with the Government guarantee on borrowing.  It is amusing to find so much &mdash; nearly half the print &mdash; about remuneration and superannuation of staff.  The Ministers for Communications and the Public Service in putting into a statute some conditions about remuneration of staff and about national guidelines seem to be breaking a nut with a <Col N="1828" /> sledgehammer.  It is reminiscent of the black humour joke &ldquo;If you do not stop shifting about, I will nail your other foot to the ground&rdquo;&mdash; nailing the negotiations by writing them into a statute.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I have known for some time about the difficulties of Irish Shipping.  I accept that the Minister has given a clear outline of these difficulties. He mentioned them in his 1983 Estimate speech and also in 1984 in that context.  I have here a document which I put together in my own Department when Minister for Transport, in connection with our national economic plan which also dealt with the difficulties as they appeared then in the deep sea market.</P>
    <P>I have asked a number of questions which I hope the Minister will answer. There is an obligation on this House to sustain Irish Shipping on account of the usefulness in general of a national shipping company; on account of their history originating in emergency powers orders; on account of the philosophy for them by the late Mr. Seán Lemass in his speech at the establishment by statute of Irish Shipping Limited in 1947; on account of what successive Ministers have done in 1959, 1980 and 1982.  However, this should not preclude Members of this House from challenging various decisions.  They may have been the right decisions, but at least we should examine them because, after all, it is the taxpayer's money that we are dealing with and we are responsible to the taxpayer.  For that reason, I am not opposing this Bill, although I am more uneasy about it than I have been about any of the other Bills which have come before the House asking to sustain various semi-State bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank Deputy Wilson for facilitating the passage of this Bill through the House.  I join with the Deputy in paying tribute to the former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, who was responsible for transport matters for many years, especially during the war years.  He was the Minister responsible for setting up Irish Shipping Limited. <Col N="1829" /> Indeed, his actions, as a Minister and as Taoiseach, have inspired many people on both sides of this House.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping were one of those more successful companies started by the late Seán Lemass and indeed, they have been a very successful company.  For many years, they have been considered the beacon light of the State sector, the exemplary company, the proof that semi-State or State corporations were not necessarily synonymous with loss-making or inefficiency.  They were a profit-making, efficient, proud company, holding their head high in a very competitive world market.  For 15 years in a row they made significant profits.  Not alone that but they seldom, if ever, troubled the State for additional funds by way of equity or otherwise.  Indeed, in some of the arrangements regarding shipbuilding at Verolme (Cork) Dockyard they played more than their fair share and helped out a lot from time to time.  Therefore we need to underline yet again the success that Irish Shipping Limited has been for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That makes their present plight all the more tragic and sorry.  Deputy Wilson asked: was this as a result of bad luck or bad judgment?  We must guard against the wisdom of hindsight.  As my colleague, Deputy Alice Glenn, said once, it is very easy to have 20:20 vision from a position of hindsight.  Nonetheless it has to be said that a major error of judgment was made &mdash; I do not think we should seek to hide that &mdash; a very major error of judgment was made.  What is more it was made without the Minister of the day being informed that the decision was being taken.  Therefore, it was taken unknown to the Minister of the day back in 1979-80, and was made unknown to the Minister for Finance of the day also. Therefore, a major error of judgment did take place although it must be said that it is easier to see that with hindsight than with foresight.  Nonetheless it is very clear that the downside risk of this decision was not properly calculated especially in view of the wellknown cyclical nature of the deep-sea shipping industry. Certainly some bad judgment was involved, bad judgment on the part of a company from <Col N="1830" /> whom we had come to expect very good judgment.  While the judgment concerned was a major one it has to be viewed in the context of a very good previous record.  I fervently hope &mdash; and in this I am sure I am joined by Deputies from all sides of the House &mdash; that this single error of major magnitude can be overcome by the company, that they will soon return to their former position of glory amongst semi-State companies, to a position of success and profit.</P>
    <P>There was bad judgment, although it has to be said there was also a good deal of bad luck.  Nobody could have foretold the downturn in transshipping rates around the world; nobody could have foretold that they would fall to such a low level, because the level to which they have gone has been unprecedented, unheard of; nobody could have predicted the influence the depression would have on transhipping rates.</P>
    <P>There are nine chartered ships, two of which will be purchased as part of this deal.  That will have the effect of increasing our strategic shipping fleet from the present approximate 150,000 tonnes to, I think, something of the order of 240,000 tonnes.  Deputy Wilson asked about the owners of the ships.  One ship is owned by a company called Quincey Chang in Hong Kong, four by a company called Wah Kwong in Hong Kong, one owned by Transocean Transport Corporation in Hong Kong, two by the Teh Tung Steamship Company in Tokyo and one by the Nakamura Steamship Company of Tokyo.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson also asked about the figure of £45 million and referred to the figure of £50 million in the 1982 Act.  The 1982 Act dealt with the special arrangements for the purchase of the Irish Spruce and arrangements for its building at Verolme (Cork) Dockyard.  In that case the Irish Spruce was being acquired by a foreign company and leased back to us.  Irish Shipping Limited simply guaranteed some of the borrowings of that company. The provisions of the 1982 Act were to guarantee the guarantees whereas the Bill before us simply guarantees Irish Shipping Limited's own borrowing of up to £45 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1831" /> I do not know that there is much else I can say except that a major mistake was made, a mistake so serious as to threaten, to bring very close to the precipice the entire Irish Shipping Limited Group. But, through the deal they were able to negotiate at the last minute of the eleventh hour, they were able to save themselves from that precipice.  Certainly it came very close to the end of Irish Shipping Limited.  I hope the respite afforded by these negotiations &mdash; which will be assured by the enactment of this Bill &mdash; will give the Irish Shipping Limited Group sufficient time to recover their posture and restore them to their former profitability.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Deputy Wilson asked had any losses suffered by Reardon Smith rebounded on Irish Shipping Limited. The answer to that is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, except to the extent that Irish Shipping Limited have had to assume full responsibility for seven ships chartered jointly with Reardon Smith in the Celtic Bulk Carrier Consortium. An initial compensation payment of £1.63 million has been paid to Irish Shipping Limited by Reardon Smith.  As I said in my opening remarks, Reardon Smith, who are themselves in difficulties, have assured Irish Shipping Limited that, as soon as their position recovers, they will fully discharge their part of Celtic Bulk Carriers' responsibilities but, for the moment, Irish Shipping Limited because of the nature of the agreement have to carry responsibility for that.</P>

      <P>It is in that connection that perhaps the Minister would give his view about the actual cost.  He gave the actual cost in dollars in his speech.  Perhaps he would give me his view and that of his Department &mdash; you know I am an Ulsterman &mdash; on whether they were a bargain, in other words, did we get them at a good bargain price, or are we paying the full price?  I suppose Japan is the keenest country pricewise now for shipbuilding. If, for example, we had had to have them built in Japan would they have cost much more?</P>

      <P>Irish Shipping Limited, as part of their charter agreement, were committed to the purchase of some of these ships at the end of the charter anyway; that is number one.  Secondly, the value of a ship fluctuates with the value of the trade carried by that ship. Therefore, it is very much connected with the tramp shipping rates.  The cost of building these ships would exceed the price being paid for them.  That is the best way to put it.  We are getting them for considerably less than it would cost to build them anew.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of the total of nine ships there is a condition or an option in some cases to acquire 50 per <Col N="1833" /> cent of the ship at the end of the chartering term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the case of five of the ships they would have an option to acquire.  I am not sure whether that option would be compulsory.  I will explain that.  When the chartering period is over they would then own 50 per cent of the ship.</P>

      <P>Another thing which did not surface at all is the question of the position of the Ocean Bank as a holding company.  Have any of the losses that Irish Shipping assess, that is £22 million up to 31 March 1984, been attributed to the Ocean Bank connection or &mdash; which I think more likely &mdash; how much worse would be the liabilities have been were it not for the Ocean Bank connection?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got those figures offhand but the Ocean Bank development continues to be a highly profitable ancillary activity for Irish Shipping Limited.  It is 75 per cent owned at the moment with a possibility of reducing it to 70 per cent because of an option that the minority shareholder has.  It is 70 per cent to 75 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Part of the sale of some of those shares brings it down to 70 per cent and brought in about £9 million <Col N="1834" /> which helps in the very difficult circumstances. Ocean Bank continue to be a very profitable ancillary of the Irish Shipping group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Our difficulty is that the financial year ended only 11 days ago and we have not got the returns, but we can take it that the loss of the group would be considerably higher but for the ancillary activity.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to section 2 I have a point that I intended to make on Second Stage on the question of employment. I have in my notes from some couple of years back the figures for total employment in Irish Shipping Limited and I have a related question with regard to the employment of foreigners.  The Minister in his Second Stage speech dealt with the crewing of some of the charter ships.  My first question, which may have been answered on Second Stage, is that two largish vessels that have been purchased are manned totally by foreigners, I understand.  Are the other seven chartered all manned by foreigners?  How many are employed by Irish Shipping Limited now and how many foreigners are employed?  When might we have Irish crews on the ships that are now being crewed by foreigners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of people employed by Irish Shipping Limited is 489 and by their subsidiaries 403, giving a total for the Irish Shipping group of 892.  I have only rough figures, but I understand that on each of the other nine charter ships the average number employed is about 30, so about 270 foreigners are on board those ships.  It should be said that part of the charter <Col N="1835" /> agreement &mdash; remembering that these are owned at present by foreign ship owners &mdash; was that the crew came with them so they were employed in that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If, for example, some of the foreigners on these ships leave the crew, as sailors do occasionally, are we free to have Irish personnel employed on them?  There is no stipulation that excludes Irish sailors from filling vacancies, is there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have to distinguish between the two ships it is proposed to purchase and the remaining seven chartered ships.  It would be possible, and it is the intention of Irish Shipping Limited some time in the future, to convert to Irish crews when they get out of their present financial difficulties.  The problem is that, believe it or not, that would require physical changes to the ship because of the different sizes of Far Eastern crews and Irish crews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact.  It would cost approximately £250,000.  In addition, of course, Irish crews are somewhat more expensive.  Nonetheless, Irish Shipping would want to have Irish crews and they propose to do so as soon as they get back on to an even financial keel.</P>
      <P>One effect of the Bill going through the Dáil at this moment is to protect present employment.  A short few weeks ago it seemed as if all these jobs were gone and the negotiations which gave rise to this Bill have managed to retrieve them at least for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The ships will be now Irish owned and consequently the conditions of service etc. will somehow or other be affected by Irish law.  Is there any indication that the crews being employed on those ships now are being employed at a much lower rate as in the Orient and how does this affect the new ownership by Ireland and Irish laws?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed that there will be any change in the immediate <Col N="1836" /> future.  It is proposed that the existing crews would continue to serve the ships even after they are purchased for the time being.  As I have said, Irish Shipping will be anxious to convert to Irish crews as soon as it is financially possible for them to do so.</P>

      <P>There is the anomaly of the chief executive having his other foot nailed to the ground by statute.

It seems to be interfering with the free exercise of the chief executive's duty in a very heavy handed way by incorporating it in the statute.  Has it been done before?

      <Col N="1837" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 was moved by the Minister for Justice on Tuesday, 10 April 1984:</P>
    <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Each of the following sections, namely, sections 3 to 8 and 14 to 18 shall cease to be in operation at the expiry of five years from the commencement of that section unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that that section should continue in operation.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment yesterday I was about to give my reasons why I thought this section should be altered.  It is an untried law and there is great concern about its effect, especially in relation to the safeguards involved; and because there is a danger, both from the point of view of the protection of the Garda and of innocent members of the public, the House should be able to monitor it.  It is desirable that Members of the House who are presently going to pass this Bill &mdash; it should be done during the course of the present Dáil &mdash; are in a position to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By that I mean the full five years should not elapse before review because of the intense interest in the Bill and because so many Members have contributed to it. There has been keen interest from the general public and from professional and other concerned bodies.  The amendment we are discussing concerns a one-year period, but even that means that we must wait for one year to elapse before reviewing it.  If it proved unworkable or unsatisfactory we would have to wait until the year was up unless legislation was introduced <Col N="1838" /> for it to lapse if it was the desire of the Members of the House.  It may be necessary to consider putting in a substitute clause to cover that.  In brief I consider a five-year period to be too long and that two to three years would be more desirable.  I would be worried that a period of five years is a long time to be putting up with a fault, or with something unworkable, especially if it is affecting innocent members of the public and is due to the difficulty of framing legislation. I suggest that the period of one year is too short.  Ideally we should be in a position to keep it under review, preferably during the term of this Dáil, so that we can look at it again and I hope we can consider doing that in two to three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to respond to a number of points made in relation to the amendment which The Workers' Party put down seeking to have a period of one year substituted for that of five years.  The Minister's amendment seeks to allow various sections of the Bill &mdash; the most important sections from his point of view &mdash; to lapse after five years.  Although we have been talking about the operation of the Act, if it is passed, there is nothing in the Minister's amendment, or indeed in my own amendment, which would require review of the operation of the Act.  It is important to keep that in mind. The proposal to have the various sections lapse after one year is important because it would put the Deputies and the Government under some pressure to ensure that they could justify the operation of this Act within a year.  If the powers were renewed for a further year they would again have to justify the operation of those sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various charges have been made in relation to why The Workers' Party put down this amendment.  Various points have been made in relation to the introduction of the Bill as a whole.  Yesterday a number of Deputies mentioned that there was a crime emergency and fear of a total breakdown in Irish society.  I am sure the Minister will agree that that is an overstatement of the situation in relation to crime.  We know there is an <Col N="1839" /> increase in crime and that there is an increased perception or fear of crime, but an examination of the statistics does not indicate that Irish society has broken down or that by and large the Garda are not capable of coping with the level of crime.  I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to a series of three articles, in particular to two articles, written by a superintendent operating in the Dublin inner city area.  Those articles appeared in the <i>Garda News</i> in December 1983 and January 1984.  The superintendent carried out a comparison of the levels of crime in Ireland, in various parts of England and Wales and in the United States.  His conclusion was that our levels of crime are not as serious as the general perception in the public mind.  I am not trying to understate the fear of many old people and the fear of many women in relation to crime but I would argue very strongly that charges from this House that there is a crisis or an emergency do not stand up to realistic evaluation.  For Deputies to say there is an emergency and there is a breakdown in Irish society is not true.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, cries of an emergency in any society are a prelude to the introduction of emergency-type legislation.  It is my contention that the central sections of this Bill are emergency-type legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is in a difficult position here.  I do not want to unduly restrict the debate.  On the other hand, I do not want to let the debate again develop into a Second Stage type of debate that could drift on indefinitely. I am afraid that the Deputy is indulging in a Second Stage debate when he talks about old people being subject to attack, afraid to go out and so on.  We are dealing with the law of evidence in the section which it is proposed to alter.  The question is whether one is for or against the section, whether one agrees that a five-year trial period is sufficient or whether that period should be reduced to one year.  Those are the lines on which the debate should run.  Otherwise, we will have repetition on the same lines as on <Col N="1840" /> Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Chair has no interest in this other than to run the debate on reasonable lines and in accordance with Standing Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's position, that he is interested purely in the order of this House.  I was making the case for the need for a one-year review rather than a five-year review on the basis that this is emergency-type legislation.  I said that the attempt to imply that the public perception is that there is a crisis or an emergency does not stand up to examination and, therefore, a review is necessary within 12 months of the operation of the Bill to see if it is having the effect it is claimed of decreasing the rate of crime.  Basically that was the point I was trying to make in relation to my amendment to the Minister's proposal.  I may have strayed in one aspect but I think my general contribution was in order.  I am trying to defend the amendment I put down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points were made in relation to the amendment. One point by Deputy Shatter was that it could not be considered a serious amendment because of the short period involved, that one year was inadequate. I would argue that in Great Britain there is the Prevention of Terrorism Act which is renewed every 12 months, not every five years. Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act comes before this House every year for renewal and I have never heard anyone say that is too short a period.  It is interesting that I have not yet heard a debate on that section and its renewal in the two years I have been a Member of this House.  Those two examples show that the length of time does not indicate we are not serious.  It indicates we are concerned about the need to have an early review of the operation of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point made by Deputy David Andrews was that we were being dishonest in relation to the amendment and I think that extended to our attitude to the <Col N="1841" /> Bill in general.  In making that charge the Deputy has an obligation to specify how we are being dishonest in that regard.  I may be wrong and I hope I am not misjudging the Deputy, but it seemed to me to be offered in the form of a threat, that if we continued our opposition to the Bill he would in some way divulge some dark secret about myself or about Deputy Mac Giolla&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the amendment I am proposing that sections 3 to 8 and 14 to 18 shall cease to be in operation at the expiry of five years from the commencement of the section unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas. I did not put that down because I considered the Bill to be emergency legislation or because I thought the provisions represent emergency legislation.  I will continue to make the case that the Bill stands on its own merits.  I tabled the amendment for other reasons.  In a serious Bill such as this, where the rules of evidence are being changed in some sections and where in other sections extra powers are being given to the Garda Síochána, it is important in a country such as ours with a reasonably homogeneous community as a whole that the greatest possible consensus is established.  People were concerned and worried about certain provisions in the Bill.  I introduced many safeguards when the Bill was first published and I have tabled a lot of amendments for Committee Stage.  I do not think there is any reason to put a five year time limit or any other embargo on the Bill but because there is concern I am willing to do that because it will help to establish a greater concensus here and outside.</P>
      <P>A reasonable time is necessary but I do not think one year is sufficient.  If we are to allow the powers of these sections to die at the end of a certain period and if it requires a resolution of both Houses to reactivate those powers there must be an adequate period in which those new provisions can be assessed.  In regard to sections 14 to 18 particular cases would have to be taken through the courts and the different courts of appeal.  One year is not adequate for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa made reference to other legislation which he said is reviewed annually.  That legislation is not reviewed in the House annually, it is renewed by Government or ministerial order.  We are proposing that the powers being given in the Bill should die unless this House, and the other House, reactivate them.  The Minister will put down a <Col N="1844" /> resolution and there will be a debate on the provisions and how they have operated over a period of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods and other Deputies made the point that five years was too long and suggested that the time limit should be three to four years.  I am of the view that it should be either five years or four years.  I am open to argument on that.  I believe that at least four years is needed and I am not tied to five years.  I am prepared to come back on Report Stage and change it to four years if that establishes a greater consensus.  However, I need adequate time to see how these sections operate so that the House will be in a position to decide when a subsequent Minister comes back in four or five years after the commencement of the Bill to reach a decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea asked if in the event of these sections being amended in the interval over the five year period would those sections, as amended, also cease to operate.  They would.  I have been informed by my advisers that the Interpretation Act, 1937, states that references to an enactment are to be construed as reference to that enactment as amended.  That brings to mind an important point, that there is not anything in the amendment to prevent me or a subsequent Minister from coming to the House before the end of the five year period with amendments.  The amendment does not constrain me, or my successors, in any way from bringing in amendments if the provisions of the Bill are not proving effective or are not operating properly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter and other Members yesterday afternoon asked about the provisions of adequate statistics, particularly on the detention section, so that we have them when we are reviewing the provisions of the Bill.  In view of the time limit it is proposed to collect statistics.  I do not consider it necessary to make specific statutory provision for this.  For example, it is envisaged that the regulations relating to the treatment of persons in custody will prescribe the keeping of certain records.  It is considered that these records, together with other data which can be complied on an administrative basis, <Col N="1845" /> will provide the basic statistics for monitoring these provisions.  I do not think it is necessary to write that into the Bill.  I take the Deputy's point, particularly in regard to detention.  It would not be possible for the House on the information presented to it by a Minister for Justice in five years' time to adequately make up its mind if it did not have adequate statistics on which to base its opinion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews and other Members asked in what light a Minister would come to the House in five years' time and what the basis for the review would be. It would be based on the experience of the operation of the sections as evidenced by the statistics, the examples of how the other sections operate in court and how the courts deal with them on appeal. They would have to be examined and reviewed in the light of the general crime situation, the incidence of serious crime and prison committals.  In the meantime the Whitaker Committee on the penal system will have reported and the House, in the light of that report, will have extra information.  Even though that committee of inquiry is centred on the prisons its terms of reference are wide enough to permit it to examine why people are sent to prison, what happens to them when they leave as well as how they are treated in prison.  That material could be considered in the course of the review.</P>
    <P>The reason I am bringing in this amendment is to help to establish a greater consensus.  It is no harm that legislation be reviewed periodically.  People see these as serious new powers and I have no objection to their being reviewed and, if necessary, renewed.  I am not tied to the five years but I am certainly committed to an adequate period.  I do not believe I would be prepared to go below four years but I will consider that matter between now and Report Stage and see if it is necessary for me to come back with an amendment to, as Deputy Woods suggested, reduce the time limit.  Of course, there is not anything to prevent me, or my successors, coming to the House before the end of that time to make any amendments necessary.</P>

      <P>In view of what Deputy De Rossa has said I must make a brief comment in regard to this matter.  We are going along with these measures because we believe there is a serious situation at present, particularly in the cities.  I differ with Deputy De Rossa in that I believe that the present level of crime is not acceptable and we have to tackle it.  We must support the Garda and give them the backing they are requesting.  Therefore, we want to see adequate safeguards in the measures proposed in sections 3 to 8, but there is a basic difference of opinion. We are accepting this provision at present.  In the past we had a very low level of crime, and we still have it in parts of the country, and we do not want the present level of crime to increase further. We are prepared to support the Garda. We felt that three years might be adequate but we are supporting the five years at this stage in the hope that the Minister will consider our suggestion.  I hope he will consider even a four-year provision and have an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.  In practical terms the provision the Minister is proposing is wise because it provides for a fixed date, a definite period.</P>

      <P>This is a matter of interpretation. The section includes the words &ldquo;imprisonment includes penal servitude and detention in St. Patrick's Institution&rdquo;. It might be desirable on Report Stage to add to that the words &ldquo;or any other centre designated by the Minister&rdquo;. There may be some other centres which the Minister might use in the future and which should be covered in the Act.  I say this because I think it is time to consider the provision of new centres and some <Col N="1847" /> new approaches.  Some very old establishments, like Army barracks or billets, might be revamped and used.  We have a major problem in regard to space, and Members from both sides have said that the Bill is only a contribution to solving the present problem.  For instance, there are 419 places in Mountjoy but 4,300 people were committed there last year. This means there is great pressure in regard to space.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy is concerned with the definition of imprisonment.  People can be imprisoned in prisons but the definition is widened to include penal servitude and St. Patrick's Institution.  Historically, penal servitude was a substitute for transportation and generally speaking it was a more exacting form of imprisonment. Persons sentenced to penal servitude were convicts.  Unlike ordinary prisoners, they were subject to certain civil disabilities such as loss of right to administer their property, disqualification from holding certain offices, for example, membership of the Dáil.  It is being abolished under the Criminal Law Bill which I hope will be introduced next session. At the moment there is no difference in practice between the conditions attaching to penal servitude and imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to St. Patrick's Institution, before the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, persons could not be sent directly by the courts to that institution unless they were being sent for borstal training &mdash; detention for two years with the possibility of earlier release for good behaviour, for employment and so on. Since 1960 persons between 16 and 21 years of age may be sentenced for detention in St. Patrick's Institution for any <Col N="1848" /> offence for which they could be imprisoned.</P>
    <P>So, to ensure that people sentenced to imprisonment under this Bill can be sent to prison we thought it necessary to make it clear that St. Patrick's Institution can be used for imprisonment.  I accept the point about extra prison spaces.  The courts can only sentence people to prison or to St. Patrick's Institution and they can be transferred to other houses or places of correction that would not be designated as prisons.  That can be done by ministerial order or by an official designated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 31 to 35, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;for which the sentence is fixed by law&rdquo; to the end of the subsection and substitute &ldquo;for which a person of full age and capacity and not previously convicted may, under or by virtue of any enactment, be punished by imprisonment for a term of five years or by a more severe penalty and to an attempt to commit any such offence.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate is was suggested that the reference to &ldquo;any offence for which the sentence is fixed by law&rdquo; could refer to offences other than treason, capital murder or murder.  The redraft proposed in the amendment would remove any possibility of such an interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been so much concern about this section that I thought the Minister might have told us a little more about it.  Subsection (1) states that the section applies to any offence for which the sentence is fixed by law.  Fairly early it was recognised that the &ldquo;or&rdquo; was a drafting error and that it could apply to all offences and consequently that it would be necessary to substitute &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other problems in relation to this.  I suggest that the Minister <Col N="1849" /> should spell out in more detail what the offences are.  This is a very important section because it allows power to detain and arrest on suspicion.  People will not like the idea, from the point of view of their character, that they have been arrested, even though only on suspicion. That will be the position under this Act. What offences apply?  It is easy for us to say here that if offences carry a penalty of five years or more they are fairly serious, and this is what we are thinking about and we support it, but does this include larceny generally?  Larceny can be of a large or a small amount.  Questions have been raised as to whether the larceny of a transistor, one pound of butter, one bottle of lemonade and so on, will come within this area.  Would the Minister spell out the offences to which this will apply?  To whom will the sanction apply?  The most common interpretation is that it will apply to those who have reached the age of criminal responsibility, to persons as young as seven years of age and to all over 14 years of age.  There are some question marks over the period of seven to 14 years.  Under seven years of age it is considered that the young person is incapable of crime, <i>doli incapax</i>, and between seven and 14 years, <i>doli capax</i>, which is what the legal people call a rebuttable presumption.  The incapacity of infants to commit crime ceases upon their attaining 14 years.  At that age they have to take full responsibility.  This means that from 14 years up they accept full responsibility; between seven and 14 years there appears to be some doubt. They come under the aegis of the section as drafted but there would be this rebuttable presumption.  We do not want to get into a situation of having to rebut this presumption in relation to children in that age group.  I would like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy is discussing the section rather than the amendment.  If I deal with the points he raised now, I will have to deal with them again when we are discussing the section.  In this amendment the phrase &ldquo;any offence for which the sentence is fixed by law&rdquo; means offences like <Col N="1850" /> murder and treason.  People reading the Bill interpreted it to mean any offences for which the law prescribed a sentence of any sort, and there was a misunderstanding about this.  The purpose of the amendment is to clear up this point.  What concerns us here is, as the amendment says, &ldquo;an offence which can be punished by imprisonment for a term of five years or by a more severe penalty&rdquo;; the phrase &ldquo;fixed by law&rdquo; was to deal with treason and murder, the more serious offences. Here we are talking about any offence for which the prescribed offence is a maximum of five years or a more severe penalty. Crimes for which there is less than a five-year maximum sentence are excluded.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In this amendment I am clarifying the difficulty of interpretation people had with the phrase &ldquo;fixed by law&rdquo;.  The rest of the section remains.  I want to assure everybody that this means a crime for which there is a more severe penalty than five years; it does not mean the colloquial interpretation that was taken, that it was covering something for which there is a prescription under a particular Act of a certain set penalty which would be less than five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear about this.  When this legislation goes into operation it will be interpreted by gardaí on the ground.  The amendment says &ldquo;for which a person of full age and capacity and not previously convicted may, under <Col N="1851" /> or by virtue of any enactment, be punished by imprisonment...&rdquo; The original section reads &ldquo;any offence for which&rdquo;. Since &ldquo;larceny&rdquo; covers small and large items, and the penalty can be five years or more, the detention could be for larceny of a very small amount.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Larceny is a felony and this applies to felonies regardless of the amount taken.  Larceny of one penny is larceny and larceny of £100,000 is also larceny.  The law has not decided to divide larceny in proportion to the amount taken and there are a number of reasons for this.  In the first instance, it would be very difficult to do so but we must also take into account the circumstances of the victims.  The larceny of £10 from a very poor person could have a more serious effect on him than the larceny of a very large amount from a wealthy person.  This section includes everything that could be termed as a felony.</P>

Recently under the Offences Against the State Act an individual was arrested for malicious damage amounting to £15.  I am sure that was never the intention of the House when that section was going through. That led to a certain amount of limited abuse during that period.  That is the type of problem that arises.  The spirit of the Bill would be that it applies to crimes of a serious nature.  When we talk of a five-year cut off point, obviously that is what the Minister and the House have in mind.  Another question I want to ask is, to whom will this apply?</P>

      <P>With respect, it may not solve the problem.  Deputy Mitchell asked what was meant by the expression &ldquo;a person of full age and capacity&rdquo;.  It is a description of somebody who is capable of committing a crime and who is aged between seven and 14 years.  The amendment to which the Chair suggests I should address my remarks does not deal with that problem.  It is more complex than that.  I understand the Minister for Health has proposals for a new Children Bill which may deal with this.  The Minister for Justice is concerned about this problem and perhaps he would look at it between now and Report Stage when the Minister for Health may have advanced his Bill.  The matter will have to be clarified.</P>

It appears it can apply to people aged seven years and upwards and this presents some difficulty. We were informed yesterday on the Order of Business, in response to a question I asked the Taoiseach, that the first of the Children Bills would be introduced shortly after the Easter recess.  The whole question of the age of criminal responsibility now arises in terms of the application of this Bill and the detention of persons aged seven years and upwards. If the amendment stating that the section shall not apply to any person under the age of 12 is passed after the section is passed, is the legislation not then contradictory or would the amendment suffice?</P>

      <P>Perhaps the urgency of the Children Bill can be outlined while we are discussing this section.  Recently the Minister for Health indicated his hope to have this Bill in the House in a matter of weeks.  Until such time as that Bill is introduced and the age of criminal responsibility is raised from the ridiculously low level of seven years, I would not be in favour of adopting this measure. It would be an appalling reflection if a child as young as seven should suffer under this legislation.  I would hope that the Children Bill would come into force before the implementation of this legislation. The Minister has already indicated that these measures will not be introduced prior to the passage of the legislation dealing with the setting up of the complaints tribunal.  That may take some months and one would hope that in that period the Children Bill would also be passed.  Does the phrase &ldquo;full age and capacity&rdquo; refer to mental capacity and have we a strict legal definition of exactly what mental capacity means?  I understand this is in dispute, even among psychiatrists.</P>

      <P>A person who is <i>doli capax</i> is one who commits a crime knowing at the time that what he is doing is wrong.  If under the existing law a child between the age of seven and 14 is charged with a criminal offence, strictly speaking the court, before determining whether the child has committed the offence, must make a determination as to whether if the young person did the act in question he had the level of understanding to know that the act was wrong. There is a contradiction in the position. It would seem as the section is drafted that a person could be detained if he or she were of full age and capacity.  In other words, before a garda could decide whether a person aged between seven and 14 should be detained he would have to carry out in his mind the judicial process and decide not merely whether the person was involved in wrong-doing but also whether he or she had the level of understanding to know it was wrong. That is probably unworkable in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods proposes an age limit of 12 years.  That is equally unworkable because at present children aged between 12 and 14 are presumed to be incapable of committing a criminal offence.  They are presumed not to have sufficient knowledge within the legal context to <Col N="1855" /> know that what they are doing is wrong. It is possible on one interpretation of the amendment proposed by the Minister to take the view that it does not apply to children below the age of 14.  One possible legal interpretation is that on the Minister's own wording in referring to a person of full age and capacity there is a very good legal argument, on the basis of existing case law in the courts, for saying that by implication that section would not apply to children under the age of 14 years.  I do not wish to misinterpret Deputy Woods's intention, which is that children of seven to ten years should not be detained, with which I would agree; but curiously, because of the manner in which the law has developed, his amendment could result in children of ten to 13 years of age being detained.  On the other hand, the Minister's wording may not allow that to happen at all.  In the context of the amendment being proposed, this is a matter of concern and like some other items in this Bill, requires to be clarified.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa has tabled an amendment that this should not apply to persons under 16 years of age.  It would seem logical that the detention provisions, if they are to apply, should apply to those persons who can be convicted of criminal offences.  The point raised by Deputy Harney and, I think, Deputy Mitchell and also Deputy Moloney in effect might be summarised that in real terms detention provisions should not apply certainly to young children.  That would be very much my view.  If very shortly there will be legislation to raise the age of criminal responsibility, the detention section in the Bill should in no circumstances apply to children whose ages will be such as to be below that of criminal responsibility.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister review this section with a view to a more appropriate amendment being tabled on Report Stage to co-ordinate the age limit with that of criminal responsibility and in the context of having a definite age on which there is no uncertainty, so that there will be no need for a number of court cases to clarify the issue.  It would clarify the position with a regard to a person being <Col N="1856" /> not merely of full age but having the capacity to commit criminal offences. None of the amendments as yet deals with that.  Deputy De Rossa's amendment stipulates 16 years, but it could be that the age of criminal responsibility should be 14 years.  I do not know, not having seen the legislation which the Government will produce in this area.  I ask the Minister to look at the section in this light and urge Deputy Woods, in the context of his own amendment, to understand that the comments which I have made are meant to be helpful.  I do not want to suggest that he was about something that he was not about.  As someone who is familiar with this area of law I know that there is a linguistic and semantic problem with which none of these amendments has dealt.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On the question of full age and capacity, firstly the full age is 14 years.  Capacity means of sound mind, not a lunatic.</P>
      <P>The section defines the kind of offences to which the section applies.  It does not deal with the kind of persons who could be arrested and detained under them. The capacity issue arises in relation to the sentence.  One should ask the question: &ldquo;If this person were an adult and not insane and if he were convicted, could he get five years imprisonment?&rdquo;  That is what the section is about.  The law will pose that question and if the answer is yes, this section applies to this type of offence.</P>
      <P>On the question of the type of person to which it applies, that is something different. It is tied up with the age of criminal responsibility which everybody in the House would agree is too low and needs to be raised, at present being seven years. To say that the age of criminal responsibility is seven years is not the full story. Between seven and 14 years there is a presumption of innocence, but that presumption is rebuttable.  The type of rebuttal is to a scale between seven and 14 and would be a matter for a court to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which I propose here was meant to clarify this phrase &ldquo;fixed by law&rdquo; which caused so much concern.  The <Col N="1857" /> type of offence to which the section applies is an offence for which there is a sentence of five years maximum, or a more severe penalty.  The penalty would be that applied to a person of full age &mdash; 14 years &mdash; and not insane, but it is the nature of the penalty which is being dealt with and not the nature of the person. Deputy Woods's amendment deals specifically with the age at which the section would apply, but I should like to come in again on that.  We have there the problem of the existing age of criminal responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am not introducing any new concept. All criminal law applies to people who have reached the age of criminal responsibility within the parameters which I have described of rebuttable presumption of innocence and so on.  Whether we should have a different application of the law and a different application of the age in this Bill is something on which I would like the views of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in supporting any section of this Bill because, regrettably, the law is necessary because of our present crime problem. However, this section is capable of being misunderstood and misinterpreted. Indeed, people within my own constituency have been circulating letters deliberately implying that children from seven years upwards could be detained for up to 18 hours under this law and under the Offences against the State Act for up to 66 hours.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that a seven-year-old cannot be detained for that period.  There is still a question mark regarding children between the ages of seven and 14 years. That was why yesterday, on the Order of Business, I raised with the Taoiseach the question of the Children Bill.  It is extremely relevant to this section of the Criminal Justice Bill.  I am pleased to hear that the first section of the Children Bill will be before the House after the Easter recess.  We should take time to be very clear and unambiguous about this matter.  I ask the Minister to state clearly that children of from seven to 14 years old cannot be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the technical point made by <Col N="1858" /> Deputy Shatter.  Deputy Woods's amendment could perhaps present more difficulties than it could solve.  We are really out to detain people who are committing crimes.  There are within the city many young people capable of committing quite serious crimes, which is a terrible thing to have to say.  However, we should wait until the Children Bill comes before the House to decide how to deal with these.  I favour some type of parental responsibility and hope that the Children Bill will deal with that.  The Minister should not leave anything hanging because people have misgivings regarding the legislation generally due to inaccurate statements about the application of this law.  In particular, the House should be clear that the First Stage of the Children Bill will come before the House shortly and the whole area of criminal responsibility can then be clarified.  It needs to be.  I should not like the full rigours of this law to apply to children and would be joined in this by the House and the Minister.  The sooner the Children Bill becomes law, the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with the Minister's explanation.  Of course, the section applies to the type of people capable of being prosecuted and not specifically to age.  The Minister and various Deputies on the other side have adverted to the fact that a person between seven and 14 years is more difficult to convict because there is the increased burden of proof arising from the fact that there is a rebuttable presumption of lack of knowledge or lack of intent.  In other words a person who is convicted of a certain offence, who is aged 14 or over, might not be convicted if they were aged under 14 because of the fact that, under 14, there is a heavier burden of proof on the prosecution.  There is no distinction drawn in this section between children aged under or over 14 in the same way as the ordinary law of criminal evidence draws a distinction, in the sense that it requires a greater burden of proof to convict somebody under the age of 14. There is no distinction drawn here; somebody who has reached the age of seven can be detained under the powers set out <Col N="1859" /> in the section.</P>
      <P>To revert to what the Minister said about the five years provision I understand him to say &mdash; and it is my interpretation of the section &mdash; that an offence for which a person could be sentenced to five years is the type of offence referred to in the section.  But, as has been pointed out on this side of the House, there are many offences for which, under the general heading of offence, one could get five years but, in practice, that sentence would turn out to be far less or there would be the application of the Probation Act.  The Minister should ask the draftsmen to look at this again.  To refer simply to offences in a general way is a lazy approach particularly when people prosecuted as a result of being detained under the powers contained in the section could get off with the application of the Probation Act.</P>

I would hope the Minister would explore every avenue open to him to ascertain whether this difficulty can be overcome but, having listened to Deputy Shatter, I think he will find it difficult. Nonetheless, in the interests of the community at large and by way of removing that anxiety, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the situation when, perhaps on Report Stage, he would be able to solve that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 in the names of myself, Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Gregory seeks to do more than the amendment of Deputy Woods, in that we are seeking to have written into the Bill that nothing in this section will apply to persons under 16 years of age.  I understand that no person under the age of 16 can be sent to prison.  Yet the provisions of this Bill seek to give powers of detention, interrogation, strip-searching, the taking of photographs, fingerprinting and so on in <Col N="1860" /> respect of young people, as I understand it, from the age of criminal responsibility, which is seven years.  It may be argued that it is stretching credibility to assume that the Garda will take in children of seven years of age.  But the facts are that there are a number of young children on Dublin streets who are not much more than seven years of age, who are causing problems to the general community in the sense that they may be begging, engaged in taking handbags and so on. But it is unsatisfactory that these young people should come withing the provisions of this Bill.  For instance, if they are arrested under the terms of this or any of the other sections, there is no obligation on the Garda to notify their parents or to have parents present when they are being questioned.</P>
      <P>There is a wide range of powers being given in the Bill generally and in this section which are new powers.  This means that those new powers will be applicable to everybody who comes under the law.  I do not accept the Minister's argument that simply because the law as it stands applies to everybody over seven years of age automatically the provisions of this new Bill should also apply in the same way because they give very widespread powers to the Garda.  I have no doubt but that by and large the Garda act in a humane and caring way in relation to the young people who come within their control or to their notice.  But the facts are that if a garda in any part of Dublin city, or in any urban area, is subject to pressure &mdash; because of lack of staffing or anything else &mdash; then it is quite conceivable that a child could be put into a cell for six hours and forgotten about. That is quite on the cards under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would argue that there is a grave obligation on the Minister to ensure that none of the sections of this Bill will apply to young children.  Our amendment indicates that they should not apply to persons under the age of 16.  There is also the fact that our amendment refers to sections other than the one to which the Minister's amendment refers.  It must be pressed home that there is widespread neglect of the way people generally, <Col N="1861" /> whether they be juveniles or adults, are dealt with under our prison system.  I intend to go into that matter on later sections.  But I would appeal to the Minister to ensure, by way of amendment, that these sections, the core of the Bill, relating to detention, interrogation, strip-searching, fingerprinting and so on categorically, do not apply to children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister's explanation and to other Deputies talking.  There is now no doubt at all in my mind that this expression used &ldquo;of full age and capacity&rdquo; is simply not appropriate to the question of extending the powers of the Garda in detaining a young person, for this reason, that that whole concept of a presumption of innocence, or a presumption of a young person not having the capacity or intention to commit a crime makes sense only when one is talking in terms of convicting somebody. It is a decision a judge has to make, given the knowledge he has of a case.  It is not at all appropriate that one should use such a means when one is deciding whether or not a garda has the power to detain somebody because in the consideration of whether the person whom the garda suspects of having committed a crime &mdash; as to whether that person has the capacity &mdash; there may be no way of a garda knowing whether a young person of between the ages of seven and 14 would or would not have the capacity.  It seems to me that it is definitely possible and entirely probable that under this section, as drafted, and as the amendment is drafted, a person aged between seven and 14 years could be detained.  I cannot see what any presumption might do for him because it is something that simply will not arise for six hours of a person's detention.  Therefore it is wholly desirable that this be changed.  I would urge the Minister to reconsider this matter and come back to us on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may well be that if the Minister for Health is sufficiently advanced in his legislation &mdash; and we do not know for certain that he is &mdash; the only certain way of dealing with this is for the House to agree upon an age acceptable to us, to deal with <Col N="1862" /> it in that way, and leave out this expression altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are three amendments being moved and discussed at the same time from which a number of issues arise.  As I have explained already, the amendment I am moving is simply to clarify the phrase &ldquo;fixed by law&rdquo; because there was a misinterpretation about it.  The type of offence to which the section applies is one which has a five-year maximum sentence or a more severe penalty than that. That, in general, applies to all felonies.</P>
      <P>On the question of full age and capacity, full age means 14 years or older and capacity means not being insane.  But it is in assessing the nature of the offence to which the sentence applies that the phrase &ldquo;of full age and capacity&rdquo; is inserted and intended to be used.  For example, somebody would not have a legal immunity if he or she was of full age and of full capacity.  In that situation if guilty of an offence they carry a five-year maximum sentence at least.  Then the section would apply to that type of offence.</P>
      <P>A different issue arises then from the amendments proposed by Deputy Woods and Deputy De Rossa, and it is this.  At what age under our criminal law does the criminal law apply?  I am not putting anything into this Bill about the age at which the criminal law applies because that is covered by the general matter of the age of criminal responsibility.  If I came in here with any piece of criminal law about anything it would apply to people who had reached the age of criminal responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there is no reason to write in any age, because it applies to the age of criminal responsibility.  The age of criminal responsibility at the moment is seven years but between the ages of seven and 14 there is a presumption of innocence. This presumption of innocence is rebuttable.  The evidence required to rebut the presumption needs to be enormously strong the nearer you are to seven and the evidence required to rebut the presumption need not be so strong as one moves up near 14.  Everybody in the <Col N="1863" /> House agrees that the age of criminal responsibility is too low, but the age of criminal responsibility applies to all criminal law.  I am not changing the age of criminal responsibility.  I am introducing new criminal law which will apply to those who have reached the age of criminal responsibility.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If the Garda are not using their existing powers of arrest to arrest seven-, eight- and nine-year-olds, why should one suppose that they will suddenly now take a fit and start arresting and detaining them?  They have the power of arrest already.  Where is the presumption that they will arrest and detain them?  I can see the concern being expressed by Deputies in the House who are unhappy about the age of criminal responsibility.  I am unhappy about it also.  The Minister for Health has made a commitment that he will introduce a Children Bill and that Bill will deal with the age of criminal responsibility. If the Deputies in this House feel that we in the terms of this Bill should do something about the age, I am prepared to listen to the arguments, but none of the amendments being proposed is sufficient to deal with the problem and I would have to take the advice of Deputies here in the House and come back on Report Stage because the amendments proposed do not achieve what they purport to achieve and would not work.  To be very brief about it, the amendment I am proposing is simply an amendment to assure everybody that it does not apply to offences that carry a sentence of less than five years and that this phrase &ldquo;fixed by law&rdquo; means, in effect, capital murder and murder and treason.  We are changing that phrase now to show clearly that <Col N="1864" /> a more severe penalty is involved.  The phrase &ldquo;of full age and capacity&rdquo; written in here is not a test of to whom it applies. It is a test of what penalty is applied.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is necessary to put it in the Bill to explain that if somebody were of full age and capacity such person would not have legal immunity and then there would be certain offences to which a five-year sentence or more applied.  There is nothing in the Bill about the question of the actual age for the implementation of this section because the age of criminal responsibility to which all criminal law applies is seven with a rebuttable presumption from seven to 14.  My amendment is straight-forward as it stands and is being misunderstood, but if Deputies in the House want to discuss whether in this piece of criminal law we should put in an age provision in advance of the delivery of the commitment by the Minister for Health to change the age of criminal responsibility, I am prepared to listen to those arguments.  However, to my mind, the amendments put forward are not adequate to do that and I would have to listen to what Deputies say and come back on Report Stage on the age provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take up the point made by Deputy Shatter earlier and I accept the spirit in which he made it. We are not prepared to accept this Bill applying to anyone under 12 years of age. We are prepared to talk about whether we want 12, 13 or 14 years of age or whatever, but we are not prepared to accept it as applying to under 12.  With regard to Deputy Shatter's point, you could still have your rebuttable presumption between 12 and 14.  If the Minister's amendment to the original subsection is agreed, then you have your rebuttable presumption up to 14, but you have also in the amendment which I put down an exclusion up to 12, that it will not apply to children under 12.  The problem here, which Deputy Molony has brought out fairly clearly, is that the rebuttable presumptions <Col N="1865" /> really arise only in court.  That is too late.  I agree with the Minister that the Garda are not looking for the power to detain eight, nine, ten and 11-year-olds. Nevertheless, we are about to give extra powers to add to the present law, and in adding to the law surely we can say that the additions we are making will apply only to those from 12 up and at least let that be clear.  If in due course the Minister for Health comes along with his new age of criminal responsibility &mdash; whatever it may be, it could turn out to be 12 &mdash; if it is not 12 a fairly simple amendment can adjust that.</P>
      <P>In relation to the fact that the rebuttable presumption does not occur until later, the interrogation is the first question. I had a parliamentary question down on 2 November about the Offences Against the State Act, and it transpired that only 4 per cent of those detained in 1982 under the Offences Against the State Act appeared in court.  Obviously that Act was being used to get information or for some other purpose.  It was not being used to bring people into court. There is a danger that if we allow this Bill to go through without a provision such as the one I am suggesting we will find people under 12 being detained for questioning and never coming to court at all. The Minister has said that he is not changing anything.  The present age of criminal responsibility is seven with variations between that and 14.  I say that the Minister is changing something.  He is changing the law and bringing new powers and this section particularly brings in these powers of detention and interrogation. In that respect we do not want to see it applying to children under 12.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Minister's last intervention, the fact that the Garda do not use their existing powers is not a good enough reason for us not to introduce proper safeguards in this Bill. I was informed earlier by the Minister for Health that he intends to introduce the Children Bill shortly, but we do not know the age of criminal responsibility.  I hope that it will be at least 14 years, but we do not know &mdash; neither do we know whether <Col N="1866" /> the Bill will be passed quickly.  In the meantime children between the ages of seven and 14 years should not be suffering as a result of this section.  Between the ages of seven and 14 years there is a presumption of innocence at the discretion of the Judiciary, but a lot of youngsters in that age group could end up being questioned for endless hours in Garda stations.  That would be unsatisfactory.  I appreciate that a great deal of crime, particularly car theft, handbag snatching and beating old ladies around the head, is committed by people in this age group. That is a fact and it is a regrettable one.</P>
      <P>We should consider introducing at some stage in this legislation an offence for parents failing to supervise their children. I realise that could be a problem and that it is not always the fault of parents but there are a large number of them who fail to supervise the activities of their children and who allow youngsters under seven years of age to roam the streets unsupervised until the late hours.  That is not good enough.  It may be difficult but we should consider the introduction of some offence for such parents.</P>
      <P>The Minister made it clear that this section will only apply in such cases where a penalty of five years is fixed by law.  I am glad that he specified that. When we consider some recent decisions of the Judiciary we see that some judges impose a sentence of five years for minor crimes, a sentence which would seem to be harsh.  I am delighted that the Minister has stressed that these measures will only apply where a sentence of five years is specified by law, and also delighted the Minister has indicated that he intends to review this section before the Report Stage.  I ask the Minister to include proper safeguards for the seven to 14 years age group before the legislation leaves the House.</P>

      <P>There is some uncertainty about the provisions in relation to children.  I am still unsure whether the powers of detention under this legislation can apply to persons between the age of seven and 14 &mdash; I would like a simple yes or no.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about criminal law applying to persons over the age of 14, there being a presumption of innocence between the ages of seven and 14.  This is all very well before a district justice or a judge, someone in a position to rule impartially, but we are talking about powers of detention &mdash; in other words, persons being held for the purpose of investigation of an offence, not when such a person has been brought before the court.</P>
      <P>The House feels generally that this is a section we have to review.  There is a great deal of violent crime committed by persons of 14 or 15 years of age and, because of the presumption of innocence between seven and 14 years which is currently applied by the courts, I think Deputy Woods would be wrong to press his amendment.  We should allow the Minister to look again at this section, as he is obviously prepared to do.  We can scrutinise it more closely on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The amendment says &ldquo;For which a person of full age and capacity and not previously convicted ...&rdquo; Does it mean a person not of full capacity but previously convicted could be detained under this section?  That is part and parcel of this section but I hope we can look at it again. I do not wish to go over the same ground but there is a lot of concern to get it right. I do not think it is in anyone's mind, including the Minister or the Garda Síochána, that someone between the ages of seven and 14 or who is not full capacity should be capable of being detained for 18 hours.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The words &ldquo;Not previously convicted&rdquo; means that a five-year sentence must apply on <Col N="1868" /> first conviction rather than where someone would have a lesser sentence initially.</P>
      <P>With regard to seven-year-olds, I am doing nothing to change the situation that the age of criminal responsibility is seven. There was a commitment in the Children Bill that the age of criminal responsibility would be dealt with.  What this age should be will be debated for a long time.  Everyone knows from practical experience that persons of 13, 14 and 15 years are involved in a lot of crime and the convictions obtained in court would indicate that.  If I were to accept Deputy Woods idea to come back on Report Stage with his amendment, and put in the necessary qualifications, it would simply apply to this Bill; but if the age of criminal responsibility was, for example, 12 years the effect would be a legal immunity below the age of 12.  We must be sure to get the age right.  If we leave a significant number of people below a certain age with legal immunity from the law &mdash; I am talking about the age of criminal responsibility in general &mdash; we are providing people with an immunity from the law.  For example, if many young people in Dublin below the age of 13 are involved in criminal activity, then we are giving them absolute immunity from the law. Another question arises, namely, would the Fagins of this city organise them if they had that immunity?</P>
      <P>This is not a Bill dealing with changing the age of criminal responsibility.  I appreciate the concern of Deputies regarding the provisions of this Bill applying to children aged seven, eight or ten years.  The age of criminal responsibility applies to them now even though there is a presumption of innocence.  On Report Stage I will come back to the House with a proposal that I hope will satisfy Members.  Perhaps the age of 12 years suggested by Deputy Woods is right: it seems to me about right.  Some people would argue that it is too high and Deputy De Rossa would regard it as too low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept an amendment without examining it because other considerations arise immediately.  For example, would evidence of age be required?  Let us consider what would happen if I <Col N="1869" /> accepted Deputy De Rossa's amendment which specifies 16 years.  At the moment the Garda have the power to arrest without warrant and when this happens a person can be held in a Garda station while they are waiting to be charged.  The question then arises: would the period in the station while awaiting charge become illegal?  That matter needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the difficulty of the House and the concern of Deputies. Many of the people opposed to the Bill in principle shamelessly used the matter of the age of criminal responsibility to attack the Bill, but that is not something I am dealing with in the Bill.  There is a commitment to change the age in the Children Bill and all of us have agreed to it.  I am prepared to come back on Report Stage and try to deal with this section and the problem that Deputies perceive because of the age of criminal responsibility being seven years.</P>

      <P>The Minister's approach to this problem regarding the age of criminal responsibility is reasonable. Deputy Harney referred to the introduction of the Children Bill by the Minister for Health.  Perhaps the Minister would consult with the Minister for Health regarding the age to be provided for in the Children Bill.  That might deal with the problem in relation to the whole matter of the age of criminal responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Woods is right.  His amendment seeks to ensure that the section will not apply to any person under the age of 12 years and the Minister sees some favour in that proposal.  The Minister should give serious consideration to the amendment put down by Deputy Woods.  I find it very difficult to believe that the law now provides for the detention, albeit the unlikely detention, by the Garda Síochána of a child aged seven years.  That is what brings the law into disrepute.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously the proposal of Deputy Woods. The Workers' Party propose the age of 16 years.  I do not intend to deal with The Workers' Party proposal but I think that <Col N="1870" /> proposal is unreal and I imagine it would be unacceptable to the House.  The case regarding the age of criminal responsibility has been well argued and discussed.</P>
    <P>In his amendment the Minister proposes the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;for which a person of full age and capacity and not previously convicted may, under or by virtue of any enactment, be punished by imprisonment for a term of five years or by a more severe penalty...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that a maximum term?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's reaction to the debate.  It is clear that Deputies on all sides have expressed the wish that there be added to the Bill an age limit so that children below that age cannot be detained.  In essence that is what we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1871" /> I accept many of the points made by the Minister.  I appreciate he will want to consider now what should be the age limit and the possible consequences in other areas of the law.  We are not asking the Minister in this legislation to define the age of criminal responsibility.  With due respect to the Department of Health, the Minister there has promised us since 1981 that we would have a Children Bill but that has not yet emerged.  However, with regard to this Bill, I do not think there will be any difficulty on Report Stage in adding a provision to the effect that children, whether under 12 years or under 14 years, cannot be detained under the provisions of section 3 and subsequent powers of detention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's responsiveness to the debate.  He should be given time to consider the form of amendment to be tabled on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like some clarification to make certain that I have interpreted the Minister correctly.  If the Minister changes the age of criminal responsibility in this context, will that apply only to offences under this Bill or will it apply to offences across the board? It would be ironic if at the end of the day we passed legislation which only increased the rate of crime rather than led to a reduction in it.  I am a great supporter of the argument of increasing the age of responsibility to 12 years of age but can one do that without having the new Children Bill to take over? Otherwise there will be a vacuum and, as the Minister said, there will be no control whatsoever over children under 14.  I represent a constituency where there is a high level of crime committed by children between ten and 11 years of age.  I wonder will they be exempt from the law.  If that will be the case there are people in the city who will be quick to use them to commit crimes.  Will we have a situation where an 11-year-old caught in the commission of a robbery or burglary offence cannot be dealt with under the law?  Lawyers tend to see these things in black and white terms but the unfortunate suffering public do not see them like that.  The <Col N="1872" /> public see them in black and blue terms. I want to be clear that any change in the age of criminal responsibility will not leave a vacuum, that we will not have a change without having other legislation to replace it instantly.  I want the Minister to make it clear that we will not be creating a situation that will allow that to happen.  It is important that we are aware of what we are doing.</P>

      <P>I should like to get clarification on a similar point.  The Minister mentioned that if we accepted this amendment immunity would be given to certain people or to those under the age suggested by Deputy Woods, 12 years.  If a Children Bill is brought in by the Minister for Health and the age is fixed at 12 years will children under that age not have immunity?</P>

      <P>In spite of the Minister's explanation &mdash; I should like to thank him for his reasonable approach &mdash; I am still unhappy with the amendment introduced by him.  It should be opposed. The general criminal law protects people who are over seven years and under 14 years in a sense that it requires a greater burden of proof to convict a person under 14 than it would require to convict an adult. There is no distinction in these powers of detention between those between seven and 14 years and those over 14 years.  The difference in the general law should be reflected in the powers of detention which the Minister is introducing.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also mentioned that these powers of detention apply to an offence for which a person could get five years.  Unfortunately, they also apply to offences for which the person, if convicted, could get benefit of the Probation Act or a small fine.  I am unhappy with that.  The Minister should go back to the parliamentary draftsman and have the entire section reconsidered.</P>

      <P>The Minister invited us to express our views in regard to the possibility of exclusion under this.  I share the consensus in the House that there should be a level of exclusion involved in this.  The debate has got confused <Col N="1873" /> because we are dealing with a number of amendments together.  I support the Minister's amendment.  It is a valuable clarification. Perhaps the point raised by Deputy Andrews could be clarified further with a view to doing what the Minister intends doing on Report Stage. With regard to the amendment moved by Deputy Woods, I welcome the Minister's commitment to look at the general area and to consider exclusion.  I fully accept that it would be grossly irresponsible and that we could not change the age of criminal responsibility in the Bill.  That is not what we are asking the Minister to do.  If he did that he would, as he said himself, be leaving a vacuum.  The age of criminal responsibility can be changed only in the context of a Bill that will present an alternative structure for dealing with criminals. Clearly there are many serious criminals in the 13 to 14 age group.  It is a tragedy for the individuals that they have become hardened criminals at the age of 13.  They have been done a grave injustice and I hope the Children Bill will deal with that more fully.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to introducing a Children Bill and to looking at the way we care for children in need of care and those who get into criminal difficulties. We are committed to look at them and to include the raising of the age of criminal responsibility.  Therefore, it would be irresponsible when dealing with this legislation to increase powers against those about whom we hope to introduce alternative structures in a short time. Certainly, by the end of the year we will have detailed proposals before us on the whole area of children's law.  I urge the Minister to exclude as far as possible children perhaps up to the age of 14.  I am not definite about the age but 14 years is the age that is accepted in the courts.  The Minister should exclude children under that age from the increased powers of the Bill.  Those children will still be liable to be dealt with under the existing criminal law if found guilty of crimes.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty and I am aware that a lot of young people in the seven to 14 age group are involved in serious crime.  I do <Col N="1874" /> not share the view that they should be questioned or taken to a Garda station. In many cases they could co-operate with the Garda not only in relation to crimes they may have committed themselves but in relation to crimes they may have witnessed. The reason I am worried about this is because adequate safeguards are not built into the Bill later.  These young people may be questioned without a compulsion being on the Garda to have a parent or next of kin present.  The Garda are asked only to do that as far as is practicable, but that could mean anything. There is not any compulsion to have a legal adviser present.  It is because those safeguards do not exist that I am worried that young people in the seven to 14 age group can under the legislation be detained for long periods for questioning by the Garda.  It is because the adequate safeguards are not there that I am so worried.  If we had such safeguards I would be happy to accept that we could have a lowering of the age from 14 but until we get them this is not acceptable to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">

      <P>I share the concern of most Members and the public that a distinction is not being made between the treatment to be meted out to adults who may be apprehended on serious crimes and the treatment for children apprehended on less serious crimes other than there is the requirement that parents would be notified as soon as practicable if the child requests that.  My opposition to the section remains in that the Garda continue to have that power to hold children. It has been suggested that the Bill does not deal with the age of responsibility and that the Garda are not pursuing children of that age, that they consider them as not being amenable to the law at such a tender age.  It has also been suggested that we should somehow delegate our responsibility to a Children Bill which is long overdue but has not been presented to the House.  We have a responsibility to deal with the legislation before us and not to defer decisions to future legislation.  I would be just as apprehensive about trying to reach a decision in the course of the discussion on this section <Col N="1875" /> as to what is the correct age of responsibility.  Young people can be guilty of serious crime.  We see a number of Dublin Deputies in the House now because of what young people can do to vulnerable sections of our community.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister is taking note of what has been said and I suggest that we allow him to take back this provision and give it the type of consideration it should be given on Report Stage.  I am happy to settle for that, but I oppose the section as it stands and will wait until the Minister has had an opportunity to consider it before coming back to us on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The discussion on this aspect of section 3 is an indication of the kind of uncertainty there is in relation to the whole area of crime and the level of criminal responsibility.  The debate has indicated a failure to discuss in depth how this should be dealt with.  We have been suggesting the exclusion of certain categories of young people from this section and that the Minister will come back later.  I have no doubt he will have a quick word with the Minister for Health to ask what the Children Bill contains in this respect and that the Minister will then stick that in as the age under which young people would not be criminally responsible. That would be regrettable because there will be a long debate here on the Children Bill and that will not leave adequate time here on Report Stage to discuss such an important aspect.</P>
      <P>The question has been asked whether seven, 12, 14 or 16 years is the appropriate age.  Without a clear statement by the Minister on the age he considers to be the correct one for excluding young people from this section I am not happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to advert again to the extent of this section.  It will be applicable to children; they will be brought to court and they will be detained for the purpose of interrogation.  That is the purpose of the section.  They can be held for up to 20 hours, they can be held between midnight and eight in the morning during which they can be fingerprinted, photographed and searched by the Garda.  The Garda <Col N="1876" /> will not be obliged to contact their parents or a solicitor, if the young person concerned knows a solicitor.  I am sure that in most cases the Garda would make efforts to contact parents or solicitors. However, statements made by young persons in the course of interrogation will be admissible in court and failure of a child to co-operate with the questioners can result in a prison sentence.</P>
    <P>Generally, the Bill provides a fairly serious enlargement of Garda powers.  I have expressed opposition to that enlargement, not because the present level of crime is acceptable but because I argue that this is not the way to deal with it.  Some Deputies have asked that this provision should be applied to children from the age of seven upwards.  That is an indication of the kind of morass we are getting ourselves into in dealing with crime and the level of criminal responsibility.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The House might be interested to know that in the annual report for crime, 1982, it is reported that 768 children under 14 years were convicted or had charges proved against them.  This happened every year between 1978 and 1982.  I have said that the Bill does not deal with the age of criminal responsibility.  There is no age in this Bill, which merely applies what existing criminal law provides.  What I have promised to consider is the exclusion of children under a certain age from being liable to arrest.  This does not affect the age of criminal responsibility.  The power of the courts would remain.  Existing powers will remain and it would be for this House to change the age of criminal responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept the proposals of Deputy Woods.  I must consult with the Government and the Attorney General. How can the Garda establish that a person is 12 years of age?  It does not arise in the matter of criminal responsibility in the case of a seven-year-old because the presumption of innocence at that age is so strong.  At 12 years of age the presumption of innocence would not be so strong.  The Garda have power of arrest without warrant.  It is not new.  It applies <Col N="1877" /> to everyone of the age of criminal responsibility upwards.  If somebody of 12 years was brought to a Garda station and charged and if there was an interval between the arrest and the charge, as there can well be, a bland amendment like Deputy Woods proposes would not cure it because it would have an effect on the body of criminal law.</P>
    <P>However, I will examine it.  I am very sympathetic towards it.  I can see that a consensus exists on it in the House. However, I will have to have consultation to try to establish what the age should be. Then we would need a much more detailed amendment than that suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion calling on the Government to maximise the potential of our tourist industry because there is room for improvement in the manner in which this great industry is being operated.  The tourist industry should be compared with the dairy industry, together worth approximately £750 million per annum.  The tourist industry gets this money from foreign tourists and home holidays.  The tourist industry deserves the same recognition as the dairy industry.  Compare the dairy farm lobby with the tourism lobby and the latter is a small unpublicised one, not alone by the tourist interests but by the Department and Bord Fáilte.  We should examine the great scope which exists for improvement in the marketing of tourism in the same aggressive fashion as our dairying industry is being marketed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of ways by which the potential of the tourist industry can be expanded and developed: first, by cheap air and sea fares for tourists coming from the United States, Britain and the Continent; second, by special reductions in VAT for tourists who spend money on food and accommodation in hotels, restaurants and guesthouses; third, by the improvement of the domestic economy, because this is not only essential but vital for the promotion of the tourist industry; fourth, Bord Fáilte and the Department should embark on a vigorous and more aggressive marketing campaign throughout Britain, Europe and the United <Col N="1879" /> States; and fifth, the car ferry service into Cork from Britain and the Continent should be restored and even improved because this services the south-west area.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the Irish Sea in terms of transport is the most expensive stretch of water in the world. I strongly recommend that the Government approve of a transport subsidy scheme for a two-year trial period from Britain and the Continent into Ireland. This could and should be done and then reviewed after that period.</P>
    <P>A positive and direct link can be proved between the New York &mdash; Shannon fares and the New York &mdash; London fares and the inflow of tourists to Ireland. When the New York &mdash; London fares are cheaper, there is a 15 per cent decrease in the number of Americans visiting Ireland, and when the New York &mdash; London fares are dearer the reverse is the case.  This is a remarkable figure and a statistic which cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>The rate of VAT payable by hotels, guesthouses and restaurants is remarkably high and has a serious adverse effect on the tourist trade.  I suggest that VAT at a very low rate, if payable at all, should be recouped to visitors in the manner suggested by Deputy Flynn in this debate last night.  The biggest, most consistent and strongest complaint I get from hotel, restaurant and guesthouse owners in relation to tourism is the VAT problem. I am calling on the government to do something positive and practical about this as a matter of urgency.  VAT makes Irish tourism uncompetitive.</P>
    <P>The improvement of our domestic economy is fundamental to the improvement of the tourist industry.  Petrol, beer, spirits and cigarettes are now taxed to the point of diminishing returns and Ireland is no longer the happy ground for visitors who like to motor and to relax over a relatively cheap drink and a smoke.  From this point of view there is no incentive for the British and continentals to spend a motoring holiday in Ireland.  I am calling on the Government to do something positive, fast, about this.</P>
    <P>Many people engaged in the tourist <Col N="1880" /> industry &mdash; and I represent the best and most attractive tourist constituency in Ireland &mdash; tell me that the marketing system operated by Bord Fáilte is far from satisfactory.  It appears that there is now a bias very much in favour of Dublin and the Dublin region and that in their promotional work the Department and their agents, including Bord Fáilte, encourage prospective visitors to spend more time in the Dublin area than in any other part of the country.  If this is not correct &mdash; and it is a very serious allegation &mdash; I would like the Minister or the Government to prove it.  It appears that more money is being spent abroad promoting Dublin than any other region.</P>
    <P>Tourism is the only major industry in the west and south-west of Ireland.  In my own constituency of South Kerry for example, there would be many more thousands of people registered as unemployed in the local labour exchanges were it not for this industry.  It is the staple industry in west and south-west Kerry. The social and economic climate in Killarney, Kenmare, the Iveragh and Dingle Peninsulas would be very poor were it not for tourism, and the future growth of these areas depends to a large extent on the manner in which the south-west and the west of Ireland are promoted.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Government and the Minister to revitalise both the Department and Bord Fáilte so that they can embark on a more vigorous and comprehensive marketing campaign based on the suggestions I made tonight.  Finally, I am asking the Minister to investigate fully reports that the Dublin area is being promoted more strongly and forcefully abroad than areas of high tourist, scenic and recreational amenities, such as Killarney, west and south Kerry which I believe should be developed as a pilot area in the same way as the Shannon-Limerick area was developed for industry in the past through the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  This is a very serious complaint which should be investigated fully, and a statement issued without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am <Col N="1881" /> glad we are having this debate on tourism. We should not underestimate the importance of this industry.  It accounts for nearly 8 per cent of our exports of goods and services and represents about 4 per cent of our GNP.  In 1983 Irish tourism as a whole earned £824 million, an increase of 10 per cent over 1982. Revenue from overseas tourism amounted to £540 million, an increase of nearly 11 per cent on 1982, and domestic tourism earned £24 million, an increase of 9 per cent on 1982.</P>
      <P>Tourism has proven in real terms to be relatively resistant to the recession.  Once people acquire the habit of taking a holiday they seem to continue to do so, even though circumstances deteriorate financially in a country, and even personally, and other areas begin to suffer.  Hence it is a very important industry from the point of view of this country in that it is one which is not only buoyant but also relatively resistant to temporary downturns in the economy.  Various forecasts, including that by the European Travel Commission, suggest a continued lack of growth in the tourist industry.  Therefore it is extremely important that we should devote all possible attention to the development of this industry.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that in the period I have had responsibility for tourism we have taken some steps forward, including a reduction in VAT in respect of some of the important expenditures related to tourism and also the introduction of a VAT refund scheme in respect of goods purchased by tourists within this country. I would have to admit that these two concessions are not by any means large in their financial impact but they indicate a clear move in the right direction and a clear recognition by the Government, in very severe financial conditions wherein very few concessions have been made to any sector, that tourism is a sector which deserves special incentives and attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also glad to say that I was able to participate early last month in a major tourist promotion in the most buoyant of all our markets, namely, the United States.  I was very struck by the optimism expressed by all the tour operators, both Irish and American, whom I met during <Col N="1882" /> the course of that intensive promotion. All reported that booking levels were significantly up on last year which, as I have already indicated, was a good year, relatively speaking.</P>
    <P>We succeeded this year in obtaining an earlier indication by the airline companies of the intended level of fares for transatlantic flights in 1984.  It was a problem in the past that the airlines were a little late in giving this information because one was watching to see what the other would do and this meant that travel agents had difficulty in quoting prices.  It is very important that there should be the closest possible co-ordination between our national airline and Bord Fáilte in promoting the interests of tourism in Ireland and I was glad of the opportunity during my visit to the United States to have an extensive briefing with the representatives of Aer Lingus in North America.  I intend to pursue these contacts further with a view to the greatest possible synchronisation of the two policies.  I recognise that the national airline have a job to do.  They want to have a positive bottom line and there are limits to the extent to which they can incur social responsibility towards tourism which does not appear on their balance sheet.  The company are operating in the public sector because they are performing a national as distinct from a purely company role and hence they have a wider responsibility which they would not have if they were simply an Irish-owned private airline.</P>
    <P>I regret that I did not hear Deputy Flynn's speech.  However, I have a report of some of the remarks the Deputy made. He said that tourist numbers from the United Kingdom have fallen every year for the past few years.  This is not correct. Tourist numbers from the United Kingdom in 1981 were 1,008,000, in 1982 they were 1,031,000 and in 1983, 1,052,000. There has been a slight upward trend.  I would agree with Deputy Flynn that probably the most important market we should attempt to regain is the British market and we would be foolish if we did not recognise that political developments have played a part.  I am hopeful that the improvement in the political climate as <Col N="1883" /> between Britain and Ireland and within Ireland resulting from the work of the New Ireland Forum will in forthcoming years lead to a great growth in British tourism to Ireland.  We should see these important political developments, which are valid in themselves, as having this further economic role in assisting the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I intend to give this industry the maximum attention. I am very glad to have working with me as Minister of State Deputy Michael Moynihan who has a very intimate knowledge of the industry.  In response to Deputy John O'Leary, who has now departed the House, I would point out that there is no question of the Dublin area receiving preference in tourist promotion over other parts of the country. It has been my experience of the tourist promotions in which I have engaged that all of Ireland is promoted and that there is no reference to this area rather than that area.  Most tourists visit more than one part of the country and it would be quite foolish to promote one area rather than another because people will not stay in one area.  We promote Ireland as an entire and single package as a destination and that will continue to be our policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a constituency which could be described as Ireland's Riviera and I know what tourism means to our national economy and also to the economy of the south-west region.  We in Ireland can offer our tourists fresh air, unpolluted water, good food and drink and good hospitality.  We must ensure that that standard is kept up as far as tourists are concerned, and we must be careful not to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  Our tourists must be given a fair deal.  I appeal to those running our hotels and guesthouses not to charge exorbitant prices.  They must remember that when the tourist leaves the hotel he does not take the bed with him &mdash; indeed, some of the charges would nearly include the price of the bed.  The <Col N="1884" /> tourist deserves civility, hospitality and a fair deal, and I appeal to our tourism promoters to cut out the &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; policy.</P>
      <P>Proper travel facilities are a necessity. The development of decent ferry services between Cork and Britain is vital, as is increased air traffic service between Cork Airport, Britain and the Continent, if this industry is going to prosper.</P>
      <P>Remember that the south-west region is the most popular for European tourists and Cork port and airport are the gateway to that region.  Over 80 per cent of our tourists come to the south-west.  It is a sad reflection that they must land at the eastern tip of the country and travel almost 250 miles before they hit the real beauty spots.  This is very bad planning and must be tackled as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Good road networks are a must for the tourist regions.  Indeed, I am very pleased that our Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan, announced last night the formation of an EEC tourism policy.  This is a major breakthrough.  I congratulate Minister Moynihan on his initiative in bringing about the introduction of this policy. If there is to be a future for tourism there must be proper planning in coordination with other European states and we must get our fair share of the cake as far as the Regional Fund is concerned, in order to upgrade and update our tourist industry.</P>
      <P>VAT charges have a crippling effect on hotels and guesthouses.  A reduction in this penal tax would be a vital step towards making the industry solvent again.  I must emphasise that the tourist industry has a very high labour content, employing many seasonal workers.  It is of immense value to the small farmers and fishermen on the western seaboard who are trying to eke out a living and educate their families.  They relish the possibility of getting seasonal employment for their families in the hotel and catering industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One section of tourism which is completely neglected is angling.  Our rivers and lakes are completely neglected.  They should be restocked to capacity with trout, salmon and other fish of vital importance in attracting the angling tourist. <Col N="1885" /> There is a huge potential for angling tourists and we are only skimming the surface in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the angling tourist were attracted here, it would lengthen considerably the tourist season.  Our farmhouse holidays, guesthouse holidays, caravan and camping holidays all have an attractive appeal to the European tourist.  We must go all out as a nation to attract ever more tourists. Tourism could be a better proposition than any oil field, provided it is properly handled and planned.  I must congratulate our Minister, Deputy Bruton, for his initiative in travelling to the United States on an intensive promotion tour to attract many American tourists this year. In this year of the visit of President Reagan, there would be a vital injection to our industry in the form of these extra American tourists.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate our Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan.  He comes from what can be described as the Mecca of tourism, Killarney &mdash; the area of south-west Kerry and south-west Cork constitutes the Mecca, as far as Ireland is concerned. He is a man with an abundance of knowledge and foresight with regard to tourism.  He has seen the industry progressing for many years and was the first Minister for Tourism to take the opportunity to investigate the conditions prevailing on the ferry and airline services to and from this country.  I know by Michael's foresight that he is a very intelligent man who will pioneer this major industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Minister Moynihan is the man to pilot this industry into the future years with confidence.  We are all pleased to have him in the position of Minister of <Col N="1886" /> State in charge of tourism.  When tourists come to Ireland they expect conditions as good as anywhere else.  We must ensure that the conditions on our ferry services are as attractive as those at our airports.  First impressions are always lasting and they are what bring the tourist back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>We all realise the importance of the tourist industry to our economy and, indeed, the number of speakers offering here tonight is indicative of the importance which we in this House place on its contribution to our economy.  That industry employs almost 80,000 people.  The income to the national Exchequer from tourism last year was in excess of £800 million.  In my own area of the north-west &mdash; Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim &mdash; I understand that for 1983 the income from tourism was in excess of £80 million.  I do not know of any other industry in that area which would make the same contribution.  I understand also that between part-time and full-time workers it employs in excess of 6,000 people.</P>
      <P>We all know well that there have been difficulties in the tourism area in the last few years, probably due to economic difficulties and the high level of inflation which we have been experiencing, causing us to fail to hold our competitiveness with other tourist areas in Europe and elsewhere.  I believe that we have come through the worst of that and our inflation rate is now under 10 per cent.  We shall become more competitive.  I congratulate the Government on some of the measures they adopted last year and this year &mdash; for instance, in reducing the amount of VAT on bed nights from 23 per cent to 18 per cent and lowering the tax on caravan and boat hiring and so forth.</P>
      <P>There is still VAT of 23 per cent on meals.  I was in a hotel in Donegal last weekend where I had a chat with the proprietor.  He told me that if four people come into his hotel for a meal the money he receives from one of the four goes to pay the VAT.  Perhaps in ensuing years the Government would see their way to doing something in regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> I listened to the Minister of State last evening and the Minister this evening.  It is good to know that there is a tourism promotion going on in the United States at present and that the feedback is most encouraging.  I believe the Minister of State said last evening that he expected an extra 40,000 American visitors here this year.  But unfortunately in the region I represent, the north-west, particularly Donegal, our past experience has been that very few of these American visitors go northwards, especially to Donegal. Tour operators and promoters, as a rule, do not put Donegal on their itinerary, possibly because they contend it is too far north, perhaps because it is too close to Northern Ireland.  But, for one reason or another, the increased numbers of American tourists coming here do not go as far as Donegal.  I do realise that they make a very significant contribution to our economy and to tourism nationally.  But, if it is taken on a regional basis, then it will be seen that they have very little impact or make very little contribution to Donegal.  I have had experience of travelling in other parts of the country during the summer when I found it almost impossible to get a bed in any hotel in southern Ireland because of the number of Americans in the tourist season whereas, in Donegal, it is very seldom one will see a tourist operator with American tourists.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say that we would have to concentrate more on the United Kingdom market.  I would hope that would include Scotland, because we in Donegal have been dependent on Scotland for many years for a large percentage of our tourists. There is hardly a family in Donegal who have not got relations in Scotland.  That market should be tapped, and the only way we can do so is to promote Donegal in Scotland.  I have had a number of complaints from Donegal people about the location of the tourist office in Glasgow, where I understand it is situated in some backroom of the Aer Lingus offices.  I would hope that something would be done in the not too distant future to bring the Bord Fáilte office in Glasgow on to <Col N="1888" /> the main street and undertake a proper promotional job there.  I have spoken to the Minister of State about this, when I received a very positive reaction.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that we do have unique problems in the north west. Some of the continentals to whom Deputy Sheehan referred, and some Americans, do not go northwards.  When the Minister is nominating members to the board of Bord Fáilte he might consider nominating somebody from the north-west from, say, Donegal or Sligo-Leitrim. As far as I am aware, since its inception, nobody from that region has ever served on that board; as far as I know the nearest we ever got was having somebody nominated from Cavan.</P>
    <P>I might mention self-catering units briefly, of which I understand over 200 have been sanctioned in the past two years.  They are an excellent idea.  If more are to be built in the future I would appeal to the Minister to give first priority to those people with a commitment to the tourist industry.  There is always the danger that builders and speculators who would get these buildings would not put the same amount of work into them as would people who are committed to tourism.</P>
    <P>There is one problem we have in Donegal and in all Gaeltacht areas, which goes back to the early seventies, when it was decided that signposts in Gaeltacht areas should be in Irish only.  I have had experience, as I am sure have other Deputies who frequent Gaeltacht areas, of seeing continentals in these areas consulting a map, looking at a signpost which read, say, Ailt an Chorráin while on the map there appeared Burtonport, or worse still, on the signpost there appeared Baile na nGallóglach while on the map it was Milford.  I am as committed to the Irish language and have as great a love of it as anybody else, but I feel that signposts should correspond with names on maps or, alternatively, that there should be bi-lingual signs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the couple of minutes available to me I should like to make a few points.  It is fair to say that this Government have shown themselves <Col N="1889" /> responsive to the needs of tourism within the very severe budgetary constraints on them.  The VAT concessions and so on at least are an indication, though I readily agree they are not sufficient.</P>
      <P>I should like to say something about the question of promotion mentioned by Deputy Flynn last evening.  In fairness to him I think he was critical of all Governments, not necessarily this one.  The figures here are striking in that, in 1979, the Government of the day spent just under £8 million on promotion whereas this year the Government will spend £15 million. Allowing for inflation that indicates an improving recognition of the need to spend substantial money on the promotion of Irish tourism.  If Deputy Flynn's point was that all Governments have failed to recognise the need to spend more on promotion, then I would agree with him, because any major multinational promoting a product internationally would not get very far with £15 million.  We are promoting perhaps the largest single product we have to offer internationally, which is our country, to visitors and we must place greater emphasis in future years on its promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has just returned from the United States.  There is no question but that that constitutes a huge potential market for Ireland with 40 million people there claiming to have an Irish background. We have not really begun to tap that market, and £15 million, £20 million or £30 million will not tap it either.  While our resources are limited we must find ways and means of allocating those resources somewhat differently so that we get into the field of really promoting Ireland on a large scale in the United States, in particular amongst the Irish ethnic community.  I might draw an interesting comparison: I am always astonished at the comparative success of the Jewish community in the United States relative to any other ethnic group.  There are five million Jews in America.  Last year every man, woman and child in Israel received in effect from American investment of one kind or another the equivalent of 800 dollars, which amounts to 2,800 million dollars invested in Israel <Col N="1890" /> last year by the United States Government. Of course, much of that would have been in the area of defence, but much of it also was on development, on tourism and other things.  The Irish lobby in the United States has not been tapped by successive Governments to bring about that kind of dramatic improvement in American investment here, particularly in tourism.</P>
    <P>A comment was made about the impending visit of President Reagan. That is something which will cost us relatively nothing, which will be worth much more than anything the £15 million could do for us in America, if we seize the opportunity of that visit to promote Ireland through the enormous press and media coverage it will receive, for whatever reason.  I hope we will seize that opportunity.  There are other opportunities open to us also.  Last year I remember being in the United States when Eamon Coughlan ran his famous mile wearing his &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; jersey.  We could not pay for that either because 50 million or 60 million Americans were watching that race, many of whom had Irish backgrounds. Therefore we must look at innovative ways of getting our message across in the United States, because we cannot really afford the £50 million or £100 million we might need to do it the hard way.</P>
    <P>I might make a short reference to the area I come from, the Cork-Kerry region. We are now awaiting in Cork with bated breath the announcement relating to the Government task force for that area.  It is no secret that the people on that task force did regard as of extremely high priority the question of a cross-channel ferry, and the question of services through Cork airport, in particular the need for a replacement of Avair.  Those are the points I wanted to make of central importance to Cork and Kerry tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Private Member's Motion which was debated last night and is being debated again tonight.  All speakers on the motion have emphasised the importance of tourism to the economy and it cannot be over-stressed.  In 1982 <Col N="1891" /> tourism brought £706 million to the economy and £840 million in 1983.  We had State investment by way of Government funding to Bord Fáilte of £24.6 million, and that is a very small investment for the total overall return to the economy generally.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, for various reasons in recent years and in the very recent past tourism has not meant to the economy what it should mean.  Tourists have not been coming in the numbers that they should.  We need a systematic examination of all aspects of our economy and tourism is one very important area that needs to be examined very closely.  The investment of State money through Bord Fáilte and the funding of local authorities for the all so necessary infrastructural development work that is part and parcel of the development of the environment for tourism and the return on that money need to be looked at immediately.  The attractiveness and friendliness of Irish people are renowned world wide and with changing times and lifestyles these attributes may be changing very slowly, but I, and I am sure other Members of the House, hope that we will maintain that fundamental attractiveness that has been in many ways the cornerstone of our tourist industry.  The friendliness of the Irish people and their readiness to meet and greet the tourists on the boreens and roads of Ireland has meant so much to us and to the industry generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our system of examination of tourism, or of any other aspects of the economy, we must inevitably come up against the problem of the very high cost economy that we have at present.  The serious level of taxation is a positive discouragement to people coming in and to people who are in the business of providing accommodation for the tourist coming in.  The capital sums needed for investment in the industry in addition to the taxation are proving to be beyond the means of many people.  The levels of VAT have become a major problem and the anomalies in relation to its application are very obvious.  I will quote some figures to the House.  In respect of bednights <Col N="1892" /> for overseas visitors in 1983, £2.1 million received by the hotels was subject to VAT and £5.1 million received on other accommodation was not subject to VAT.  Of the £374 million spent by out-of-State visitors within Ireland 68 per cent, or £254 million, went to the Exchequer in taxes.  Those figures are sufficient to emphasise the problems of the application of VAT generally, particularly for the tourist industry.  A VAT rate of 18 per cent applies on accommodation in some cases and 23 per cent on meals and on other accommodation no VAT at all is applicable.  The anomaly there has profound implications for the industry generally and the Minister would do well for the benefit of the economy and the industry generally to apply himself to it immediately.</P>
    <P>The tax on beer in Ireland is 20 times that in Germany, ten times that in Belgium, 50 times that in France and twice that in the UK.  That last quotation emphasises the problem for those involved and employed in the provision of accommodation in my constituency of Louth on the Border with Armagh.  In addition we have the problem of the difference in the price of petrol North and South.  These price differences are sufficient to emphasise the problems confronting those involved in the tourist industry in Counties Louth and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>Tourism in the Border counties of Louth, Down, Armagh and Monaghan is very important.  The natural beauty of the Cooley peninsula with its mountain range combined with the Mourne mountains is the logical area to sell and project in one unit.  Some years ago the East Border Region Committee in conjunction with the local authorities in that area commissioned a tourism study of the north-eastern region embracing the counties of Louth, Monaghan, Down and Armagh.  I hope that that study will be an invaluable document to those concerned with development plans for the tourist industry in that region.  It would have relevance to Bord Fáilte and to the local authorities in that area.  The need which was emphasised for the infrastructural development, the provision of more <Col N="1893" /> accommodation and the development of the various amentities that go hand in hand with the tourist industry are there and obvious for anybody who wishes to read that study and to take action on the points raised in it.</P>
    <P>That leads to the question of funding. Money under the special border region fund is being channeled into the provision of tourist-related amenities.  Unfortunately, the amount of money being made available under that fund is inadequate. Louth County Council in addition to Bord Fáilte are the agency in that area for the expenditure of that money and they find that the sums being made available to them are so small that the type of projects they can undertake or contemplate are of no significance to the overall development of the area in its promotion of the tourist industry.  I ask the Minister for Finance to consider the provision of far greater amounts of money under this heading.  In the past 12 or 15 months we have had a number of debates on the development of the Border region in which the importance of the tourist industry was emphasised over and over again. When we identify the need for the development and its benefits, the next logical step is to talk in terms of the type of funding we will make available for that development.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the role the local authorities play in this development. Unfortunately, at present local authorities are in very serious financial trouble which obviously has implications for the type of work projects they will undertake.  Many of them find themselves millions of pounds in debt on their current account.  They are hamstrung because of their financial position.  The fine teams of engineers in many of those counties have an output and productivity only 50 per cent of their capability because the moneys are not being made available for the projects so sorely needed.  I ask the Government and the Minister to look immediately at this area where many of our fine professional people, who have spent years perfecting themselves in their profession in the universities here and abroad, find themselves languishing in local authorities <Col N="1894" /> where their output and productivity are but a skeleton of what they should be and could be if the necessary finance were made available to them.</P>
    <P>I have touched briefly on the unique problems of the Border areas, North and South, the price differences in petrol and the tax on drinks which are posing serious problems for people in accommodation in those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief time available I would like to deal specifically with tourism in the south-eastern area.  Earnings from tourism are now worth £80 million in that area.  I would like to pay tribute to the South-Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation for their tremendous input despite the lack of Government support and the limited resources available to them.  Working in close liaison with the different local and voluntary tourism councils, SERTO have initiated a number of joint marketing ventures in order to promote the south-east as a prime holiday destination.  We now have the successful servicing by the B &amp; I shipping line, and their day trip programme will be extended to include Sealink in 1984. This type of business is very important not only to County Wexford but in general as many of the day trippers have not visited Ireland before and are potential future long-stay tourists.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, SERTO and the county tourism councils of the south-east region are only scratching at the surface of the vast potential available for development because of both lack of funds and Government support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the Garden of Wicklow to Wexford, Waterford, Kilkenny and Tipperary we have a reservoir of untapped natural resources which the Government shamefully continue to ignore.  They have shied away from investing in the tourism industry in this region, when with proper <Col N="1895" /> development over 2,000 extra jobs could be created there.  It is a region with the highest unemployment rate, well above the national average, and we could certainly do with those jobs.</P>
    <P>With the support of Wexford County Council the County Wexford Tourism Council put forward a proposal for the development of a heritage park at Ferrycarrig, County Wexford.  Recognising that our countryside is dotted with the physical reminders of our ancestors in the forms of earthworks, castles and churches this council are reconstructing a selection which will prove to be a focal point for tourists.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give a commitment that adequate funds will be made available through the environmental and Youth Employment Agency schemes to ensure that this worthwhile project becomes a reality.  When completed it will be self-financing and of major benefit.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of self-help by voluntary tourism organisations is to be welcomed, although their achievements will be limited without adequate financial resources.  The Government must grasp this self-help attitude and give support to such organisations in the south-east area.</P>
    <P>The greatest asset available to the south-east region should be the port of Rosslare which is the gateway to Europe or, put in reverse, the gateway to Ireland. Rosslare is a national and regional resource that has been starved of funds despite its proven performance and potential.  In 1977-81 major extension works were carried out by the Fianna Fáil Government on Rosslare Harbour.  A sum of £5 million was invested in land reclamation, and a new link span loading ramp and pier constructed.  No further development has been carried out and Rosslare Harbour today does not even comply with the minimum basic requirements of a port.  There is no terminal building, no proper gangways and inadequate passenger services to and from the port.  A major development programme on the lines suggested by the Rosslare Harbour Development Board is needed to boost the whole south-eastern <Col N="1896" /> region.  A recent survey has shown that at least 80 per cent of first-time visitors to Ireland come by sea.  One million passengers pass through Rosslare every year, and the increase in roll-on, roll-off freight has been enormous.</P>
    <P>Rosslare port is connected to Britain by Fishguard and Pembroke while Le Havre, Cherbourg and Roscoff provide direct continental links.  The accessibility of the port and its proximity to Europe are important factors in its emergence as Ireland's Euro-port.  However the present facilities are totally inadequate for the approximately 3,000 sailings per year. Apart from the customs block the remainder of the port is like a shanty town with temporary buildings scattered all over the area, unsurfaced areas of the terminal and major problems with flooding and drainage.  There is an old wreck of a bus that should have been sent to the knacker's yard years ago which is used for ferrying passengers.  The train service makes us the laughing stock of Europe, with the passenger train pulling out of Rosslare Harbour five minutes before the ship arrives.  We cannot expect tourists to come to this country via Rosslare when providing this type of service.</P>
    <P>The sole responsibility for this farcical situation lies with CIE as the port operator, and the Government.  The Minister announced recently that £300,000 had been allocated for the development of Rosslare.  This is a mere pittance when compared to allocations in other parts of the country.  When this was announced at a press conference called by three Fine Gael TDs in Wexford there was back-slapping and ballyhoo, but that does not fool the people of Rosslare and County Wexford.  It was an insult to the local development committee who have fought the case for the development of Rosslare since 1973.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government and CIE to look again at Rosslare Harbour and its importance to the economy, and instead of empty promises to come up with adequate finance for its development.  There is a need for co-ordination of the activities of the various organisations involved in the development of the port.  The Minister has before him a proposal by Rosslare <Col N="1897" /> Harbour Development Board to establish a State-funded development agency to promote development of the harbour and its environs.</P>
    <P>With appropriate aid from the Government tourism can do much to increase foreign revenue and provide employment. The local authorities and voluntary organisations have made great efforts to develop tourism, but due to the lack of finance they find themselves somewhat constrained.  The Government have made no effort to assist them so far.  It was pointed out that last year the tourism industry earned £840 million.  Money earned from foreign tourists amounted to £600 million.  Approximately 10 per cent of our total work force is employed in the tourist industry, but the industry here has never been given proper recognition, and it is time the Government woke up to the fact that we have an industry with 85 per cent input of Irish origin which is a major contributor to the economy.  There is a vast potential for job creation if the will is there to develop the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should consider the appointment of a Minister with sole responsibility for tourism and transport who would initiate a national tourism policy in order to raise the industry from its present state to one of major growth. Problems in the industry at present make it impossible for us to compete for a share of the international market.  We have the highest inflation rate, the highest VAT rate, highly priced petrol and the least developed telecommunications and transport system in Europe.  These problems must be rectified if we are to compete successfully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to outline some of the problems in relation to tourism in Donegal.  It is the most northerly county in Ireland, far from the major tourist points of entry such as Dublin, Shannon, Rosslare, Cork and Belfast.  Due to the geographical location of Donegal it is vitally important that we have adequate services.  As our rail service is almost non-existent additional finance should be made available for the improvement of roads, particularly the roads leading to the major tourist <Col N="1898" /> resorts in the county of Donegal.  If we are to prosper as a tourist county an airport is vitally important.  A definite commitment to provide an airport was given but unfortunately Donegal is still awaiting the provision of finance for an airport site, despite the fact that 50 per cent of the finance is available from European funds which I understand expire next year.  I suggest to the Minister that every effort be made to provide this necessary facility.</P>
      <P>Traditionally a large percentage of our tourists have come from Scotland, and much has to be done to revitalise that market.  A joint feasibility study was carried out by Bord Fáilte and the North of Ireland Tourist Board and it was recommended that a ferry between Scotland and Donegal should be a priority.  The ferry was to operate from Ardrossan to Moville, but unfortunately there has been no progress to have the proposal implemented.</P>
      <P>With little or no State investment in the industry, last year Donegal earned approximately £50 million from tourism and provided between 6,000 and 8,000 jobs.  It is obvious that a positive commitment to financing and marketing the industry in Donegal would result in a substantial increase in tourism earnings and also substantial job creation.  This is necessary in all areas but particularly in Donegal, which has a high level of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Donegal does not benefit in any real way from Bord Fáilte's tourism marketing programme, and this is felt very much at local level.  We seem to be the last to be considered.  It is not clear if this omission by Bord Failte is due to lack of care or is deliberate policy.  In any event, Donegal is the loser.  A commitment by Bord Fáilte to treat Donegal in the same way as the other major tourist centres would be of great value to tourism in our county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Donegal has tremendous tourist potential. It has unspoiled beaches, magnificent scenery and excellent hotels and guesthouses as well as farmhouse holiday homes and self-catering apartments. However, despite these advantages the <Col N="1899" /> fact that we are a Border county has created serious problems for the tourist industry, for instance, with regard to the price differential in petrol, drink and foodstuffs.  Many Northern Ireland tourists take advantage of our amenities but they do not contribute to the economy of the county as they purchase many items prior to their arrival in Donegal.  Unfortunately this also applies to visitors from other parts of the Republic who travel to Donegal via Northern Ireland.  Donegal has obvious problems but they are not recognised by the Government although many submissions were made to them last year and this year.  Steps must be taken to alleviate some of those problems.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned earlier that some relief on VAT rates had been granted to the tourist industry, but 23 per cent VAT on food and drink and 18 per cent on accommodation are the highest rates in Europe.  They are counterproductive to tourist development.  This applies to all tourist regions throughout the country. The refund of VAT to non-nationals should apply also to accommodation costs.  This would be a useful aid for tourism, and it should not present any major difficulties in implementation. I may be wrong in this, but I understand that the North of Ireland Tourist Board are exploiting the high cost of petrol and drink and the high cost of living generally in the Republic in their overseas promotions. All of this reduces our competitiveness, increases our difficulties and exposes our vulnerability.</P>
    <P>The Minister must consider seriously the introduction of refurbishing grants for hotels as the hoteliers, with their present margins of profit, cannot provide the necessary finance for such works.  This has the inevitable result of a fall in standards at a time when we should be more competitive than ever.</P>
    <P>I recommend that a substantial amount of money from the European Regional Development Fund should be made available immediately to mount a joint marketing campaign for Border counties and for promotion work in North America and in Britain.  This should be done in <Col N="1900" /> conjunction with the North of Ireland Tourist Board.  I urge that the European Regional Development Fund be continued for a further five years.  Moneys from this fund should be allocated exclusively to tourism projects as intended and not used in normal spending programmes.</P>

      <P>The tourist industry is an undeveloped industry here and the potential of regions, especially the region of Cork-Kerry, has not been exploited to the full.  The provisions of the budget, even in these hard times, will help the tourist industry enormously.  They show that the Government have a commitment to the industry and to its future.</P>
      <P>The whole economy is on an upswing, and this year we must take advantage of that improvement.  The only way we can do that is by having a proper marketing strategy abroad.  Figures published in recent months show that the tourist industry has a major role to play in the overall wellbeing of the economy.  With the strength of the US dollar, the upswing in the US and European economies, the drop in our inflation rate and other positive signs, the prospects for the industry in 1984 seem bright.  We must take advantage of this by ensuring that our environment is attractive.  We need a long-term policy in relation to the protection of the environment, and a national policy on those lines would help the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The greatest thing we can do is to give value for money.  Satisfied tourists will tell their friends about the attractions here.  A satisfied customer is our greatest marketing agent.  We must endeavour at all times to cater for tourists and ensure their holidays here are enjoyable.  The industry is a labour intensive one, and I understand that 23,000 people are employed in the hotel sector and a further 3,000 on seasonal work.  The total turnover of the industry is £255 million, and that is an indication of how much we depend on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that 17 per cent of our tourists availed of hotel accommodation last year and the remainder were catered for in guesthouses, caravans or farmhouses. <Col N="1901" /> We should follow the example set by the French tourist board and sell the concept of <i>gîte</i> type holidays that are on offer in that country, making small accommodation available to continentals. We must see to it that our attractions are publicised in a proper manner on the Continent but not forget the enormous market that exists at home.  In 1972 the income from the home market amounted to £45 million, and that increased to £260 million in 1983.  When we discuss tourism we seem to forget that the greatest customers we can have are our own people. For that reason we must make holidays here as attractive as those available on the Continent.</P>
    <P>There have been many comments about the inadequacies of our seaports when compared with our airports.  Our seaports must be modernised because they cannot handle big numbers of passengers. Delays at those ports must be reduced to a minimum.  The growth of tourism in the Cork-Kerry region has been hampered by the absence of a ferry service between Cork and Great Britain. The Cork-Swansea service is essential for the healthy growth of tourism in that region.  I am not satisfied with the performance of the B &amp; I in recent years.  I am not satisfied with the way that region has been sold abroad in recent years. However, I am pleased to detect a determination among all interests in that region to resolve the problem in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I appeal to everybody, from the Minister down, to do all possible to get an early decision on the ferry service between Cork and Great Britain next year.  We cannot hope to have a viable service if we do not make a decision about it until February or March next year. A decision must be reached in the autumn of this year at the latest.  If that is done it will be possible to sell the region in Britain and on the Continent before Christmas. We must bear in mind that the British, and the continentals, decide on their summer holidays around the Christmas period.  It is too late to try to sell holidays in February or March.</P>
    <P>I hope the seaports will be modernised, that there will be a Cork-Great Britain <Col N="1902" /> ferry service next year and that our airport will continue to operate services that will bring tourists to the region.  I am pleased with the performance of the Ministers this year and with the initiative shown by Minister of State Moynihan during his trip to Germany to sell Irish holidays.</P>

      <P>As we are all aware the tourist industry is of great importance to our economy particularly when one realises that £840 million passed through that industry in the last year.  The objective of the Government should be to optimise the economic and social benefits to Ireland gained by the promotion and development of tourism.  That is not happening. In order to achieve that objective it is incumbent on the Government to provide the resources to the bodies responsible for the development and growth of the industry.  With the strengthening of foreign currencies against the punt Ireland is more attractive to foreigners, particularly Americans and Europeans, than it has been for many years.  In order to ensure that the benefit to be obtained from the currency differential is not a short-term one many aspects in relation to the industry must be reviewed and corrected forthwith.  The standard of our accommodation must be up-graded, and there is a need for increased grants and interest free loans for the refurbishing of hotels.  Unless visitors can obtain good and relatively cheap accommodation the hotel industry will continue in the crisis it is in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this year's Estimates there has been a reduction in the grant-in-aid for holiday accommodation of 12 per cent before inflation.  That reduction is an indication of short-sighted planning, and it will in the long term be detrimental to the hotel industry and, consequently, increase the numbers queueing up at employment exchanges.  The 18 per cent and 23 per cent VAT rates the hotel industry is subject to makes it difficult for it to compete with the other accommodation on offer. It also makes Irish accommodation expensive when compared to accommodation in other countries, thus losing us more tourists.  I urge the Minister to look <Col N="1903" /> at this area and get the Minister for Finance to examine the VAT rates with a view to reducing them to a flat figure in the region of 10 per cent, or less.  The attitude of our people towards keeping the countryside, the towns and the cities beautiful still leaves much to be desired. Continued pressure and advertising must be kept up so as to inculcate a civic spirit among our people.  The legislation enacted to curb pollution and littering will have to be enforced more rigorously.</P>
    <P>If we present a sloppy and dirty product to our visitors they will not return to their homeland with good reports.  The cheapest and best ambassadors we could have are satisfied customers.  The promotion of tourism should be on a year round basis but Bord Fáilte, hampered by the lack of finance, must curtail marketing in the winter months.  The grant-in-aid under section 2 of the 1961 Act in this year's Estimates was increased by 7 per cent but that does not keep in line with inflation.  With an increase in tourism worldwide it is economic suicide not to take advantage of such an improvement. If Bord Fáilte are not given the necessary resources to promote Ireland worldwide all the year round the country will suffer.  The Minister of State should make every effort to get more money from the Minister for Finance so that Bord Fáilte can carry on their promotion work throughout the year instead of from January onwards.</P>
    <P>East Cork is not noted for tourism but many visitors go to the area for coarse and sea angling in the Blackwater river and in the Youghal-Cobh area.  Pollution is a great threat in that area and it must be controlled properly.  A special grant must be made available to those interested in promoting angling such as the Blackwater Valley Angling Association. There are excellent beach and amusement facilities in Youghal, and in recent years Youghal Fáilte have made great strides in promoting the area.  More help is needed from central funds to assist that group.</P>
    <P>A caravan site is available in the area but it cannot be developed due to a lack of finance.  I appeal to the Minister of <Col N="1904" /> State to use his good offices to request the Minister for the Environment to make the necessary finance available to Youghal Urban District Council so that that much needed project can commence.</P>
    <P>The ferry service to Cork brought in 100,000 visitors and 20,000 vehicles in 1983.  It is imperative that we have a Government commitment to provide a new ferry service because the loss of the ferry will be detrimental to the tourist industry in Cork and Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a disappointing response from the Government benches, indicating a lack of political dynamism in the Department.  Yesterday we were treated to a series of generalities by the Minister of State.  He just gave us an historical essay on past performances on tourism by Bord Failte.  He indulged in the glory of former years.  He tried to justify the lack of political will to do something about tourism and blamed everything on our economic difficulties. He did not give a single indication of intention to deal with, to accept or reject the positive alternatives proposed by us. If the Minister accepts what we recommended yesterday he should do something about it.  If he rejects it he should argue in support of that rejection.  If, as it appears, he will do neither, it is obvious that he and his Department are destitute of any ideas on how to deal with a major revenue earner.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, when referring to the reduced VAT rate, seemed to forget that Fianna Fáil had the VAT rate on hotel accommodation and bed nights at 18 per cent.  It was his Government who increased it to 23 per cent but because of the pressure from vested interests and from this side they were forced to reduce it to 18 per cent.  He spoke about the reduction of VAT on live entertainment but forgot that this does not include cabaret shows at which food and drink are served.  This hits the tourist sector directly.  Live shows for tourists in Gleneagle and Doyle's and Jury's still pay VAT at 23 per cent.  The Minister should remove that terrible level of VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our hotels have a major employment <Col N="1905" /> content.  They have a huge investment and it is fair and proper that the Minister should have referred to them in some small way when dealing with the matter yesterday.  He should bear in mind that the profits in the hotel industry last year were only 6 per cent of total revenue and that 38 per cent of all hotels lost money. I suggested the need to equalise VAT on hotels with the average VAT in Europe at 9 per cent.  I suggested that we should have a refurbishing and renewals grant for the hotel industry but the Minister did not even suggest that he would consider implementing the commitment and promise he gave in this House last October during the debate on the Tourist Development Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of tourism policy in the Department.  Last night we put forward the framework for a national tourism plan.  We suggested a co-ordinating advisory council and the increased allocations necessary for Bord Fáilte in respect of revenue and capital expenditure.  We asked the Minister to deal with the taxation situation, the access transport difficulties, environmental control and preservation and specialist tourism facilities. We asked the Minister particularly to deal with standards in hotels and in tourism facilities in general.  We suggested that he would deal with the British potential, and though the Minister this evening glibly trotted out certain figures, I should like to give him the real figures as far as the British market is concerned.  In 1978 1.055 million visitors came here from Britain, in 1979 it was 1.077 million, in 1981 the figure was 1.068 million and last year it was 1.052 million.  In spite of what the Minister has said, that is a fall-back in British tourists.  It was Fianna Fáil who were in power during the three years when the figure was increasing.  It now appears that British would-be visitors do not like the Coalition Government because they have not been coming to visit us.</P>
    <P>Tourism as an employer and contributor to our gross national product is as important as the dairying industry.  Why would the Taoiseach and his Ministers not give as much attention to tourism as to the dairying industry?  Dairying output <Col N="1906" /> in 1982 was £727 million and the tourist industry in that year brought in £747 million. Therefore, the tourist industry matches the dairying industry but it is not getting the same allocations, grants or other supports from the Government.</P>
    <P>We spoke last night about standards. When Deputy Gene Fitzgerald was Minister in 1982 the employment incentive scheme was applied to the hotel industry. It was very useful for the seasonal hotels because it allowed the industry to take on extra staff when they needed them.  However, as soon as the Coalition came in they withdrew that scheme but had to restore it under pressure from this side; but they restored it on the same basis as the manufacturing industry which is no use to seasonal and resort hotels.  I ask the Minister to restore it to the level provided by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald when he was Minister.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister to consider the new scheme of VAT refunds on sales to tourists from abroad.  If he had given a commitment that he would look at it again he would have done something useful. The scheme outlined by the Revenue Commissioners is nothing but a send-up for bureaucratic nonsense.  It has been made awkward for the sake of being awkward. It is a simple idea and it required only simple administration.  The experience is there in other countries and we should have taken the pragmatic view and stopped pussyfooting about looking for difficulties where they did not exist. The scheme will not have any beneficial effect on the industry this year.</P>
    <P>The position is as follows.  The Revenue Commissioners wish goods to be bought in Ireland and the goods to be taken out of the country in a certain period.  They are to be stamped on the way out and the visitor sends back the stamp, forms and invoices to get the refund.  But the visitor, having returned home, has to send all that documentation to the shop or shops where he bought the goods.  The shops will then have to make the refund in the currency of the visitor. The administration costs will be enormous and the validating of purchases will also be difficult.  Why do we make it so difficult to implement a simple scheme <Col N="1907" /> which operates in other countries in a simple way?  The scheme should be that the visitor would purchase the goods, get his invoice and receipt, bring it to the rebate counter at the point of exit and get the money refunded.  I cannot understand why the Revenue Commissioners are allowed to bring in such a nuisance of a scheme, so complex that it will not have any benefit whatever.</P>
    <P>We have outlined the basis for a new national plan for tourism.  I invite the Government, if they cannot put forward a plan of their own, to adopt ours and to get on with the job.  We do not think the <Col N="1908" /> Government have the proper attitude towards tourism.  We do not think they recognise the potential in tourism.  They have a do-nothing attitude, total inertia, which does not allow them to recognise or appreciate the economic good thing that tourism can be as a job creator.  We cannot accept the Government's amendment. They ask us to commend the steps taken by them.  We condemn the lack of steps they have been taking to deal with what we regard as a major revenue generator. The Government stand indicted for their lack of activity in this regard.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Appointment of Paediatrician to Portlaoise Hospital.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this very important matter and also thank the Minister for making himself available at such short notice.  In raising the question of the appointment of a paediatrician to Portlaoise General Hospital I am merely endeavouring to reflect the views and concerns of the people of Laois and others outside the county who for many years have been using the facilities at the hospital.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years we have developed the hospital to general hospital status and have developed in a very advanced way the obstetrical and gynaecological services as part of that overall development.  The only outstanding speciality is the provision of paediatric services.  Credit for the development of specialities and for the excellent standard of care is due to the surgeons and consultants and the dedication of the nursing and domestic staff who are working under rather difficult conditions due to the general understaffing of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit is due also to the CEO of the Midland Health Board and the members of that board who, despite very severe financial restrictions, through their prudent management have maintained services at the highest possible level. From the moment the decision was taken to upgrade our hospital to the status of a general hospital, which by implication means the provision of the widest possible <Col N="1911" /> range of specialities, the health board under their chairman, backed by the hospital staff at all levels, worked extremely hard to bring the hospital to its present stage of development.  The final stage of development programme was the establishment of a paediatric unit.  This unit was refused by Comhairle na nOspidéal in 1979 but under pressure from Members of this House and from the then Minister for Health, Deputy Woods, as well as the united voice of the people of County Laois, the comhairle agreed subject to certain conditions to the provision of a department of paediatrics to be shared by Portlaoise and Tullamore.  This plan would envisage a resident paediatrician in both hospitals, with a third consultant providing cover for the two hospitals. For both Laois and Offaly this was an excellent arrangement and it was accepted fully by the people of County Laois.</P>
    <P>The conditions laid down by An Chomhairle were that Portlaoise would develop the structural facilities for the unit and immediately the health board responded with the erection in Portlaoise of a new purpose-built paediatric unit &mdash; one of the most modern, may I say, in the entire country.  All the conditions for the establishment of the unit had now been completed, with the board and staff accepting, in a responsible manner, that due to the embargo on public sector recruitment the post could not immediately be filled.  They went about their task of providing the highest possible level of service and patient care in the hospital and were content to wait for the appointment which they understood was coming.  Then came the bombshell.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, was present at the Labour Party Conference at Portlaoise on Tuesday, 20 March.  Members of his party asked him the obvious question &mdash; when the paediatric post would be filled at Portlaoise.  I now quote from <i>The Nationalist and Leinster Times</i> of 6 April:</P>
    <P>Mr. Desmond told the conference that it was intended to appoint the paediatrician to the health board at <Col N="1912" /> Tullamore.  There would, he said, be no paediatrician at Tullamore and Portlaoise, in other words that there would be duplication of services.</P>
    <P>I do not want to display any discourtesy to the Minister by reading from that paper the comments which followed from the members of his own party at that conference.  It was natural that the Labour Party members in Laois would react as they did to that startling announcement.  It was also natural that the people of Laois, having read that report, reacted as they did.  It is only natural that I, as one of their public representatives, reacted as I did by immediately tabling a Dáil question.  On 3 April 1984 I asked the Minister for Health the following question:</P>
    <P>If he would confirm that a paediatrician is to be appointed to the General Hospital, Portlaoise, and how soon that appointment will be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was as follows:</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board submitted a proposal in August last year indicating the financial implications of creating a paediatrician post at Portlaoise General Hospital.  This proposal is still under consideration in my Department.  Approval of the post will, however, be primarily a matter for Comhairle na nOspideél, who have responsibility for the numbers and types of consultant appointments in the health services.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for the Minister to state when a decision will be made on this proposal.</P>

      <P>I have no desire to accuse the Minister of misleading the House or myself in relation to that reply, but it is very evident that there is a clear contradiction between what the Minister said in this House and what he said at the Labour Party Conference in Portlaoise.  Neither have I any desire to score any unfair political points.  I am merely giving the Minister an opportunity tonight to put <Col N="1913" /> the record straight and assure the people of County Laois that the services that they understood would be provided at the General Hospital in Portlaoise will in fact, be provided.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Chair to allot to my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, one minute to make a contribution.</P>

I want to inform him that there has been grave disappointment on the part of everyone in the county of Laois as a result of the Minister's pronouncement in Portlaoise. The Midland Health Board had outlined that there were to be full paediatrician services available at Tullamore and at Portlaoise.  We have an excellent medical staff in Portlaoise and every facility available.  All that is needed is compliance with what was originally decided, that a permanent resident paediatrician be appointed so that the services can be maintained at a very high standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in these four counties, except the unit opened some time ago in the private hospital in Ballinderry. Limited paediatric cover is provided for the area from Temple Street Hospital in Dublin &mdash; mainly about 12 out-patient OPD sessions per month and very sizeable numbers from west Offaly and Westmeath go to Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe for services.  That is the situation.  It is very disturbing and one which I want to put right immediately.</P>
      <P>The maternity units at Portlaoise, Mullingar and Templemore are suffering because of the lack of a paediatrician, as births are tending to drift to units outside this area.  I have recently had a communication from Comhairle na nOspidéal who have written to my Department separately, pointing out the serious lack of paediatric services in the midlands and have recommended the appointment of a consultant to Tullamore as a very urgent priority.  I have accepted that recommendation and the proposal is that the appointment should be based in Tullamore because of its central location. The consultant is to provide scheduled out-patient department clinics at the other centres such as Portlaoise and Mullingar and look after various clinic services in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the view, also, of the health board that this is about the most reasonable approach to the development of immediate services in the area.  Furthermore, Tullamore has a particular advantage at <Col N="1915" /> present in that the children's beds in the Tullamore hospital are looked after by staff at full nursing level, so that the start-up cost will be very substantially less in Tullamore, as of now, than in Portlaoise or, for that matter, in Mullingar.</P>
    <P>The extra cost of the services in Tullamore will probably be less than £100,000 per annum, as distinct from £250,000 on average in the other centres because, as the Deputies know, one must provide not just a paediatrician, but also at least two non-consultant hospital doctors, ward sisters, staff nurses and, of course, secretarial assistants.  It is not just the question of an appointment but of a whole new unit.  I have to take a decision and am pleased to say that, in consultation with the health board and within that health board's budget, I shall be appointing the paediatrician to Tullamore.  This will be a bit of history because as I have said, in Portlaoise, Mullingar and Tullamore there is no service at all.  It is most undesirable for covering maternity and child care services in the area that there are no consultant staff beds for children at this time in the area.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is the old story.  One must do one's duty as Minister and I cannot yield to all the perennial competing claims between Mullingar, Tullamore, Portlaoise and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Prior to 1979, Comhaltas received grants from Bord Fáilte for their entertainment scheme.  Responsibility for that particular scheme was transferred to the Arts Council in 1979.  The grants which the Arts Council make to Comhaltas are in respect of specific cultural activities and were never intended to subsidise their overall operational costs, or their capital projects.</P>
    <P>The total amounts paid by the State sources to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann since 1978 are as follows:</P>

A grant cannot be allowed for the building of a chimney as there is an existing one in the house.  Grants have been approved in respect of the other categories.

      <P>The total number of inspectors employed on new house and improvement grant work on 1 January 1980, 1983 and 1984 were 77, 58 and 55 respectively.  It is not possible to indicate the number of these inspectors assigned to County Galway on the dates in question because the assignments of individual inspectors may relate to more than one county and are altered from time to time.  The information requested in relation to numbers of inspections actually carried out is not readily available in my Department.</P>
      <P>In relation to the latter part of the question it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the period between the receipt of a notification in the Department that work is completed and the carrying out of an inspection.  The general length of time taken for inspections is estimated to be four to six weeks; the exact time in particular cases depends on a number of factors, the principal one being the inspector's workload at the time an inspection is requested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's policy as regards shelter for the population against the possibility of an outbreak of nuclear warfare is based on the premises that, in this event, the most likely hazard will be radio-active fallout caused by nuclear explosions abroad rather than direct strikes on this country by nuclear weapons.  This premise, allied to the consideration that shelters at or near a strike area offer virtually no prospect of protection against the effects of nuclear weapons, has led the Department to concentrate their attention and efforts on shelter against the hazard of fall-out.</P>
      <P>For that purpose, special purpose-built shelters are not necessary.  Indeed, for the levels of radiation which might reasonably be expected in this country, the mere fact of staying indoors in itself would provide a significant protection and this protection factor could be increased very substantially by carrying out the advised simple protective measures.</P>
      <P>There is no plan to depart from the present policy which is directed not towards the construction of special shelters but towards the idea of domestic refuge rooms prepared by householders themselves with the aid of advice provided by the Department.  Such advice is conveyed mainly in the Department's booklet &ldquo;Bas Beatha&rdquo; (available free of charge).</P>
      <P>Except in so far as it is necessary to provide for fallout protection at control centres from which civilian and Army personnel would operate the arrangements for warning and advising the public, the position as regards shelter for the Army is the same as that for the public at large.</P>

      <P>The number of employees in the public service in 1983 was 310,000 approximately.  However, as I indicated in response to a similar question from the Deputy on 29 June 1983, my Department are not responsible for the administration of sick leave schemes in the public service as a whole.</P>
      <P>The review referred to in my earlier reply in respect of the non-industrial civil service is not yet completed.  This review relates (a) to the year 1982 and (b) to a total workforce of 60,500.  Preliminary results, from a sample of 16,000 of the 60,500, indicate that the average number of working days lost through sick leave in the year 1982 was nine.  If the sample results hold true the total number of working days lost would have been 544,500.</P>
      <P>Details of the number of medical certificates issued by doctors are not recorded centrally.  However, I can tell the Deputy that on average seven of the above nine days were in respect of medically certified illnesses.</P>

      <P>Planning for the replacement of existing navigational facilities and for the provision of new facilities at the State airports is an on-going activity.  This planning process takes account of operational and technical requirements expressed by relevant interests.</P>
      <P>The precision approach radar at Dublin Airport was permanently withdrawn from service on 2 February 1984 because there was no longer any operational need for the facility as most airlines have a preference for an instrument landing system (ILS) as an approach aid.</P>
      <P>Where interruption of service of air navigation facilities is necessary for maintenance or other foreseeable reasons users are given adequate advance warning in accordance with established procedures.  Equipment failures may occur on occasions without notice but every effort is made to minimise such failures through regular preventive maintenance.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are being made for the installation of a new VHF communications system and two new ILS facilities at Dublin Airport &mdash; one to replace the existing facility on the main runway with the other as a new facility on the secondary runway.  These new facilities together with a new approach radar which was installed last year will meet all safety and operational needs at Dublin Airport.</P>

      <P>I have written to the Deputies involved expressing my concern about their statements. Evasion of any tax is illegal and cannot be condoned.  It is particularly inappropriate for Dáil Deputies to show disregard for the laws passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the bookmaker, not the punter, is legally responsible for paying betting duty.  While a bookmaker would normally be expected to collect the duty from the punter at the time of making the bet, the non-payment of the duty by the punter on a bet is not sufficient proof that betting duty was not paid by the bookmaker in respect of that bet. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are arranging to have the two Deputies interviewed by customs and excise officers to determine whether they can provide evidence of betting offences by bookmakers.</P>

      <P>The provisional outturn of expenditure on rent allowances up to the end of 1983 is £305,277.  The reduced level of expenditure as compared with the estimates for those years was caused by commencement delays and a lower than anticipated number of claims.</P>
      <P>Under the Act referred to above and regulations made thereunder, landlords of dwellings which were formerly rent-controlled are obliged to register the tenancy of each dwelling with the housing authority and to provide specified particulars in relation to such tenancy including details of the rent, and of any new rent, payable for the dwelling.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they are provided on a continuing basis with the information contained in registrations of tenancies.  This ensures that all rents paid to landlords of registered tenancies are brought to the attention of inspectors of taxes for assessment purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware that there are serious delays in the High Court in Dublin and at a number of the provincial venues where it sits to hear jury actions, notably in Cork.  This position has built up over the past number of years because of the increasing number of cases being entered in the High Court.  However, as a result of the changes in courts' jurisdiction brought about by the Courts Act, 1981, the volume of new business being taken in the High Court has fallen substantially and I am optimistic, therefore, of an early improvement in the arrears situation in the High Court as a whole.</P>
      <P>As to the particular problem in Cork the position is that it is the function of the President of the High Court to arrange the distribution and allocation of the business of the High Court and it can be taken that in doing so he takes into account the needs of particular areas.  He has increased the number of High Court sitting days in Cork in the current legal year by 50 per cent and he has now arranged, I understand, to hold High Court sitting in Waterford in June next at which Waterford plaintiffs who have long-standing cases on the Cork list will be offered a hearing.  If it is found possible to continue holding sittings in Waterford this will ease considerably the arrears situation in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that one of the problems associated with the High Court sittings in Cork has been the slow disposal rate of cases, which has been attributed to unwillingness on the part of Cork practitioners, as compared with those in other areas, to settle cases.  This is borne out by a comparison of disposal rates in the different High Courts venues since Michaelmas 1982.  The average number of cases disposed of per week has been <Col N="1806" /> 43 in Cork as compared with 69 in Limerick and 83 in Dundalk.  However, I am glad to say that the disposal rate during the sittings just completed in Cork was 82 per week.  The High Court is due to sit in Cork again in May for two weeks and in July for two weeks and if this disposal rate is maintained the arrears position can be expected to show significant improvement.</P>

    <P>Records are kept in a form which relates to competitions rather than calendar years.  The tabular statement which follows sets out particulars in relation to the number of applications received for the 1983 recruitment competition; the number who passed the qualifying examination; the number called for interview; <Col N="1807" /> the number successful at interview; the number called for medical examination and, where appropriate, oral Irish test; and the number appointed to date.</P>
    <P>Present plans are to appoint approximately 200 more recruits during 1984 but the precise numbers will depend on the level of vacancies arising from resignations, retirements and deaths during the year.  No decision has been made at this stage as to the total number to be appointed from the 1983 competition or the length of time the lists of qualified candidates will last, but the matter is at present under review in consultation with the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>A review of the entitlements of the person concerned revealed that there had been an increase in her means consisting of half the weekly value of her husband's earnings.  A question for reduction of her blind pension to the weekly rate of £2.00 with effect from 24 February 1984, the date of the first uncashed order, was therefore referred to the local pension committee for decision. The reduction in the rate of pension has been implemented on a provisional basis pending the committee's decision, and she will have the right to appeal against it.</P>

      <P>The National Manpower Service was set up at the end of 1971 and became fully operational at the end of 1972.  Since then 849,381 job-seekers have been registered by the service.  A breakdown of this figure by year is given in Table 1.  In the same period, 253,569 job-seekers were placed in employment.  A breakdown of this figure by year is also given in Table 1 below.</P>

    <P>The number of young people catered <Col N="1823" /> for on temporary employment schemes directly administered by the Youth Employment Agency is limited.  It is agency policy that youth training and employment programmes should be administered by established manpower agencies.  The youth employment levy is used to fund such programmes and persons are recruited through the National Manpower Service.  The number of young persons who were placed by the Service on levy funded programmes in 1983 (i.e. the first full year of levy) is estimated at 29,000.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service have no function in referring people to the Department of Social Welfare for unemployment benefit or assistance.  It is usual practice for unemployed job-seekers to report direct to an employment exchange before registering with NMS and the number who register first with the Manpower Service is negligible.</P>
