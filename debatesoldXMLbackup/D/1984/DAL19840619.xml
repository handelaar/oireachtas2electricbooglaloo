      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals for the revision of the local electoral areas in the administrative county of Dublin as at present constituted. However, as the House is aware, a comprehensive review of the local government system including the structures in the Dublin area is in progress and this could necessitate electoral area changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will make a statement on the talks his Department have had with their British counterparts about the impact of nuclear waste dumping on our environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister for the Environment has a general responsibility in relation to environmental matters, <Col N="1006" /> the Minister for Energy has specific statutory responsibilities in relation to the disposal of radioactive wastes and any discussions with the United Kingdom authorities on such matters are primarily a matter for him.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, no doubt, be aware that the discharge of radioactive wastes from Sellafield and the dumping of low level radioactive wastes in the Atlantic were the subject of discussions between the Minister for Energy and those authorities last February.  There have been no direct discussions between my Department and the UK authorities on these matters.  However, the Sellafield discharges were raised by the Tánaiste &mdash; then Minister for the Environment &mdash; at the Anglo-Irish summit in London on 7 November 1983.  In addition, the then Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Quinn, raised the matter informally with his United Kingdom counterpart while attending an EEC Council in Brussels on 28 November 1983.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that there is still a great deal of anxiety and unease about this matter? Will he agree that it seems to be difficult for us to get any kind of clear picture as to the extent of the dangers?  Will he tell the House if the Nuclear Energy Board are at full strength now and if they have the capacity to monitor the situation and to advise us on it?  In addition, will he state if there is any new, up-to-date information available either to himself or to any of his colleagues in the Government since the rather unsatisfactory outcome of the talks between the Tánaiste when he was Minister for the Environment and his British counterpart to which reference was made in the reply?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was put down by Deputy Allen who obviously shares my worries in this regard.

      <P>When there was a motion before the Dáil recently approving Ireland's participation in international agreements in this matter, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, handled the brief.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It raises a very important point with regard to collective responsibility in regard to a most serious aspect of the dumping of nuclear waste which could become a very serious hazard.  In the interests of collective responsibility and in doing something in the national interest in this area, would the Minister impress on his colleagues the importance of having some sort of co-ordinating committee within the Government to deal with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if guidelines are issued from his Department to local authorities giving criteria for pedestrian crossings including specific provision reflecting requirements for disabled people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to general guidelines laid down by my Department the provision of pedestrian crossings is a matter for road authorities at the request, or with the consent, of the Garda Commissioner. Road authorities also have regard to technical criteria developed by An Foras Forbartha.</P>
      <P>While these guidelines and technical criteria are aimed at the safety of road users generally, their application provides the basis for, <i>inter alia</i>, the inclusion of features of particular assistance to disabled persons.  These would include the appropriate siting of crossings, the timing of pedestrian phases in light signals, the provision of pedestrian refuges and adequate lighting at crossings.</P>
      <P>In addition, in response to a particular request issued by the Department in 1981, road authorities have provided &ldquo;dished&rdquo; kerbs at pedestrian crossings which are of considerable assistance to disabled persons.  More recent features include the provision of supplementary audio signals &mdash;&ldquo;bleepers&rdquo; at certain light-controlled crossings to assist blind persons or those with failing sight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that local authorities are taking adequate steps to ensure the provision of the special audio pedestrian crossings to facilitate blind people to which he referred in his reply as, from observation, it appears <Col N="1011" /> that very few have been installed outside Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the run-down condition in some corporation flats complexes in Dublin's Inner City and that these conditions are largely due to the absence of any specific capital allocation to Dublin Corporation for upgrading works on flat schemes; and if he will agree to give serious consideration to the allocation of funds to the corporation so that this badly needed work can be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problems in some of Dublin Corporation inner city flat complexes.  As the Deputy will appreciate, consideration of possible solutions and approaches to these problems is a matter primarily for Dublin Corporation, which are responsible for the management, maintenance and repair of their housing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To meet the costs of such management, maintenance and repairs the corporation have available to them the entire rental income from their overall estate, together with 40 per cent of the proceeds of their sales of local authority houses and any other moneys from revenue sources that they may decide to allocate for the purpose.  In addition, grants are available from my Department in respect of certain improvement works to local <Col N="1012" /> authority dwellings.  Capital allocations by way of unsubsidised loan may also be made available in respect of such works.</P>
    <P>The making of capital allocations for normal maintenance and repair works to local authority houses would not be appropriate since such works are properly a charge on revenue funds.  I am conscious, however, of the general problem involved in the financing of extensive works of a capital nature to local authority houses which are in need of modernisation and renovation.  There are no funds available to me out of which additional allocations could be made for this purpose but I am keeping the matter under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the existing finances available to the corporation are totally inadequate and that conditions in inner city flat complexes are deteriorating as a result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The moneys available are adequate for normal maintenance but in the case of flats or houses which have become substandard we would have to look at the matter again.  The money available from rental and the 40 per cent income from the sale of houses is quite adequate to meet normal maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that one of the contributory factors to the run-down condition of inner city flat complexes is the tremendous shortage of professional and supervisory staff in the maintenance section? Is he aware that there are two architects and one engineer available to the corporation to run the entire maintenance section for capital city?  Does he feel this is adequate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Skilled craftsmen rather than architects are required for maintenance.  Obviously architects are needed to examine the fabric of older dwellings and I would say that two architects would be adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister is so out of touch <Col N="1013" /> with what is adequate.  Certainly the corporation would not agree with him.  Is he aware that in Britain a similar pattern of inner city neglect led to serious rioting before positive action was taken?  Would he consider a detailed examination of his Department's response to inner city conditions before the same thing occurs here?  I have no doubt the same will occur if there is not a positive response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is a direct correlation between the serious social problems that obtain in these areas and the neglect of the environmental surroundings?  Would he agree that this is caused by the absence of sufficient personnel to deal with the problem?  Would the Minister elaborate on the number of tradesmen and staff below the professional level detailed to do this work and provide the proper environment to prevent deteriorating social problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That takes in a whole range of problems.  The withdrawing of the caretaker a number of years ago was the start of all this.  There was also an over-emphasis on local authority dwellings in one area and the proper social mix was not achieved.  We must plan to improve the social fabric of the inner city and inject a better social mix.  We must consider both the social fabric and building fabric.</P>

The prior inspection is quite clearly indicated on the application form as being necessary and that applicants should not proceed until the work has been inspected.

The Deputy has been talking about keeping people out of geriatric hospitals as if this situation implied some impediment thereto.  The situation about prior inspection is quite clearly stated on the application form.

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the 35 fire authorities which were established under the Fire Services Act, 1981, to ensure that sufficient personnel and equipment are available to provide a satisfactory fire service for their areas.  In addition to the formulation and implementation of national policy and legislation in respect of the fire service, my role includes guiding, advising and assisting fire authorities in the discharge of their functions and the provision of finance to assist in the development <Col N="1019" /> and improvement of the fire services.  At the request of my Department fire authorities have been carrying out appraisals of their existing fire services with the object of identifying deficiencies and formulating programmes for improvements.</P>
    <P>Fire cover is provided mainly by full-time personnel in the larger centres of pupulation and by part-time staff in other areas.  As at 31 December 1983, a total of 1,120 full-time and 1971 part-time staff were employed.  Many senior fire service personnel have functions in relation to a number of different towns.  Accordingly, it would not be possible to provide a breakdown of the full-time staff in relation to individual towns as requested. Details of the location and capacity of the items of equipment used by local fire brigades at individual local stations throughout the country are not available in my Department.</P>
    <P>A capital sum of £7.5 million has been provided in 1984 to assist fire authorities in the improvement and development of the fire service, including the construction and improvement of fire stations and the purchase of fire-fighting equipment. This is 25 per cent more than in 1983 and compares with the amount of £2.143 million made available in 1980.  In addition, a 50 per cent subsidy is paid on loan charges of fire authorities in respect of borrowings for fire services purposes and £1.46 million is provided for this purpose in 1984.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as environmental <Col N="1021" /> control is concerned, the main considerations in this country to date in the provision of coal-burning electricity generating stations have been to minimise atmospheric pollution caused by such stations through the installation of suitable equipment to remove grit and dust from air emissions and the provision of high stacks to disperse emissions of sulphur dioxides and nitrogen oxides.  The further reduction of emissions would be dependent on the degree of sophistication of the control systems and the maintenance of those systems.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of growing international concern about emissions from power plant which can result in the precipitation of nitric and sulphuric acids, and give rise to long range transboundary air pollution.  This had led to the adoption, on 1 March 1984, of an EEC directive which requires new procedures for the control of emissions from plant which could cause significant air pollution.</P>
      <P>The directive will require an authorisation system under which new plant must use the best available technology, which does not involve excessive costs, for preventing or reducing emissions.  In addition, existing plant must be brought within the controls on a phased basis.  A further draft directive on the limitation of emissions of pollutants into the air from large combustion plant has also been proposed at EEC level.</P>
      <P>This country's policy in regard to control of air emissions will continue to be developed in tandem with the development of EEC policy in this area.  In addition, preliminary work on the preparation of comprehensive new air pollution legislation has been carried out in my Department and this will be brought to completion as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason he requested Dublin County Council to accept asbestos waste, which is listed as being toxic and dangerous by the EEC, when the same waste was refused entry into the United Kingdom, which is the traditional area for disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1022" />
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>A circular issued by my Department in July 1982 made it clear that the Minister expected local authorities to see to the provision of adequate landfill facilities for the disposal of industrial wastes arising in their functional areas.  The circular asked that immediate consideration be given to the scope for acceptance on existing sites of industrial wastes, including those &mdash; such as asbestos wastes &mdash; which require special care in handling and disposal but can be safely disposed of by landfill methods under properly controlled conditions.  A memorandum which accompanied the 1982 circular indicated that landfill, either on specialised sites or in conjunction with domestic wastes, was an acceptable means of disposing of asbestos wastes provided certain requirements are met. This circular and memorandum were entirely consistent with the national strategy for waste disposal which was announced in May 1981.</P>
      <P>The internationally accepted method of disposal of asbestos wastes is to suitable landfill disposal sites.  In the last few years, asbestos waste arising in the Dublin area has been exported to the UK for disposal by landfill.  In recent times, however, the UK authorities have indicated that they see no reason why arrangements could not be made to dispose of this waste at landfill disposal sites in Ireland, rather than in the UK.  In addition, there are indications that the import of asbestos wastes to the UK may be prohibited entirely.  Arising from this, and taking into account the advice previously issued by my Department to local authorities about the disposal of asbestos wastes, my Department suggested to Dublin County Council last autumn that they examine the possibility of accepting on landfill sites asbestos wastes arising in the Dublin area.  I understand that the county council, at its meeting on 12 March, agreed to accept such waste at Balally for a trial period of 12 months but that this decision was rescinded at a subsequent meeting on 9 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reversal of the local authority's earlier decision is regrettable, particularly since it was the intention that all <Col N="1023" /> asbestos for disposal on the site would be examined by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and would be subject to the consignment note system prescribed in the 1982 regulations on toxic and dangerous waste.  I also understand that all the recommendations made in the Asbestosis Research Council's Recommended Code of Practice for the handling and disposal of asbestos waste were to be followed.</P>
    <P>Unless adequate facilities for the disposal of industrial wastes are provided, there will be significant additional costs for existing Irish industry.  Besides, the lack of these facilities would have very serious implications for industrial development and employment, and for the environment.  The decision taken by Dublin County Council in this particular instance must be viewed against this background.  Wide powers are available to the council to ensure that wastes such as those in question are properly and safely disposed of and it is essential that these powers be utilised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>EEC directives relating to water quality come under two broad categories, those relating to discharges of particular pollutants, and those specifying quality standards for particular waters, for example, drinking water, fisheries and bathing waters.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that obligations arising from directives in regard to the control of particular pollutants can be met through the imposition of conditions by local authorities when licensing discharges under sections 4 and 16 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the second category of directive, waters coming within the terms <Col N="1024" /> of the directives have been designated and monitoring is carried out by or on behalf of the appropriate local authorities. Results are forwarded to the Commission annually in respect of designated bathing areas, although this is not, strictly speaking necessary as none of our bathing areas is used to the extent envisaged in the directive.  Results relating to waters designated for other purposes will be sent to the Commission in accordance with the provisions of the relevant directives.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied that existing arrangements are generally adequate to ensure the implementation of the relevant directives, I am considering the need for regulations under section 26 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, which would prescribe national quality standards for waters and for particular effluents.</P>

      <P>I believe that a water quality management plan for Dublin Bay is necessary for the preservation and, where necessary, the improvement of water quality.  The making of such a plan is a matter, in the first instance, for the local authorities concerned.  At a recent seminar on Dublin Bay, I called on these authorities to come together on this matter and, in the short term, initiate a programe which would provide the basis for the preparation of a comprehensive management plan.  My Department will be taking up the matter with the local authorities in the near future.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of each local authority to provide the necessary accommodation for travelling <Col N="1026" /> people, whether under their normal housing programmes, in special schemes, or on halting sites.  My Department provide 100 per cent subsidy in respect of the capital costs of providing special accommodation and 90 per cent recoupment of the cost of employing social workers.

However, I am not waiting for that report and I am meeting all county managers on an individual basis to discuss their proposals to deal with this problem.  I accept that some counties felt they were being asked to do too much while others dragged their feet.  I will be taking action to ensure that all local authorities play their part in dealing with this problem.  I met the county manager from the Deputy's constituency yesterday and discussed the problems in that county.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the progress that has been made in the recycling of glass, metals, domestic and industrial waste; and if he is in consultation with any local authorities or groups of authorities to achieve improvements in the field of the recycling of these materials.</P>

    <Col N="1027" />
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's concern with recycling arises mainly in the context of the waste collection and disposal services operated by local authorities. Recycling potential is primarily a matter for industry and is largely dictated by the economics of materials recovery and re-use.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are empowered to consider any possibilities of promoting or assisting in recycling that may arise in the course of their waste collection and disposal operations and my Department have consistently urged them to facilitate recycling proposals in any way they can.</P>
      <P>A number of local authorities have made provision to assist in the recovery of waste oils and scrap metal and in the case of waste oils it is estimated that about 1½ million gallons were recovered in 1983.  The potential to increase this recovery rate exists and local authorities have recently been asked to further assist by providing special receptacles at their tipheads, as well as encouraging garages or other relatively large scale oil users to provide facilities for periodic collection.</P>
      <P>While local authorities are not directly involved in glass recycling, the Irish Glass Bottle Company operates bottle banks in a number of areas and a significant quantity of glass is recycled by merchants and through voluntary organisations.  The voluntary organisations are playing an important role and this must be taken into account in considering local authority involvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that some housing authorities are referring homeless people to health boards; and if he will issue a direction to all housing authorities that provision for homeless people should be made in all new housing schemes and schemes of letting priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 54 of the Health Act, 1953, health boards have a statutory duty to provide institutional assistance for any person who is unable <Col N="1028" /> to provide shelter and maintenance for himself or his dependants.</P>
      <P>The provision of permanent housing accommodation for persons, including homeless persons, in need of such accommodation but who are unable to provide it from their own resources is a function of housing authorities.  I am aware that some authorities have referred to health boards persons without accommodation, or persons seeking temporary accommodation, because the authorities were not in a position at the time to offer suitable accommodation to these persons.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is a need for a clearer division of responsibility between health boards and housing authorities in this matter and also a need for greater uniformity among housing authorities in dealing with homeless persons.  As I indicated on 14 December last during the debate on the Housing Bill, 1983 and also in reply to a previous question by the Deputy on 24 January, my Department are carrying out a fundamental review of the relevant provisions of the Housing Act, 1966 with a view to formulating legislative proposals that will enable the question of homelessness to be more effectively tackled.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister give us some positive indication as to when the Government are going to make the changes in the legislation which are necessary to ensure that homeless people are adequately provided for?  Local authorities are being put in an invidious position because of the lack of clear legislation outlining what the real position should be.  I am sorry that I missed the beginning of the Minister's reply but I heard him saying that he had referred to this previously. Of course he has, but he has done absolutely nothing about it since then.</P>

      <P>An allocation of £63 million has been made to the Housing Finance Agency for the payment of loans in 1984 compared with £55 million advanced in 1983.  I understand that the agency have not imposed restrictions on the approval or payment of loans or on the category of persons qualifying for loans; neither has any direction of this kind regarding single persons or otherwise been issued by me.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is necessary for the agency in the interests of proper budgetary planning to provide guidelines for individual local authorities as to the amounts likely to be available for loan payments this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate and in particular I am pleased that the need for the Bill and for building regulations has been appreciated.  A number of points were raised during the debate on which I would like to comment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy expressed his concern about a lack of consultation with the industry prior to the introduction of the Bill.  I can only say that Deputy Molloy must not have been fully informed on this matter.  In fact there have been extensive consultations with representatives of the industry, particularly since 1981, but also before that when the 1976 draft of the regulations was issued for comment.  The 500 comments received on the 1976 draft were fully considered and incorporated, in so far as they were acceptable, in the amended draft regulations published in March 1981.  While there were meetings with representatives of the industry prior to 1981 the frequency of meetings increased dramatically from 1981 onwards when our proposals for a certification system of control were being formulated. These proposals were in fact circulated to the industry in April 1981, September 1981 and April 1982 and were the subject of numerous meetings with the industry at both ministerial and official level.  The comments of the industry representation at these meetings were taken into account when the Bill was being prepared.  I must emphasise that I am satisfied that every opportunity was given to the industry to express their views.  The industry would concur with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to repeat what <Col N="1095" /> I said in my opening remarks and that is that the Building Regulations Advisory Body, which will be broadly representative of the industry, will be used as a forum through which the consensus views of the industry as a whole can be articulated. This is important particularly in relation to the proposed certification system of control.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the Opposition's suggestion that I should postpone proceeding to Committee Stage of the Bill until both the building regulations and building control regulations were published.  It is not normal practice to publish proposed regulations before the Bill is enacted.  In this instance we published, for reasons I have already given, a draft of the building regulations in 1976 and 1981 and a final draft revised in the light of the recommendations of the Stardust Tribunal and other developments since was published on 16 May entitled <i>Proposed Building Regulations.</i>  An Foras Forbartha have also published a guidance manual which explains the regulations both diagrammatically and in the language of the industry.  The publication of the manual has been welcomed by the industry and it has been favourably commented on.</P>
    <P>As regards the building control regulations, I referred in my opening remarks to the proposed system of control and how it would work.  I referred also to the fact that we proposed to have further consultations with the industry on certain details of the system which had to be resolved.  My officials and I have had meetings with the industry recently on this and we propose to have further meetings. I do not propose to hold up the Committee Stage of this Bill until the details of the control regulations are agreed with the industry.  To do so would be both unnecessary and inappropriate. However, let me repeat that I propose to have full consultation with the industry through the medium of the Building Regulations Advisory Body before making them.</P>
    <P>For Deputy De Rossa's information there will be 35 building control authorities and not 80 to 90.  All the county <Col N="1096" /> councils, their four county boroughs, Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Athlone, Drogheda and Dundalk Urban District Councils will be designated as building control authorities.  The Dublin area will, therefore, have three building control authorities.  However, section 2 (4) enables authorities to make arrangements for the joint performance of any of their functions should they so wish.  Deputy De Rossa also suggested that we are following the UK in our proposals for a certification system of control.  Indeed the words he used were that we &ldquo;slavishly copied&rdquo; the British.  It would appear that he would need to check out where he is getting his information from because, again, he is wrong.  Our proposals for a certification system of control were being developed long before the British ones and differ substantially from the system proposed in the UK.</P>
    <P>From the debate there appeared to be some confusion as to the position in relation to the exemption of low rise housing from the control arrangements.  This confusion arose from a lack of appreciation of the distinction between the building regulations and the building control regulations.  The difference between the two kinds of regulations is that the building regulations will lay down the technical standards while the building control regulations will deal solely with procedural and control arrangements such as the details of the certification system.  I wish to make it clear that while low-rise housing will be exempted from the need to submit certificates of compliance with the regulations it will still be required to comply with the technical requirements of the regulations and will be subject to the inspection and enforcement procedures in the Bill at the discretion of the building control authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen suggested that a provision be inserted in the Bill to the effect that no building be sold in the absence of a certificate of compliance from the building control authority.  While there may, in theory, be some attraction in this proposal, I think that it would give rise to serious practical problems.  However, copies of certificates of compliance lodged with building control authorities <Col N="1097" /> will be available to potential purchasers of buildings should they so wish it.</P>
    <P>Concern that decisions by building control authorities on dispensations and relaxations would lead to different standards around the country was expressed. There may indeed be different decisions in different building control authority areas but these differences should relate to the particular circumstances applying in that area or in the particular case in question.  However, I will be monitoring the situation on an on-going basis to ensure that, as far as possible, a consistent approach is adopted by building control authorities to applications for dispensations and relaxations.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy Molloy and some other Deputies during the debate was that of the civil liability of designers and builders and the possibility that non-compliance with building regulations extends this liability in some way.  I understand the industry's concern about this general issue given the trends that have evolved in case law in the past decade, particularly in Britain, in regard to liability for defects in buildings.  The main cause of concern seems to be the open-ended nature of such liability. There is no significant evidence, as far as I am aware, that building regulations have been a factor in, or a cause of, the developments that have taken place in case law dealing with liability for negligence related to buildings.  While as I said, I can understand the industry's concern on this issue, I am satisfied that the general issue of liability is not appropriate to be dealt with in the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy feels that local authorities should have more responsibility and that certifiers should have less.  This is to deny the whole thrust of the proposals in the Bill which is that the industry should certify its own work.  This is not unreasonable &mdash; architects, engineers, builders and others are responsible in any event for their own work and, as such, are liable in a case of proven negligence.  This approach underlines the thinking behind section 6(4) which exempts a building control authority from ensuring that a building is free from defect or complies <Col N="1098" /> with the regulations or that a certificate of compliance is accurate.  There is general agreement in the industry as a whole in regard to the merits of the proposed control scheme.  Given that we are opting for a procedure along these lines, it would be illogical to impose liability on local authorities for ensuring that buildings comply with building regulations.</P>
    <P>The point was raised that State and other public bodies should be included in the control system.  While I am confident that standards of construction of public buildings are sufficiently high, I pointed out in my opening remarks that while I propose to exclude them for the present I will be reviewing the situation in the light of experience.  I would also like to emphasise the fact that although such buildings will be excluded from the control system they will be subject to the requirements of the building regulations.</P>
    <P>The question of who will certify compliance with the regulations was also raised.  I accept that there may be problems in designating certifiers but this will be fully considered in consultation with the industry through the medium of the advisory body.  In particular I am aware that there are professional people who are not members of any professional body or who do not have a formal qualification. I would like to assure them that their position will be taken into account at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the assertion that the Bill will increase costs, a point raised by Deputy Durkan and other Deputies, I should like to say that the purpose of the certification system of control as proposed is to reduce costs.  It was in fact the industry that requested this particular system rather than an approval system as a means of reducing costs and eliminating long and unnecessary delays.  In relation to additional costs arising from the implementation of the regulations I am satisfied that standards in the proposed building regulations are already being widely applied and that additional cost, if any, will be minimal.</P>
    <P>Deputies Calleary and Allen raised the question of the situation of the authorised person under section 10 of the Bill and I think I should take this opportunity to <Col N="1099" /> clarify the responsibilities of building control authorities and the situation regarding their powers to ensure compliance with the regulations.  While it would be inappropriate, for the reasons I have already given, for a building control authority to be held responsible for ensuring that a building is free from defect or that it complies with building regulations, this does not mean that the local authorities should be powerless to do anything by way of inspection, if evident breaches of the regulations are brought to their notice.  Section 7 to 9 dealing with the issue of enforcement notices, section 10 dealing with inspection by an authorised person and section 11, which relates to an order of the High Court in particular cases of breaches of the regulations, are the relevant enforcement sections.  As regards section 10 to which Deputy Calleary refers, while this section imposes no obligation on a building control authority to inspect a building in any particular circumstances, or at all, I would expect that the authorities will avail of the powers of the section if and when they feel it is necessary to do so.  It will be a matter for each authority to consider objectively to what extent and in what manner they will make use of the powers of the section having regard to the particular circumstances prevailing in their area, the financial and other resources available to them, their capacity to carry out inspections, and any other factors that may be relevant.</P>
    <P>I would like also to refer to the further point raised by Deputy Allen regarding the acceptance of the certificate of compliance by agencies such as, the national house building guarantee scheme, building societies, and others, which carry out inspections of new houses for their own purposes.  While this is naturally for these different agencies to consider, I have some doubt as to its practicality given the different purposes of inspection involved for each agency.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa indicated that the standards in the regulations should apply to existing buildings.  While I take the point, it would be impractical and indeed unreasonable to require a building owner to apply the building regulations standards <Col N="1100" /> to a building which was built in accordance with the accepted standards of the time it was built, and which had proved to be adequate for the purpose for which it had been built.  The building regulations would of course apply should that building be structurally altered or undergo certain changes of use.  However, having said that, I should also point out that local authorities have other powers available to them in relation to dangerous buildings.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa also raised the issue of insurance by architects, builders and other certifiers against negligent certifying and negligent design.  I should point out that the principal objective of the Bill is to ensure that buildings are built to adequate standards for the primary purpose of protecting public health and safety.  I do not see a need in this context for specific legislative provision to be made in the legislation in regard to the question of insurance cover for approved certifiers, although this is no doubt a matter that will receive careful consideration from the professional and other interests that will be involved in the operation of the certification system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton felt that we should implement the parts of the regulations dealing with fire first.  Following the Stardust Tribunal recommendations to this effect such a course of action was considered very seriously, but was found to be impractical as all the parts of the regulations interact with one another and it would not be practical to make the fire parts of the regulations in advance.  However, I can assure Deputy Bruton that as soon as possible after this Bill is passed, the proposed building regulations will become law.  In the meantime I have asked all those concerned with their use to regard them as if they had statutory backing and to apply the standards therein, including the fire standards, when designing and constructing buildings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh raised the question of the selling of houses on which small extensions were carried out without building bye-law approval and the difficulties created because of this.  I would refer the Deputy to my opening remarks <Col N="1101" /> in which I clarified the situation &mdash; subsection (7) of section 20 of the Bill covers this matter and effectively gives an amnesty in such cases.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would refer briefly to the point made by Deputy Molloy in relation to section 16 (4) which may in certain circumstances extend responsibility for an offence to a director, manager or secretary of a corporate body.  This is not an unusual provision.  A similar provision is contained in the Fire Services Act, 1981, and other legislation as well. I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that it becomes operative only where an offence is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of the person involved, or is attributable to any neglect on his part.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to thank Deputies who contributed to this debate.  It is important that the Bill proceed as quickly as possible, not only to enable the building regulations to be made at an early date but also to enable the establishment of the Building Regulations Advisory Body for the purposes of consulting the industry generally.  There has been a lot of discussion about building regulations over the years.  Now that we have got this Bill this far, I do not want the momentum to drop.  I will be happy if we pass this legislation, set up the advisory body and, after full consultation with the relevant bodies, get agreement particularly on the question of certification.  Once we get that, I do not see any great problems.  As I said, we have had discussions with the industry and in my view we are going in the right direction.  Now that the Second Stage has concluded I can have further discussions with the industry and when the Committee and Final Stages are passed, we will make the regulations as soon as possible.</P>

    <Title>Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend and extend the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  That Act, which was the subject of detailed discussion on Committee Stage by an all-party committee of the Dáil, constitutes the basic legal framework for a wide range of controls over the supply and distribution of certain dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs.  In addition, the Act specifies offences and penalties in relation to the possession of and illicit traffic in drugs, includes provision for procedures for dealing with irresponsible prescribing of controlled drugs and provides the Garda Síochána with powers of enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the changes in the pattern of drug abuse since 1977, since the enactment of the 1977 legislation seven years ago the whole pattern of drug abuse has changed considerably, both in terms of magnitude and the nature of the problem. <Col N="1106" /> The level of drug abuse has increased dramatically.  Statistics from the National Drug Advisory and Treatment Centre in Jervis Street show that in January 1984 a total of 336 attended for treatment, whereas the corresponding figure for January 1983 was 232.  This represents an increase of some 45 per cent.  Perhaps most alarming is the increasing incidence of abuse of harder drugs such as heroin.  This phenomenon was documented in the recent survey carried out by the Medico-Social Research Board in a north inner city area of Dublin.  Ten per cent of those surveyed in the 15-24 age group were found to be abusing heroin.</P>
    <P>In response to the growing incidence of the problem and in an attempt to devise a co-ordinated plan of action to combat it, the Government last year set up a Special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse to review and report on the problem.  Following consideration of numerous oral and written submissions from experts and various other bodies with an interest in the problem, the task force made a number of recommendations covering the areas of law enforcement, treatment facilities, education, research and community and youth work services.  The implementation of these recommendations is currently being monitored by the task force and a substantial degree of progress has been made.</P>
    <P>The task force in their recognition of the need for new legislation highlighted in particular certain deficiencies in the 1977 Act and the need to amend the existing legislation in order to deal more effectively with the problem.  The proposals put forward by the task force have been incorporated in the Bill, together with desirable changes recommended by other parties concerned with controlling the drug problem.</P>
    <P>I believe that the general provisions in the Bill, based as they are on informed opinion and perceived needs, deserve the wholehearted support of this House.  I should say at this point that I welcome and will, of course, give careful consideration to any suggestions which Deputies <Col N="1107" /> may wish to make to improve the Bill and which are deemed desirable.</P>
    <P>Regarding enforcement provisions, the Bill is primarily designed to facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of the 1977 Act.  Certain technical difficulties have been experienced by the Garda which have impeded their work in enforcing effectively the current statutory controls. Sections 9 and 10 of the Bill will remedy these deficiencies by providing the Garda with clearer powers in relation to the search of persons and vehicles, vessels and aircraft and in relation to the issue of search warrants.  For example, section 9 makes it explicit that the power of a garda to search a vehicle, vessel or aircraft where he suspects an infringement of the law, includes power to search containers etc. thereon.  It also provides that the owner or person in charge of the particular vehicle, vessel or aircraft may be required to remain present for the duration of the search.  Section 10 provides for the issue of search warrants in cases which were not covered before &mdash; for example, where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the illegal cultivation of cannabis, opium poppy or the coca plant.  Provision is also made for the issue of search warrants in respect of lands, caravans and tents in addition to premises.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 7 of the Bill will mean that members of the Forensic Science Laboratory no longer have to attend court to give evidence in relation to inspections and analyses carried out by them on drugs which are the subject of prosecutions.  Instead, a certificate of analysis signed by the officer who has carried out the analysis will suffice.</P>
    <P>The new definition of cannabis and extension of prohibition on cultivation of cannabis and the opium poppy to include the coca plant, as provided in section 2 of the Bill, will greatly facilitate prosecutions in relation to the cultivation, possession etc. of cannabis.  The existing definition failed to capture much of the home-grown variety.  In addition, section 8 of the Bill extends the current prohibition on the cultivation of cannabis and <Col N="1108" /> the opium poppy to include the coca plant.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office I have had on occasion to refer a number of cases of irresponsible prescribing of controlled drugs for investigation in accordance with the procedures set out in the 1977 Act.  I found these procedures to be very cumbersome and time-consuming, involving referral to the registration authority concerned, followed by the setting up of various committees.  In cases which call for the prohibition of prescribing as a matter of urgency a separate advisory panel must be established.</P>
    <P>Section 3 and 4 of the Bill provide for a streamlining of the machinery involved in the investigative procedure.  They provide that the Minister, and not as heretofore the registration authority concerned, may establish a committee of inquiry where he considers that there are grounds for giving a special direction prohibiting a practitioner from prescribing controlled drugs.  Pending the report of the committee of inquiry, the Minister may issue, where he considers it necessary a temporary prohibition.</P>
    <P>The committee of inquiry will investigate the allegations, consider any representations made by the practitioner and report on the matter to the Minister.  It will then be a matter simply for the Minister to decide whether or not to issue a special direction, without recourse to the further procedures provided for in the 1977 Act which have been found in practice to be superfluous and time-consuming. In cases where the Minister decides to issue a special direction, the practitioner will still have the right to appeal to the High Court which is provided for in section 11 of the 1977 Act.</P>
    <P>The growing level of drug abuse has brought about an increase in public awareness of the problem.  The greater awareness has been paralleled by increasing demands for higher penalties for those found guilty of drug offences. Section 6 of this Bill provides for an increase in the maximum monetary penalties which can be imposed on summary conviction in order to take into account the change in money values since 1977 <Col N="1109" /> and the increasingly serious nature of the drug-pushing problem.</P>
    <P>The current maximum monetary limit of £3,000 for serious indictable offences such as drug pushing has been removed. This particular provision is designed primarily to apprehend those &ldquo;well organised&rdquo; drug pushers who are involved for financial gain.  The section also provides for an increase in the maximum sentence for a convicted drug pusher from fourteen years to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Over the years the courts have been hindered in passing sentence on drug pushers as a result of the current mandatory remand provision pending receipt of reports on their medical and social backgrounds.  Section 11 of this Bill provides for the substitution of a discretionary remand provision for the mandatory one as it is obviously inappropriate to defer sentences in serious cases such as drug pushing where the problem of addiction does not arise.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the power of the media to influence our thinking and everyday actions.  Young people are particularly vulnerable in this regard. Section 5 of the Bill provides that books and magazines which encourage drug abuse and advertise equipment for use by drug abusers may not be printed or sold. I believe that this prohibition is necessary to guard against the introduction of publications of this sort into this country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I appreciate that the new legislation will not on its own provide an immediate solution to this complex problem. Nevertheless, I believe that the increased penalties will prove an effective deterrent for those engaged in drug pushing etc.  Also the facilitation of the enforcement procedure will go some way towards achieving more rapid apprehension of those responsible for committing offences.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the recommendations of the Task Force on Drug Abuse, which are currently being implemented and which take into account the many facets of the drug problem.  The recommendations as a whole comprise a comprehensive plan of action.  I believe it will make a substantial contribution to the containment of the problem.  I have <Col N="1110" /> already implemented a large number of the measures concerned in the treatment area, the education area, the community area and, today, in the legislative area.  I am hopeful that the House will appreciate the urgency of the new measures proposed and will support me in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal Act, the Misuse of Drugs Act, was first presented to the Dáil in 1973 and came into operation in 1979.  As the Minister has pointed out the main work on that legislation was done by an all-party committee in 1976. After a lot of hard work by all sides in the House the legislation was agreed by the parties.  It is in the spirit of that all-party approach that I would like to discuss the Misuse of Drugs Bill before us today.</P>
      <P>The Misuse of Drugs Act is very important legislation which deals with a situation which is difficult and complex.  The principal Act was new and it is appropriate that after five years in operation we should review it to see how it can be improved.  While most of the amendments proposed by the Minister give more power to the Garda and increase the penalties for offences it is important to balance between giving the necessary power to the authorities to implement the legislation to recognise the special problems and the needs of the addict. Many addicts are young people without any evil intent and they unwittingly get hooked on drugs without knowing the harmful consequences of their action. They often require medical care and attention rather than punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that there has been a serious increase in substance abuse in the country over the last ten years, particularly over the last five years.  It is important at the outset when we are speaking about substance abuse and drug abuse to recognise that far and away the greatest problems in the country are still created by the amount of alcohol consumed and the amount of tobacco smoked.  While the abuse of drugs is a very serious problem, particularly in this city, we should not lose sight of the need to see what we can do to ensure that the people do not damage their health or other people's <Col N="1111" /> health through the abuse of other substances. It is important to recognise that the abuse of alcohol and the abuse of tobacco are two substance abuses which are causing serious problems.</P>
    <P>In the sixties there was practically no drug addiction not alone in Ireland but throughout Europe.  The few addicts we had became addicted to drugs abroad.  It is interesting to note that in 1966 only one person was charged with drug offence. By 1979 that had risen to 594 people and by 1982 to more than 1,500 people. It is an increasing problem and the particular substances used vary from country to country.  We seem to be the only country who use dicanol, an opium derivative, on any large scale.  We have got a problem now with the abuse of heroin which is of crisis proportions, particularly in Dublin.  The heroin problem started to escalate very rapidly in 1980 following the Iranian revolution.</P>
    <P>Section 2 includes a new definition of cannabis.  It is important that it should be redefined because the cannabis cultivated in Ireland does not have the flowering referred to in the Principal Act.  Cannabis is still the most widely abused drug. Throughout the world 560,000 tons were seized in 1982.  Here there were 107 seizures in 1977 and 430 in 1981.  While heroin creates the most serious problem, we must not lose sight of the fact that the amount of cannabis being used is increasing as well.  A debate has been going on for years on whether or not the use of cannabis is harmful.  At this stage there is sufficient evidence to show that its use is not harmless in its own right and that it leads to the abuse of harder drugs.</P>
    <P>The problem of heroin use has reached almost crisis proportions in this city. Since 1980 there has been an almost vertical rise in the graph.  It is estimated that there are 1,500 addicts in this city.  A recent study carried out by the Medico-Social Research Board showed that in one area of the city 10 per cent of young people between the ages of 16 and 24 years were using heroin.  That is a frightening figure.  Many of these young people have a poor educational record.  Some of them use other drugs and the older ones <Col N="1112" /> are unemployed.  These are all factors which we have to take into account.</P>
    <P>In 1977 there was one seizure of heroin here and in 1981 there were 117.  That is an indication of good detection work by the Garda and also of the increased use of that substance in the city.  Particularly worrying about the use of heroin is the amount of associated crimes.  Perhaps that is why in the public mind heroin addiction seems to supersede all other forms of substance abuse and addiction. Heroin addicts spend up to £100 per day to get their supply on the black market. Many of them are involved in crime to get money to keep themselves supplied with the substance to which they are addicted.  The side effects of heroin also cause people to become involved in very serious crime.</P>
    <P>The Jervis Street national drugs advisory and treatment centre see 80 new patients per month.  There is a time lag of approximately four years between when a person starts to take heroin and his or her appearance at the Jervis Street clinic.  This is a particularly difficult problem and shows no sign of abating.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us in the past that glue sniffing will be dealt with in the Children Bill.  We might ask how effective legislation to deal with glue sniffing will be because it is indulged in mainly by very young people.  It is a particularly serious problem because a number of sudden deaths have occurred in the case of teenagers as a result of sniffing glue. They can die while sniffing it.  It is particularly serious from that point of view.  A question arises as to how this problem should be dealt with, and whether legislating for these young people is the correct way to deal with it, or whether some other way might be found.  In this area the ideal answer is education on the danger of the misuse of any substance.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister intends to change the procedure for investigating allegations of irresponsible prescribing against members of the medical, dental and veterinary professions.  Under the present legislation the Minister refers the case to the registration authority who set up a committee of inquiry to investigate the allegations.  The Minister now intends <Col N="1113" /> to by-pass the registration authority and set up his own committee of inquiry without reference to the registration authority, except to notify them of his decision following the investigation.  In other words, under the present legislation, if a doctor were accused of over-prescribing, the Minister would refer the case to the Medical Registration Council who, in turn, would set up a committee of inquiry who would report back to the Minister. The Minister would then write to the doctor pointing out the result of the committee's inquiry and the doctor would be at liberty to appeal to the Minister against the decision if he was not satisfied with it.  The Minister would then write again to the Medical Registration Council who would set up an advisory committee, who would again write back to the Minister. The Minister could then give a direction or refer the case back to the original committee of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I accept that that is cumbersome and time-consuming.  If somebody is over-prescribing drugs it is important that the case should be investigated quickly and a decision made.  I accept the need to expedite investigations into irresponsible prescribing.  Having said that, I have certain reservations about the section.  The registration authority should be involved in the investigation in some way.  Under the proposed legislation the Minister will set up a committee of inquiry and make his decision on the basis of their report, and notify his decision to the registration authority.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that in the Bill there is no indication of who will make up the committee of inquiry and what the structure of the committee will be.  It is important to recognise that the right to prescribe controlled drugs is part of the profession in which practitioners earn their livelihood, doctors, veterinary surgeons and dentists.  The composition of the committee of inquiry should be written into the legislation so that we can ensure that justice will be done.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House hold no brief for practitioners who over-prescribe controlled drugs.  We are as anxious as the Minister to have this practice brought to a halt.  It is important to recognise that <Col N="1114" /> only a small percentage of practitioners, mainly doctors, have been involved to any serious extent in the over-prescription of these drugs.  We have to find a balance between the right of an individual to practise his profession and the responsibility of the Minister to protect the public from over-prescription.  I ask the Minister to meet representatives of the medical, dental and veterinary professions to discuss the section with them in order to find a more acceptable way of dealing with the problem rather than having the Minister bypass the registration authority completely.  There are time limits with regard to setting up the inquiry and when the Minister gets a reply from the respondent, but there is no time limit on when the Minister will take a decision.  There should be a time limit on the Minister when he receives the report of the committee.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with penalties, mainly penalties for increasing the fines for various offences under certain sections of the original Act.  Subsection (3) states that a person found guilty of an offence under section 15 shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine of such amount as the court considers appropriate or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for life, whereas the 1977 Act sets out a fine of £3,000 or a sentence not exceeding 14 years.  It appears to me that instead of making the penalty more severe for those guilty of unlawful supply we are providing for a lesser penalty in this section.  At the moment the average life sentence is between eight and ten years and existing legislation provides for a maximum of 14 years.  Nowadays a life sentence is always less than 14 years and, therefore, I ask the Minister to provide for a maximum of 14 years in this section.</P>
    <P>The pusher, the person who sells drugs for his own gain, is guilty of the most serious offence.  We have to distinguish between the pusher who is an addict &mdash; often he sells drugs to get money for his own supply &mdash; and the person pushing drugs for commercial gain and who is not involved in taking drugs himself.  We can have absolutely no sympathy for the latter. We must have regard to the condition of the health of any person who suffers <Col N="1115" /> from drug addiction and to their need for treatment but for the person who, for commercial gain, sells these drugs with such devastating consequences for the community we can have no sympathy.  If we provide for life imprisonment instead of the 14 years as set out in the Act, we will favour that type of criminal.  We will look at the section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the original Act refers to:</P>
    <P>... a person who is the occupier or is in control or is concerned in the management of any land, vehicle or vessel and who knowingly permits or suffers any of the following to take place on the land, vehicle or vessel....</P>
    <P>The Act mentions various activities such as the cultivation and preparation of opium and cannabis.  Subsection (2) states that in respect of any person who is in management of such vehicle or vessel it will be presumed by the court that they had knowledge of such activity unless they prove otherwise.  I suggest that the words &ldquo;licensed premises&rdquo; be added there because it appears there are licensed premises where young people particularly get drugs.  In the context of prevention of misuse of drugs every outlet must be looked at and the necessary legislation introduced.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the number of persons charged for possession of cannabis was almost 1,000, for heroin it was 208 and for synthetic narcotics such as dicanol, which appears to be a particular problem in Ireland, it was 76.  For forged prescriptions the number of offences was 19 and the number of persons charged for the importation of drugs was 18.  In respect of the cultivation of cannabis plants 52 people were charged.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill provides for the courts to dispense with their obligation under the present law to obtain a report from a medical doctor or an appropriate authority in respect of a person in possession of drugs.  I accept what the Minister said that where a person is not medically ill or is not involved in addiction it should not be necessary to await a medical report, but where such a report is required perhaps the Minister might look <Col N="1116" /> at the current situation.  I understand that the person who carries out this examination does not always have expert knowledge of the patient or of the misuse of drugs.</P>
    <P>A matter that has not been dealt with by this Government &mdash; it is not necessarily the responsibility of the Minister for Health &mdash; is the whole matter of the involvement of officers of the customs and excise in prohibiting the importation of drugs.  There are about 700 members of the customs and excise who are placed in strategic positions at airports, seaports and along the land frontier.  Most of the drugs that are misused come in either through the airports or seaports or along the land frontier.  Very few of the drugs abused are produced at home, apart from cannabis which is grown here now. Others, particularly heroin, must come from abroad.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why something has not been done to ensure that customs officers have the authority and training to help combat this very serious situation.  It is very surprising that there is no ministerial representative from the Department of Finance on the special task force having regard to the seriousness of the problem and the fact that customs officers are in a position to seize drugs at the point of entry.  Ideally, if we could seize drugs at the point of import, it would considerably lessen the problem and perhaps abolish the more serious aspects.  If we could even seize a percentage of what is coming in it would lessen the work of the Garda Drug Squad and would mean that less damage would be done to individuals and communities. There is no reason why a special drugs squad could not be established amongst customs officers.  At least they should get proper and adequate training to deal with this problem, such as detection equipment, sniffer dogs and anything else necessary to ensure that they play a meaningful role in helping to combat the misuse of drugs.</P>
    <P>The whole question of misuse of drugs highlights the old saying that prevention is better than cure.  Prevention is also better than punishment and any anti-drugs strategy must control supply and <Col N="1117" /> demand.  Sections 8, 9 and 10 up-date the production and processing of drugs. These sections relate to bringing in new drugs under the Bill and increased powers to the Garda in terms of search warrants and arrest, which are very welcome.</P>
    <P>The control of supply depends on the production and processing of the traffic in drugs and I should like to see customs officers taking a more active interest. There should be a unit amongst customs officers which could help to ensure that as much of this illegal trafficking as possible would be stopped at the point of entry.</P>
    <P>Supplies also come from illegal prescriptions and I know the Minister intends to tighten up the law in that regard in section 3.  The penalties for forging illegal prescriptions are increased and it must be looked at carefully to ensure that there is proper supervision of prescription pads so that the number of forgeries will be reduced to a minimum. It is surprising to hear of some of the forgeries which got through the dispensing agent.  Chemists' premises, dispensaries and hospital pharmacies must have maximum security to prevent people breaking and entering.</P>
    <P>Prevention is the ideal answer to the misuse of drugs.  If people get involved, treatment and rehabilitation should be readily available to get them back into the community as quickly as possible. Prevention depends on education and the main treatment facilities are available at the National Drug Advisory Treatment Centre which is doing excellent work. Hospital facilities at Jervis Street are to be moved to Beaumont and, while it is not intended that the drug advisory unit will go there, nevertheless they do not have any indication at this stage as to where they will be located.  It has been recommended that they should be in a centre city location and that would be ideal because the centre city is convenient and people can be moved there quickly.  A unit of that nature should be attractive and the present centre city premises is too small for the work which is being done.  It is important that there is a quick decision as to where the centre will be located and that work will commence <Col N="1118" /> immediately on creating a proper purpose built unit, which is necessary for this work.</P>
    <P>The laboratory which is available is grossly over-loaded, which is causing a serious problem because, if you do not have full laboratory facilities, it is very difficult to monitor patients' progress with regard to measuring the level of the drug in the system either through blood or urine samples.  They need intensive treatment and I ask the Minister to look at the whole question of the centre city premises and say when a decision will be made on it.  It is envisaged that there will be bed accommodation in Beaumont and Saint James's Hospital to cater for the north and south city but it is the day care centre which is important.  These people, who are a danger to themselves and others, have nowhere to go unless they are compulsorily detained in prison. There are no alternative rehabilitation units, apart from Coolmine, Rutland and Usher's Island day centre.</P>
    <P>With regard to rehabilitation, there are voluntary agencies such as Coolmine, Usher's Island day centre and the Anna Liffey centre, which are worthy of support. It is encouraging to see that some public companies are giving financial support to these bodies which are doing such excellent work.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that they have the necessary finance from his Department to enable them to carry out their work.  In Coolmine in 1981 the number of drug abusers contacted was 246 and there were 68 in residence, 85 per cent of whom were from the Dublin area and were abusing morphine or morphine derivatives.  The average age was 21 years.</P>
    <P>The main area of prevention lies in the field of education and it is quite alarming to read some of the studies which have been carried out, for example, the study carried out by the Medico-Social Research Council and the department of community medicine in Trinity College, and reported in 1982.  They carried out a survey of 5,178 post-primary students and discovered that 20 per cent of them had been offered drugs.  Of those under 16 years of age, 25 per cent had friends who used drugs; of those over 16 years of <Col N="1119" /> age, 44 per cent had friends who used drugs.  Forty per cent of the students under 16 and 15 per cent of those over 16 were unable to name a soft drug and 30 per cent of the total were unable to name a hard drug.  This is an indication of the lack of knowledge of the people attending three post-primary schools in the one area.  It is important that there should be a proper level of advice and encouragement available to parents, teachers and the public in general.  People should be informed of the over-use of substances such as alcohol, cigarettes, the drugs covered by this Bill and medicines generally. It is important that the Government should have a comprehensive policy in relation to preventing abuse of these substances, not just a policy in regard to penalties and giving the Garda more powers.  Healthy alternatives should be promoted and people should be encouraged to consider their responsibility for their own health and to adopt a healthy lifestyle.  Leisure activities should be available and I would ask the Government to look at the provision of proper recreation and leisure facilities, not only for people who are liable to over-use these substances but for the many who have leisure time, particularly the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Health education should be an integrated part of the schools' curriculum, including the whole problem of drugs and drug abuse.  The plan for education published by the Department stated that they would encourage health education but the time has come when the Government should look seriously at the whole question of health education, not only in relation to drugs but in relation to the promotion of good health, sex education and the various areas of life which are important.</P>
    <P>The Health Education Bureau believe that the most important and hopeful intervention measure in controlling drug abuse is client orientated community health education and school education. I would compliment the HEB on their work in the field of community health education and their efforts to co-ordinate the approach by doctors, chemists, counsellors, <Col N="1120" /> juvenile liaison officers, social workers and others.  It is of relevance to recognise that in 1982 when Deputy Woods was Minister for Health he allocated an extra £250,000 to the Health Education Bureau, which has not been repeated, for the specific purpose of education in the area of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>There are many recommendations in the report of the Ministerial task force on which we would like to see more progress. The Criminal Justice Bill is going through the House at present and we have also dealt with the customs and immigration controls.  While additional ban-ghardaí have been assigned to the drugs units in Dublin, Cork and Limerick it is important to ensure that the drugs squad is kept up to the necessary strength to cope with this very serious problem.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question by me today regarding progress on the report of the task force the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The recommendation relating to the appointment of one judge of the Circuit Court and one district justice who would have special responsibility for all cases involving drug offences in the Dublin area is being pursued with the appropriate authorities &mdash; so also is the recommendation relating to the appointment of one solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's Office who would specialise in drug offence case work....  The Minister for Education has asked the new Curriculum and Examinations Board to examine the introduction of health education in schools &mdash; at both primary and post-primary levels.  It is also planned to develop the programmes of training in drugs education....</P>
    <P>We should be getting more action rather than matters being pursued or examined. The situation is serious and we should have the necessary facilities to deal with it.  It is not all the responsibility of the Minister for Health but it is important that the Government be seen to be taking the necessary action.</P>
    <P>We are not opposing this Bill but we will have some amendments on Committee Stage.  Because I feel there should be an all-party approach, I should prefer the <Col N="1121" /> Minister to consider some of the points I have raised and perhaps it would be possible to get agreement on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill is welcome in the whole context of endeavouring to tackle the problem of drug abuse and particularly with regard to the question of pushers.  The Minister acknowledged in the course of his remarks that this Bill does not constitute a solution to the problem nor did he offer it in that vein.  I welcome also the tightening of the various definitions of drugs, of places that may be searched and so on, as I do those sections which strengthen the Minister's powers in dealing with rogue doctors.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that his mind was open to improvements of the Bill and that he hoped, in the course of this and Committee Stage, some worth-while proposals for its improvement would emerge.</P>
      <P>I have a number of reservations in regard to one or two sections, for instance, the one which replaces the mandatory remand of persons who have been found guilty of an offence by a discretionary power to remand.  Possibly this is an over-reaction to a recent case.  Perhaps it would be better that the mandatory remand was retained but that, where the Garda or justice concerned considered it necessary, there be power to remand in custody cases such as that which more than likely occasioned the amendment concerned in which a notorious drug pusher absconded while on remand and awaiting sentence.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned also about section 6 which seeks to enable the imposition of a prison sentence on a drug addict on a third offence.  While there is considerable difference of opinion as to whether cannabis is a harmful drug it is generally accepted that an addict who is sent to prison, particularly somebody who has been using cannabis, more than likely will come in contact with hard drug users while in prison and, in some instances, may even come in contact with the drug itself.  For that reason I should like the Minister to reconsider the provisions of that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> The other part of section 6 &mdash; which seeks to replace the maximum sentence of 14 years by that of life imprisonment &mdash; would appear fairly repressive to the general public, a similar move being afoot in relation to the Criminal Justice Bill.  In reality I do not think it will affect the level of sentencing all that much.  I know the Minister for Justice, in dealing with the Criminal Justice Bill, explained that the purpose of providing for life imprisonment was to enable the courts to impose a sentence of up to 25 years but we are not aware, nor have we been told, what is the level of sentencing at present in relation to drug pushers.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with that aspect when replying.  I am in favour of drug pushers being dealt with fairly harshly. But I am concerned also that this House, in the introduction of legislation, is not involved merely in a cosmetic exercise, that not alone should we be seen to be taking action but that that be effective.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the whole question of drug abuse and the fact that this Bill does not constitute a solution to the very serious drug crisis &mdash; nor did the Minister proclaim it to be &mdash; particularly in large urban areas, I should be most anxious that the Minister would give us a detailed report on how far the recommendations of the Special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse have progressed and what concrete action, if any, has been taken as a result.  For example, there were a number of recommendations concerning the provision of research facilities, of aid for areas particularly disadvantaged and at high risk of the dangers of drug abuse.  There were also recommendations with regard to the strengthening of the custom and excise powers for the detection of drugs and the appointment of a district justice to deal with cases more speedily.  I shall be glad to hear from the Minister how far any of those proposals have progressed either in his Department &mdash; where they relate to his area of responsibility &mdash; or others, where, for instance, they may relate to that of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, in so far as it goes, with a number of minor reservations about some sections.  As the Minister will <Col N="1123" /> be aware from previous interventions of mine in this area, I am concerned about the recommendations in the task force report with regard to various agencies, such as the Youth Employment Agency, the Health Education Bureau, AnCO, Cospóir and so on, combining their resources in areas of high risk.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate if any progress has been made in that regard or in the provision of at least one school teacher in various second level schools with the expertise to talk to students about the dangers of the misuse of drugs. Overall the Minister is doing a reasonably good job in this area but the public at large need to know more specifically what is being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the introduction of this Bill which was recommended by the Special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that this debate will add to the public debate on the whole subject of drug abuse.  It is the sort of social problem that could easily carry the ebb and flow of the trend of the early seventies when there was a crisis, not a great one and nothing in comparison with that we have experienced, certainly in Dublin in the eighties.  There was a response to that earlier crisis at that time when controls were introduced and the problem diminished. Then, by and large, we forgot about the dangers and risks of drug abuse.  I should like to think we would have learned a lesson from what happened in Ireland since 1980, particularly in Dublin and Limerick and to be constantly watchful in the future.  On the question of prevention a lot can be done through education and information and having good bridges between young people and the community, young people and their parents and young people and their educational institutions.  The Bill is to be welcomed in that it will focus attention once more on this very difficult social problem which is still of epidemic proportions in this city.  It is leaving a trail of destruction and very often death in its wake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> I was a member of the task force established by the Minister for Health that had its first meeting on 23 April 1983.  In all we had 12 meetings before we reported to the Government.  That was a very hard working ministerial group.  A total of 60 submissions, written and oral, were made to the group from gardaí involved in the drug squad, customs and excise officials, probation and welfare officers, youth and parents groups, and teachers.  It was an extraordinary experience to see and hear the problem of drug abuse here.  It was chilling to hear some of the evidence put before us.  Like others who are not directly involved in the problem of drug abuse at any level one tends to think it is fictional or exaggerated for various reasons but there was no exaggeration or fiction about the submissions made to the task force.  We were made aware of the difficulties that customs and and excise officials experience.  Those officials will be the first to admit that as an island country we have many ports where drugs could be landed, and because of the relaxed approach at our air and sea ports it is very difficult to ensure that hauls of drugs are not brought in here.  An example of the size of hauls that can be brought in was gained at Dún Laoghaire last year. At a time when the task force were receiving submissions a young woman coming through Dún Laoghaire was able to conceal heroin with a street value of £276,000 in a pocket in her jeans.  When challenged and asked if she had heroin she admitted she had and surrendered it. That is an illustration of the difficulties customs and excise officers have.  Apparently, it is very easy to conceal a large quantity of heroin.  When one considers the number of juggernauts and heavy trucks that come here from other countries one can imagine the difficulty involved in minutely examining such vehicles.  Customs and excise officials have a great problem.  They get great help from other EEC countries.  The task force met members of the Pompidou group which operates under the aegis of the Council of Europe and learned that they have a close liaison with our customs and excise officials.  That group is the European watchdog on drug trafficking and <Col N="1125" /> passes on information on criminals involved in the movement and sale of drugs.  It appears that that group is a very effective organisation and is helpful to us and the authorities in the UK, France and Holland.</P>
    <P>Members of the drugs squad outlined their difficulties to the task force and we made submissions accordingly.  One point that came through from the community welfare and social worker groups is worth mentioning &mdash; the idea that drug addiction is a problem of one social grouping seems to have been accepted. I am sure that is because the most up-to-date report available is that which relates to the North City by the Medico-Social Research Board.  That report focused attention on drug issues in Ireland in 1982 and 1983.  However, we heard clear evidence that there is a problem of drug abuse in all Dublin suburban areas.  It is better masked and does not create as great a problem because of the cushion of contacts and of money and the greater understanding or awareness of the parents.  The social facilities exist to make it easier for children in middle class areas to be sent for treatment or to avoid the more critical rigours of the law.  However, it is as likely in suburban middle class Dublin that the sons and daughters of judges or bank managers would be drug addicts as it is in any of the more publicised areas.</P>
    <P>One of the overwhelming feelings I got during and after the meetings of the task force was that there is a need for greater liaison and contact socially between young people, whether they are living in a deprived social area or in the more privileged areas, to have a greater link with the garda, their schools and their parents.  It is important that they know what each of them is doing.  That came through clearly to me at a meeting for parents in my constituency after the task force had reported.  We asked them to come in the belief that they needed to be informed of the facts, to be able to identify difficulties in a family where a child was on drugs.</P>
    <P>As the meeting was about to commence five or six young people sought admission.  We had a difficulty because <Col N="1126" /> the young people were hostile to the idea that they were not being included in the meeting.  This was put to a meeting of about 130 parents who at first were reluctant because they felt inhibited at the prospect of their sons and daughters or the friends of their sons and daughters being present, but eventually the young people were admitted and they joined the meeting. The generation gap was evident.  The parents were trying to understand why the young people needed drugs and were taking them.  They were keen to help young people and to set up structures to prevent drug taking.  Young people resented the fact that they were considered a problem.  At the end the young people entered into dialogue with the parents.  The whole episode indicated a difficulty that could not be dealt with in isolation and that the parent groups and young people's group must work together.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for the streamlining of the procedures for investigating allegations of irresponsible prescribing by medical, dental and veterinary practitioners.  This is to be welcomed.  One of the frustrations that emerged from people who spoke with us in committee was that some doctors &mdash; a minority, I stress &mdash; were prescribing in a very irresponsible way despite cautions and every effort to make them desist.  It is important that procedures to deal with this be made less cumbersome.  A doctor who continues to prescribe controlled drugs knowing full well the effects they are having is as vicious as any drug trafficker. The eventual effect on the victim is the same.  This section is putting into effect provisions for a means less cumbersome than pertains at the moment for the Minister to act in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>My responsibility on the task force was with regard to the Department of Justice. As already noted, one of the recommendations of the task force was that the Garda Drug Squad should have more personnel.  The point was made that ban ghardaí were very useful in this work of detection and the request was made that extra ban ghardaí be allocated to the drug unit.  This has been done.  Another point <Col N="1127" /> was the difficulty of a parent, when he finds or suspects that his child or a neighbour's children are taking drugs, in making direct and confidential contact with the Garda.  It was suggested that a telephone number under drugs should be inserted in the telephone directory.  I thought this a very reasonable request and the Commissioner has agreed to it. It is too late now for the number to be inserted in this year's directory, but in future it will make it easier for people to get direct help.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation relevant to this Bill was that a special district justice and Circuit Court judge should be allocated for work on charges of drug abuse, and this is being pursued at present.  It will be a matter for the President of each court.  These recommendations applied specifically to the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>As is evident time and time again, the Garda have enormous commitment and dedication to the work they are doing, not only in detection of drug abuse but in apprehending those trafficking in drugs, pursuing the amounts of drugs coming into the country and seizing them.  The seizure rate has increased.  The Garda are also very committed to community work. I am very impressed with the work of the Garda.  What is sometimes overlooked is the fact that now a far greater number of gardaí are trained to deal with drug abuse, and not just in the small drug units in various centres.  In all 1,400 members have completed special training courses. In the past three years an intensive training programme has been in operation for each Garda division and a substantial number of members are in advanced training.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Report on Crime 1983</i> gives a breakdown on the misuse of drugs and the number charged in that regard.  It states:</P>
    <P>During 1983 a total of 1,822 persons were charged with offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, this compares with a total of 1,593 persons charged in 1982 &mdash; an increase of 14.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The total number of seizures of controlled drugs in 1983 was 2,278.  In 1982 <Col N="1128" /> the figure was 1,873.  This shows an increase of 21.6 per cent over 1982.</P>
    <P>While there was an increase of 9.1 per cent in the amount of heroin seized, the most significant increase for the year was in the amount of cannabis resin seized, which amounted to 285.86 kilogrammes, compared with 172.67 kilogrammes in 1982, representing an increase of 181.4 per cent.  The largest single seizure of cannabis resin was 300 kilogrammes at Dublin Airport and there was also a very significant seizure of 146 kilogrammes made in Waterford....</P>
    <P>Many notable seizures of drugs were made throughout the year by officers of the Customs Service at various points of entry to the State and their co-operation is very beneficial as almost all drugs abused here are brought into the country.</P>
    <P>Very close liaison and co-operation exists between the Garda and the customs and excise officers.  The indications of the increase in the numbers of seizures last year is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few points on recent suggestions that &ldquo;civilised&rdquo; countries should perhaps consider legalising the use of cannabis or at least taking some of the punitive element out of it.  An article was published in the <i>Garda News</i> of March 1984 entitled &ldquo;Cannabis, a Cultural Poison&rdquo;, by Detective Inspector McGroarty, who is very informed on the whole area of drug abuse in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Cannabis is now recognised globally as the principal debut drug of today's youth and that is the principal reason why the United Nations through its International Narcotics Control Board in their report for 1983, quoted in the article, is so concerned about its proliferation.  The report states:</P>
    <P>There are disquieting signs that in the face of the magnitude of the problem, determination may sometimes be giving way to permissiveness.  Circles in certain countries apparently assume that to permit unrestricted use of drugs, regarded by them as less harmful, would permit better control of other drugs which they deem more perilous <Col N="1129" /> to health.  To adopt such an attitude would be retrogressive.  Parties to the Conventions are not free to select which of the drugs under international control they will restrict exclusively to medical and scientific research.  Parties are obligated to take effective measures for the control of all such drugs in co-operation with other States.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong note of caution in that.  In fairness to our young people, many of whom seem to be under the impression that the taking of cannabis on a regular basis is not harmful, we should caution them that we do not know enough in terms of medical research about the use of cannabis to permit us to make an assessment of how damaging or dangerous it might be.  There is reference also in the <i>Garda News</i> to what Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, President of the Phoenix House Foundation, &ldquo;the largest presidential programme for drug abuse in the United States&rdquo;, had to say.  He said:</P>
    <P>We have treated 15,000 young drug abusers in the past 12 years.  We know how regular use of marijuana (cannabis) affects attention span, concentration and memory.  We have seen the decline in intellectual performance of heavy users, and even regular users. To grow, to develop, to achieve adulthood, adolescents must cope with the emotional storms and squalls of the troubled teenage period.  If they turn to marijuana (cannabis) or to alcohol or other drugs to relieve the anxieties of the moment, then they establish a pattern of escaping rather than dealing with reality.  Marijuana use is self reinforcing. They are not aware of regression nor are they conscious of their sustained immaturity.</P>
    <P>We are not likely to have any serious move here for the legalising of cannabis but the use of this drug is widely accepted by young people.  All the indications are that it is a debut drug so it is important that parents and those who are leaders of opinion realise that there must be no encouragement whatever for young people to use heroin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> Another recommendation of the task force, and one to which Deputy O'Hanlon referred, relates to education. Video films are being developed by the Department of Education in conjunction with the Health Education Bureau for use within the context of life skills.  The duration of these videos is from 12 to 15 minutes and they deal with specific themes such as drug abuse, pressure in relation to drinking, initial failure in a work situation, parental control and loneliness.  These films are very compelling and would make a very good base for moving towards the prevention of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  We cannot take too seriously the problem of drug abuse. Unfortunately, the indications are that the problem is here to stay.  We have a definite responsibility to stem this trend by way of education, by way of legislation, by way of community development and in every other way possible.  We must set in motion the steps for combating the problem.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, too.  It is partly in response to the Government's task force on drug abuse.  That task force was set up in 1982 and reported towards the end of last year.  The Bill represents also the response of the Government and of the Minister for Health in particular to the whole question of bringing about a reduction in the incidence of drug abuse.  The Bill in itself will not eliminate the problem but, taken with the other efforts being made by the Government, it should have the effect of bringing about a reduction in the incidence of abuse in the not-too-distant future.  Drug abuse is one of the most serious problems with which our society has ever had to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the increase in the incidence of drug abuse.  Many more people, too, are being affected indirectly by this problem and it was in the light of this escalation that the Government acted in setting up the task force under the chairmanship of the then Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Fergus O'Brien.  The task force have done very good work in collating <Col N="1131" /> facts.  Up to then various statistics were bandied about and there was an ignorance in relation to the problem.  Indeed, not only among Members here but among the general public, there remains an ignorance of the serious nature of the problem.  Drug abuse is a problem for all of us.  It affects not only those who are using the drugs but also many others because of the various side effects.</P>
    <P>The whole area of drug abuse is a high finance one.  Huge sums of money change hands.  Drugs are sent here from other countries, so there is very big business involved.  It is a business which offers apparent unlimited wealth to those who are prepared to deal in it.  Since in the majority of cases those addicted do not have at their disposal the means with which to service the addiction, they engage in many of the house robberies and other crimes that are all too prevalent. Addicts are not concerned as to how they come by the money so long as they are in a position to buy the drugs and it is this situation which affects so many other people.  As one increases his intake of drugs the greater his dependency becomes and, consequently, the more money he will require to service the habit.  This has resulted in a big increase in the number of robberies committed. The drug problem will become a scourge if we do not tackle it quickly.  I hope that the Bill will be part of a procedure which will reduce the availability of drugs and which will act as a warning to those involved in the drug trade.  It will not be the complete answer to the problem but it will help bring about some improvement.</P>
    <P>The Government task force made certain recommendations.  It is clear that we must do what we can to help people who will respond to treatment.  It is necessary to have full treatment facilities available. The ones that we have in the city centre are very good but whether they will be able to cater for the ever-increasing problem is another question.  Certain other areas should be earmarked for such facilities. At present the main treatment areas are Jervis Street Hospital and Coolmine. Dublin is a very big area and there are <Col N="1132" /> other afflicted pockets in it including the Minister's and my constituency.  There are areas there where the problem is rife despite the great efforts of the Garda Drug Squad and local gardaí.  If something is not done areas which are not yet affected will be affected in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The Government task force looked at the question of education and of explaining the dangers of becoming involved in drug abuse.  Some good drug awareness groups have been set up.  Experts from Jervis Street Hospital and the Coolmine centre talk to parents and residents associations about the problem.  There is a lot of ignorance about the problem but if parents know what to look for the problem can be tackled.</P>
    <P>There must be greater co-ordination between the Department of Health, the health boards, the Health Education Bureau, the Department of Education and other Government Departments which may be involved.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate how the educational programme is developing.  He might let us know how the National Co-ordination Committee on Drug Abuse is proceeding. It was set up towards the end of last year and is to report to the Minister anually.  The Minister might say if there is a representative group on the committee. Has the Minister received their first report?  What recommendations have been made by the committee to date?</P>
    <P>Together with the question of education and youth development there is the question of research into the problem. Drug abuse is more common among young people who initially try them for kicks and then find they are dependent on them.  They slide down the slippery slope, a slide which is often irreversible and results in death.  Youth groups should be made aware of the dangers in relation to drug abuse.  Youth leaders and juvenile liaison officers should be briefed about the problem and know what to look out for.</P>
    <P>As regards section 3 and the committee of inquiry which the Minister is setting up in relation to irresponsible prescribing of drugs, who will be the members of the committee?  Will the committee be set up <Col N="1133" /> following the passage of the Bill or will it be set up at a later date?  Members will be anxious to know if the committee will be representative and have power to act. Will it have linkage with, for example, the Medical Council, the Dental Boards or the Medical Union?  I understand a report will be given to these various bodies but what will the procedure be when the committee go into action?</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the question of the evidential nature of certificates.  Along with other Members of the House I recently paid a visit to the forensic department in the Phoenix Park.  There is only a small group of people there but they do tremendous work on various matters ranging from drug offences to other serious crimes.  The difficulty they found themselves in was that some of their men were attending courts and had to wait for perhaps a couple of weeks to give evidence. The point is they may have spent only two minutes in the witness box, but they had to spend a few weeks at the courts.  During this time their work in the laboratory was falling behind.  This not very large group of men who do a very good job should be facilitated so that they can give evidence by way of certificate. Admittedly, in some cases they may have to attend court, but where possible evidence by certificate should be allowed so that these people will not have to attend courts for two or three weeks at a time, while their laboratory work is falling behind.</P>
    <P>I hope sections 9 and 10 will have the effect of reducing the amount of drugs smuggled into this country.  It must be admitted that drugs are smuggled in in some containers every week, but it must be made clear to shippers and other importers that the importation of goods could be made very awkward.  Admittedly, it would be impossible to search every container but the onus should be on the importers to ensure that their containers are not used to import drugs.</P>
    <P>The Garda Drug Squad are doing a very good job in difficult times and against great odds.  Recently the customs officials called for a customs drugs squad to combat drug smuggling, but I am not sure if that is the answer.  Customs officials <Col N="1134" /> deserve our support and their numbers should be maintained at an adequate level to deal with the problem.  Under sections 9 and 10 importers can be watchdogs and help to keep drugs out of their containers.  It is only by a combination of effort that we will bring about a reduction in the problem.  Obviously we cannot hope to keep all drugs out of the country; a certain amount will be smuggled in.  As Deputies said, a small package of drugs can be worth a vast amount of money. This will encourage criminals to smuggle drugs into this country.  I hope this Bill will be part of the response to combat this problem.</P>
    <P>Another section of this Bill deals with life imprisonment.  This has got press headlines, but I wonder if it is a workable section and if it will have the desired effect.  My hope is that it will discourage people from getting involved in drug pushing.  It is the drug godfathers who make vast sums of money from drug pushing and the section imposing a life sentence is aimed at them.  If these godfathers are arrested and convicted, they should serve a life sentence, not just six or eight years.  A life sentence might sound harsh but what will it mean?  Will it mean eight, ten, 14 or 20 years?  If a justice imposes a life sentence but the criminal serves only a few years, this will defeat the purpose of this section.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us his thinking behind this section and if he is satisfied that it will have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>I would like to touch on the legalisation of cannabis.  The situation was summed up by certain medical experts when they said that for various groups, including epileptics, women of childbearing age, people with heart trouble or with a history of bad drug experiences, there should be a tighter control in the interest of the health and welfare of mankind.  In the March issue of the <i>Garda News,</i> Dr. Desmond Corrigan is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that a drug containing varying amounts of 421 different chemicals, some of which are fat soluble and persist in the body for up to 8 days after a single dose, some of which interfere with basic cell functioning <Col N="1135" /> and some of which affect brain functioning, can be considered harmless to everybody who uses them under all the circumstances of use.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with drugs is that from the first use of certain drugs dependency is not created nor do they have harmful effects, but it is the second, third and fourth uses which start the person on the slippery slope which could lead to death.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will highlight this problem and that the National Co-Ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse, which should be reporting and making representations to the Minister, are making progress in this regard.  I hope that the points made in the Government task force's report and the progress of the force are being evaluated by the Government and that where action is needed and further resources necessary these will be forthcoming.  It is only by a combination of all efforts that this problem will be reduced initially and eventually resolved. This concerns all of us.  Some of us cannot absent ourselves from it and leave it to those medically treating drug abusers or to the Garda Drug Squad to deal with it, because we all have a duty in this regard. The Bill before the House is part of the Government's response to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for giving way.  I welcome this Bill and it is one which the public generally will welcome. Any action against this terrible problem of drug abuse in the community is indeed to be lauded.  I have come from a meeting of the Dáil Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, where we have been considering a different aspect of the problem from that which the Minister addresses in this legislation.  Not enough emphasis has been put, in the Bill, on customs control at point of entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, these drugs are not home grown, although there was a case in my own constituency of a person growing cannabis in the back garden of his neighbour who did not use his back garden very regularly, being somewhat eccentric. <Col N="1136" /> These drugs are mostly imported, and not only are they imported but they are also being exported to a large extent from here to Northern Ireland.  Stronger attention must be paid to customs control. This legislation does not try to address that problem &mdash; perhaps it is more an area for the Minister for Finance since the customs and revenue officers are answerable to him.  As things stand, customs officials have powers of arrest under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876. However, because the penalties under that Act are very mild, the officials depend generally on the Garda to make arrests under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  That often means that a customs officer who suspects someone of having drugs on his or her person must send for a Garda officer and a garda is not located at every point of entry.</P>
    <P>We should consider the customs union's proposal which is, to my knowledge, accepted by the Revenue Commissioners, that there should be an extension of the powers under this legislation to give customs officials the same power as the Garda force in the case of an arrest in connection with drugs. Because this would entail greater powers being given, it would be necessary to include some form of redress for members of the public who might feel unnecessarily embarrassed or abused, for instance because of strip searching.  If we are serious about addressing this problem, we should consider the extension of these powers to customs officials and this certainly would greatly improve the situation.</P>
    <P>Under the Criminal Justice Bill, we had a discussion on what life means.  The Minister for Justice felt that in that case it could mean the period of one's life &mdash; that a person found guilty of certain serious crimes could be sentenced for a period up to the length of his life.  In other words, a sentence of life being substituted for the present one of 14 years' imprisonment would not result in a lesser sentence.  I hope the same definition will apply in this case; otherwise there would be a danger of allowing the term &ldquo;imprisonment for life&rdquo; to be interpreted, as it is at the moment in the courts, as perhaps <Col N="1137" /> only seven or eight years, whereas 14 years' imprisonment is a stiffer sentence. Up to life, at the discretion of the judge, should be the sentence.</P>
    <P>Since we last discussed drug abuse, the sniffer dog that we were promised has not materialised.  I understand that one is on order and one will be trained, but if we are serious about wiping out this problem of drug abuse, we must investigate this area.  Another possibility is what are called x-ray aero-space centres which cost £10 million apiece.  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that at least four of these would be required if we are effectively to examine container traffic coming into the country.  We cannot afford that sort of investment; it is a lot of money.  However, surely we can find the small amount to recruit more than one sniffer dog?</P>
    <P>I hope the section in the Bill dealing with irresponsible prescribing will be rigidly applied.  There is reason to suspect that one or two members of the medical profession &mdash; certainly a very small minority &mdash; have not upheld their oath and medical standards.  In this connection, the Minister might examine the area of the medical card under our health system to see if there is not an incentive there for some doctors to prescribe irresponsibly. If so, there should be penalties against this malpractice.</P>
    <P>The task force referred to by the Minister have suggested the appointment of a judge in the District and Circuit Courts to deal specifically with drug offences, so that there would be more consistent sentencing in these cases.  Otherwise, a person caught in possession of cannabis could get a ten-year sentence and someone found with a larger quantity of heroin could be told merely to leave the country. Such inconsistency baffles the public.</P>
    <P>I understand that legislation is not needed in this instance, that the Department of Justice could take up the matter with the President of the Circuit Court. I hope this is being done.  If all these areas are tackled simultaneously with this legislation, we can make a very definite impression on this problem which is affecting the community.</P>
    <P>This is a timely Bill which I hope will <Col N="1138" /> pass before the Recess and will contribute towards dealing with this terrible problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a very major step towards combating the increased drug abuse problem.  Every concerned person must welcome the Bill on this basis.  Concern has been expressed by various parent groups over the last few years about the increased incidence of drug abuse.  In the Minister's speech we were told that between January 1983 and January 1984 in one centre alone there was an increase of approximately 45 per cent.  If there is one thing the Bill needs to do it is to crack down hard and fast on the perpetrators of the serious problem created among young people.  I am talking about the large scale drug traffickers and the people who have made millions out of the business over the last five years. I am also talking about the people who continue to make millions out of their ill-gotten gains and I am talking about the people who are peddling on the streets, or by any other means, illicit drugs which are very harmful, habit-forming and are being consumed by a section of the population in ever-increasing proportions.  This can only serve as a very stark reminder to all of us how small the problem was a few years ago and how great it is likely to become if it is not stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey was carried out in my constituency among secondary school children. This survey showed the great number of young people who knew a person who had experimented with so-called soft drugs.  It also showed up the great proportion of those young people who knew somebody who had progressed on to the harder drugs and the great number of young people who knew where they could get soft drugs and the more dangerous ones.  Much of it started by what they considered harmless experimentation. They were influenced by some people who indicated that certain drugs were non-habit forming and, therefore, they were harmless, which is untrue. Some people were led to believe that by experimenting with the non-habit forming soft drugs they would not come to any <Col N="1139" /> harm.  The reverse has actually happened because by experimenting with the non-habit forming drugs for a sufficient length of time they found they had to progress to stronger drugs which were habit forming and were very harmful to their health.</P>
    <P>I believe illegal drug trafficking is worth approximately £25 million per annum.  This is a considerable sum of money and gives an exceptionally high lifestyle to those involved in it.  I hope the Bill will put out of the market place the people who are making a vast profit from drug peddling.  If the highly organised drug traffickers are not taken out of the business there is very little chance that the Bill will be a success and that we can reverse the trend established over the last few years.  If the Bill is not a success from that point of view we will have to look for stiffer measures to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>When we talk about sentences and law enforcement we should realise that there is a considerable amount of public concern about the number of cases that have gone to court and the alleged offenders have got off lightly.  It is very difficult to explain to lay people that for technical reasons, or some other reasons, this can happen.  I understand how frustrated people can become when they see this happening.  I hope we will now be able to ensure that we have far better means of bringing those people to justice and when they are brought to justice the measures in the Bill will ensure that they pay the penalty for their crimes.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the apparent nonchalance with which some commentators refer to soft drugs.  On a television programme some time ago when a certain person was asked if he had experimented with drugs he quite calmly informed the public that he had.  That may be very honest and may seem to be very bland before an audience but it is extremely harmful from the point of view of young impressionable people who take this as the accepted practice, like smoking cigarettes. That is a very dangerous slant to present and we should all be very wary of it.  I notice one of my colleagues, Deputy Alice Glenn in the House.  She is <Col N="1140" /> a member of the same health board that I am a member of.  In the past we have heard even members of the medical profession saying that alcohol was bad, was habit forming and there were serious social side effects to it.  In the same breath we have heard them deal with drug abuse.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise the dangers inherent in the consumption of alcohol but I have to emphasise also that by speaking of that being on the same scale as the drug abuse we have in the country at the moment, is simplifying the matter.  We should accept that we have a growing problem and we should also accept that it is no longer confined to our major cities but is spreading out in to the suburbs.  I believe that is happening because of a crackdown by the drug squads in the centre city areas and drug peddlers are forced out into some of our newly developed suburbs in order to peddle their wares.  There they find a very vulnerable population.  In a newly developed area there are young people and teenagers in blocks of houses, as opposed to an older established area.  This is the style of their operation.  They approach their targets, or their business, from that point of view.  They know there is an age-group in a particular area and that there is a market there, and they move in with all haste to make all the profit they can.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to come to grips with a problem which has reached crisis point.  I hope we will not receive deputations from various quarters asking us to water down any aspect of the Bill.  The time has come for us to face facts and reality, and to accept that, as legislators, we have a duty to all our law-abiding citizens.  I welcome the Bill. I hope it will eliminate the drug pushers and peddlers from the market place, and eventually eliminate the drug abuse problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally agree with any measures which are necessary to ensure that there is a crackdown on the drug problem which is now so prevalent in our country.  We have an appalling problem of drug addiction and drug peddling particularly in the city of Dublin.  All <Col N="1141" /> steps necessary must be taken to ensure that there is no incentive for drug pushers to continue in that business and that they are adequately and severely punished for the crimes they commit.  Drug pushers are common murderers.  Many deaths result from their actions.  They are as guilty as murderers are and should be treated as such, and the punishment should fit the crime.</P>
      <P>We have an appalling problem in our capital city.  Last year the prevalence of heroin addiction in a north central Dublin area was 12 per cent in people between the ages of 15 and 19 years.  Rather horrifyingly the figure for females was worse than the equivalent figure some five years ago in a New York negro ghetto.  These are frightening statistics, and they should make us all aware of our responsibility to ensure that every attempt is made to get rid of the evil godfathers who are the cause of these crimes.  It has been estimated that hard drug dependency in Dublin adolescents is around 10 per cent. Others have challenged this figure, but no one has challenged the basic point which is that Dublin is a fairly severely drug scarred city.  It is our duty to ensure that that scar is removed.</P>
      <P>Some months ago we were all appalled at a decision taken in our courts.  A non-national was convicted of heroin pushing and sentenced to 14 years. Because he was a non-national he was offered deportation and he availed of it. This was unfortunate because it gave a clear message to the international drug racketeers that if convicted here of heroin possession or heroin smuggling, with a bit of luck they could be deported.  This is an appalling indictment of our judicial system in that instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the use of soft drugs.  Attempts are made by some, including, unfortunately, a tiny minority within the medical profession who should know better, to suggest that soft drugs are harmless.  These people have very liberal views on many matters and they try to suggest that cannabis and marijuana are not dangerous drugs, that they might not do any harm and might not lead on to more serious consequences, that they might not be addictive <Col N="1142" /> or cause dependency.  Those suggestions by those liberals do not stand up against all the evidence we have before us.</P>
    <P>In the era of pre-modern medical science, cannabis had a sort of glamorous aura.  It was considered a panacea for all problems from constipation, to mania, to dandruff, to gonorrhoea.  In the days of old folk medicine they even gave it to hens to see if they would lay more eggs. This was a pile of rubbish.  It did not cure any of those problems.  It did not even work on the hens.  Modern medical science accepts that cannabis is a dangerous drug of itself.  Let us not run away from that fact.  It leads many young people down the slippery slope towards the permanent abuse of hard drugs and ultimately disaster.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that many hard drug users start with cannabis.  This is where they are initiated into the use of drugs.  Cannabis of itself has no medical value as a treatment for any disease.  In its obscure pharmaceutical combination of a variety of chemical formulae it has very damaging chemical influences on those who take it.  You can have withdrawal symptoms, de-personalisation, sensory distortion, a diminishing of ability, a lessening of ambition and poor motivation.  These are all manifest effects of cannabis on individuals.</P>
    <P>Rather peculiarly, after a person takes cannabis for the first time, it takes less of the drug each time afterwards to produce the same effect.  This is known as the phenomenon of reverse tolerance.  Clear and definite scientific medical research has indicated that its use leads to atrophy or shrinkage of the brain.  Two well known medical experts, Hefer and Frandsen, cite studies on young cannabis addicts who died, as showing that they had shrinkage or atrophy of the brain equivalent to that which is normal for a 90 year old person.  The expert view of the medical scientists who have given us that evidence must be accepted.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that it was an aphrodisiac but that is not so because it affects adversely both the sexual desire and performance.  It causes many other severe medical conditions.  It increases the chronic obstruction of air passages <Col N="1143" /> and a person who is a blue bloater or a puffer will certainly get worse if he takes cannabis.  A person with a propensity to heart disease will increase his chances of making that disease worse if he takes cannabis and it also increases the tendency to develop cancer.  We should not fall into the trap which is being laid for us by those liberals who suggest cannabis is harmless.  It should continue to be regarded as a dangerous illegal drug and people who use it or who attempt to promote its use among the public should suffer accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has given us a knowlegeable discourse on this subject that cannot leave anyone in doubt about the damaging effects of cannabis.  Those who suggest to young vulnerable people that they can indulge in this with impunity are doing them a great disservice.  I welcome the Bill and I look forward eagerly to seeing it implemented.  The kind of sentences and the punishments the Minister has in mind must be seen as a deterrent to the godfathers.</P>
      <P>The Dublin central constituency which I represent has been indentified as an area where the problem has taken a grip to a much greater extent than elsewhere throughout the country.  It flourished in areas that had definite economic problems, that suffered deprivation, where there were poor educational opportunities and where there were many broken homes.  In many cases all of these factors led to young people grasping at any outlet and then they were caught up in a system where they were becoming pushers of drugs, thus leaving themselves open to all kinds of punishments and any hope of having a meaningful life.  I should like to pay tribute to the work that has and is being done by the Drug Squad, the clergy, teachers and concerned parents. Without their tireless efforts in the past two years the problem would be much worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Mitchell, I have just come from a meeting with representatives of the Customs and Exise.  They met the Committee on Crime, Lawlessless and Vandalism to speak specifically about the <Col N="1144" /> drug problem and they made some interesting and worth-while points.  They are a workforce of almost 700 men and they do not think they have been utilised to the best advantage.  All of us agree that if drugs are apprehended at the point of entry before they get to the streets where the &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; merchants have a network, regardless of the damage they are doing, it is very difficult for the Garda, the Drug Squad or anyone else to deal with the problem.  Once the drug is on the streets it is difficult to catch the culprits.</P>
    <P>The representatives of the Customs and Excise complained that because of inadequate personnel and resources they were not able to deal with their normal duties and because of that the Exchequer is losing hundreds of thousands of pounds.  They reminded us that in his budget address the Minister for Finance indicated that whatever resources were required to make them an efficient and effective force would be found.  I take heart from that.  If these people are to be used in the detection of drugs at the point of entry, it will be necessary for us to spend money.  For instance, they need facilities to search suspected people.  As one representative pointed out, drugs can be swallowed and I was amazed when I heard of a person who had swallowed 15 lbs. of one substance.  I found that difficult to believe but I was assured the case is on record.  It took seven days while the person was detained for the drugs to be delivered through the natural process. The Customs and Excise staff must be given every facility to help in the detection of drugs.</P>
    <P>They also pointed out the difficulty of examining container traffic, one of the most successful ways of bringing in drugs. They need equipment to deal with this matter.  At the moment they have one sniffer dog in training.  If we are serious about tackling the problem of detecting drugs at the point of entry we will have to do much more.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister &mdash; I know I am pushing an open door &mdash; that he consult with the Minister for Finance to ensure that the necessary resources be made available to the Customs and Excise <Col N="1145" /> people.  I am told that some kind of order is required from the Minister.  Under the 1876 Act the Customs and Excise people were given authority to apprehend, arrest and search, but because of some order implemented in 1977 the penalties they can impose are minimal compared to what could be imposed if the Garda apprehend the culprit.  This Bill will exacerbate the situation.  We should reconsider the matter in order to bring in the Customs and Excise people and give them the necessary authority to apprehend and hold suspected people.  At the moment they carry out searches but they must then call for the Garda Síochána.  In that interval the stuff can be swallowed or passed to a second person.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago at their conference prison officers were quite explicit that prisoners have no difficulty in getting drugs.  I do not know how this can happen but I suppose they are passed by visitors. This is a very serious situation.  A person could go to prison for an offence that was not drug-related and then find himself in the company of others who may persuade him to get into the drug habit.  If they get into the habit of taking drugs it is very difficult to stop.  I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill.  He has my support and that of every Member of the House and the sooner it is implemented the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing this Bill but I do not believe that it goes far enough.  I am a man of extreme beliefs in relation to law and order and this comes into that field. I abhor the drug scene and I believe it is out of control.  It is very satisfying to see the Minister and the House accepting that we have a dreadful problem.  We have lost the battle in the criminal area and the measures which have been taken recently were taken too late and it is reassuring to know that the Minister is fully aware of the burgeoning situation in regard to drugs.  There is gang warfare in the city of Dublin because of the rewards involved in drug trafficking.  Recently, several murders occurred in the city as a result of gang warfare and it is very disillusioning to know that there are men <Col N="1146" /> prepared to kill because of drugs and the rewards which they yield.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem is our acceptance of soft drugs, particularly alcohol.  There is a social acceptance of alcohol.  Some members of the medical profession, albeit a very small number, have been guilty of over-prescribing and causing dependence on soft drugs, especially in regard to prescribing for women.  That has sown the seeds for the growing acceptance of drugs and the medical profession should curtail it in their own interests as well as those of the people they serve.</P>
      <P>The clergy should also be more involved in the drug question and teachers should go on courses so that they can hold weekly classes to instruct young children in their formative and impressionable years of the absolute horror and misery that addiction to drugs can produce. Dependency on heroin is living death and the most extreme measures should be introduced to counteract it.  Unfortunately, one of the drawbacks of a democracy is that it allows liberalism to flourish. I am liberal in certain areas but, in some ways, liberalism is the scourge of this country because it seeks to equate good with evil.  As far as drugs are concerned, liberals should not be allowed to be heard because surely nobody in his right senses can condone the taking of drugs, soft or hard?  In other countries, drug pushers are dealt with summarily by being shot and there is little or no drug pushing.  I am not advocating that penalty here because it would not be accepted but, unfortunately, there will be commissions and inquiries and the problem will worsen and get out of control as in the case of law and order.  People who are convicted of heroin pushing should get life imprisonment and they should not be let out in seven or eight years.  The key should be thrown away, although I suppose I will not get much support for that suggestion.  However, the problem is so serious that it warrants life imprisonment. Otherwise the drug situation will escalate out of control and more and more people will be living off the backs of unfortunate and impressionable young people.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> For many years, the clergy were the bulwark in the Pioneer movement in the fight against excessive alcoholism.  They recognised the terrible dangers which alcohol represented and they should make it part of their business to involve themselves at school level in the problem of drugs.  They should give instruction to children even at a very early age on the evils of drugs.  I hope the Minister will update this Bill in the remaining years of the Government.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief and I hope that the Minister will have sufficient time to conclude Second Stage.  This Bill has been debated at length and I do not wish to cover points which have already been made.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with drug tests which are regarded as lawful in this country. I am referring to a death which took place recently in Dublin as a result of testing a drug for combating heart disease. I am sorry that the Bill being introduced does not contain firm proposals which would cover the areas which I mentioned in a Private Notice Question. There are people here, regarded as the down and out section of our community, drop outs and so on, who are being subjected to tests of drugs which have not been fully tested and I consider that to be misusing drugs.  This Bill fails to incorporate proper legislation in regard to tests being carried out on people.  This matter was raised by way of Private Notice Question by myself, Deputy De Rossa and others.  I asked whether legislation would be introduced to control this testing.  The tests are carried out in accordance with guidelines agreed between the National Drugs Advisory Board and the medical profession.  Be that as it may, there has already been one death.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I understand that people have been seriously affected <Col N="1148" /> by some of these drug tests.  I further understand that on occasions correspondence is sent to people living in hostels kindly run by the Salvation Army and other generous bodies, informing them that money is available if they allow drug tests to be carried out on their bodies. That certainly is a misuse of drugs and a misuse of power by the multinational drug companies.  I abhor this practice.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a very wide brief and I appreciate the enormity of the problems which confront him.  I do not believe anybody could put more effort into the job but he should seriously consider introducing rigid regulations and laws to prevent tests being carried out on these people.  I have been informed that these tests do not happen on isolated occasions. I understand that after a period of, say, four months a further test is carried out. It may take some time for the effects of the first test to wear off and such effects may still be present when the further test is carried out.  The combination of effects could be seriously detrimental.  People who are caught in the poverty trap, some of whom may be borderline alcoholics or drug addicts, may be prepared to go forward for these tests.  This should not be allowed to happen unless specific regulations and guidelines are laid down by the Department of Health.  I call on the Minister to introduce these regulations and I intend to pursue the matter further.  Multinational drug companies are in the business of making money and are not particularly concerned about the effects on private individuals. We must be very careful about what we will allow to happen.</P>
      <P>The Customs and Excise section should have a special drugs squad working to detect the importation of drugs. There has been a sizeable number of detections of people involved in drug trafficking and smuggling.  The growth in drug trafficking might be halted by the establishment of a customs drug squad.  The misuse of drugs is an enormous problem and I welcome the Minister's efforts to tackle it.</P>

      <P>I wish to make several points.  I welcome any measure which highlights the very serious heroin problem in this city.  Whether the contents of this amending legislation will go any way towards dealing with that problem is a different matter, but I accept the need to update the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  The first point in the report of the Government Task Force published last September was that a Bill to amend that Act would be brought before the Oireachtas and I welcome the fact that this is now happening.  I regret to say that very little else in the task force report has so far been implemented.  Very many worthwhile recommendations made by the task force, which would go a great deal of the way towards dealing effectively with the drug problem in Dublin and throughout the country, have not been implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to take immediate action, as a matter of urgency, to revive the building and construction industry.</P>
      <P>The construction industry has been starved of funds deliberately since this Coalition Government came into office and is now in deep recession of crisis proportions.  No other sector of our economy has suffered to the same extent. Yet the attitude of the Government to the industry is one of total indifference and continuing neglect.</P>
      <P>Twelve months ago this House debated a Fianna Fáil motion calling on the Government to recognise the serious jobs crisis in the construction industry and urged the introduction of urgent measures to stimulate the private and public sectors in order to avoid the collapse of the industry.  Time has shown that our concern then was well founded.  Unfortunately, our warnings went unheeded and during the last year the industry has suffered a further 13 per cent contraction in activity.  If present Government policies are not changed radically this dangerous trend will continue.  All the economic indicators continue to reflect the rapid decline in construction activity. The major fear now is the danger of a more accelerated rate of decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction industry has a workforce of approximately 125,000, of which some 45,000 are now unemployed.  Men who have worked all their lives in the building trade are idle.  Youth training in the skills of the various trades have no <Col N="1151" /> prospect of work and apprenticeships are practically impossible to get.</P>
    <P>The importance of Government economic policies and their implications for the industry have never been more crucial to its survival.  Yet we see the Government cutting back severely on public capital expenditure, introducing measures calculated to reduce the level of private investment in the industry.  It is well known that both the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance are of the belief that it is wrong for the State to support construction in times of recession.  Their steadfast adherence to this mistaken belief is the major obstacle to change in Government policy.  It seems that the socialist Minister for the Environment, Deputy Kavanagh, is failing at the Cabinet table to win greater State investment for this industry in the same way that his predecessor, the present Tánaiste, also failed.  The Labour Party is seen now to talk with two tongues. During the recent election campaign their chairman, Senator Michael D. Higgins, called for greater State investment to reduce unemployment in Europe, while at home his party in Government have been cutting the volume of State capital investment in construction by 25 per cent in the two years 1983 and 1984 to date.  The contradictions inherent in the present Government have resulted in the neglect of major sectors of our economy due to indecision and failure to implement any planned strategy. It is clear that the Labour call for increased investment does not find favour with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  We end up falling between two stools with no policy for the future.</P>
    <P>The role of an Opposition party must be to highlight inadequacies in Government performance and to demonstrate how their policies would succeed if in Government.  In this case there is hardly any need to demonstrate that Government policies are having a detrimental effect on the construction industry as the crisis is now a matter of common knowledge. To see the extent of the crisis one need only examine the level of unemployment in the industry.  As I have <Col N="1152" /> already said, the construction industry has a workforce of approximately 125,000, of whom some 45,000 are now unemployed.  This trend of increasing numbers of unemployed persons in building and construction has been prevalent since 1979.  In 1979 there were 19,900 unemployed in this industry.  In 1980 that figure had increased by 8 per cent to 21,500.  The following year it increased by 29 per cent to 27,800; in 1982 it increased by 21 per cent to 33,500; in 1983 by a further 21 per cent to 40,500; and the latest figures, for March 1984, show 45,302 people unemployed, constituting an increase of 9 per cent or 4,654 on the March 1983 figures.  Figures published by the Government in May of this year show that approximately 13,000 people have lost their jobs in building and construction firms in the private sector since this Government came into office.</P>
    <P>Sales of cement are another strong indicator of the level of activity in the industry and they have been showing a continuous drop since 1979.  For example, in 1979 cement sales amounted to 2,067,000 metric tonnes; in 1980 the figure was 1,815,000 metric tonnes, constituting a drop of 12 per cent; in 1981 there was a standstill in cement sales.  In 1982 there was a drop of 18 per cent in cement sales to 1,486,000 metric tonnes.  In 1983 there was a drop of a further 7 per cent to 1,383,000 metric tonnes, and for 1984 the projection is a drop of 5 per cent to 1,300,000 metric tonnes.  In the first four months of this year cement sales were down approximately 7 per cent on the corresponding figures for the first four months of 1983, the actual figure being 374,000 metric tonnes.</P>
    <P>Present policy can be assessed by studying Government decisions regarding public capital programme allocations and expenditure.  The Public Capital Programme fell by 16 per cent in 1983 and is expected to fall by 9 per cent this year, that is, on the basis of the Public Capital Programme published at the beginning of the year.  However, it has become clear already that the funds allocated are not to be spent at the rate they were last year. Exchequer returns for the first quarter of <Col N="1153" /> 1984 showed that the Local Authority Loans Fund was down 24 per cent in money terms when compared with the same period last year.  In addition voted capital services were down 9 per cent in money terms, equivalent to 15 per cent in volume.</P>
    <P>If further evidence is needed of the serious decline in the construction industry one need only examine the figures for new house completions.  In 1981 there were 28,917 houses built.  In 1982 that figure had dropped to 26,798 and, in 1983, it had dropped to 26,138.</P>
    <P>A disturbing feature of the new Housing Finance Agency loans is that the number of loans for new houses comprises 49 per cent only of the total.  With over 50 per cent of the agency's funds going to second-hand housing the question must be posed as to whether it should be included at all in the public capital programme, because there can be no way that money for second-hand housing represents new investment.</P>
    <P>Another disturbing feature is that despite the introduction of the Housing Finance Agency the number of new house loans being provided in 1983 by that agency, and under the Small Dwellings (Acquisitions) Act, at 5,603 was more than 500 units down on the figure for 1982.  SDA loans approved for new houses during the same period fell from 4,920 to 3,592, a fall of 1,300 units.  The figures for the first quarter of 1984 show that the trend is continuing with the number of loans down 16 per cent on the same period last year.</P>
    <P>The high level of unemployment, and the continuing drop in output and investment, as illustrated in the figures quoted, are clear evidence that this important sector of the economy is in serious trouble and urgently in need of Government action to reverse the dangerous trend.  The National Planning Board in their Proposals for Plan 1984-87 published in April this year, recognised the extent of this problem and the need for further action when they stated:</P>
    <P>The present level of unemployment among building and construction workers represents a waste of manpower <Col N="1154" /> that should be utilised as far as possible within the financial constraints to provide productive infrastructure. While this cannot be done without net additional cost to the Exchequer it should be done in such a way that the extra cost is kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the National Planning Board specifically recommended increased capital investment in the construction industry and deemed it appropriate to finance productive projects by foreign borrowing.  I am very pleased they have made this recommendation. It fully supports the views expressed by Fianna Fáil in the debate on the construction industry in 1983 and completely refutes the attitude of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, who was adamant that any further investment of public money in the construction industry would be simply compounding the problems, postponing the ultimate solution and making them all the more difficult to solve.  He said on that occasion that the Opposition may take it that he would not be party to such an approach.</P>
    <P>Looking back at those remarks some 12 months later it is disturbing to see that not alone did we not get the increase in investment that we were encouraging then and which he so adamantly opposed but the Government did not even spend the amount allocated in the public capital programme and about 10,000 people have lost their jobs in this industry. Surely, that was an extraordinary statement for a so-called socialist.  All our pleadings of last year for increased public capital investment and an introduction of tax and other incentives for private capital investment, were ignored.  Yet we see the Government's own National Planning Board supporting the moves we urged last year.  I should like to quote from the report of the National Planning Board:</P>
    <P>(ix)  The area in which projects are most likely to meet the criteria set out in Chapter II.4 on <i>Public Investment Planning</i> is the backlog of road, bridge and by-pass construction recommended in the <i>National Road Development Plan</i> (1982).  Less than one per <Col N="1155" /> cent of GNP has been spent annually on road building over the last ten years, despite the increase in the level of traffic congestion.  The amounts allocated to road works in 1982, 1983 and 1984 have not been large enough to prevent the backlog of investment documented in the 1982 <i>National Road Development Plan</i> from increasing. The Board are of the view that a much higher level of investment in roads than is at present being undertaken could be justified using the public sector investment appraisal techniques outlined in chapter II.4.  To the extent that the commencement of essential road works is more constrained by delays in planning, public hearings and the issuing of compulsory purchase orders than by a shortage of funds, pressures could be eased by legislation streamlining the entire process by which major public works projects are undertaken.</P>
    <P>(x)  It would be appropriate to finance projects which met the criteria set out in Chapter II.4 in full &mdash; that is, which were productive &mdash; by foreign borrowing.  To the extent that road development projects do not meet those criteria in full, their cost should be met by reducing the level of expenditure on other headings in the PCP which have (a) a higher import content, (b) a lower domestic labour content, and (c) commit the State to substantially higher additional current spending in the future than would road construction.</P>
    <P>(xi)  It is not easy to identify areas of capital spending other than road building that would meet the criteria in Chapter II.4.  However, over the current year and into 1985 it is very likely that substantial items in the PCP would fail to meet this requirement by an even larger margin than would an increased allocation to certain labour intensive/low import content headings. In the absence of detailed input-output studies of the capital programme, it is not possible to identify such items precisely, but the Board recommend that as a first step an additional £20 million <Col N="1156" /> be made available in 1984 for headings such as the provision of serviced sites for housing development, the construction of sporting facilities, leisure centres and related community facilities (such as pre-schools and health centres).  The money should be found by reducing the allocation to headings in the PCP, which have a high import content.</P>
    <P>(xii)  The goal of this accelerated infrastructural programme should be to reemploy an additional 1,000 persons in the first twelve months.  In the following twelve months, the programme should be on a scale that would create additional employment for 4,000 persons.</P>
    <P>I thought it important to put that quotation on the record so that we can refer to a Government agency that has authoritatively refuted the type of ridiculous answers we have been getting consistently from Government Ministers, that they will not agree to any further investment in this industry.  The Government's own National Planning Board are now recommending that.  I accept that it is a very timid recommendation but it is a positive one.  Is it too much to hope that the Government might now take the action we recommend and which so obviously has the support of their own planning board?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in agreeing with the board's recommendation for an increase in the 1984 PCP expenditure feel that the industry needs an immediate injection of £200 million, not just £20 million.  That would create 10,000 jobs.  Approximately £120 million of the investment would return to the State through a reduction in social welfare costs and an increase in tax revenue.  Expenditure at this level would quality for EC grant aid of between 20 per cent and 40 per cent of the project cost.  Fianna Fáil are firmly committed to the investment of an extra £200 million in construction programmes immediately on return to office.</P>
    <P>This debate is taking place at our insistence to highlight the present problem and in the expectation that the merited response will be forthcoming from the Government.  We await with keen interest <Col N="1157" /> the reply of the Minister and hope for something more responsible and substantial than the Tánaiste's response to last year's debate which consisted of a speech prepared some hours before the debate started and did not make any reference to the positive suggestions made by Fianna Fáil.  That speech completely ignored the serious problems that were being discussed and was mostly an irrelevant political tirade ignoring the Government's own responsibilities to adopt policies to deal successfully with the industry's problems and forgetting the Government parties' commitment to the electorate on which their mandate was based.</P>
    <P>I am not encouraged to see that so far tonight we have not had present in the House the person who carries responsibility for the industry, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Kavanagh.  It is a feature of the Government that Ministers absent themselves from debates of major importance to their briefs.  It is another indication of disinterest and the lackadaisical approach of Ministers to serious problems for which they carry responsibility.  It is not the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien.  He does not sit at the Cabinet table with other members of the Government. He is not involved in making any of the decisions that have affected the industry and contributed so greatly to the increase in the number unemployed in the industry.</P>
    <P>It has become popular for members of the Government to dismiss their failures with the excuse that there is a serious recession, that the Government do not have any money, cannot do anything and the Opposition will always be complaining and cannot offer any solutions to the problems.  That is the standard response trotted out to any serious discussion we have sought to create here or outside on the problem of the construction industry and the dire crisis it is in.  This negative attitude on the part of the Government is frightening.  It is a policy of despair and it is having a demoralising effect on our people.  It is making the young, and the not so young, very cynical of politics and politicians and represents a potential <Col N="1158" /> threat to our democratic system.  The widespread apathy so evident in the recent elections to the European Parliament is largely the result of the Government's attitude, their lack of policies, concern and general complacency.  To be crowing over who won what seats in an election where less than 50 per cent of the citizens bothered to vote is a vain exercise and ignores the real message from the people.</P>
    <P>If the Government and the institutions of State continue to ignore the problems confronting our people there is the danger that impetuous youth and others may seek more extreme solutions on the fringes of democracy as we have known it.  It is no policy for the Government to say that the Opposition have no solutions, no positive suggestions on how to deal with the difficulties in the economy, in this case concerning the construction industry.  I want to anticipate that kind of response because I am becoming accustomed to the gist of what the scriptwriters have been putting before the Minister and which the Minister has been regurgitating here in Dáil debates.  For that reason I want to repeat briefly some of the positive suggestions that I have made in previous debates here.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister previously to promote actively joint venture housing but he took no new initiative in that area. Were he to empower local authorities to provide land at a nominal cost per site I have no doubt that many of the 33,000 families on local authority waiting lists would participate in joint venture schemes to provide housing for themselves. We got a big silence to that proposal. I also asked the Minister to initiate equity sharing schemes which I believe would result in an additional 5,000 new houses per annum being built, 7,000 man-years of employment, £70 million extra cash into the Exchequer and 1 per cent GNP growth.  I elaborated on the mechanics of this scheme at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis in February.  My proposal for the introduction of a co-ownership scheme was well received in the industry and commented on favourably in the media, but did not evoke any response from the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, <Col N="1159" /> who has failed to take any major initiative himself since his appointment.</P>
    <P>I also asked the Minister on another occasion to initiate a scheme whereby deposit interest on special savings such as building society savings accounts be relieved of Government tax as the money is eventually invested in construction and helps to boost the economy and provide employment.  I have received no response yet to that suggestion.  I have asked the Minister to introduce new incentives to encourage investment in construction projects particularly in the residential building sector where the demand far exceeds the supply.  I pointed to the success of the Fianna Fáil 1981 Act section 23 incentive which provided possibly up to 10,000 jobs in the construction industry. The response to that suggestion was to so modify the section 23 incentive as to restrict the incentive radically for private investors and practically render it useless.  This action above all others has given a clear indication of the Government's attitude to private investment in construction.  They are opposed to incentives of this kind.  Indeed, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Alan Dukes, is known to have told a group of businessmen that he considers the 1981 section 23 incentive to be immoral.  Because of this conscientious moral judgment up to 10,000 unemployed construction workers had to tell their wives and young children that they would have less food on their tables and less money to buy clothes and shoes and that any little plans for holidays or leisure pursuits would all have to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>On another occasion I asked the Minister to relieve the industry of the heavy taxation burden which was a serious dis-incentive to private investment in construction, especially as it was evident that private investment had already dropped by 50 per cent in the period 1979-82.  The response to that suggestion has been to impose new and increased levels of taxation, thus increasing costs and causing further unemployment.  Among the Government measures introduced in 1983 and 1984 affecting the construction <Col N="1160" /> industry are the following: the list is fairly long and it is not a full list.</P>
    <P>They increased the VAT rate, planning charges, and development levies.  They introduced a new residential property tax.  They increased the PRSI costs for employers in the construction industry and other industries.  There was the withdrawal of the construction industry from the Employment Incentive Scheme, the abolition of the residence-related tax incentive scheme, the decision by the Government to reduce the mortgage interest relief and the exclusion of the industry from the new risk venture capital incentive scheme.  That list alone is sufficient evidence of this Government's anti-development attitude.  It is sufficient proof, if proof is required, of this Government's desire to reduce the level of private investment in the construction industry.  Yet the standard reply from the Minister when challenged on the continuing decline in output, employment and investment in this industry is: &ldquo;Ah, the private sector should be putting more into it.  You cannot expect the State to keep bolstering up the construction industry to compensate for a withdrawal of private investment&rdquo;.  What the devil do you expect only withdrawal of private investment when the Government themselves are introducing substantial new measures which are acting as a disincentive to investment, which are forcing people not to invest in this industry, instead of having a positive approach and introducing new incentive rates which would bring more money into the industry?</P>
    <P>It has been very difficult for anybody who is in any way concerned about the high level of unemployment and lack of activity in construction to understand the Government's mentality in this matter.  If it was Government policy to replace private investment completely with State investment, which would be pure socialist theory, then one could understand the logic in bringing in these penalties against investment by private individuals in construction; but it seems that that is not stated Government policy or intention. It is very hard to establish whether there is any policy or strategy or whether the <Col N="1161" /> Government even know where they are going or understand the effects of the measures they are introducing.  If the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, sticks to his prepared script probably he will say that £3 out of every £4 in the construction industry is coming from the State, that this is not good enough, that there must be more private investment in the industry. We agree that there must be more private investment, but the Minister must understand that people will not invest and risk their money if there is no return. It is all right for the Minister to stay there and not be affected by the outcome of these measures personally; but he must accept that they are having a detrimental effect on an industry which has given employment to up to 125,000 people and are driving money away from the industry.</P>
    <P>Therefore, again we wish to avail of this debate to appeal to the Government to reverse their policies, to abolish many of the new disincentives they have introduced and to come forward with positive proposals along some of the lines we have suggested, or to come up with their own suggestions; but we get no new ideas from the Government.  They are absolutely bereft of ideas and, it seems, of interest and it is incumbent on us as an Opposition party to haul them in here and make them listen to the problems they are creating and make them appreciate the extent of these problems and the poverty they are creating in so many homes throughout this land.  The Government sit idly by.  All of last year and, it seems, all of this year they have given no indication of their intention to do anything to reverse the disastrous trend.  I do not know how long the Government are going to sit and do nothing.  Are they going to wait until some of the biggest firms in the country collapse and come down around their ears?  Nearly every month numbers in this industry are becoming unemployed equivalent to the number who became unemployed in the Ford factory in Cork.  Up to 800 a month are losing their jobs.  There is no outcry from the Minister, no expression of regret or concern at the extent of the damage that his Government's policies <Col N="1162" /> are having.  He is washing his hands of them in Pontius Pilate fashion and claiming there is nothing he can do.</P>
    <P>There are things he can do.  We in Opposition have suggested some of them.  Some are already known to be very successful in other countries and could result in massive investment and the creation of thousands of new jobs here without the State having to make any major contribution, but we have received no positive response.  In the absence of the Minister tonight it seems that we will not get any great response to this debate, but we will wait until the debate concludes tomorrow night before we say anything about that.</P>
    <P>On coming into office one of the first steps taken by the Government was to reduce the public capital programme by £220 million to £1,890 million and to renege on the commitment to invest an additional £100 million in the construction industry.  These two decisions resulted in a loss of £320 million to the industry at that time &mdash; all during 1983 &mdash; but the position was further aggravated when the Government reduced public capital expenditure during 1983 by a further £150 million.  It is well to remember that the original Fianna Fáil budget allocation for the 1983 Public Capital Programme was £2,110 million. The Coalition reduced the budget allocation to £1,890 million but the actual expenditure outturn of the public capital programme was only £1,740 million in 1983.  In all, therefore, the Government left the industry short £470 million on expected capital investment during 1983. The industry has been struck a mortal blow by the Government and has little hope of reviving unless the Government take some positive steps at an early date.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the House looks forward with great interest to hearing what the Government intend doing to save this important industry and to give some hope to the 13,000 men who have been thrown out of work by this callous Government and their ineffective and inept Ministers for Labour.</P>
    <P>What has happened in relation to the Government policy to built 30,000 houses per annum?  After two years in office they <Col N="1163" /> will be 8,000 houses below their target. It has been reliably estimated that in the second half of the eighties, between 6,000 and 7,800 more new houses per annum will be required than was the case in 1983. With 30,000 families approved and waiting for local authority houses, it is clear that most families will have to wait five years to be housed.  Unless the number of local authority houses being built annually increases greatly from the present level of 6,000 the number of years families will have to wait for housing will be increased greatly as will also the social problems associated with that situation.</P>
    <P>Radical new policies are required to tackle this great social problem.  In addition to the suggestions I have made already, there is a need for a further package for private housing to bridge the deposit gap between the sale price and the loans currently available particularly for first-time buyers.  Suggestions on those lines have been made at housing seminars which were attended by the Minister and his officials.  The time has come for the Minister to take steps to deal with the developing situation.</P>
    <P>The amendment being put forward by the Government is pathetic and displays yet again their callous disregard for the needs of this vital sector of the economy. It is just not correct to say that the decline in activity and employment in the building industry arises from factors outside the Government's control.  That statement is so inaccurate as to imply on the Government's part a misunderstanding of their role and an abdication of their responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>I have shown how the public capital programme expenditure has fallen short of the Government's own published targets in 1983.  Similar trends are evident in 1984.  The early indications are that capital spending will again this year fall short of official targets.  These figures give the lie to the theory being propounded by the Minister that private investment, rather than public investment, is at fault.  When the committed public investment is not being fulfilled, when the Government are not fulfilling their published intentions regarding the level of public capital <Col N="1164" /> expenditure, how can they blame the private sector for the situation?  Many hundreds of millions of pounds have been withdrawn from the industry deliberately by reason of Government decision.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment refers also to the reduction in private sector investment.  It has been accepted by all sides that there has been a reduction in private sector investment but, as I have shown, some imaginative Government initiatives along the lines I have suggested would result in a massive increase in private sector investment, particularly in housing, but so far the Government have failed in this area and are seen to be opposed to incentives to encourage private investment.</P>
    <P>The amendment refers further to policies pursued by Fianna Fáil while in Government as being the cause of our present problems.  Is it not time the Government realised they have been in office for nearly two years, that they have been responsible for the budgets of 1983 and 1984 and that the acceleration in the decline in construction has been due largely to financial decisions made in both of those budgets?</P>
    <P>The Government amendment seeks endorsement of their present disastrous policies and refers to their being designed to maintain public support for the industry at the highest practicable level.  As we have said all along and as is now confirmed by the National Planning Board, this is manifestly untrue.  The board are recommending that even in this year there should be a further increase in public capital investment.  The Government amendment is a sham and must be rejected by the House.  By their inaction in this area and by their lack of concern, the Government are seen to be adopting a very callous attitude to the problems they are creating and compounding for those thousands of families whose main bread winners were employed all their lives in the construction industry.  The Government are responsible, too, for the problems facing parents of young people who have been training in the various trades, whether as electricians, plumbers, carpenters, or bricklayers.  All of these young people had looked forward <Col N="1165" /> to a bright future and to steady employment in an important sector of the economy, but there are no openings for them now.  The industry in which they had hoped to spend the rest of their lives is in a serious state of decline.  Despair is permeating the whole industry.</P>
    <P>The number of public tenders being invited has fallen dramatically while no action is being taken on many of those tenders that have been received.  The level of activity and of State investment in the construction industry in the first four months of this year has fallen so dramatically that the crisis we recognised last year is seen now to be continuing and to be entering a very dangerous phase.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil appeal to the Government, to the Minister present and to the Minister who is absent to rethink seriously the policies they have been adopting and to show that they have some initiative and some spunk.  First, they must show that they understand the full extent of the problem and then that they are prepared to do something about it.  It is not good enough for a man sitting in the Custom House, having responsibility for an industry of this size, not to take any action but to be negligent in his duty. The public revulsion of the inactivity of Labour Ministers in the Government has been witnessed in the recent elections. Surely the Labour Party, who claim to have concern for the homeless, must recognise that in Government they have not delivered on any of the policies they claim to be their party's policies.  They have not been seen to be active in seeking to have those policies implemented.  So far, the Labour Ministers in Government have been a miserable failure.  The Minister for Finance has proved to be a major obstacle to investment in the construction industry and he is supported fully by the Taoiseach.  If the Labour Ministers cannot surmount the obstacles presented by those two individuals, they should take the decent course &mdash; leave the Government, let the Coalition fall and allow a party to come into office who are committed to dealing with social problems, a party who are prepared to make the commitment and the investment and to create a climate which will bring growth back <Col N="1166" /> into our economy.  I ask the House to reject the Government amendment and to support our motion.  I hope this debate will bring home to the Government the seriousness of the problem and that it will evoke from them a positive response that will bring benefit to those who are facing a very bleak future.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;while concerned about the decline in activity and employment in the building industry, recognises that this decline arises from factors outside the Government's control, including the reduction in private sector investment and the reckless economic and financial policies pursued by Fianna Fáil when in Government, and endorses the policies being pursued by the Minister and the Government which are designed, firstly to maintain public capital support for the industry at the highest practical level and, secondly to create the economic and financial conditions in which the industry can develop and grow on a sound basis.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that Fianna Fáil put the motion down on the building industry and I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion.  It gives me a chance to set the record straight particularly with regard to the cavalier fashion in which the industry was treated by Fianna Fáil when they took office in 1977 and with regard to the present and future state of the industry &mdash; one would think from reading the motion that it was on its dying legs.  I hope we will dispel that myth tonight and tomorrow and show that the Government are acting responsibly towards the industry unlike the Opposition when they were in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the building and construction industry has suffered decline in output and employment in recent years. My concern and that of the Government <Col N="1167" /> is to see the decline reversed and ordinary growth and development resumed as soon as possible.  It is only right, given the importance of the building and construction industry to the economy, that the House should have this opportunity to debate the present situation in the industry.  We all agree that a growth in the industry is necessary if the objectives of economic development and a reduction in unemployment are to be achieved. If this debate is to serve any useful purpose or contribute in any way to the achievement of the desired objectives, then it must be conducted in a responsible and constructive manner.  In particular there is need for a clear understanding of the cause of the problems at present affecting the industry and a proper assessment of the role of Government in tackling these problems.  We must be realistic about the present state of the industry and prospects for recovery in the immediate future.  Anything less would involve a betrayal of our responsibilities to the electorate in general and to the industry in particular.</P>
    <P>An examination of the profile of output and employment changes in the building and construction industry over the last two decades show clearly that the industry has been subjected to severe fluctuations over the years.  Output fluctuations on this scale prevent proper planning and lead to expensive inefficiencies and severe dislocation in both the industry and the economy.  Since the industry is sheltered to a large extent from the direct effects of fluctuations in the world economy and since about two-thirds of construction output is financed directly or indirectly by the public sector, the problem is largely domestic in origin.  The Government have a responsibility to the industry to ensure it develops in an orderly way and that output and employment fluctuations are minimised and not reinforced.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the irresponsible behaviour of the Fianna Fáil administration between 1977 and 1981 must be judged.  The economy in general and the building industry in particular are still paying the price of the <Col N="1168" /> disastrous, debt-financed inflationary boom unleashed by that administration which destabilised the whole industry and represented a complete negation of the kind of systematic planning that is needed.  It resulted in spiralling costs which largely negatived the increased investment and gave us an increase in imports which is still with us.</P>
    <P>In the three years between 1977 and 1979 the public capital investment more than doubled at a time when it was manifestly clear that the industry had already entered a strong growth phase.  Output rose by 1.7 per cent in 1976 and by 8.7 per cent in 1977.  Average employment which fell by 5,000 in 1976 rose by 3,000 in 1977.  This was the beginning of orderly growth and the Coalition Government of 1973 to 1977 was achieving it.  All that the irresponsible intervention of the Fianna Fáil Government achieved was a sharp increase in imports of building materials to meet the artificially raised demand, large increases in building costs and prices and inflationary pressures which worked their way through the economy and imposed unwarranted cost increases on our manufacturing and services sectors.</P>
    <P>The legacy of high prices, high imports, high debt and false expectations still bedevils the building industry.  One would hope that the futility of trying to inflate output out of proportion to and beyond the capacity of the building industry has been learnt by the Opposition and that they would never again attempt to manipulate the industry for shallow party political advantage &mdash; but I am bound to say that nothing that has happened or been said by the Opposition since that period would give one any encouragement to believe that the lessons have been learnt.  Playing politics with the country's second largest industry is still the name of the game so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>To appreciate the role of the Government in dealing with the present recession in the industry it is important to understand the nature and source of the decline in output over recent years.  The immediate cause of the difficulties in the industry is the dramatic decline in private investment which is estimated to be down by over 50 per cent between 1979 and 1984.  The worst affected parts of the industry are industrial buildings, commercial developments and investment in agricultural buildings. It seems clear at this stage that recovery in these areas must await an improvement in the economy generally and in agricultural incomes, since the simple reality is that we now have an oversupply of new office space and of factory space. This is a temporary situation but its effect on the demand situation in the building industry cannot simply be wished away. Building activity on new hospitals and schools has been maintained at the 1979 level as also has investment in roads and sanitary services.  As regards telecommunications and harbour developments, output in 1984 will be well above the level in 1979.</P>
      <P>Overall, there is likely to be a further small decline in building output in the current year.  While this is disappointing, there is clear evidence that the worst of the recession affecting the industry has passed and that the stage is set for a resumption of orderly growth.  Average employment in the industry may aslo drop in 1984 but in this case too the situation seems to be bottoming out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I should correct a false impression that has been created by the quotation of unemployment figures for the industry.  According to the Central Statistics Office there were 45,300 building and construction workers on the live register in March of this year.  This figure must be considered in the context that in March 1979 when the industry was overstretched and when shortages of skilled workers were being felt throughout the industry there were almost 20,000 workers registered as unemployed in the building industry.  The fact of the matter seems to be that the building industry figures in our unemployment statistics are <Col N="1170" /> residual in nature in that general workers of many kinds who do not readily fit into any of the other specified categories of workers are assigned to the building industry, the registered figures for which are thus inflated considerably at all times. We all know that there were nothing like 20,000 workers unemployed in the building industry in 1979.  I have little doubt that the current figures are similarly inflated.  In doing this I am not by any means complacent as to the seriousness of the present situation but it is important that we should at least deal in facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another black hole solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make some specific comments about the current trends in the housing sector which comprises about 40 per cent of the output of the industry.  I am glad to say that this sector has been the mainstay of the industry during the recession and has reinforced its position as the most important component of the industry.  Some 10,679 new houses were completed in the first five months of this year compared to a total of 10,750 in the same period in 1983.  While this year's completions to May are slightly down on the same period last year, I am confident that total completions for 1984 will equal or perhaps exceed last year's figure of 26,138.  When one realises the effects that unemployment and difficult economic conditions generally can have on housing demand, one must feel that the maintenance of output levels is a very satisfactory achievement in the present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers of mortgage loans approved and paid by the main lending agencies remains at a high level and I am satisfied that the supply of mortgage finance, which is crucial to the level of activity in the housing sector of the building industry, will be satisfactory throughout 1984.  Building societies continue to play a dominant role in providing funds for house purchase.  Last year the societies provided a record number of just under 18,000 loans valued at £406 million <Col N="1171" /> and I expect that their contribution in the current year will be of the same general order.</P>
    <P>The SDA and Housing Finance Agency loans schemes serve a vital function in bringing house purchase within the reach of people on lower incomes who would not normally be catered for by the other lending institutions.  This year the Government allocated more than £140 million for these two schemes and this allocation is £16 million, or almost 13 per cent more than the amount provided in the 1983 public capital programme. I expect that the allocation of £140 million for SDA and Housing Finance Agency loans will finance the purchase of about 9,000 houses this year.</P>
    <P>The Government have provided £211 million in capital towards the local authority housing programme for 1984. Based on this level of allocation, we expect this year's programme to be maintained at least at the 1983 levels when 6,190 houses were completed and a further 8,354 were in the course of construction at the end of that year.  This had been the first time since 1979 that the level of 6,000 completions had been exceeded.  In fact, the capital claims received from local authorities to finance their housing programmes in the current year indicate that house completions for 1984 will reach 6,400 with over a further 8,000 houses in progress at the end of the year.  This would be the highest level of completions achieved since the mid-seventies when the last Coalition Government were in power.</P>
    <P>Employment on the programme has also continued to improve over the pre-1983 levels.  Last year, average monthly employment reached 6,400 which was an increase of about 500 on the corresponding figure for 1982.  In the first four months of this year, I am pleased to state that employment continued to rise to over 6,700 per month, which indicates that the considerable Government investment in the programme is paying dividends.</P>
    <P>There is a crucial need to ensure that the best return is obtained on all public capital investment and, in the present <Col N="1172" /> difficult economic circumstances, this objective assumes greater importance.  In view of the high level of public capital involved in financing the local authority housing programme &mdash; £211 million capital and over £150 million in subsidy in the current year &mdash; my Department introduced new procedures last year to control the costs of local authority housing and to achieve the best possible return on the State capital invested in the programme. These controls, together with the competitive tendering currently being obtained on local authority housing contracts, will ensure that the maximum return is obtained on the £211 million capital devoted to the programme, and that the targets for the programme in the current year and for future years are achieved.  I would like to emphasise that the new controls do not envisage a return to the low-cost mentality which so affected the programme in past years but represent instead a systematic effort to combine value for money with good quality houses.</P>
    <P>The continued high level of output in the private housing sector is reflected in the number of people availing of new house grants and mortgage subsidies so far this year.  The number of applications for the £1,000 new house grant should, if the trend set so far continues, be of the order of 11,000 approximately this year. Also, combined payments of new house grants and mortgage subsidies in the first five months exceed payments in the corresponding period last year by over 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>At present, it is expected that between 12,000 and 12,500 applications for home improvement grants will be received this year.  They will represent a significant increase on the 1983 level.  Combined payments under that scheme and the disabled persons and essential repair grants schemes in the first five months of the year also show an increase over the same period last year.</P>
    <P>The programme of special housing aid for the elderly has continued to be very attractive and has through the year provided a very valuable service in improving the living conditions of old people who live alone in unfit and insanitary <Col N="1173" /> accommodation.  Since this scheme started in 1982, the living conditions of over 3,000 people have been improved and work is in progress in a number of other cases.</P>
    <P>In so far as the housing programme generally is concerned, it is impossible to ignore the implications for public expenditure of any special measures to boost output.  On the owner-occupier side, it is the volume of private sector demand that largely determines the trend of output.  If the number of people who decide to buy new houses falls, there is little the Government can do to influence the situation short of providing further incentives by way of additional grants or subsidies that in present economic conditions are simply not on.</P>

      <P>That is what I am doing, if the Deputy lets me.  It should not be forgotten in this regard that we <Col N="1174" /> have probably a more extensive range of financial aids for private housing than any country in Europe.  The Deputy said there were no incentives, but this is a measure of the incentives that exist. These measures have the effect of channelling demand away from local authority housing but they are expensive and must be paid for by the general body of taxpayers. If we were to borrow here, there and everywhere that would do it.</P>
      <P>The scope for extension of the local authority programme is severely restricted by the repercussions it has on both capital and current spending.  This year we will spend over £350 million in building and subsidising these houses. Obviously we must maintain the programme at a reasonable level and, if possible, secure better value for money, as we are doing, but it is not an option to talk in present conditions about significant real growth in the expenditure on the programme.  That is the harsh reality at present and the Opposition know it.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the fall in private sector investment in the building industry.  I am confident that an increase in this kind of investment will come about with a general upturn in the economy and a return to confidence in the country.  I think that is happening now; the signs are there and have been for some time.  Cement sales, which are a good indication of activity, have been very encouraging in the last 12 months, despite what Deputy Molloy said.</P>

      <P>Nineteen eighty-three may well have been a watershed year for the economy in that we had a significant <Col N="1175" /> increase in industrial output, imports of producers' capital goods began to rise, inflation fell appreciably, there was a slowing down in the growth of unemployment, a reduction in the budget deficit as a proportion of gross national product and an improvement in the balance of payments.

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not comment on that because the Deputy might fall into it.  On the international front, inflation is also falling and business is improving, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, economies which are growing strongly.  All of this should have favourable implications as more spending power becomes available and effective demand increases.  The Government's policies since taking office have been geared towards creating the right environment for increased activity and putting us in the position where we will be able to take the best advantage of any upturn in opportunities for expansion that may arise.  There is now a general acceptance that this means getting our public finances right and keeping inflation under control &mdash; not borrowing as the Deputy suggested.  We are doing this and we will continue to do so.  Easy solutions in the form of injections of taxpayers' money are now seen for what they are, and it is substantially those looking for short-term political advantage who are counselling otherwise.</P>
      <P>The public capital provision for the building industry for 1984 is being maintained at as high a level as practicable, given the unavoidable constraints to which I have referred.  The provision for 1984 is about the same in money terms as for 1983, that is over £1.1 billion.</P>

      <P>Who wrote the Deputy's &mdash; the CIF?  One does not blame the industry for calling for more money, why should they not?  That is only to be expected from any section which feels the serious effects of a general recession. However, they have their fair share of the cake, and, indeed, privately they would say so.  We are stimulating and will stimulate further the entire building industry.  They are moving in the required direction in an orderly way.  I hope that Deputy Molloy will have the good grace to acknowledge that, but he will not, we know that.  If we were to do handstands that still would not be what the Deputy wants.  One cannot call for more Government spending, more demands on the taxpayers, more short-term so-called solutions.  The time is long past when we could tolerate such an approach.  The country cannot afford it.</P>
      <P>We would have been up to our necks in &ldquo;hock&rdquo;, owned by some international bankers, if the people on the far side had been left loose for much longer.  It is a good job that they were not.  Despite the very hard things which the Deputy has to say about the economy and the recession, the results of the European elections were not too bad.  He says that there is a cynicism about politics and about institutions of the State.  It is a wonder that the electorate did not flock to his side of the House.  We know where the cynicism is and what the problems are and I shall not go into them here because we are dealing with the construction industry. We know exactly the problems of that industry.  All governments, with the exception of one other, got the knock but the Government of this country did not. That is a clear indication.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy stole our proposal.  That was a Fine Gael proposal in the beginning of the eighties, but I am glad that the Deputy is now coming around to our way of thinking. Because of the Housing Finance Agency people can acquire houses at a very low interest rate, 18 per cent, which has made a tremendous difference.  We would not have the same effect from joint venture if we had not the Housing Finance Agency.  The Opposition opposed it tooth and nail and this is the first time that they have been forced to speak in favour of it.  They were extremely worried about where we would get the money for it.  I am delighted that they now see that the Housing Finance Agency has a major role to play in providing homes for those who would not in a normal way be able to afford them.  I believe that Deputy Lyons knows that fact.  However, that <Col N="1180" /> does not mean that we should not examine the Housing Finance Agency and I am looking at it.</P>

Deputy Molloy need not worry.  We are moving on many fronts and have many ideas.  By the time we finish our term of office this industry will be going in an orderly direction, not up and down like a Punch and Judy show, depending on desired results of by-elections or general elections.

      <P>The female cuckoo is too lazy to build her own nest.  When she becomes pregnant, she searches until she finds a nice little nest which has been built already and she lays her egg.  When the young cuckoo becomes old enough she finds the nest is not big enough and she proceeds to jostle the young weakling out of it.  It reminds me of the Government. The Minister of State tried to claim that the Government did well in the European election and that the Fianna Fáil Party were decimated.  The fact is that the Fianna Fáil Party won an extra three seats.  The Labour Party have been decimated thanks to the Fine Gael Party. That is not what we came here to discuss tonight.  I would like to remind the Minister of the case of the cuckoo.</P>
      <P>I am sure that, like a lot of other Deputies over the past two weeks, the Minister of State has been out canvassing for his candidate.  I canvassed in the Laois Offaly by-election where we increased our vote by 8 per cent.  The two problems which were foremost in the minds of the electorate were unemployment and taxation. The Taoiseach is quoted as having said during the course of the election campaign that the electorate were selfish in complaining about high taxation.  I commend the electorate for having told the Taoiseach about the problems of high taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, if they wish, have a great opportunity to reduce the level of unemployment by looking to the construction industry to promote employment. It is a fact that for every job created in the construction industry another job is created in downstream industries.  Ministers over the last week have outlined the fact that unemployment is the biggest problem.  The potential exists for employment in the most labour intensive industry of all, the construction industry. <Col N="1182" /> Unemployment is currently running at 45,000 in that industry.  The Minister questioned the statistics.  Is he questioning the role of the Central Statistics Office in this?  We cannot get away from the fact that in 1979 there were 125,000 people working in the construction industry. Now there are 90,000 people working in that industry which is just twice the number of people unemployed in that industry.</P>
    <P>The latest CIF survey shows that 20 per cent of companies in the house building business have currently no work at all.  It is interesting to quote from the Annual Report 1983-84 of the Construction Industry Federation which stated:</P>
    <P>Since the present Government took office, unemployment in the industry has been growing by 10,000 per annum.  The Government's attitude to private investment in construction is summed up in their attitude to Section 23 incentives which were particularly successful in promoting the construction of private rented accommodation. These measures, while extended for a further three years to 1987, after extreme pressure from the industry, have been so modified as to radically restrict the incentives for private investors. The belief of the present Government seems to be that they have no role to play in stimulating private investment in construction and that the industry must wait patiently for renewed growth in the Irish economy for a revival of private investment in the industry.  The Government seems to feel that they can stand back from the industry in the belief that they are powerless to do anything about it.  The Government can, of course, stimulate private investment by introducing incentives.  The CIF have made detailed proposals on how investment could be increased at little or no cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the Minister for the last 20 minutes and I have not heard one idea from him as to how they will solve the problem of unemployment in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The construction industry, as the Minister <Col N="1183" /> well knows, is on its knees and it is about time the Government faced up to this fact.  It is pitiful to see young people studying and sitting for their leaving certificate exams.  During the last few weeks I spoke to some of the parents of those young people and I said it must be a worrying time for those children.  The majority of the parents said it was not the exams that were worrying them but when they finished their exams and, irrespective of the results that they had little or no hope of employment.  We have a ridiculous situation at the moment where AnCO have courses for bricklayers, carpenters, electricians and plumbers and when those people are suitably qualified they have not the remotest chance of getting a job in the construction industry. The downstream industries are also affected.  Electrical installation companies have never had it so bad.  One has only to watch the public notices in the newspapers to see the number of electrical contractors who have gone into liquidation over the last nine months.  It is pitiful to see people and companies who have spent years in building up, working hard and investing heavily in their companies going to the wall because of the inexcusable policies of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that cement sales were a good barometer for the construction industry.  I agree with him, but I must contradict him on his statement that cement sales for 1984 have actually increased.  I suggest that he should contact the relevant authorities and check it out again.  Cement sales were up for the month of May but comparison was made with the month of April.  We must compare like with like.  In January cement sales were down by 28 per cent.  When we compare the first five months of this year we find that cement sales are down, tonnage wise, by 2 per cent.  New house starts are down.  All the indicators are in the one direction, which is the wrong one.  Fewer houses are now being financed by public sector loans than ever before.  An example of that is 1983 when housing loans were down by 500.  We must also question the provision of funds for the Housing Finance Agency for <Col N="1184" /> 1984.  The process can and should be reversed and I challenge the Government to reverse it.</P>
    <P>In the past year construction employment has increased in the highly developed countries such as the US and Denmark. If, as some Government Ministers have pointed out, we have bottomed out of the recession, none of the indicators show that the construction industry will benefit.  How many sand pits, how many woodwork mills have been closed down and put into mothballs?  It is pitiful to see this happen.  Regrettably it is a fact of life here in Ireland at the moment.</P>
    <P>Bearing all these things in mind, one of the biggest problems recently has been the withholding of money from the public capital programme.  This is the single biggest factor which has depressed the construction industry over the past two years.  I wonder what the Government think of the national planning report.  I hope that, whatever is left of the industry, the Government are not thinking seriously of curtailing house improvement grants, that they are not contemplating the removal of mortgage interest and that the £1,000 new house grant will continue. It would sound the death knell of the construction industry if any of those items were to be withheld.</P>
    <P>The Minister should read the contribution made by Deputy Molloy.  He outlined many areas where the Government could restore confidence.  There is no confidence in the construction industry. When confidence goes out of any industry, that is the end of it.  Ask any small builder, and even some of the large builders, and they will tell you there is no confidence in the construction industry. The private sector can do nothing to promote employment unless it has the goodwill and the co-operation of the Government. It has not got that at this stage.</P>
    <P>The neglect of the construction industry by this Government is a disgrace.  I question the part being played in that national disgrace by the Labour partners in Government.  A small sop was given to the construction industry by the reduction in VAT on ready-mix.  However, it came too late to do anything great for the industry.  The Minister of State <Col N="1185" /> should impress on his Minister the problems being experienced in the construction industry.  It is a pity that taxation is one of the big cripplers of all industry. Over the next few months the Government should look at the problems being experienced in particular by employers. As this is one of the most labour intensive industries, PRSI affects employment.  It is bad for any employer to have to pay 12½ per cent for every employee.  This is having a devastating effect on employment in the industry.  This is an area which should be looked at very soon.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State told us the target for local authority housing for the coming year is 6,000 units.  It is questionable whether that target will be met.  In Dublin alone new starts were down by 20 per cent and the number of houses currently under construction is also down.  One must ask is money for local authority housing being held back.  I have pointed out the spin-off effects on the down-stream industries.  We only have to look at the hardware industry.  In every town hardware shops are closing down.  Hardware wholesalers are feeling the chill winds.  I am given to understand that the hardware business is down from 30 per cent to 50 per cent on the figure two years ago.  The Minister should look seriously at the problems.  There is no point saying what the Government did in the past year and what Fianna Fáil did since 1977.  The problem is here and there is no point telling 45,000 people that it has existed since 1977.  That will not do.

        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I welcome this opportunity to say a few words in this debate.  When I came into the Chamber there was a bit of cross fire between the Minister of State and Deputies on this side of the House about the Euro-elections.  I wish the people who were elected every success and I commiserate with those who were not successful. The Labour Party were the losers in the European elections.  Their absence from the Chamber tonight is quite noticeable. If they are representing the working people they should be here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> The building industry is in a very bad state at present.  Thousands of people are unemployed.  Many builders are finding it very difficult to keep going.  There was a time when a builder was reluctant to undertake a small scheme.  At present builders will tell you they will take anything because the industry has gone down so far.</P>
    <P>There is a great demand for new houses but unfortunately there seems to be a breakdown in the financing of those houses.  Sometimes Dublin Corporation engage contractors who are based outside the country but have a registered office in some part of Ireland.  They bring skilled and unskilled people in van loads and bus loads from outside the State.  It is well know that many of them are in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance in the area they come from. They are taking jobs away from skilled people here who cannot find jobs in the building trade.  I raised this with Dublin Corporation and I was informed that there is not much they can do about it due to EC laws and regulations.  It is rather regrettable that that is happening when so many skilled people cannot find jobs.  The building industry needs a large injection of capital in order to create employment and I call on the Minister to review the industry with this in mind.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 14, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 14 and 15 deal with the withholding of information regarding firearms or ammunition and also regarding stolen property and we have agreed to discuss together amendments Nos. 35 and 45.</P>
      <P>When we discussed section 14 on a previous occasion we made clear our concern with regard to the matter and very briefly I should like now to summarise our thoughts.  Basically we welcome the two sections and support them in principle. We have pointed out our reservations about drafting and we have made some suggestions to the Minister.  The requirement to give information in one's possession appears simple enough but there is also the provision that a garda may by taking reasonable steps require a person to give information regarding previous dealings.  It is difficult to know what exactly this means.  The provision appears to be without limit and we raise a question in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The penalty for withholding information in relation to stolen goods or property can be five years in jail.  That means any stolen goods, whether it be one pound of butter, a pen or anything else. One could hardly visualise the court giving a sentence of five years but the fact that the five-year clause will apply will bring it under section 3 of the Bill and this brings us back to the question of the arrest and detention of a person, with questioning for six, 12 or 20 hours depending on the circumstances and the case.  I wonder why five years was specified here?  In future will there be a temptation <Col N="1188" /> to use the maximum penalty of five years in most instances, thus bringing into operation the provisions of section 3?</P>
    <P>I raised the question of false or malicious allegations.  The matter of people informing on one another leaves open the possibility of score-settling.  It may not be possible to do much about that: it may be one of the problems that go with accepting the principle of the section.  We have seen that the person who gives information will have immunity from prosecution in relation to the information given and this information may lead to other information that can lead to a prosecution. This immunity is to be applied by the Garda apparently without reference to the DPP.  This is a new and potentially dangerous departure and I should like the Minister to consider this matter for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The point of greatest concern involves a new duty to inform on one's wife or husband under threat of five years in jail. This appears to run counter to the common law protection given to marital communications and I should like to hear the Minister's view on the matter.  Section 1 (c) of the Criminal Justice (Evidence) Act, 1924, states:</P>
    <P>The wife or husband of the person charged shall not, save as in this Act mentioned, be called as a witness in pursuance of this Act except upon the application of the person so charged;</P>
    <P>This relates to the common law provision where a person is not required to give evidence in court against his or her spouse.  It appears now that a wife or husband will be required to give information, not evidence in court, against a spouse under threat of a maximum of five years imprisonment or financial penalties or both, as suggested in amendment No. 35 in the name of the Minister.  Section 1 (d) of the Criminal Justice (Evidence) Act, 1924, states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Act shall make a husband compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during the marriage, or a wife <Col N="1189" /> compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during the marriage;</P>
    <P>That Act states very clearly what we know to be the case in practice.  It is very clear and explicit and indicates very clearly the position in relation to information gained in marriage.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal, as drafted, would require a husband or wife to give information.  For example, the husband of a wife who stole a pound of butter could be compelled to give information to the Garda which could not be used as evidence in court but which could be used to assist the Garda in getting other information and evidence about the wife which would lead the wife into court, or vice versa if the husband was involved. This is an unwarranted intrusion into marriage.  We know that marriage breakdown is extensive, that the Government recognise this and are very anxious to do something about it.  They set up an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown to examine the difficulties which arise from marriages which are under stress and strain.  This proposal is going to make matters much worse and it is an unwise change in this respect as proposed by the Minister.  It may make the task of the Garda more difficult because they are frequently asked to interfere in marital problems and breakdowns and to become involved.  They are reluctant to do so because, very often, there are two sides to the problem and it is easy to see how they can be drawn into a situation where information would be given, perhaps with wrong motives, leading to further problems within the marriage. I ask the Minister to look again at the question of informing on a spouse, as I think it is most undesirable.  The section can do a great deal in any event without entering into communication within marriage.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from section 14 that any information given by a person under subsection (1) shall not be admissible in evidence against that person or his spouse in any proceedings, civil or criminal, other than proceedings for an offence under subsection (2).  The offence under <Col N="1190" /> subsection (2) is where a person fails or refuses, without reasonable excuse, to give such account, or gives information which he knows to be false and misleading he shall be guilty of an offence and liable to summary conviction, and so on. The Minister should consider the reservations which I have expressed in relation to the drafting for the Final Stage.  We accept both sections in principle and we also accept the amendment which the Minister is proposing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods has stated that the Fianna Fáil Party agree in principle with the section.  However, he has expressed reservations about the drafting of the section and the question arises whether, due to the way the section is drafted and to the potentialities of what can happen under the section in certain instances, we would be better off without the section.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is the precise effect of subsection (4) which states that any information given by a person in compliance with the requirement of subsection (1) shall not be admissible in evidence against that person or his spouse in any proceedings, civil or criminal, other than proceedings for an offence under subsection (2), the specific offence created by the section of refusing to disclose information without reasonable cause as to how the firearm or ammunition came into the possession of the accused.  If it emerges from the interrogation that the accused, by his own admission, has obtained a firearm illegally and he is prosecuted for that offence, does subsection (4) mean that his confession that he obtained the firearm illegally will not be used in evidence against him?  If that is the case, it is rather peculiar because statistics suggest that 80 per cent of convictions in serious crime are obtained by confession.  Therefore, it seems odd that a self-incriminatory confession cannot be used in evidence against the accused.  There may be no other evidence sufficient to convict the accused in which case he would walk free from the court.  I should like the Minister to expand on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Woods has mentioned, we went through these two sections in detail when we were last discussing the Bill.  Deputy Woods raised some points again which he raised previously and I welcome his general agreement in principle to these sections.  He is worried about the obligation, not alone to give an account of the information a person may have in his possession but also to take reasonable steps to acquire such information.  Reasonable steps are something that would be objectively tested by a court and, as I have said in relation to the Road Traffic Act, 1961, a similar form of words is used there.  The courts are very experienced in assessing what is reasonable and what is not reasonable.  Obviously it would be a reasonable step to produce a receipt or a licence to show that a firearm was legally held.  Perhaps a bill of sale for goods could be produced but to require somebody to go to America to do so would obviously be unreasonable.  Therefore, it is easy to see the extremes of what would be reasonable and unreasonable.  In that grey area where the layman would be in doubt as to what was reasonable, the court would decide and the test would be objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the five year maximum penalty, we are trying to stop a very serious evil in society: the trading in firearms with people making profit from armed crime and subversion at the risk of the lives of others.  Armed robberies and larceny are among the most serious problems facing us today.  The use of firearms to rob and steal is a serious matter and consequently the penalties for failing to comply with the conditions of sections 14 and 15 are strong and have been set at five years.  It is not to be taken as an indication that every measure introduced by any Minister from now on will involve a minimum penalty of five years.  In the case of proof by written statement the penalty is 12 months for failing to comply. Other sections of the Bill demonstrate that a five year penalty will not be a general rule.  I agree that it should not be taken as a headline that all subsequent offences should be treated on the basis <Col N="1192" /> that everything should be admissible under section 3.</P>
    <P>The problem of people wanting to settle old scores or grudges against their neighbours and being malicious is a problem but it is not any greater than the problem that exists already.  There is some experience of false information being given to the Garda to embarrass neighbours.  There are powers of search under the Misuse of Drugs Act and people can get others against whom they have grudges into difficulty.  I do not think this increases it in any way.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea and Deputy Woods spoke about subsection (4).  The point of the subsection is that the statement made by a person under the obligations of subsection (1) shall not be admissible in evidence against that person or his spouse. I was faced with a dilemma here because there are conflicting principles.  There is, first of all, the desire that we should abide by what has been the traditional common law position that one would not incriminate oneself or one's spouse by a statement made under compulsion.  On the other hand, there is the case put forward by the Garda that people who may be demonstrably guilty might walk free because they might not be able to take a prosecution.  The subsection does not give immunity from prosecution but provides that the statement shall not be admissible in evidence against the person making it or his spouse.  On the question of 80 per cent of all convictions being based on confessions, unless sections 14 and 15 were actively invoked they would not apply.  If somebody is questioned under section 3 and makes a statement it would be admissible in evidence.  Subsection (4) does not give immunity from prosecution; it is only the statement which cannot be used in evidence against the person.</P>
    <P>There is a price to be paid for accepting sections 14 and 15.  We are trying to get at the suppliers of firearms, the traders in stolen goods, the fences, the people who control, organise and market firearms or stolen property.  There is a price to be paid in trying to formulate law to get the information to proceed against them. <Col N="1193" /> That price may be to weaken to some extent the case against the person found in possession but it is not an immunity from prosecution.  It is simply the inadmissibility of the statement.  Somebody found in possession of an illegal weapon can still be proceeded against for illegal possession but his or her statement would not be admissible in evidence as to the source of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods said his greatest concern was the idea that somebody would be obliged to give information against a husband or wife under either section.  The obligation to give an account &mdash; in the case of section 15 &mdash; or to give any information in his possession &mdash; in the case of section 14 &mdash; is to give such an account or such information <i>simpliciter</i> and information could be against oneself. There is no protection extended from self-incrimination; neither is there any protection given from incriminating one's spouse by giving the information required under the section.  Again it comes down to the problem of conflicting principles.  We have said in this section that a person is obliged unless there is a reasonable excuse.  What a reasonable excuse would be is a matter for the courts to decide.  They may decide that incriminating one's spouse would be a reasonable excuse but the law on it is not developed to the extent that one can be precise.  The problem from my point of view is the task of steering a reasonable balance between two important principles: the need to get information about the suppliers of firearms so that the illegal use of such weapons can be combated and, similarly, the trade in stolen goods and, on the other hand, the reasonable need to protect marriage.  We have gone a reasonable distance to reconcile the two principles by providing that the information given would not be admissible in any proceedings against a person or his spouse.  It would be difficult to go further than that because there would be practical and drafting difficulties.  There are already requirements under law which require one to give information about one's own activities or those of a spouse. For example, under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, the obligation to say who was <Col N="1194" /> driving a car at a particular time could involve a spouse in a charge of manslaughter, yet the obligation is there.  I see this as a similar obligation.  One would hesitate to increase the potential for tension between husbands and wives in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are two further points worth making.  Larceny and trading in stolen goods can frequently become a family business.  Many people are aware of family businesses in shoplifting where whole families are involved, including children of all ages, and large amounts of goods are being taken from stores in the city.  Very often it could be a husband or wife who could have the maximum amount of information.</P>
    <P>As well as that, if we do make the kind of exception that the Deputy proposes in the case of husbands and wives, would there be submissions then from other Deputies that we should also make an exception for children, parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins or people living in a house together?  What about relationships of trust between employees and their immediate superior?  What about relationships of trust in business? Should we make an exception of them as well from giving an account of where the weapon or stolen goods came from?</P>
    <P>There are difficulties and I have endeavoured to approach the problem in two ways.  First of all, there is a clear conflict of two very important principles &mdash; the sanctity of marriage and, in the case of firearms, the sanctity of human life, which are in conflict when we talk about this.  The best suggestion I can make within the section as drafted in regard to how these can best be reconciled is that we leave it to the courts to define &ldquo;without reasonable excuse&rdquo; and see whether the courts consider that it would be a reasonable excuse not to incriminate one's spouse in the sort of circumstances outlined by Deputy Woods.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods dwelt on the problem of marital breakdown to some extent.  He spoke of making the Garda's task more difficult.  I think his point was that the Garda can be called in frequently where there are marital problems.  I accept that. <Col N="1195" /> There are increasing problems being encountered in marriage and increasing marital breakdown.  All I can do is suggest that the solution might be found elsewhere.  I do not think it lies in the Criminal Justice Bill.  Rather it might lie in other activities of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted the section of the Criminal Justice (Evidence) Act, 1924, which those before us saw as desirable and necessary to make quite clear the position pertaining at present: that nothing in this Act shall make a husband compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during marriage, or a wife compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during marriage.  The danger is that the steps being planned here will have such vast social impact they would far outweigh the benefits one might hope to reap in relation to the number of cases involving firearms.  The Minister advances as his reason for continuing this provision in the Bill, the fact that the Garda want it.  We do not know exactly what the Garda want.  For instance, we know that the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have said that sections 14 (1) and 15 (1) need to be clarified in order to determine precisely what information a person is required to give and that sections 14 (4) and 15 (4) need to be clarified in order to determine what information, if any, can be used against that person subsequently.  Therefore, the Garda themselves are not clear on what information is intended in this case. Obviously the Garda want something, and in principle we want to give them what they want.  But let us be clear in what we are giving them and about what we are doing in the steps we propose taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then says: &ldquo;Well, a price has to be paid&rdquo;.  We can maintain that about anything we do in principle, and the principle we are accepting is the price we are paying.  The question is: how far do we go in practice in the implementation of that principle?  Of course, we know that in trying to get at the dealers in firearms, the fencers in goods and so <Col N="1196" /> on we need to get that kind of information; but is it necessary for the State to intrude into marriage to get that information and to take that step?  The section here does not deal with uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews or anybody else.  Those who went before us were able to draft a law which maintained and preserved the marriage relationship notwithstanding the fact that they were making other things compulsory at the time.  Can we not look harder at this to ascertain how we can deal with the problems with which we want to deal, introduce the principle the Minister wants to introduce and yet not intrude into marriage and communications within marriage?  Surely that can be done and I would ask the Minister to re-examine it for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister went into all sorts of other relationships of trust within business and so on.  The one I raised specifically was that which those who went before us seemed to regard as important and which has become part of the common law.  The innovation we would be including in this section is that a husband would be obliged to inform on his wife and <i>vice versa.</i>  At present we know that the common and statute law is that one spouse cannot be called on to give evidence against the other spouse except where the offence was against herself or himself, whether it be an assault within the marriage or whatever.  But under this provision a spouse can be compelled by law to inform and can be subjected to a penalty of a maximum of five years' imprisonment for refusing to do so.  In my view that undermines the traditional regard the law has had for marital privacy and for the bond of marriage.  The Minister says he does not like to have to interfere with that.  Then why interfere with it?  Surely the number of cases the Minister will solve by so doing could be solved some other way?  After all, we are merely rendering it easier for the Garda to get information.  We are making it easier for them in every other relationship outside marriage.  In regard to communications between husband and wife surely it could be covered in some other way?  That section, as drafted, introduces a whole new area.  I have spoken to some <Col N="1197" /> gardaí, especially since we last debated this matter, and they foresee enormous problems for themselves in this proposal. We are back to what people have been saying about this Bill, that their underlying worry is that certain provisions will fall more heavily on certain sections of the community.  I am genuinely concerned in relation to those sections of the community where we have not solved many of the problems there to be solved. For example, the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown are endeavouring to make proposals to solve some of the problems there, as elsewhere in our society.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat disappointed in the Minister's clear rejection of my suggestion that he would consider this matter for Report Stage, especially since I had raised it on the last occasion and merely finalised the point this evening.  I do not want to repeat what was said on the last day.  In relation to the drafting, the Minister mentioned the taking of reasonable steps to get information and that the courts would decide what were reasonable steps.  But in this case it is not merely a matter of reasonable steps to find out how somebody came by firearms, property or whatever, but it also says &ldquo;and as to any previous dealings with it&rdquo;.  I presume this is one area in which the Garda themselves are concerned about how far that is supposed to go.  Certainly it is very open.  I mentioned that on the last occasion but the Minister does not seem to have taken much heed, judging from his remark this evening when he said: &ldquo;Right, let the court decide&rdquo;.  In regard to many of these matters the Minister is inclined to say the court can decide ultimately. Obviously, the court will decide in relation to what they read in the Bill and how it is presented.  In their wisdom I know they will solve many of the problems what will arise and use commonsense in relation to them, but they must be guided by the Act as passed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he himself is concerned about sections 14 to 18, about the length of time their provisions should operate and so on.  In view of all of that I would ask him to re-examine that section and ascertain whether it is <Col N="1198" /> necessary in practice to effect such a major change in marital relationships affecting society as a whole.  In these days various people are advancing reasons for the breakdown in the relationship of marriage as we know it.  I am reluctant to go along with the Minister on that aspect.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in principle and we will support him in that.  However, if that means we are opening floodgates in regard to questioning and informing within marriage and changing fundamentally that relationship within marriage, and the way the State has looked upon that relationship, we may be establishing a principle we will regret in the future.  The Minister should consider that point.  While it may appear necessary in a pragmatic way to help solve some of the problems surely the major part of the problem would be solved by the section as a whole without such an intrusion.  Surely the Minister's advisers can produce a provision which will preserve the bulk of what is in the section and at the same time continue the protection that has existed up to now.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister will consider the views expressed by our spokesman.  This is the first opportunity I have had to express a point of view on this section in the House. My perusal of the Official Report on this section has left me totally dissatisfied with subsection (4).  I attended a university debate recently and the views expressed by the Government and Opposition here were expressed at that debate also.  The general view at the debate was that subsection (4) was representative of all the concern expressed on the generality of what might be called the more dangerous sections of the Bill in the context of civil liberty.  It represents to me, and to many people in the community, those dangers to civil liberties.  The subsection purports <Col N="1199" /> to fly in the face of a very well settled principle of common law, that a spouse be not obliged under civil or criminal law to give evidence against his or her spouse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point I am making.  It is a very dangerous departure.  As I understand it, there is another aspect to it apart altogether from intruding into the marriage home.  We could have a situation where a family would be divided and that is a very serious departure.  Another point that must be raised &mdash; it was raised by Deputies Woods and O'Dea &mdash; is that any information given by a person in compliance with a requirement under subsection (1) shall not be admissible in evidence against that person or his spouse in any proceedings, civil or criminal.  That raises the informer spectre.  I am concerned about that.  The Minister has nodded his head and said I am departing from what he understands the section to mean but those fears have been expressed to me. They are reasonably grounded fears in connection with the section and the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has undertaken to have a look at subsection (4).  It is generally felt in the House that as drafted it is loose and having spoken to gardaí I am aware that they are concerned about it.  Certainly the principle is <Col N="1200" /> correct; what the Minister is seeking to do is correct.  He is anxious to root out the suppliers of firearms, fences and so on.  We agree with the principle of the section but that does not necessarily suggest we should agree with a denial of civil liberties in a number of instances. That is one of the dangers in the section as drafted.  We look forward to what the Minister will say on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Subsection (4) applies to any information given by a person in compliance with the requirements of subsection (1) and provides that it shall not be admissible evidence against that person or his spouse in any proceedings, civil or criminal, other than proceedings, for an offence under subsection (2).  It preserves the safeguard which exists for a person in the relationship with his or her spouse.  The only exception is the proceedings under subsection (2).  The only way it can be used under subsection (2) is if a person fails or refuses to give information or gives false or misleading information.  It is only when persons do not comply with section 14 that the information can be used against themselves because they failed to give the account or gave false or misleading information.  It does not interfere in any way with the existing position. If I were to remove subsection (4) altogether the House can see the type of difficulties that would arise.  The subsection is a safeguard and recognises that information given by a person under compulsion of law would, in all probability, not be admissible in evidence since it would not have been given voluntarily.  It is also not unlikely that, without the protection against self-incrimination or, indeed, incriminating one's spouse the whole section might prove to be unconstitutional. It is a statement of a safeguard rather than any attempt to remove safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will certainly examine the point made by Deputy Woods, that the obligation in the whole section is an obligation to give information <i>simpliciter</i> and that that obligation would oblige a person to give information about himself or herself and also about a spouse.  That is the net point <Col N="1201" /> that is now between us and I will take the views of the Opposition into account on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some confusion between the Minister and Deputy Andrews on this.  The point Deputy Andrews is making &mdash; I apologise to him if I am interpreting him wrongly &mdash; is that there is a general principle that spouses will not incriminate each other by any statements they make.  That general principle has stood for a long time. The section, in effect, is creating a new offence and the general principle which applies in relation to other offences will not apply in relation to the new offence. Therefore, there is a departure from the general principle in that a new offence is created to which the general principle will not apply.  That quite legitimate point was made by Deputy Andrews and in another way by Deputy Woods.</P>
      <P>In a reply to Deputy Woods the Minister referred to a precedent in road traffic legislation.  I am aware of what the precedent is and I think the Minister will bear me out when I venture the opinion that it occurred under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, in relation to offences arising from the use of mechanically propelled vehicles.  That precedent departs from the general principle also in addition to this new offence.  I have never been happy that the principle was justifiably departed from in relation to that offence. That departure from the general principle may or may not be justified in itself in that type of offence, but it does not justify this further departure.  Two wrongs do not make a right.  Because the precedent is there it is useless for the Minister to say that the precedent justifies him now in departing from the general principle.  If that were the case the general principle could be departed from on a wide scale by simply referring back to this one road traffic precedent, and the more it was departed from the more it would become justifiable to depart from it in later offences because the greater would be the number of precedents.  That argument does not stand and I was surprised to hear the Minister using it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also made the point that <Col N="1202" /> section 14 (4) does not prevent a prosecution from taking place in relation to another offence such as, in the case of section 15, possession of stolen property, larceny, theft or, in the case of section 14, illegal possession of a firearm.  Of course, we understand that all the subsection does is prevent any confessions made by the accused in relation to his obligation under section 14 from being taken into account in evidence against him in relation to a prosecution for another offence.  However, we must bear in mind that the burden of proof in criminal cases is quite severe.  The case must be proved beyond all reasonable doubt. That is quite a substantial burden of proof.  If a voluntary confession is made which is not subsequently disputed that obviously is sufficient to discharge the burden of proof, but the other evidence available to the authorities might not in itself be sufficient to discharge the burden of proof.  The Minister justified earlier provisions in this legislation by saying that he did not want people who are obviously guilty to walk free.  Here is a case where people who may be admitting that they are guilty of some crime walk free from that crime by virtue of the fact that a voluntary statement made by them cannot be taken into account and used in evidence against them.  The remainder of the evidence might not be sufficient to discharge the very onerous burden of proof which must be met by the prosecution in a criminal case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough, but it is a statement which is not disputed and in normal circumstances that would be sufficient to discharge the burden of proof in relation to prosecution for the other offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little concerned about the implications for the presentation of evidence by the prosecution in a criminal case.  I am not an expert on criminal law or criminal evidence, but it seems that the skilled prosecutor can evolve ways from here on to present evidence in subsequent prosecutions <Col N="1203" /> in a way which would get around section 14 (4) given that the intention behind section 14 (4) is good.  For instance, take a person found in the possession of property which has been stolen. The person admits that he stole the property in question and subsequently he is prosecuted for larceny.  His confession would be sufficient of itself to discharge the onerous burden of proof and secure a conviction.  The other evidence available to the authorities might not be sufficient. Could the prosecution present the evidence in such a way that the person will be asked whether it was true that he was found in possession of property, that he was asked to give some explanation as to how the property came into his possession and whether a prosecution took place?  Obviously, if the person said that he did not steal the property, that he secured it legitimately, and the Garda subsequently prosecute him for stealing the property, then it will be obvious to the court that the initial prosecution under section 15 should have taken place, namely a prosecution for giving false or misleading information.  It is only if he is telling the truth and the Garda accept it as the truth that he stole the property that a prosecution will not have taken place.  I am not an expert on the presentation of evidence by either the prosecution or the defence in a criminal case, but there may be some way whereby the prosecution can present evidence in such a way that the court will know that a person made a statement that he stole property in accordance with his obligations under section 15 or that he was in possession of a firearm illegally in accordance with his obligations under section 14 when he is prosecuted for the substantial offence of being in possession or of larceny rather than the statutory offence created under these sections.</P>

Whilst the Minister explained the principle behind the section and the Opposition <Col N="1204" /> spokesman on Justice has accepted that principle and naturally I accept it, I would like to enter my own <i>caveat.</i>  The section is accepted very reluctantly and if I were in a position to do otherwise I would take a different course and urge a different direction.  I am not at all happy that this in the final analysis is the type of section, particularly section 14 (4) which the Garda Síochána themselves would want.  They may not want to become involved in that area.  How it will improve our crime figures in the future leaves a great deal to be debated.  In the nature of things I am voice-voting against the section and leaving it at that.  The section is representative of the hazards into which we have been brought by the type of section we are now dealing with. Section 14 (4) should give rise to a good deal of concern in this House.  Whilst I agree that the debate has been conducted sincerely and in a fair-minded fashion, nevertheless had I the opportunity of taking a different course and this were a different occasion certainly I would take a far different line.  That would be my attitude also to a number of other sections.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 16, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>16. &mdash;Section 4 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, and section 13 (3) (a) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 (each of which provides for a maximum fine of £100 on summary conviction of certain indictable offences) are hereby amended by the substitution, in each of those provisions, of &lsquo;£1,000&rsquo; for &lsquo;£100&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to insert a new section in the Bill, the purpose of which is to increase from £100 to £1,000 the maximum fine the District Court can impose on summary conviction of certain indictable offences.  Section 4(1) of the 1951 Act refers to certain scheduled offences under the Act.  When these are tried summarily in the District Court, fines of only £100 can be imposed. Examples of these offences are indecent assault and minor offences under the Larceny Act.  Section 13 (3) (a) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, relates to indictable offences to which an accused pleads guilty in the District Court.  In those cases, with the DPP's consent, the court may sentence the accused but here again in this case the maximum fine is £100.  I think it will be accepted generally that it is right that this maximum fine be increased to bring it into line with the current maximum for summary offences which is £1,000.</P>

Following the Minister's lengthy explanation of why he proposes to delete section 16, I shall not delay the House, but in effect what I have to say will probably be helpful to the Minister. <Col N="1206" /> This was one section which from the outset we considered we would have to oppose in total.  Clearly it was a section that should not have been in the Bill in so far as it contained, for instance, the proposal to draw certain inferences from failure to mention any fact relied on in a person's defence and also various other aspects which would lead to considerable difficulty in interpretation and implementation. We are very happy that the Minister is withdrawing the section.  We opposed it from the outset both from the Front Bench and from the lofty back benches and I am confident that our agreeing to the section being withdrawn in total will help the Minister in his negotiations otherwise also.</P>

      <P>I am pleased, too, that the long campaign, particularly against section 16, has come to an end successfully.  The Minister gave all the credit for this to his side of the House.  I would not expect him to do otherwise but I would like him to give some credit to Deputy Woods and to other Opposition Deputies for helping him to see the light in this instance.  In fairness to the Minister, he is not above seeing the light of day.  In this case he saw the error that had been made.  Naturally he must take responsibility for it but the type of thinking represented in the old section gave rise to considerable concern outside the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to that of Deputy Andrews in welcoming the deletion of section 16.  It was an extraordinary piece of legislation by any standards and it is very difficult to understand how it could have come from the parliamentary draftsman's office in the first place, be agreed by the Cabinet and <Col N="1207" /> then appear before the House in the form of proposed legislation.  I am not questioning the Minister's motives in withdrawing the section.  Perhaps when he studied it he saw the implications of it, or perhaps his action resulted from pressure from his backbenchers.  It may have been the one time during the lifetime of this administration that Labour's voice was heard or the Opposition may have a little to do with it.  In any case I am glad the Minister has decided to withdraw the section.  I can only express the hope that for whatever time I am here I shall never again see legislation such as that before the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (1) (c), to delete lines 18 to 35, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;such failure or refusal may be given in evidence against the accused in any subsequent prosecution against him, in relation to which the failure or refusal is material.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment would shorten the section, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...then if, in any proceedings against the person for the offence, evidence of the said matters is given, the court, in determining whether to send forward <Col N="1208" /> the accused for trial or whether there is a case to answer and the court (or, subject to the judge's directions, the jury) in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged (or of any other offence of which he could lawfully be convicted on that charge) may draw such inferences from the failure or refusal as appear proper; and the failure or refusal may, on the basis of such inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any other evidence in relation to which the failure or refusal is material, but a person shall not be convicted of an offence solely on an inference drawn from such failure or refusal.</P>
    <P>That would apply to clothing or footwear and shall not have an effect unless the accused was told in ordinary language by the member of the Garda Síochána when making the request mentioned in subsection 1 (b) what the effect of the failure or refusal might be.</P>
    <P>At first I thought of including safeguards in relation to that section.  Then I came to the conclusion that the amendment would simply make refusal or failure to give an account as required by section 17 admissible evidence.  Once the evidence is admissible it is unnecessary to have all the complications created by the rest of this section.  If this evidence was admissible it would fall to be treated by the court like any other admissible evidence.  The court or jury will be entitled to draw such inferences as may be proper and to treat the evidence as corroborative if the circumstances warrant it according to the existing principles of the law of evidence.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment is to make refusal or failure to give an account admissible evidence which can be treated in the normal way by the court.  The intention was to avoid the complications which arise under the section.  The same applies to section 18.  We are suggesting a similar provision in relation to that. Section 18 deals with inferences from an accused's presence at a particular case. Subsection (c) states:</P>
    <P>...the member informs the person that <Col N="1209" /> he so believes, and requests him to account for such presence, and</P>
    <P>A similar amendment is proposed there.</P>
    <P>We also feel there should be further improvements to the section.  These would include that any account given by the accused in answer under section 17 and 18 should have the same status under the section as failure or refusal to give an account.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the terms of section 17 (1) which permits a judge or jury to draw such inferences as appear proper from a failure or refusal to give an account in answer to a request made under the section, will the Minister tell us what kind of inferences are envisaged which a judge or jury would not be capable of drawing?  Will the Minister say in what circumstances the inferences can be drawn by a judge or jury under the section which could not otherwise be properly drawn apart from the provisions of the section?  If nothing in the section can be taken to preclude the drawing of any inference from a failure or refusal to give the account requested which could be properly drawn apart from the section, what is the intention and purpose of the provisions of section 17 (1)?  Why is it only the failure or refusal of an arrested person to give an account in answer to a request that has the particular status envisaged by subsection (1)?  Why does the section not give the same status to the fact that a person has given such an account as requested?</P>
    <P>Any evidence which is admissible at the trial may, if the circumstances so warrant it, be treated as capable of amounting to corroboration of any other evidence in accordance with the general principles of the law of evidence.  Why does the Minister deem it necessary or desirable to have a statutory provision predetermining that this particular type of evidence when admitted should be treated as or as capable of amounting to corroboration?  Does the Minister envisage that evidence concerning the failure or refusal under the section might not, according to the existing principles of law, be treated as or as capable of amounting to corroboration of any other <Col N="1210" /> evidence?  If so, would he explain the circumstances in which such a situation might arise?  If there are no circumstances we must ask what is the purpose of the statutory provision in subsection (1) in relation to corroboration, if evidence of failure or refusal could in any event, apart from the section, be treated as or as capable of amounting to corroboration of any other evidence?</P>
    <P>As regards the use of the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; what does the Minister mean by conviction of an offence &ldquo;solely on an inference drawn from such failure or refusal&rdquo;? Does he mean this is where the inference is the only evidence standing against the accused in relation to the criminal charge or, alternatively, does he mean that while a judge and jury would not be disposed to convict on the basis of other evidence against the accused, neither should they convict when the inference which they have drawn from the failure or refusal is the sole item of evidence which would bring the judge or jury to the last step in concluding that the accused was guilty beyond reasonable doubt?  Does the section mean that the inference drawn from the failure or refusal is the sole incriminating evidence against the accused?  If this is the case, where does the section say that or how is it purported to interpret the section as saying that it is referring to the sole incriminating evidence against the accused so as to differentiate that type of evidence from any other evidence on which a jury would have to rely in order to find the accused guilty?</P>
    <P>The safeguards which I mention would include such things as: any request made pursuant to this section should be made in writing and given to the accused person and the accused person should then be informed that he may give his reply in writing or orally and, if the latter, his reply should be taken down in writing; if the arrested person fails or refuses to give any reply to the request made of him the fact of such failure or refusal should be recorded in writing; when the reply of the arrested person is recorded in writing, or where there is no reply, the fact of his refusal or failure to reply is recorded, he should be invited to place his name and <Col N="1211" /> sign his name on the sheet or sheets containing the written request and the written reply or the written record of his refusal to reply, as the case may be.  If he refuses to sign such written record, such refusal should also be recorded by the member concerned.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a need as the section stands to have some safeguards. This is a matter which could be covered separately by the Minister.  At first I thought of putting it in an amendment and saying that the request should be given in writing to such person and his reply, if any, noted in writing and if he fails or refuses, then such failure or refusal should be noted in writing, but that would be making it a statutory provision. Consequently, I felt that our amendment which makes the failure or refusal clearly admissible as evidence would be sufficient and might meet the Minister's requirements.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to tell us the reasons for this section.  There is a great deal more to be said about it because many views have been expressed on it.  This section will have a considerable impact on the Judges' Rules.  That has been brought out in the contributions made to this section.  For instance, the Incorporated Law Society said that section 17 effectively negatived the long-established Judges' Rules and put the person who is being questioned under a positive duty to relate a fact at that stage which may well be ultimately the fact that tilts the scales against him at a subsequent trial.  In their view, this is clearly contrary to the basic doctrine of our law where a person is innocent until proven guilty.  They say that a further disadvantage is that it may be necessary for a defendant to give evidence at his trial to explain why he did not provide the necessary information or explanation to the Garda during the investigation, thus putting himself in peril of cross-examination when that need not otherwise occur.  They also feel that it is clear that if these sections are to be introduced, there will be a need for the correct wording of all inquiries made by the Garda and the results of these inquiries must be recorded and made available for <Col N="1212" /> subsequent use by the defendant's lawyers. This comes back to the point I was making about the need for safeguards to accompany the provisions.  In the society's view it is not clear what kind of notice is going to be given under subsection (3).  They say the trial judge should be given the discretion in a jury trial to prohibit the prosecution from commenting on or raising inferences.  They went on to say that if there is to be a change in the inquisitorial system, it should not be introduced without the protection which is given by the inquisitorial system to the person being questioned.  There is considerable concern about protection and safeguards in these proposed changes.</P>
    <P>The Judges' Rules are in certain respects negatived and put a person being accused at a considerable disadvantage. There are opposing views on this.  Rule 1 states that under the present law a person questioned is under no obligation to answer and he cannot be charged with obstructing a police officer if he refuses to answer.  Under the new régime this will be abolished.  Rule 2 states that when a police officer has made up his mind to charge a person with a crime he should administer the caution before questioning. The substance and traditional from of the caution are abolished by the Bill. Rule 3 provides that persons in custody should not be questioned without caution. This is clearly incompatible with sections 14 to 18.</P>
    <P>Rule 4 which provides that the caution be administered if a prisoner wishes to volunteer a statement is also abolished. Rule 5 which states the form of caution under the rule and that care should be taken to avoid the suggestion that his answers can only be used in evidence against him, as this may prevent an innocent person making a statement which might assist to clear him of the charge, is no longer required.  Rule 6 is also abolished. It requires the giving of a caution as soon as possible where a prisoner makes a statement before there is time to administer the caution.  Rule 7 provides that the person making a voluntary statement shall not be cross-examined and no questions should be put to him about it. It is impossible to hold that this rule <Col N="1213" /> survives the imposition of an inquisitorial régime of detention and investigation.</P>
    <P>The Garda feel that modification of the Judges' Rules is required so that the provisions of the Bill can become fully workable and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors said (a) that the Judges' Rules should be amended to allow the provisions in the Bill to become fully workable.  They see that the Judges' Rules will be very seriously affected.  The association go on to say that the rules should be revised to facilitate the procurement of the best evidence with which to connect the suspects with the crime; that they should be simple and without contradiction, and not help an increased number of professional criminals avoid conviction.</P>
    <P>(b)  It is recommended that rule No. 2 be modified to enable an interviewer to elicit all the information a suspect is prepared to divulge.  Therefore, the caution should not be administered until the suspect is actually charged.</P>
    <P>(c)  The abolition of rule No. 3 would be a logical consequence if the proposal to permit detention for investigation is approved by statute.</P>
    <P>(d)  It is illogical to prevent a prisoner from divulging relevant information by having to caution him, merely to satisfy the dictates of the procedure which is archaic and outmoded.  If a prisoner wishes to volunteer any statement it should not be necessary to administer the caution as referred to in rule No. 4.</P>
    <P>(e)  The caution under the Judges' Rules should be altered to read:</P>
    <P>You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so.  You are, however, free to say anything you might wish.  If you say or refuse to say anything, the prosecution will be at liberty to comment on such failure or refusal but anything you may say will be recorded and may be given in evidence.</P>
    <P>The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors propose a new form of caution which they believe would be appropriate as a result of the changes which will occur under the Bill as proposed.</P>
    <P>The Judges' Rules are of long standing. <Col N="1214" /> They have been widely held and recognised. It seems quite clear that section 17 will negative these long-established rules and put a person who is being questioned under a positive duty to relate a fact at that stage which may well ultimately be the fact which tilts the scales against him at a subsequent trial.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about the changes in the Judges' Rules.  Would he confirm that sections 17 and 18 will result in changes to these rules?  What changes would the Minister see which would maintain the protection previously provided by these rules, in so far as they can be maintained?</P>
    <P>There have been various comments by people who have taken an interest in these sections.  The Association of Criminal Lawyers made considerable comment and were quite concerned about them.  They felt that they would radically alter the right to silence.  There is a particular duty on us in this House to ensure that the changes which we are making in these sections are properly drafted and take account of the reservations which can be met in dealing with them.  A question was raised in relation to section 16 that such inferences may be drawn when the court are deciding (a) whether or not to send a person forward, (b) whether there is a case to answer and (c) whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged.  Do these same inferences apply and have the same effects in section 17 in relation to the failure to account for a mark?  Can they have an effect on the court in deciding whether a person should be sent forward or whether there is a case to answer?  What other effects would there be in that respect?</P>
    <P>Section 17 (3) does not specify the form of warning which must be given to bring the section into effect.  It is quite clear that the present caution will no longer apply.  Indeed, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have pointed that out and have suggested another form of caution or warning which might be appropriate in the new circumstances. The Association of Criminal Lawyers also suggest that the judicial definitions <Col N="1215" /> of a voluntary statement no longer apply and will have to be redefined.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that very much has been said by people who are taking a genuine interest in the section and have tried to contribute to the debate outside the House which went on for quite some time.  The Association of Criminal Lawyers feel that sections 17 and 18 alike undermine the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt required of the prosecution. They also feel that the sections abolish the Judges' Rules as hitherto known and undermine the protection afforded an accused making a statement by the use of a caution.  This would appear to support my view and concern expressed in relation to the cautions and the effect of the sections as at present drafted.  Would the Minister give his view in relation to these questions?  There are many more which could be asked in that respect.  If he has at this stage any other views in relation to the section or if, on consideration, he feels that he might be able to offer some redrafting of them on Report Stage, we would be interested to hear from him in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First of all, it is worth mentioning the general position at the moment.  If we did not have these sections the jury could not infer guilt from silence.  Take for example the failure to explain something like a bloodstain on a jacket or shirt.  The prosecution could not at the moment comment on that.  These sections will now allow an inference to be drawn legally. At the moment a jury might draw an inference as a matter of common sense but there is an obligation on the judge to direct them not to draw such an inference and the prosecution cannot comment at all.  To take a specific example, somebody is arrested who has bloodstains on his shirt.  He gives no explanation for that to the garda.  The garda giving evidence can mention the fact that the accused gave no explanation for the bloodstains but the prosecution cannot comment on that and the judge must instruct the jury not to draw an adverse inference from that fact. <Col N="1216" /> A judge could frequently be obliged to direct a jury to act against their common sense.  It is difficult to know how juries come to decisions in any particular case but there must be tremendous pressure on ordinary citizens to draw an adverse inference at the moment.  I would go so far as to say that they probably frequently do so but if they do, they do so against the express directions of the judge.</P>
      <P>These sections will allow what I consider is a matter of commonsense to be legal.  Section 17 allows a jury to draw an inference and, in practice, it will be an adverse rather than a benign inference. It will be an inference of guilt from the failure or refusal of an accused to account, when asked by a garda, for objects, substances or marks found on his clothing or footwear or otherwise in his possession, or at any place where he was arrested.  It applies in specific circumstances as follows: The person must have been arrested without warrant on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence so it can only arise subsequent to arrest.  Any failure to explain marks and so forth in response to questions asked before arrest will not give rise to inferences under this section.  Inferences can only arise subsequent to the Garda exercising the power which they have at the moment to arrest without warrant.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the arresting garda must reasonably believe that the presence, object or mark is attributable to the person's participation in the offence for which he was arrested.  The reasonableness of the garda's belief is an objective test.  Again, it would be open to the court as I said previously, to review it.  However, in this particular instance it is the judge in court who will decide whether it is proper to draw an inference or not.  So, the reasonableness or otherwise of the garda's belief would be a matter which the judge would have to take into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, the garda must inform the person of his belief and request him to account for the object, mark or whatever. Only a proper inference can be drawn and in this regard the jury are subject to the directions of the trial judge as to what would or what would not be proper.  A person cannot be convicted solely on the <Col N="1217" /> basis of an inference drawn from failure or refusal to give an explanation.  If the adverse inference is the evidence, a person cannot be convicted on it.  It can add to the sum total of material evidence. What a jury decide on when they look at the whole <i>corpus</i> of evidence and what particular aspect of that evidence weighs heavily, or most heavily, with them is impossible to say.  I presume that they look at the whole <i>corpus</i> of evidence and it is the weight of the accumulation of parts which decides them.  This would be another piece of evidence, but nobody could be convicted on inference alone.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) applies the section to the condition of clothing or footwear as it applies to a substance or a mark.  This would arise, for example, where the clothing was very wet without being stained.  Obviously, in certain crime situations an inference could be drawn from somebody who is all wet but it would not necessarily constitute a stain.  It is to cover that kind of situation.  Subsection (3) requires that the accused be told in ordinary language what the effect of his refusal might be.  This involves a change in the caution because it has to be done in ordinary language.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked about subsection (4).  It is a saver for existing law under which an adverse inference could be drawn in an appropriate case from the failure or refusal of an accused to give an explanation about an object in his possession or some mark on his clothing to some person when asked to account for it.  For example, where an employer has asked an employee for an explanation for his unauthorised possession of some item of the employer's property or where a member of the accused's family asks him where he got a particular bloodstain.</P>
    <P>There is a reference here I would like to read into the record.  It is Lord Goddard, CJ giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>R v. Aves</i> 1950, who said:</P>
    <P>Where the only evidence is that an accused person is in possession of property recently stolen, a jury may infer guilty knowledge (a) if he offers no explanation to account for his possession or, (b), if the jury are satisfied that <Col N="1218" /> the explanation he does offer is untrue.</P>
    <P>...</P>
    <P>That particular judgment is the reason for subsection (4) because there are limited circumstances in the case of an accused person in possession of property recently stolen, this being the only evidence, where an inference can be drawn at the moment under existing case law. Subsection (4) is to preserve that.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is a provision of a similar nature.  Subsection (1) allows the drawing of appropriate inferences by a court or jury from failure or refusal of an accused to account for his presence at a particular place at or about the time of an offence for which he was arrested without warrant. Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) makes it clear that the arresting garda must have found the person in the particular place at or about the time the offence was committed.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) requires that the arresting garda must reasonably believe that the person's presence in the place is attributable to his participation in the commission of the offence.  Under paragraph (c) he must inform the person of his belief and ask him to explain his presence in the particular place.  Again, as in section 17, it will be a matter for the trial judge to direct the jury as to what inference, if any, may be drawn from the failure or refusal of an accused to account for his presence there.  Subsection (2) provides that the accused must be told by the arresting garda in ordinary language, when he is asked to account for his presence, what the effect of failing to do so might be.  Subsections (3) and (4) are similar to subsections (4) and (5) of section 17.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to the amendments proposed by Deputy Woods I would like to read something for the benefit of the House.  It is the O Briain Report again, which we have referred to frequently, and it is the chairman's addendum, Barra Ó Briain, giving his views on matters which his colleagues felt did not lie within the committee's terms of reference but which Barra Ó Briain felt he wanted to comment on.  It is on page 23, the last paragraph of his addendum.  He dealt <Col N="1219" /> with the concept of the period of detention for questioning and he went on to say:</P>
    <P>A second matter, related to the foregoing, is whether or not a suspect should continue to have the absolute right to remain silent in all cases.  At present, there is no legal obligation to give information to the Garda, apart from certain statutory exceptions.  No adverse inference may be drawn by any jury from such silence.  The prosecution may not even comment on it.  This rule as it stands has been criticised by several very distinguished judges in England, and by well-known teachers of law and authors.  In England, in June, 1972, the Criminal Law Revision Committee, after considering the matter for eight years, advocated the abolition of the right of silence as it hitherto existed.  The British section of the International Commission of Jurists chaired by Sir John Foster, QC, MP was of the opinion that the privilege of the accused to keep silent before his trial should be abolished. The Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Widgery, has expressed the view that the right to remain silent should be modified.  So has Professor Rupert Cross of Oxford University.  Professor Glanville Williams has expressed the view that changes in the law must include the abandonment of the present entitlement of a suspected or accused person to take no part whatsoever in the establishment of the truth.  This right of silence can be no less frustrating to gardaí, honestly and dutifully investigating a crime, than the prohibition on holding suspects for the purpose of questioning them.  Like risks of ill-treatment of persons in custody are involved.  I would favour lessening this risk of ill-treatment in the interests of both suspects and gardaí. I consider that this rule of law should be somewhat modified and that a suspect should be required to answer certain questions.  A refusal or failure to do so might be made the subject of comment by the judge at the trial <Col N="1220" /> and/or by the Prosecution with the leave of the trial judge.  The jury should be told to draw what inference they think proper and commonsense from a refusal to answer all or any such questions.  Such questions might relate to identity and address, marital status, explanation of stains on clothing, property (including money) found upon the suspect, an account of his dealings with a vehicle believed by the gardaí to have been used in a crime, his movements for a specified period of time before and after the crime, and some other kindred questions to be set out in a statute and strictly limited.  Outside of such matters the suspected person would retain his right of silence, as at present, quite unimpaired.</P>
    <P>Barra Ó Briain signs his addendum.  This is what is being suggested here in an even more limited way than Barra Ó Briain has recommended.</P>
    <P>On the amendments proposed by Deputy Woods the effect of both amendments is to prevent an inference being drawn from, as the case may be, objects, marks on an arrested person or from his presence at a particular place at or about the time the offence in question is alleged to have been committed.  The section, if amended as proposed, would simply provide that any such failure or refusal to account for these objects might be given in evidence against the accused where the failure or the refusal was material.  The problem is that is the present law and there is nothing to prevent the arresting garda from saying that he asked the accused to account for an object and he failed or refused to do so.  No inference can be drawn from the failure or the refusal, so the proposed amendment would leave the law unchanged in effect.  The amendment would nullify the efficacy of both sections.  On that basis, subsections (4) and (5) would also be pointless, although the amendment does not propose to delete them.</P>
    <P>The sections are justified on the basis that it is no more than commonsense and that an inference should be drawn from a failure or refusal to account for say, a blood stain or one's presence at the scene <Col N="1221" /> of a crime.  In deciding whether an inference should be drawn, the jury will be guided by the judge's directions.  There is no question of somebody being pulled in just because he happened to be near the scene of a crime.  The person must be reasonably suspected of the offence before he can be arrested.  The reasonableness of the suspicion must be investigated by the courts.</P>
    <P>Since somebody cannot be found guilty solely on the basis of an inference, before he will be brought before a court there must be other evidence.  The argument that this is casting the net too wide and that people who simply happen to be near the scene of a crime can be arrested and brought to the courts and sent to prison does not stand up because an inference on its own cannot possibly convict a person. Secondly the person must be reasonably suspected of the offence before he can be arrested.  The courts are certainly competent to decide that in this instance, whatever arguments we have had about reasonableness previously.</P>
    <P>Since the exercise of the test of reasonableness here will be carried out by the judge who is sitting at the trial, I do not see any problem with that.  If the judge's assessment is that the suspicion was not reasonably based, there is the possibility of an action for false imprisonment. Again the arguments advanced by some people against section 3 are not relevant because somebody would be in court and it would be for a judge to decide in this instance.</P>
    <P>As well as that, before an inference can be drawn a member of the Garda Síochána must reasonably believe that the presence of the object, the mark, or whatever, may be attributable to the participation of the arrested person in the commission of the offence in question. Again there must be a reasonable belief linking the object or the mark with the offence.  This can be tested objectively. The arresting garda must tell the accused in ordinary language and, as I said, this will involve a change in the caution which is being administered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods raised quite a number of specific points.  I think I have dealt with most of them.  He referred to the <Col N="1222" /> possibility of having some mechanism whereby the Garda would be required to give some form of documentation.  I think his idea was that the person being questioned should be provided with some documentary evidence of the questioning and of the questions asked.  That would be a very difficult procedure.  For example, the questioning is most likely to take place immediately after arrest rather than in a Garda station.  If somebody is arrested on reasonable suspicion of having been involved in a crime, and he is at the scene of the crime, questioning could occur straight away.  If somebody has an object in his possession, tools for breaking and entering, for example, which might be associated with the crime, questioning could arise almost immediately. It would be very difficult to administer that.</P>
    <P>I can see the difficulty to which the Deputy has referred.  I will examine whether the regulations, without being too complicated about it, could provide for the evidence to be recorded.  The amendments proposed by Deputy Woods have the effect of cancelling the sections. Rather than amending the section the sections would be of no benefit whatever if the amendments were accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would have the advantage of cancelling the section.  To me that would be the great advantage the amendment would achieve.  I do not intend to take up the time of the House.  Other people who want to make a contribution have come into the House.  In relation to the Ó Briain Report and the addendum proposed by Judge Barra Ó Briain I would not wish in any way to take issue with that learned gentleman.  His contribution in his capacity as a judge and outside the courts of law is beyond question.  His contribution to the State in other respects is also beyond question.  His record of service on and off the bench is uncontested and uncontestable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other people far more proficient in criminal law, I have expressed the gravest reservations about this section and the philosophy behind its drafting.  Deputy Woods has already <Col N="1223" /> expressed the general concern of the Opposition about the section, the shifting of the burden of proof, the inferences and other related matters, the fact that the judges' rules would be effectively abrogated in the sense of their application to this section.</P>
    <P>The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have expressed a view. The Incorporated Law Society have expressed the deepest reservation about, if not outright opposition to, what the section contains.  In addition the Association of Criminal Lawyers have expressed serious reservations.  The accumulation of all that legal wisdom must have some relevance to the Minister, apart altogether from what we as ordinary Dáil Deputies might have to say about it.</P>
    <P>I must genuinely hope that the Fianna Fáil Party oppose the section.  If they were not to oppose the section I would be seen to stand here voice voting once more my total opposition to the section as drafted.  I do not intend to enter into the farce of voice voting a mere back-bencher's opposition to the section.  I should like to place on record my total opposition to it.  Deputy Woods has made a very reasonable and reasoned statement on his opposition to it.  The Minister has responded in kind.  Having regard to my stated opposition to the section as drafted and the philosophy it contains, naturally I am prejudiced and I will come down on the side of Deputy Woods. Without going into the nitty gritty of all the reservations which have been so properly set out for the Minister by Deputy Woods, I want to place on record my total opposition to the section.</P>
    <P>I see section 17 almost in the same light as section 16.  The Minister very wisely buried the old section 16 without honour and I do not see why he cannot similarly bury section 17, or alternatively accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Woods.  I know the Minister has said that if the amendment put down by Deputy Woods is accepted effectively that will do away with the section as drafted.  I am not naive enough to think that the Minister will accept the amendment because <Col N="1224" /> by so doing he would undo all his work. Therefore, I do not ask him to accept the amendment.  However, when it comes to the crunch and when it comes to voting for or against the section I ask that we be consistent in opposition and that we vote against the section.  I do not intend to go through the farce of standing up and calling for a division to voice my opposition but if I had the opportunity and had sufficient Members on my side to challenge a vote I would do so.  However, that is not a reality and I am not in the business of unreality.  I congratulate Deputy Woods on his contribution setting out our opposition to the section as drafted and I support him entirely.  I hope when it comes to the crunch he will challenge the philosophy of the section.  I am not asking him to challenge the Minister in any intimidatory fashion: all I am asking is that the Opposition challenge section 17.</P>
    <P>In my opinion section 17 is a wicked section.  The Minister used a strange example about the blood stain, about the garda giving evidence, about the prosecution not being in a position to pursue that evidence and about the judge directing the jury.  I am not a criminal lawyer but regularly I address civil juries.  I have the greatest of respect for the men and women who serve on juries but I know that if one sows something in the minds of a jury they inevitably hold on to it and it may well colour their judgment.  If there is a miscarriage of justice as a result of this section we will be doing a very bad day's work here.</P>
    <P>I am not in the business of putting Deputy Shatter into a corner.  Deputy Skelly has been honourable in his opposition to the Bill and Deputy Taylor has also spoken on it.  I am appealing to those three individuals who have been continuous in their contributions to the Bill to have a look at this section and try to help us out of our dilemma.  On the one hand we want to give the Minister the good parts of the Bill, to give him those parts that seem correct to deal with what is a real emergency crime situation but, on the other hand, we are being dragged into apparent support for this and the following sections.  I find that an invidious <Col N="1225" /> situation because I am totally opposed to the section.  I am looking for support from Deputies on the other side who have a similar point of view with regard to the section.  The philosophy and the whole concept of the section is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a point that has been raised by the Association of Criminal Lawyers with regard to section 16 and which probably has application to sections 17 and 18.  The association state:</P>
      <P>The draftsmen must not have been aware that (a) above could never arise as at that stage the accused will not have disclosed his defence and the justice in deciding whether or not to send the accused forward could not be in a position to say whether he failed at the relevant time to disclose a material fact.</P>
      <P>They are suggesting that in drafting the Bill the cart was put before the horse and I ask the Minister to consider this matter before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The right to silence is very irritating for those whose job it is to prepare a prosecution in the case of criminals, sometimes hardened criminals.  If a person is caught with his hand in the shop window of a jeweller and remains silent that fact cannot be mentioned in court.  That is very difficult but in overcoming that problem are we getting away from the concept of innocent until proven guilty?  Some people argue that we are.  Some of the learned lawyers whom the Minister has quoted would advocate changes, but not necessarily an entire change, in the right to silence.  We should be very careful when we look at this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems is that this occurs when there is no independent witness present and presumably when the accused is in custody.  The whole proceedings have not been recorded and there is no record the defendant can produce in defence of his or her case.  It smacks a little of the Offences Against the State Act where a chief superintendent can give evidence that he believes a person was a member of the IRA at a given date and that suffices as evidence. <Col N="1226" /> We are getting to the stage where the word of a person can be presented as evidence but where the defendant is not in a position to present contrary evidence. Most evidence has to be substantial, it has to be examined and can be held up to objective testing.  We are getting to the stage where the arresting garda can say that he had a reasonable question to ask which was not answered to his satisfaction and the procedure can be used, with other evidence, against the accused.  I ask the Minister to consider the whole question of recording or having some formal record of the arresting garda's evidence regarding a person remaining silent.  That should be recorded somewhere and the person concerned should be able to have that record examined as part of his defence.</P>
    <P>There does not appear to be any limitation in the section such as confining the matter to the identity and address of the person, marital status or explanation of stains and this point was raised by the Association of Criminal Lawyers.  The Minister should consider the opinions expressed in this House with regard to this matter before coming back to us on Report Stage.  I appreciate the difficulty of the Minister.  At public meetings we get many complaints when crime is discussed. It is complained that if persons are caught in the act of committing a crime they are not able to mention it in court.  In trying to deal with that, we may be getting into avenues which would not be in our best democratic interest and I ask the Minister to consider the various comments and suggestions made on Committee Stage so that we can look at the matter again on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the accused is asked for a certain explanation and he refuses or fails to give that explanation could the Minister explain the difference between the word &ldquo;fails&rdquo; and &ldquo;refuses&rdquo;?  I presume the draftsman is referring to someone who gives information which is false instead of refusing to give any information and that that is failure to give information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods has expressed our position on the Bill very cogently.  While <Col N="1227" /> I agree with Deputy Andrews that we must be dubious about the philosophy that underlies the section, we have not gone so far as asking the Minister to withdraw it or to deny the philosophy which lies behind it.  We proposed quite a reasonable amendment to this section which has the intention if not the effect &mdash; we can dispute that as we debate the wording of the amendment &mdash; of simplifying this legislation, because the Minister must accept, as this side of the House do, that legislation of this sort which constitutes a further curtailment of civil liberties should be as simple and understandable to the ordinary individual as possible.</P>
    <P>From the legal point of view, I find myself in the rather peculiar position of agreeing with what the Minister said in his initial reply to Deputy Woods.  I do not think our amendments are going to do anything in regard to existing law; they will leave it as it is.  We want to bring about a situation whereby not only can the failure or refusal to give an explanation be mentioned but that it can be commented on.  We want it to have the status where it can be presented in evidence and commented upon and where it will constitute part of the totality of the evidence upon which the court makes a decision. My contention is that this could be done in simpler fashion than in this section. The lines proposed to be deleted by us are quite complicated and complex and can give rise to may interpretations and legal difficulties.  I ask the Minister to consider something between our amendment and the section as drafted which will simplify the law which is going to be introduced by this section but which will nevertheless, allow the Minister to achieve what he is trying to do.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of the section states that subsection (1) shall not have effect unless the accused is told by the garda in ordinary language what the effect of his failure or refusal will be.  It is very difficult to imagine how a garda can tell an accused in ordinary language which is intelligible to the accused that if he fails to account for the presence of the object or mark or whatever that the court may draw such <Col N="1228" /> inferences from his failure as may appear to the court to be proper.  He must go on and explain again, presumably in ordinary language, that the failure or refusal may &mdash; not necessarily shall &mdash; on the basis of such inferences be capable of amounting to corroboration of other evidence. It will not be treated as being capable of corroboration of any evidence; it will be treated only as being capable of amounting to corroboration of evidence in relation to which the failure or refusal to give the explanation is material.  It is very difficult to understand how a garda can explain this to an accused in ordinary language which will be intelligible to the accused.</P>
    <P>We are not proposing to delete the lines because we do not believe they should be in the legislation.  I am dubious about it and Deputy Andrews has also expressed doubts.  Our amendment, nevertheless, is designed to simplify it and to bring about a situation where it can be explained in ordinary language to a layman.  Between now and Report Stage we should be able to come up with something which will achieve what the Minister wants to achieve and I understand he has difficulties in relation to this area.  We could do this in simple, intelligible language which can be explained in ordinary language by a garda to an accused person.  Would the Minister be prepared to consider accepting such an amendment or to look at the section between now and Report Stage to see if his own draftsman can come up with an amendment to simplify the section and to make it understandable and intelligible? It is a further curtailment of civil liberties but, presumably, in the Minister's opinion it is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's concerns and worries and, to a non lawyer, it has always been inexplicable that someone who is found with bloodstains on his shirt at or close to the scene of a murder or found in possession of an item which would indicate that he may have been involved in a crime cannot be required to explain himself.  It has always been a fear that people who should properly be convicted of offences <Col N="1229" /> have, by using the right of silence in this area, not been convicted.</P>
      <P>The difficulty that arises under this section relates to the reasons for the rules as they exist which are largely designed to ensure that innocent people are not wrongly convicted of offences.  That concern arises particularly under sections 17 and 18 in that if somebody is standing at the scene of a bank robbery in Grafton Street and is questioned by a garda as to why he is standing there it is not unreasonable to answer that he was waiting to lodge a cheque or was just passing by when he saw a man running out.  That is a reasonable explanation and it is not unreasonable to expect people at the scene of a crime to give an explanation as to why they are there.  I do not think injustices are likely to occur under section 18 but I am concerned that injustice is likely to occur under the provisions of section 17.  Deputy Woods's amendment would effectively remove the effect of the section.  I understand the area of problems with which the Minister is trying to deal.  My concern is that in dealing with it and facing up to it we may create and give rise to another problem &mdash; the conviction of innocent people.  I am also concerned that the section cannot work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy O'Dea in the context of the phrase &ldquo;ordinary language&rdquo;.  I do not understand how a member of the Garda Síochána can explain the meaning of this section in ordinary language to somebody who has been arrested for an offence.  I do not know what that phrase means.  I presume it means language of a nature that is different from the language used in the section.  How is anybody to know how an individual garda can legally explain to an arrested person the meaning of the section?  If he uses language different from the language in the section it is quite probable, unless the garda has legal expertise far greater than we normally expect from a member of the Garda Síochána, that he may convey something quite different from the meaning of the section to the person arrested.  Alternatively if he uses the legalistic phraseology of the section it will not be understood <Col N="1230" /> by the ordinary person who is arrested for an offence.  It is impossible to explain this in ordinary language.</P>
    <P>The Minister's intention is that no inference should be drawn against somebody unless he fully understands how an inference can be drawn.  That is the correct intention but I do not think it can realistically operate.  I do not believe the phrase &ldquo;ordinary language&rdquo; will work. My recollection is that a similar phrase was used in the section which the Minister has now deleted.  This is a major flaw in the section, although it was well intended.  It will create an additional problem in that if in a trial on a criminal action the issue arises as to whether an inference should be drawn we will have trials within trials where it is debated whether a member of the Garda Síochána did or did not explain the effect of the section in ordinary language, what the nature of the explanation was, whether the recipient of the explanation understood it.  Is the comprehension of the explanation essential before an inference can be drawn?</P>
    <P>My concern is that rather than assisting the Garda in their prosecutions this may impede the administration of justice, although it is not designed to do so. Whenever an inference is suggested within a trial, we will have trials within trials.  We will have prolonged debate by way of legal submission and long cross-examinations to ascertain the exact verbiage of the explanation given in ordinary language by a member of the Garda.  The section does not deal with the question of whether the garda must be satisfied that the recipient of the information comprehends it.  Is that an essential part of this section?  That is a fundamental problem with the section as drafted and I do not see a way around the difficulty.  I accept fully that the courts are practical bodies and judges are practical judges and I would anticipate that the courts would eventually through a whole series of case law provide us with a definitive interpretation, but it will take many criminal trials.  We will still have the position of trials within trials.  I hope the Minister will take this point in a constructive way. I do not mean to be destructive of the <Col N="1231" /> section in flaying out wildly at it to make an academic point.  It is a very serious point in the context of the administration of the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>If we take it that the section can work in the manner it is designed to work, let us consider the case of somebody who is suspected of being involved in a murder. There is a blood stain on his shirt, he is charged with the murder and there might be other vague circumstantial evidence that suggests a motive for murder.  The existence of the blood stain on the shirt could result in the jury or the court drawing an inference of guilt.  Initially that would be common sense.  If I have a blood stain on my shirt and I am charged with murder it might be regarded as reasonable that I should explain how I have a blood stain on my shirt.  If I am charged with other crimes and somebody finds a substance on my clothing which might indicate that I have been involved in the making of bombs, or finds a firearm on my person, it might be reasonable to suggest that I should be able to give an explanation as to why it is there.  What is the position if I have been &ldquo;framed&rdquo;, if somebody has sought to set me up for conviction for a criminal offence, if somebody, unknown to me, has borrowed my clothing and left it back in my house with blood stains all over it, having committed a murder?  If I am asked by the Garda how the blood stains came to be on my clothes I will not be able to give an explanation. That is a failure to give an explanation within the meaning of section 17 (1) (c).  If somebody places a substance on my clothing with a view to framing me for a particular offence and I cannot give an explanation as to how the substance is there, an inference can be drawn if I am charged with that offence.  That is my concern about this section.</P>
    <P>Throughout this debate we have constantly made the point that the vast majority of gardaí perform their functions properly and honourably and will always do so.  We have equally made the point that in extending and changing criminal law in the way we are doing we must protect people against possible abuse by a very small minority of <Col N="1232" /> members of the Garda.  We are all aware that it happens on rare occasions.  What happens if a member of the Garda anxious to procure a conviction, not necessarily as dedicated as other members and wanting for personal reasons to advance his career, plants an object onmy person, possibly indicating that I had some involvement in a criminal offence?  He may say in court that he reasonably believed me to be involved in a criminal offence and arrested me and found a mark or an object on my person, be it a firearm or a substance.  The garda may have been responsible for placing that substance in my jacket, unknown to me, or for making a mark on me.  As the accused person, I am asked to provide an explanation as to how it got there and I do not know.  Another garda might place a substance on a person's clothing and a colleague might find it and the accused person would be unable to provide an explanation.</P>
    <P>That is the concern with this section &mdash; the failure to provide an explanation where somebody has been framed, made to appear guilty of having committed a crime, or failing to provide an explanation when something has been planted on him by an unscrupulous member of the Garda Síochána, or by somebody else who wants to get him into trouble.  It can give rise to an inference being drawn which can result in a person being found guilty of a serious crime.  I want to emphasise that I am not suggesting that the vast majority of gardaí would ever consider behaving in that way; in no circumstances am I suggesting that.  Nevertheless we are anxious to ensure that the innocent are not found guilty of serious criminal offences. Historically, the rules which exist at present, and to which the Minister referred very expertly in his comments a short time ago, have existed because our law has sought to bend over somewhat toward ensuring that the innocent are not found guilty.</P>
    <P>The problem about the provisions of this section, as drafted, is that in trying to ensure, as we are anxious to do in this House, that those who have committed criminal offences are found guilty, <Col N="1233" /> we are bending too far in the direction of implicitly acknowledging that we are going to have to sacrifice a few innocent people to ensure that the guilty are sentenced and imprisoned.  In a country with the constitutional provisions we have, in which we have the civil liberties that exist at present, that is not something I am happy about.  Equally I am not certain that this section will in any way increase the conviction rate the Garda are achieving at present in their fight against crime. I am concerned that, in this section, we may be going too far.</P>
    <P>Throughout the course of this debate the Minister has been laudably open-minded in listening to contributions by Members of the House far more than any other Minister of any other Government of which I have had experience in my time as a Deputy here since 1981.  He has been willing to listen to reasoned argument and been willing to introduce appropriate amendments where he felt valid points had been made.  The Minister listened to reasoned argument on section 16.  Much of the debate on Second Stage was concerned in the context of the inferences sections, with section 16 and the worries relating thereto.</P>
    <P>Possibly on Second Stage none of us Deputies considered in sufficient detail section 17 and the dangers I see implicit in it.  I would ask the Minister to apply the same open-mindedness to this section with a view to taking into account some of the comments made by myself and other Deputies to reconsider its provisions in the context of Report Stage.  In our desire to ensure that those who commit horrible criminal offences are convicted, we should ensure that we do not sacrifice innocent people, placing them in jeopardy, or wrongfully convict them of having committed serious offences, in particular to place innocent people in the position of being set up as being guilty, or of having committed criminal offences they have not committed.  That must be seen as one of the major concerns of this section.  In a sense I am less concerned with section 18 and its possible effects on section 17.  That distinction should be drawn.  There are many dangers inherent in section 17 which, in practical terms, <Col N="1234" /> are not inherent in section 18.  Again, in the context of section 18, the Minister correctly said that for people to be required to give an explanation as to why they were present at the scene of a crime they must be reasonably suspected of an offence.  I suppose the fact of being present at the scene of a crime might result in somebody being reasonably suspected of committing an offence and an inference might be drawn.  But unless somebody is present at the scene of the crime and is so drunk as to be incapable of knowing why he is there, and unable to give an explanation, it is difficult to see the provisions of this section necessarily resulting in the injustice that could result from the provisions of section 17.  I presume that if people are drunk outside a bank when a bank robbery is taking place, they are asked by a member of the Garda Síochána why they are there and they are arrested and charged with being involved in the bank robbery, evidence of the fact that they were drunk and unable to give an explanation would certainly result in no court raising an inference.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to lump sections 17 and 18 together.  I would be concerned that the dangers that do exist largely exist in the context of section 17.  I would be concerned that the Minister would have another look at that section in the light of the comments I and other Deputies have made with a view to our dealing with this in a somewhat different way, if not removing the section then certainly seriously amending it on Report Stage.  I am not sure there is a solution to this that would not require the deletion of this section but certainly I feel the need to deal with the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing sections 17 and 18, as we did section 16 which the Minister has withdrawn.  It is perhaps unfortunate that the Minister did not give the House the reasons he withdrew section 16 because such could have thrown some light on the effects of the provisions of sections 17 and 18.  In my view sections 17 and 18 constitute extensions of section 16 in that they directly limit the right of a person's silence, the right of people to remain silent even <Col N="1235" /> before they have been charged.  They may have been arrested but they do not necessarily have to be charged when the questions referred to are asked of them. In relation to section 17, if people are asked questions as to the reasons for having, say, stains on their clothing and they simply said they did not know, would the Minister say if that would constitute a refusal to reply, or would an inference be drawn from that type of reply?  It may well be that in many cases there are stains on clothing for which a person may not have a ready explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large we are dealing with the generality of people who come to the attention of the Garda, who will be frightened when they are taken into custody or are arrested by the Garda and who are at a loss to know what they ought to say or not as the case may be.  They do not have available to them at that time legal advice of any kind nor are they entitled to such at that point, nor to seek legal advice before replying to the questions put to them by the Garda.  It is important to note also that we are not talking about sections which allow a judge or jury to draw an inference from particular objects, or the presence of a person in a particular area, but simply the fact that they do not give an explanation for those stains or objects or for their presence.  As the Minister explained, inferences can be drawn already from particular objects being found in a person's possession.  But in my view to oblige a person to reply to particular questions which could conceivably incriminate him, rightly or wrongly, constitutes an attack on a person's right to silence.  For that reason I do not support these two sections.  The case has not been proved that the right to silence has in any way or to any great degree restricted the Garda's capacity to convict.  Available evidence would indicate that 80 per cent of those convicted are convicted out of their own mouths as a result of confessions made by them. Presumably the remaining 20 per cent are convicted as a result of evidence gathered by the Garda in the course of their work. Such statistics do not indicate that the right to silence of an accused person is to <Col N="1236" /> any large extent hindering the capacity of the Garda to get a conviction.  What concerns me most of all is that these questions will be put by a garda at the time of arrest and that person will not have any advice one way or the other as to whether it is in his or her interest to reply to those questions.  It is a fairly severe attack on a person's right to remain silent.  It is a basic right of people in this State not to be asked to incriminate themselves and for that reason I oppose sections 17 and 18.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, if a person has a stain on his or her clothing or an object in their pocket an inference cannot be drawn from that alone which would find them guilty.  There must be some additional evidence to support that find.  In modern times we often get stains on our clothing and carry objects that may be hard to explain.  For instance, in my last occupation I dealt with coin boxes that got blocked fairly often and I often carried a knife to free those boxes.  I often wondered what would happen if I got mixed up in a street fracas where knives were being used by two gangs of people fighting and was arrested and searched by the Garda while I had the knife in my possession.  If I was charged how would I satisfy the Garda about my possession of the knife?  It is quite possible that my explanation would not satisfy the Garda and I might find myself before a court.  In that case the additional evidence the Minister spoke of earlier would be introduced, that I had a knife in my pocket and I had been arrested at a place where people were using knives although I was completely innocent.  As Deputy Andrews said, that might colour the minds of a jury when considering their verdict.  I should like the Minister to spell out clearly what paragraph (c) means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures being introduced in these sections cannot be looked at in isolation.  They represent a major intrusion and reversal of the entire history of the criminal law going back for hundreds of years.  They are combined in the Bill with another link measure which will work in interlocking fashion with <Col N="1237" /> these, the measure authorising a member of the Garda Síochána to arrest a person merely on suspicion.  The combination of these two items is a very lethal development. The fact is that the Garda may under this legislation arrest and detain a person for many hours on suspicion and under these sections call upon that person before he or she is charged with an offence before any independent personage of authority is brought on the scene to submit to cross-examination.  The fact that a cross-examination was to take place hitherto required the presence of an independent judicial personage, a district justice or whatever.</P>
      <P>If there is to be a cross-examination before charging I believe the entire proceedings should be recorded or an independent judicial person be present.  To attach a guilt position on an arrested person by reason only of the fact that he does not immediately in a critical situation come up with reasons, answers and explanations to a cross-examination by a member of the Garda Síochána could give rise to a miscarriage of justice.  A person may remain silent for various reasons.  Perhaps the person does not have the ability to articulate a position clearly.  Perhaps the person is in a state of fear arising out of the consultation he finds himself in with people in power, namely gardaí, throwing authoritative questions at him.  One can visualise a situation where a person could be constrained through fear from giving answers at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person could well be in fear from finding himself in an unaccustomed position or environment and, following on the results of being held in isolation for many hours, that person may make a rational decision not to say anything.  The person concerned could be a stubborn individual when confronted by agents of the State.  It may be a bad thing to be stubborn in that situation but it does not involve inferences of crime.  The question of stubbornness and refusal to give an answer would then become a very substantive measure of evidence when the case would go to hearing.  A person in that situation may believe that the allegations against him were so baseless and <Col N="1238" /> outrageous that they would not warrant a reply.  He could be so appalled by what was being put to him that he would wave the whole thing away as an outrage but in doing so could put himself in a serious position, he, perhaps, being an innocent person.  It could be that the person would not understand the process in which he was participating unwillingly.  The person may be downright stupid and not have the grip at all of the process that is taking place.  He may not understand the niceties and intricacies of the sections of this Bill and be quite unaware, notwithstanding an explanation given to him by a member of the Garda Síochána, that certain serious consequences from an evidence point of view would follow if he did not answer the cross-examination questions put to him.</P>
    <P>If these measures are enacted in their present form without any alteration I believe there would be constant allegations by accused persons against the Garda that evidence given that they were requested to explain marks, conditions or whatever, were pure fabrication.  The question of determination of those allegations, as Deputy Shatter rightly pointed out, will give rise to endless confrontation and endless conflicting evidence back and forth.  I do not think criminal lawyers or criminal courts will look forward to that with any degree of equanimity.  I suggest for the Minister's consideration a possible amendment which would to some extent alleviate the position and, perhaps, improve it.  My suggestion is that we provide at the very least that the member of the Garda Síochána in this situation be obliged to provide the person arrested with a written statement of his or her belief and incorporate in it the request to the person to account for the presence of the object, substance or mark, and that the tendering of the written statement and request be accompanied by a request to the person concerned to acknowledge receipt of it by signing it if he so wished.  In that way the matter would in some measure be transferred from purely verbal confrontation into a written element and at least the person would have the opportunity of having a written document which he <Col N="1239" /> could have some time to examine and read and have a better understanding of than he might very well take up from a verbal communication put to him under unfriendly circumstances by a member of the Garda Síochána.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at that suggestion and perhaps consider it for incorporation in the Bill on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First of all, I would like to thank Deputies for their contributions.  Deputy Mitchell began by making points which were made by, I think he said, one of the groups who made a submission on the Bill.  The points he made applied to section 16 which has now been withdrawn.  They did not apply at all to section 17 or section 18.  The point was that under section 16 an inference could arise from the failure of an accused to mention a fact that became part of his defence subsequently and that at the early stage of questioning by the Garda the accused could not be expected to know what was or was not evidence material to his defence.  Now that section 16 is gone there is no carry-over effect to section 17 or section 18 of that concept. Section 16 concerned the case of the accused failing to mention something. Sections 17 and 18 apply to his failing or refusing to give an account.  There will be evidence of this at the preliminary examination stage and a justice can take it into account if proper, but only if proper, in deciding in the first instance whether to return the accused for trial and subsequently, if there is a trial before a jury, it will be a matter for the judge to direct the jury whether it is proper to draw an inference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various Deputies referred to section 16.  I stated, when the amendments were published, my reasons for withdrawing section 16.  I said that it is widely drawn, that it could apply before arrest, whereas under these sections one has to be arrested on reasonable suspicion.  I said also that I proposed to withdraw it because of the consensus of opposition and that I believed that in a Bill as serious in intent as the Criminal Justice Bill it was desirable for me to seek to achieve <Col N="1240" /> as much consensus as I could.  I think the withdrawal of section 16 certainly has had that effect.  I never had any difficulty with the principle of section 16.  My position remains the same on that.  I did not withdraw section 16 because we had a change of mind about the principle involved.  The points made by Deputy Mitchell are appropriate to section 16 but not to section 17 or section 18.  That is why I am referring to section 16 here.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea asked me initially to distinguish between &ldquo;fails&rdquo; and &ldquo;refuses&rdquo; in the section as drafted.  A failure would be to rely on remaining silent altogether and say nothing.  A refusal would be for the person arrested to say that he will not give an explanation. Therefore, on the one hand one remains absolutely silent, &mdash; that is a failure &mdash; on the other hand one speaks to affirm that one will not give an explanation.</P>
    <P>The question of ordinary language has been brought up.  Of course, there is no intention that the Garda will take the Bill around in their pockets and quote the sections.  It is intended that it will be non-legal language, ordinary language, in the sense that ordinary people will understand it.  However, it will not be left to the discretion of the Garda to judge what is ordinary language and what is not.  I have said in my previous submissions that there would have to be a new caution to meet this requirement of ordinary language.  Obviously, there would be variations on it because we are talking about objects, marks, present at the place of a crime, so there are those variations on the specifics of sections 17 and 18.  Gardaí, of course, will be given instructions as to the caution which it would be appropriate to give.  The form would have to be worked out with the Attorney General so that the caution would be a proper caution, legally proper as well as in ordinary language.  There is no question of the Garda trying to cope with the technical language of section 17 (1) or section 18 (1).  As we move along to the stage that tape recording gets off the ground, a taped record will be available in many instances.</P>
    <P>Section 18 would be more likely to apply outside the Garda station than in <Col N="1241" /> the Garda station in the sense that it is specifically confined to giving an explanation of being near or at the scene of a crime and requires, before it can be used, being arrested and reasonable suspicion that one was involved in a crime.  I can envisage a situation where questioning by the Garda could arise immediately and a person might be required to explain his presence at a place rather than in the Garda station, and that certainly would not be taped.  The intent of the new caution and the ordinary language is pretty clear.  We have not yet worked out the formula.  We must consult the Attorney General on it.  For example &mdash; and this is not meant to be definitive &mdash; a garda might say: &ldquo;You have what look like bloodstains on your shirt and I believe that these stains show that you were involved in the crime.  Tell me how they got there.  I must warn you that, if you do not or will not tell me, the court or jury, if you are tried, may hold your refusal against you&rdquo;.  That is fairly ordinary.  I am not advocating that as the caution; I am just trying to give an example of the type of caution in ordinary language which might be used and which would be easily understood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is no obligation to speak.  The person can refuse and then there is the problem of the inference in the court.  If somebody is detained under section 3 the Garda have the right to ask that person a number of questions anyway.  This does not extend it in any way.  There are other possible formulae of words.  By giving an example here I am trying to give the general flavour and intent of the subsection rather than putting forward a definitive formula of words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter made the point that there could be long arguments initially in the cases being taken to court.  There would be the trial within the trial and anxiety on the part of the defence to prove that the language was not ordinary, that the Garda did not have reasonable suspicion on arrest.  Many of these issues <Col N="1242" /> would arise.  I expect that this will happen initially no matter what form of words is chosen.  I presume that any criminal lawyer working for the defence will seek to interpret the Act formally before the court.  I am sure that in many cases our intent will be examined and the courts will give decisions on that.  That will occur with anything that we do here.  Already we have an amendment which says that these sections 3 to 8 and 13 to 18 will lapse after four or five years unless renewed by the Oireachtas.  I am coming in on Report Stage with a four-year time period.  There will be a period in which to evaluate what is happening in court and a period to monitor the effects of these sections.  They may be interpreted by the courts either in a more restrictive or in amore liberal way than I intended; but that, too, will have to be monitored.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter talked about framing people, about planting blood stains on another person's clothes, for instance.  On the question of giving an explanation, he gave two examples &mdash; forensic evidence of possession of illegal firearms or the stealing of someone's clothes with the person who stole them murdering someone and then returning the clothes covered in the blood of the victim.  The person suspected could be asked for an explanation and Deputy Shatter posed the question of what would be the position of such a person failing to give an account.  I do not know if that would be failure to give an account but the arrested person should hardly stop there.  He should say that when he got home he found the blood-stained clothing in his house but that he had no idea of how they had become blood-stained.  That would not be failure to give an account.  It would be an explanation in so far as the person being questioned could give an explanation. It might not seem a very adequate explanation but once an explanation is given, the terms of section 17 would not apply.</P>
    <P>If someone is being framed in such an elaborate fashion he has a problem without section 17 being law at all if the blood group matches that of the victim and if he cannot give an explanation.  If he has an illegal firearm which can be traced to <Col N="1243" /> a murder or to any other crime, he has a problem.  Deputy Shatter has put the case as if the implications of section 17 would bring about a situation where innocent people would be found guilty in the sort of cases he gave as examples.  The danger is very real that they would be found guilty either with or without section 17 in such cases.  A person framed in that way would not be the one to refuse an explanation. He is the one who would be at pains to explain that so far as he was concerned he did not know where the blood-stained clothing or the illegal firearm came from, that he was elsewhere when they were planted in his house.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter made a number of points on this and there is one in particular I should like to refer to.  He said he did not have the same difficulty with section 18 as with section 17.  He talked about a person standing outside a bank after a robbery had occurred in the bank and being questioned by a garda as to why he was standing there and replying that he had been on his way to cash a cheque.  That would not arise although the Deputy suggested it in a manner which indicated that he found it acceptable. Section 18 does not go that far.  The person would have to be suspected of involvement in the crime and then arrested.  The Garda, in terms of suspicion, would have to be able to tie in the person's presence with the crime.  The idea of someone being drunk or simply being near the bank at the time on legitimate business but falling foul of section 18 could not arise.  Yet Deputy Shatter considered the kind of scenario he presented to be acceptable.  What is involved in section 18 is far more restrictive than that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred also to a trial within a trial and spoke of the inhibitions on the Garda and so on.  I will take his views into account.  He has made many contributions to the Bill and many of these have been beneficial to me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter argues on the one hand that the section cannot work.  If it cannot work there is no problem.  He spoke about the possibility of innocent people being convicted.  If the Garda are inhibited <Col N="1244" /> by the section, innocent people will not be found guilty.  The Deputy raised four or five points which are all good debating points but some of them are not valid because one contradicts the other. They are mutually exclusive.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa also mentioned a number of points.  If an accused person innocently acquired blood stains and genuinely did not know about them, an inference would not be proper.  However, the Garda must reasonably believe that the stains are attributable to the participation of the person in an offence.  He would be liable to cross-examination and if he had an innocent explanation it would be probable that the charge would not be brought or, if brought, that he would be acquitted. On the other hand, if he refused to give an explanation, why should an inference not be proper?</P>
    <P>There are people who disagree with the principle involved.  There are others who do not disagree with it but who are concerned about the practical operation of it.  This can be worked out only in a court.  If a garda says in court that an accused refused to give an explanation as to how his clothes became blood stained, the garda will be liable to be cross-examined by the defence.  The judge, listening to the situation, will weight it up and decide whether an inference is proper. He would then instruct the jury accordingly. We are not talking about a situation in which the Garda would have the right to insist that a court draw inferences as if there was no judge present.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa asked also about access to a solicitor and about whether it would be proper to have legal advice.  If somebody has been charged he cannot be questioned.  The power to take a person to a Garda station in the first instance would be under section 3.  Under section 4 we have provided for the right of access to a solicitor.  The right of access to legal advice is an existing right, but a person will have to be informed of it.  Somebody could be questioned before reaching the Garda station or before a solicitor had arrived but the access to a solicitor is provided for.  There is also a right to private confidential conversation out of hearing of the Garda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> Deputy Doyle talked about carrying a knife.  Obviously, there would be difficulties for someone found in that situation. A knife could be termed an offensive weapon if it was found at the scene of a knife fight and if someone had been wounded or killed.  The only way section 17 would affect a person in such circumstances is that he would have to give an explanation as to why he was carrying a knife.  If the person gave an explanation no inference would be drawn but there would still be a problem.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ruaidhri Roberts, the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Mr. Patrick Malone, the former Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, were members of the Ó Briain Committee.  Mr. Justice Barra Ó Briain was its chairman.  The committee's terms of reference were to recommend with all convenient speed whether, and if so, what, additional safeguards were necessary or desirable for the protection against ill-treatment of persons in Garda custody.  In his addendum Justice Barra Ó Briain looked at this and stated:</P>
    <P>This right of silence can be no less frustrating to gardaí honestly and dutifully investigating a crime, than the prohibition on holding suspects for the purpose of questioning them.  Like risks of ill-treatment of persons in custody are involved.  I would favour lessening this risk of ill-treatment in the interest of both suspects and gardaí.  I consider that this rule of law should be somewhat modified...</P>
    <P>Deputies have put forward the argument that section 17 provides gardaí with a mechanism for pressuring and framing people and ill-treating them while in custody. Ó Briain took the opposite view and felt that the frustration experienced by gardaí by being in the company of someone who picks out a spot on the wall and insists on looking at it and refuses to answer any question leads to the kind of build-up of frustration which could result in the ill-treatment of people while in custody.  Ó Briain was not giving free advice on the legal system when he wrote his addendum.  What he was saying was that he felt the power of having a reasonable <Col N="1246" /> period of detention for questioning and the introduction of the power to draw inferences in this limited way contributed to the better treatment of people in custody. If a person refused or failed to give an explanation about, for example, a bloodstain or a mark, the garda could say to himself: &ldquo;I do not have to keep questioning. It will be portion of my evidence in the Book of Evidence that the accused failed to comply with section 17 or section 18.&rdquo;  That would be part of the case against the accused.  That line of argument is as legitimate in my opinion and in that of Justice Barra Ó Briain as the argument which says that sections 17 and 18 are sections which enable gardaí to ill-treat people in custody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor spoke about combining section 3 and section 17 or section 18 to provide gardaí with a lever for pressuring people.  He said we should not look at them in isolation but remember what has already been done.  I referred to the Ó Briain Report to give the other side of that argument.  The vast majority of the Garda are good and dutiful.  They are interested in solving crime and do not wish to ill-treat anyone.  They are being provided with a civilised way of dealing with this dilemma.  If someone refuses or fails to give an account an inference can be drawn in court if the judge considers it proper.  The garda will have done his job.</P>
    <P>The problems of fear, inhibition, inability to articulate or a person of a stubborn disposition and a rational desire to say nothing, or a person who does not understand the process have all been mentioned by Deputy Taylor.  The position is that a garda will be cross-examined. The defence can put forward the case for the accused and the judge will decide whether it is proper to draw an inference or not.  The judge may be able to decide, for example, in the case of a young person, through school reports or reports from the probation officer and so on, that he was not a person who could give explanations.  Deputy Taylor mentioned that it could be a case of simple stupidity or a mentally handicapped person. In such circumstances a judge would <Col N="1247" /> not consider it proper for an inference to be drawn.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor and Deputy Woods mentioned the idea of providing the person who is being questioned with a written explanation.  This would not be practicable in the sense of writing it into the Bill, particularly in the context of section 18.  Questioning could take place when gardaí came upon a person at the scene of a crime if they suspected the person was linked to the crime.  It would not be proper to put an obligation on the gardaí to produce a written statement on the roadside or to have formal proceedings for serving it on the accused, getting signatures and so on.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes.  I see the point being made by both Deputies and it is quite valid.  I will give it consideration by including in the treatment regulations a provision which would require the garda to record in the custody records the fact that questions under these sections were asked of the suspect and possibly the nature of his replies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews mentioned the danger of turning gardaí into bureaucrats and said the Bill was bureaucratic legislation. He referred to various instances where forms had to be filled and notices had to be served on people.  This is another example.  However, I will look at the point made.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea seemed to agree with the intent of these sections.  However, he thought the sections as drafted were very complicated.  The sections are the result of several drafts.  I do not think they are particularly complicated.  Deputy O'Dea is not here now.  I do not mean that facetiously.  He thought it would be better if the sections were simplified and seemed to have some ideas on it.  If he will communicate with me we will look at the sections again if there is a possibility of simplifying the draft.  The simplification of sections would be to everyone's benefit, especially judges who will have to interpret the Bill in the final analysis.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister clarify the operation of this from a timing viewpoint? The garda asks a question and the person fails or refuses to give an explanation. In one case it could take a person five minutes to give an answer and in another case perhaps he will think of an explanation in an half an hour.  If he was asked to explain a mark or a stain on a such-and-such at night, the accused may say he will think about it and he could remember perhaps the next morning. Has he failed to give an account?  Is there a time element?  How does the Minister see it working from that point of view?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not think that is a failure.  A refusal would be telling the garda he was saying nothing, that he was refusing to give any explanation. A failure would be if he remained silent.  The situation the Deputy mentions is where a person would say &ldquo;I have to think about that, I probably have an explanation but I want to think about it&rdquo;. He is neither failing nor refusing at that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume he will get the 20 hours under the detention sections to think about it.  The Minister said the caution would have to be worked out with the Attorney General.  This is one of the problems we have in dealing with this Bill.  It is clear that these changes will alter the caution which will be involved. The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors put forward their view of what the caution should be because they see that this would alter the caution required under the Judges' Rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our problem is that the Minister has not written in the caution he would see applying and he tells us this will have to be worked out with the Attorney General. This is like other sections in this Bill.  We are told the regulations have yet to be worked out and that we must rely on the Minister and his undertaking that he will not go ahead with certain sections until they are worked out.  Recently we were told that the complaints procedure will also have to be worked out and that <Col N="1249" /> it will come back before the House in due course.</P>
    <P>It was possible to have information about this complaints procedure leaked to a particular newspaper last week.  This newspaper said that the Government were to set up a Garda complaints body. In <i>The Irish Times,</i> 15 June 1984, Peter Murtagh, security correspondent, said that the whole procedure of the complaints body had been examined by <i>The Irish Times.</i>  This is an affront to this House.  We are now being asked to consider the most serious changes in the law for many a year, without being told what the Minister has in mind, because these matters have to be worked out.  Yet, I can read about this in a newspaper.  Other newspapers only got a little information about it, but obviously there was a leak to one newspaper.  This is not the first time there has been a leak from the Department of Justice to the correspondent in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be in a position to accept that assurance, and if the Minister gives me a personal assurance that this information did not come from him I will accept it but we all know there are many ways this can happen without him being personally involved. What we have to face here is the reality of what actually happened.  We come into this House and spend long hours debating these sections, trying to be helpful because people on all sides of this House realise the seriousness of this Bill.  We <Col N="1250" /> have done our utmost to improve the Bill before it becomes law and the Minister recognises that.  These proposals were circulated to a wide variety of people according to this statement.  Surely the Members of this House, who have been working so assiduously in this area, could have been trusted with some of these widely circulated, draft proposals which were obviously given to this particular paper.  This type of thing is bringing this House into disrepute.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my questions about the Judges' Rules and what changes will be taking place.  He has answered my question about the caution. Apparently the caution has not yet been worked out.  It has to be agreed with the Attorney General and we presume when it is, it will come back before this House and we will have an opportunity to discuss it, perhaps in conjunction with the regulations the Minister promised.</P>
      <P>The Ó Briain Report in relation to the right of silence said that the rule as it stands had been criticised by several very distinguished judges in England and by well known teachers of law and authors. In England, the Criminal Law Revision Committee had considered the matter for eight years.  This is very relevant because it indicates at least the seriousness of the changes we are discussing and the importance of our attempts to get these changes right.  We are not disagreeing with what Barra Ó Briain said.  He made a policy statement.  He did not draft it or provide the legal framework for it, but he made a policy statement.  It is on those policy objectives that we are prepared to support these sections in principle, but we still have a duty to draft them legally.  I put down this amendment so that we could fully discuss the section and try to find a middle ground between the position adopted by the Minister in the Bill and the proposal in my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews mentioned a very interesting and relevant fact.  He spoke about the danger of the step we are taking colouring the judgment of the jury in a particular case.  He said that if a jury can draw inferences from the subsection which they would not otherwise be in a position to draw, it would appear that a <Col N="1251" /> failure or refusal to give an account is being given an artificial status and in that respect, it can be seen to be usurping the judicial function of the court and its constitutionality could be questioned.</P>

    <P>A special inquiry was undertaken to establish the estimated cost in 1983 of the administration of PAYE.  The figure which emerged was £22.4 million which is 1.6 per cent of the net PAYE receipt in that year.</P>

Due to the <Col N="1049" /> overall reduction in numbers employed and the general scaling down of operations on the scheme there was insufficient work to justify the continued full-time employment of two welders.

      <P>Medical cards are issued to persons with full eligibility for health services, i.e. persons who are unable to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up to assist the chief executive officers in determining applications for medical cards.  I have recently announced that from July 1984 a special allowance for persons over 66 years will be incorporated in the income guidelines.  This allowance will be as follows: Persons aged between 66 years and 80 years &mdash; £5 per week (£10 if married).  Persons aged 80 years and over &mdash; £8 per week (£16 if married).</P>
      <P>This allowance will bring greater uniformity into the assessment of means in dealing with applications for medical cards and for non-contributory old age pensions.  It should enable all persons who are in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions to qualify for medical cards.  I accept that there is scope for further improvement in uniformity in assessing income for health and social welfare purposes generally and consultations have been taking place between the two Departments in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 490 and 491 together.</P>
      <P>Each of the members of the Special Government Task Force on Drug Abuse has been given responsibility for ensuring that the recommendations relevant to them are implemented without any undue delay.  The task force is currently monitoring progress made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress has been made to date on most of the recommendations. On the law enforcement side a Bill to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, has been circulated to Deputies and Second Stage will be taken today.  The Criminal Justice Bill is also progressing through the Dáil at the moment.  Additional ban-gardaí have been assigned to the drug units in Dublin, Cork and Limerick as recommended by the task force.  A more rigorous checking system for applications for passports has also been introduced by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The recommendation relating to the appointment of one judge of the Circuit Court and one district justice who would have special responsibility for all cases involving drug offences in the Dublin area is being pursued with the appropriate authorities &mdash; so also is the recommendation relating to the appointment of one solicitor in the Chief State <Col N="1054" /> Solicitor's Office who would specialise in drug offence case work.</P>
    <P>In the area of education, significant progress has also been made.  A set of five video films has now been developed by the Department of Education, in co-operation with the Health Education Bureau, for use within the context of &ldquo;life skills&rdquo; type programmes in second level schools, youth club settings or with parent groups.  The Minister for Education has asked the new Curriculum and Examinations Board to examine the introduction of health education in schools &mdash; at both primary and post-primary levels.  It is also planned to develop the programmes of training in drugs education so that selected teachers would be able to attend longer courses and progress would be made towards the stated Government aim of having at least one teacher who will be in a position to advise on aspects of the drug problem in each school in &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; areas.  I have also made money available to Trinity College to provide a diploma course in addiction studies.  This course commenced in January 1984 and provides specialised training for workers in direct contact with drug abusers and their families.  Such workers include social workers, teachers, guidance counsellors and the gardaí.</P>
    <P>On the youth and community development side, the task force has met the Health Education Bureau, Cospóir, the National Youth Council and the National Youth Policy Committee.  The task force is currently examining, in conjunction with all of the organisations involved, how the existing services are integrated at the point of delivery and how the services might be improved where necessary.</P>
    <P>The Medico-Social Research Board are currently carrying out four research projects on specific aspects of the drug problem among adolescents.  It is hoped to bring them to a conclusion within the next few months.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the treatment and rehabilitation services is that discussions are on-going between representatives of my Department and the authorities of St. James's Hospital and Jervis Street Hospital concerning the recommendations <Col N="1055" /> of the Ministerial task force which relate to treatment facilities to be provided by both hospitals.</P>
    <P>My Department have already had discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board and the Coolemine therapeutic community and I have made additional funds available this year to assist the Coolemine community in meeting the demands being made upon its services.  The Eastern Health Board are examining, at my request, the specific needs of young people with drug-related problems and my Department are keeping in touch with the board in this regard. It will be clear from this that all of these recommendations are being vigorously pursued.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 26 March 1984 and has been paid to 11 June 1984, the date of the latest medical certificate received.  He is not entitled to pay-related benefit as regulations operative from 4 April 1984 provide that pay-related benefit is not payable where the total amount of disability benefit payable equals or exceeds 75 per cent of a claimant's average weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year.  In the claimant's case 75 per cent of his average reckonable weekly earnings in the income tax year ended 5 April 1983 has been calculated as £71.63. Disability benefit is being paid at the weekly rate of £90.15.</P>

      <P>The original claim to widow's non-contributory pension in March 1982 by the person concerned was refused because her means at that time exceeded the limit which then applied.

She appealed against this decision but the appeal was disallowed by an appeals officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a widow takes an active part in the running of a farm certain monetary disregards are allowed in respect of qualified children in the calculation of her means for widow's non-contributory pension purposes.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the circumstances of the person concerned in December 1982, the rate of non-contributory pension payable to her was reduced to £23.70 because her weekly means, derived from a farm and capital, were assessed at £53.34 per week as against £15.28 prior to that.  She had by that time ceased to participate in the management of the family farm.  The amounts previously disregarded when calculating her means were therefore no longer allowable to her and she was assessed with her full share of the total income received from the letting of the farm.  She was notified of this decision on 1 March 1983 and of her right to appeal, if dissatisfied with it.  No appeal was received from her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, following a further review last year the assessment of weekly means was reduced to £49.13 and as a consequence her pension was increased to £27.70 per week from 15 March 1983 and to £36.25 from 1 July 1983 on the implementation of the budget improvements for that year.  This is the rate payable to a widow under 66 years with four qualified <Col N="1077" /> children whose means exceed £48 per week but do not exceed £50.  It will be further increased to £41.85 from 6 July next.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for award of widow's contributory pension under Irish legislation is that a yearly average of at least 24 contributions must have been paid or credited on the late husband's or the widow's own insurance. This condition was not satisfied on either record in the case of the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Protracted inquiries were needed to establish the full insurance record for her late husband because he also had United Kingdom insurance and the widow's claim therefore required to be examined under EEC Regulations.  However, it has been established that there is no entitlement to this pension and she has been notified accordingly.  Her possible entitlement <Col N="1078" /> to a pension from Britian is currently under investigation by the United Kingdom authorities and they will inform her of the outcome.</P>
    <P>The position of the person concerned with regard to a widow's non-contributory pension in this country was also examined (in November 1983) but because her weekly means of £113.07, derived from the profit from a shop and a British widow's allowance at that time, exceeded the limit of £40 per week for the receipt of pension by a widow under 66 years of age with no qualified children, her application was refused.  The British allowance was due to cease in February 1984 and she was advised, depending on her circumstances generally, to re-apply at that stage for the non-contributory widow's pension.  No claim was, however, received from her.  In view of the question by the Deputy a social welfare officer has been asked to investigate the claimant's present circumstances and her case will be reviewed when his report is received.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are three horses at Derrycloney, Mountmellick, which graze in the day-time on waste ground and wide margins adjoining the public road.  As far as Garda observations go, the horses are always kept secured. The Garda state that at night the horses are tied up on waste ground adjoining the bridge at Derrycloney.  The Garda state further that they have not seen the horses wandering on the public road nor have they received any complaint to that effect.</P>

      <P>It is not proposed in connection with the formulation of local authorities (higher education grants) schemes in 1984 to include a provision for the payment of the grants to students other than those following full-time courses.  It would not be feasible within the financial resources available to provide for the payment of such grants to part-time day students, or students attending night courses, at the present time.</P>
