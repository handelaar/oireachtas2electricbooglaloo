    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 13:</P>
    <P>In page 5, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(8) To avoid doubt, it is hereby declared that a person who is being detained pursuant to subsection (2) in connection with an offence shall in no case be held in detention (whether for the investigation of that or any other offence) for longer than twelve hours from the time of his arrest, not including any period which is to be excluded under subsection (6) or (7) in reckoning a period of detention&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this amendment relates to the detention of persons for an unspecified period if they have to be referred to a hospital.  I oppose a section which allows for a person to be detained without taking into account the fact that they are still under arrest.  When I spoke in this debate before Easter, I said that a person could be moved to a prison hospital or any other hospital where detention can take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum period allowed under the section is 12 hours excluding subsections (6) and (7) which <Col N="1052" /> the Minister said he would be studying again.  The concern of the House was not to have the 12 hours plus the eight hours rest followed by 48 hours under the Offences Against the State Act.  Subsection (8) says that nothing in the section shall affect the operation of section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939. Irrespective of the limit of 12 hours, could the Offences Against the State Act then apply after the 12 hours and would the question of rearrest be prohibited under section 3 of the Offences Against the State Act?  In other words can we then have 48 hours plus 20 hours?  That is what we were discussing before Easter, and the Minister was about to explain whether the opposite would apply, that you could have 12 hours and that the Offences Against the State Act would apply.  The Minister referred to a combination of section 3 plus the Offences Against the State Act equalling 60 or 68 hours, including the rest period.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to amendment No. 27 which deals with section 8. I should be glad if the Minister would explain if there could be 48 hours under the Offences Against the State Act on top of the 12 hours under section 3 because, under section 8 (1) a person arrested under that authority may be detained persuant to section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It was always the intention that 12 hours would be the maximum period of detention, apart from subsections (6) and (7) which we discussed.  Concern was expressed, inside and outside the House on Second Stage, that one or two things could happen, that there could be situation where people could be rearrested and held for subsequent periods of 12 hours and that this provision here could be combined with the provision for detention under the Offences Against the State Act, giving a combination of 12 and 24 or 48 hours as the case may be.  The amendment I am proposing here is to avoid any doubt &mdash; it says that person who is being detained pursuant to subsection (2) in connection with an offence shall in no case be held in detention (whether for the investigation of that or any other <Col N="1053" /> offence) for longer than 12 hours from the time of his arrest, not including any period which is to be excluded under subsection (6) or (7) in reckoning a period of detention.  That takes care of one fear.  The other fear, of combining this section with the Offences Against the State Act, is not likely to have been realised.  Amendment No. 27, section 8 (1) says that where a person arrested on suspicion of having committed an offence is detained pursuant to section 3 and is released without any charge having been made against him, he shall not be arrested again for the same offence.  That precludes the possibility of somebody who was arrested under the section and held for 12 hours being released and arrested again under the Offences Against the State Act and being held for some portion of the 48 hour period.  Subsection (3) says that where a person who has been arrested under section 30 of the Act of 1939 in connection with an offence is released without any charge having been made against him, he shall not be detained pursuant to section 3 and so on. In section 8 (1) the fear that a 12 plus 48 situation could pertain is removed and at (3) the fear that you would start with an arrest under the Offences Against the State Act and that somebody could be rearrested under section 3 of this Bill is also removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister is doing and that this amendment, in combination with amendment No. 27, is an attempt to clarify this matter.  However, there are still loopholes.  The purpose of amendment No. 27, as the Minister has pointed out, is to ensure that the 48 hour period cannot be followed by a 12 hour period&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It also applies <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) of amendment No. 27 says where a person who has been arrested under section 30 of the Act of 1939 in connection with an offence is released without any charge having been made against him, he shall not be <Col N="1054" /> detained pursuant to section 3.  That is the 48 hour period followed by 12 as I said initially.  At first glance one would be inclined to think that the Minister has cut off the combination of a 48 hour period followed by 12.  However, if you read on, it says he shall not be detained pursuant to section 3 (a) in connection with the first mentioned offence, or (b) in connection with any other offence of which, at the time of his arrest for the first mentioned offence, the member of the Garda Síochána by whom he was arrested suspected him.  Therefore, he cannot be rearrested in relation to the first mentioned offence, for which he was arrested under section 30.  However, in relation to (b) they could continue with a case that had arisen during that interrogation and which was not known or identified at the beginning.  On that basis it seems that the 12 hours could, in those circumstances, follow the 48.</P>
      <P>I know it is a complicated situation.  It seems to me that while the Minister has closed off the generality of cases the reference to another offence leaves open an offence of which he was not suspected at the time of his arrest.  This might arise during an interrogation.  If something is raised during questioning or interrogation it could be pursued in a further 12 hours.  I should like to hear what the Minister thinks about that.  They affect one another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree because they are related.  Could the Minister give us his views on that point?  I accept that he has tried to close off the 48 hours followed by the 12 hours, but it seems to me that if something arises during the interrogation a further 12 hours could follow the 48 hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is closed off in the generality of cases but, in a situation such as the one outlined by the Deputy, I cannot work a mechanism for actually closing it off.  If there are <Col N="1055" /> extraordinary circumstances such as that, the opening is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect that means there could be 48 hours followed by 12 hours. That is the point we are trying to get clear.  My amendment No. 14 proposes that we insert:</P>
      <P>Provided that no person shall at any time be detained without being charged with an offence for a consecutive period in excess of 48 hours.</P>
      <P>No matter what the circumstances, the total period should not exceed 48 hours. If the Minister accepts that as a separate amendment, it closes off any circumstances in which there could be an extension beyond 48 hours.  That is the spirit of what we have been discussing.  As far as Deputies were concerned, this was a separate provision to deal with special circumstances.  It was never intended to be an extension beyond 48 hours.  On that basis, if the Minister is prepared to accept amendment No. 14 that would cover the combinations.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (8) provides:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this section shall affect the operation of section 30 of the Act of 1939.</P>
      <P>That is in the Bill as it stands.  That confuses me on the question of 12 hours being followed by 48 hours.  You could be questioned under the 12-hour clause which could work out at 20 hours.  Does subsection (8) mean that there could be 48 hours following the 12 hours and in that way you would get another combination of 48 hours and 12 hours?  I thought that might be overcome by saying at the beginning of subsection (8): &ldquo;Subject to the new subsection (8)&rdquo; which the Minister is inserting and tie the two together.  I should like the Minister to explain to us the effect of a separate subsection which says, &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall affect the operation of section 30 of the Act of 1939&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I appreciate the difficulty which the Deputy has raised.  We cannot preclude the Garda <Col N="1056" /> from acting on the basis of information they receive subsequent to arrest about an entirely new offence which they were not aware of at the time.  The first amendment I am moving is to confine section 3 to 12 hours so that we do not have this roll-over effect which some people seemed to fear initially.  The second amendment would ensure that 48 hours plus 12 hours or 12 hours plus 48 hours cannot be combined in the situation which has been outlined.  We cannot preclude a situation where the Garda in the investigating of an offence come across an entirely new offence.  They will have to be allowed to be free to act on that and to use the powers available under the law to act on it.</P>
      <P>On the question of not interfering with the Offences Against the State Act, the powers under this Bill do not preclude the Garda from using the sections of the Offences Against the State Act which relate to detention.  The powers under that Act in relation to detention are maintained as part of our law and can be exercised by the Garda as they see fit. The fact that we are introducing new powers of detention for a shorter duration does not cancel out the existing powers under the Offences Against the State Act.  The intention of the amendments I am talking about is that the two do not become combined, so that if you are arrested under the Offences Against the State Act the maximum possible is 48 hours, and if you are arrested under this Bill the maximum possible is 12 hours allowing for the rest period overnight.  I should like the Deputy to go back on his own amendment.  I do not understand the point of his amendment and I should like him to explain it more fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admitted earlier that 48 hours can be followed by 12 hours.  All you have to do is find another offence within the period of questioning for 48 hours and then follow that by 12 hours.  Now it would appear that 12 hours can be followed by 48 hours in the first instance because nothing is to affect the operation of section 30 of the Act of 1939. That means somebody can be released <Col N="1057" /> after 12 hours and then be arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>

      <P>This stands free as a section.  If that is the Minister's intention why not put in at the beginning of subsection (8), &ldquo;subject to the new subsection (8)&rdquo; which the Minister is proposing &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall affect the operation of section 30 of the 1939 Act&rdquo;? If it is the Minister's intention that the 12 hours would not be followed by 48 hours, why not say so and be absolutely clear about it?  My amendment is very simple. It is not our intention and never was the intention of Members of the House to extend detention to 68 hours.  The effect of that would be to extend the overall possible length of detention to 68 hours. It was never our intention to have an overall extended period.  The 48 hours is regarded as more than adequate for the subversive activities and the very serious crimes to which it is related.  The amendment provides that no person shall be detained without being charged with an offence for a consecutive period in excess of 48 hours.  The amendment states that the maximum period a person can be interrogated for &mdash; it depends on whether one is the recipient or one is talking academically about this &mdash; cannot exceed more than 48 hours.  The operation of the two, irrespective of the way they are operated, should not exceed 48 hours.</P>
      <P>For instance, if the gardaí hold a person for 12 hours on the basis of the new 12-hour clause the Minister is introducing and find during the course of their questioning that there is something they wish to pursue under the Offences Against the State Act they can pursue that matter but it should be that they will have 36 further hours to question the person, 48 minus 12.  The fact that the person has been interrogated for 12 hours should be taken into account when considering the maximum period available.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It would be very dangerous to put the gardaí in a <Col N="1058" /> situation where if they are investigating an offence and come across evidence of another offence they would not be able to investigate it.  The Deputy is speaking as if 48 hours is the maximum period of detention at present under the Offences Against the State Act, but in the circumstances I am outlining where evidence of a new offence is discovered the person could be rearrested for a further 48 hour period.  That is the position at present.  It does not happen to any significant degree.  I cannot give the House even one example of when it happened last, but the provision exists under the Offences Against the State Act for a second period of detention if the Garda Síochána come across evidence of another serious offence. For example, if a person was arrested for possession of firearms and towards the end of the questioning period it transpired that evidence strongly emerged that the firearms had been used to murder somebody then the gardaí could rearrest the person for a further 48 hour period.  I am trying to rule out the combinations of 12 and 48 hours.  I am proposing in the amendment to confine the period to 12 hours in the section.  In amendment No. 27, in section 8 I am ruling out the combinations which the House has adverted to and has caused a certain amount of anxiety to Members.  I cannot rule out the possibility that the person could be rearrested for another offence of which there was no evidence or indication at the time of his or her arrest.  It is the same kind of unusual circumstances we have at present for which a person could be arrested for a second period of 48 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final analysis the courts will decide whether a person was treated oppressively or not.  They will decide whether evidence is admissible or not. There have been cases where people have been held for longer than 48 hours continuously and the courts have decided that there were extraordinary excusing circumstances.  The courts have decided in situations where there was not only a breach of the law but was probably a breach of the constitutional rights of an individual that the overriding public good, and the good of third parties, was <Col N="1059" /> greater than even the constitutional right of the individual.  The courts ruled accordingly.  We should not proceed by trying to legislate in primary legislation for every possible eventuality, because if we do we will get into frightful difficulty. We should not attempt to legislate as if the courts did not have a function.  In the final analysis it will be the courts that will have to decide what is oppressive treatment and whether evidence is admissible or not.  There have been several cases on the admissibility of evidence, especially the admissibility of confessions where we almost get a trial within a trial at the initial stage of court proceedings.</P>
    <P>I will look at Deputy Wood's amendment but I do not think I will be in a position to accept it, because I believe it would put in the kind of restriction which may not cause any difficulty for many months or years but then a case will arise where a person who is blatantly guilty will walk free.  We will then have a public outcry.  I am sure the House recalls the famous case where two girls were raped and murdered and the people arrested for those offence were subsequently found guilty.  Initially those people were arrested for a traffic offence.  In the course of an inquiry by the gardaí they discovered that these people could have been involved in the murders.  They were held longer than the 48 hours.  They were arrested on a Sunday morning and were not charged until the following Tuesday. Certainly the period of detention was in excess of 48 hours.  On the face of it, and in the opinion of a great many people, the constitutional rights of those individuals would have been transgressed by that act.  However, the court decided that the evidence obtained was admissible because there were extraordinary excusing circumstances.  We must allow a situation where a court can do so.</P>
    <P>I accept the spirit of what Deputy Woods has said.  I am as concerned as any Member that there will be no abuse of the sections and that what we intend as legislators will happen in practice.  However, on this matter I do not think it would be wise to accept Deputy Woods's amendment.  The amendments I have <Col N="1060" /> proposed certainly ensure that the 12 hour period is the norm and go as far as is reasonable to ensure that a combination of 12 plus 48 hours will not apply or a combination of 48 plus 12 hours will not apply.  Even if I accepted Deputy Woods's amendment we still could have in extraordinary circumstances for offences scheduled in the Offences Against the State Act where people could be detained for longer than 48 hours, by a second period of 48 hours.  We are not talking about the same offence or of an offence for which the Garda Síochána could have suspected the individual at the time of the initial arrest.  We are talking about the unusual situation where during the course of an investigation something emerges which indicates involvement in another crime of a major nature.  It is then that the rearrest could take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it may be the Minister's intention that 48 hours cannot be followed by 12 hours, but amendment No. 27 states clearly that: &ldquo;in connection with any other offence of which, at the time of his arrest for the first mentioned offence, the member of the Garda Síochána by whom he was arrested suspected him or ought to have reasonably suspected him...&rdquo;.  There will be many cases where a person will be arrested in connection with one offence and, during the course of that person's interrogation, other offences will come to light.  That is why I am concerned that the total should not go one way or another beyond the 48 hours.  I understood that the Offences Against the State Act provided for 24 hours detention to be followed by 24 hours on the opinion of a chief superintendent. Is that correct?</P>

If that can happen under the present law, why do we need change in the legislation?

      <P>In the new section 8, amendment No. 27, in the part which begins &ldquo;except on the authority of a justice of a District Court&rdquo; does the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo; on the third last line refer to the offence for which he is being detained in the first place or does it refer to that offence and any other offence of which the Garda ought to have suspected him?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I see the point the Deputy is making, and I will see if it can be clarified, but it refers to both.  It is one of the safeguards but it must be exercised through the District Court and information has to be supplied by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent on oath.  Certainly the intention is that it would refer to both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first point the Deputy made, if I accept the amendment I am fearful that it would rule out absolutely a situation where a court could maintain that detention beyond the 48 hours for exceptional or extraordinary circumstances was legitimate. This House has discussed the matter for months and the courts would be aware of that.  We have gone into this at a level of detail which would not have been gone into previously and the courts would take that into account and they would say that it is now the intention of this House that on all occasions, whatever extraordinary circumstances occur, <Col N="1063" /> nobody can be detained for more than 48 hours.  The court could say quite legitimately that they have no longer a discretion in this in any situation, even one like the notorious murder cum rape case that I have referred to.  You would have somebody who was blatantly guilty of a heinous offence walking free because of a transgression of the letter of the law for extraordinary reasons.  I do not think we should do that.  We can make our intention very clear, as I have done in a combination of the first amendment and now amendment No. 27, and I think the intention of the House and of the Minister is very clear there.</P>
    <P>For the new offence we cannot go beyond what we are doing without tying the hands of the courts to a degree that would not be in the public interest.  I have been here on other occasions when other arguments were coming from around the House in a very unusual situation where a decision of a member of a Judiciary was debated here.  There have been a number of protests in the public media over the last week about an interpretation by a judge of a warrant of arrest for people accused of drug-pushing.  We will always need to be careful about what we are doing in trying to tie down to absolutely the last comma because we could end up worse than we are now.  If we tie the thing down to the last comma and try to apply the absolute letter of the law rather than its spirit in all cases, then people who would be held and convicted are, in the opinion of the public at large, getting off on technicalities because it is difficult to make arguments in the other direction. I will examine what the Deputy is saying. I know he is sincere about the intent of 48 hours and 12 hours being confined and I will look at his amendment again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a point under section 8 (2).  We must bear in mind that a person to whom the subsection relates may be arrested for any offence for the purpose of charging him with that offence forthwith.  That provision is <Col N="1064" /> there for all to see.  The scope to charge a person forthwith with an offence in the normal way is there and can be brought into operation.  We accept the Minister's amendments and their intention.  I ask him to look again at the one in section 27 and the phrase &ldquo;at the time of his arrest&rdquo; and its effect.  The Minister has admitted that it means that the 48 hours can be followed by 12 hours for an offence not mentioned at the outset when he was arrested or which would not have been reasonably suspected at the initial time. While we accept the amendments, we want to make our intention clear here that we do not wish to see a period in excess of what is there at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make three points.  The Minister has referred to a case and I gather from what he said that the argument is that that exception is going to be the norm, that we are legislating for the exception which will be the norm.  He has referred to this previously in the House, and I find it difficult to agree with him here.  Somebody could be picked up for a very minor offence, such as a traffic offence, and held for 48 hours. There are other means of detecting serious crime.  The courts are there to decide whether abuses take place, so we should not legislate for that here.  I do not know what the great fear is about trying to get not every detail but much of the detail correct in this Bill.  It has been demonstrated and proven beyond all doubt over the last few months that the safeguards are very weak as far as the innocent person is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Deputy Woods's earlier point I fear that section 3 could be abused, in that extensions would be permitted by introducing other offences.  I wanted to ask a separate question, really on a point of clarification.  Could there be switching from section 3 into the Offences Against the State Act for non-scheduled offences under that Act which would then give rise to extended periods of detention? For example, malicious damage is often used for the purpose of arrest under the Offences Against the State Act or, as was said recently, larceny of even very small amounts of money could also be used for <Col N="1065" /> that purpose.  I would be concerned if switching could occur or if by means of these two sections we are talking about extensions of the section 3 provision would apply.  Even though under section (8) (1) (b) a superintendent may go to the District Court if he has further information, an extension is often given in the District Court on a very perfunctory examination and there does not seem to be any difficulty in getting either a warrant for arrest or permission for an extension of detention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The new section 8 states that if a person is arrested and detained pursuant to section 3 he cannot be arrested again for the same offence, except on the authority of the district justice <i>et cetera.</i> He can, however, be arrested again for the same offence if he is arrested for the purpose of charging him forthwith.  Would it be possible for the Minister to consider between now and Report Stage including a provision whereby, in order to detain a person for a further six or 12-hour period, he would have to be charged immediately?  As the section reads, a garda can simply say that he immediately rearrested him for the purpose of charging him forthwith for the offence but that due to some new evidence or other cause he was not able to charge him forthwith.  What is the situation if he is not charged forthwith?</P>

If there were any element of judicial function in the justice's having to be satisfied that further information had come into the possession of the police, a question might arise as to whether in that event notice would have to be given to the person proposed to be rearrested and a chance given to him to contest the statement of the police that they had fresh evidence.  It is a point which has not arisen here before and has not occurred to me before.  I express no view on it except that it might be worth the Minister's while to get advice on it.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In reply to Deputy Skelly, a person would have to be arrested separately for the new offence <Col N="1067" /> and told of it.  The previous arrest and detention would be ended.  If somebody was being detained and after three hours new information came to the Garda, then if they decided he should be rearrested the first period would end.  The problem is that it is not acceptable to me or to any reasonable person that because somebody is arrested and questioned about a particular offence this should give him immunity from proceedings against him for other offences of which the Garda could not have been aware at the time. We cannot put ourselves or the Garda in the situation where the fact that a power is exercised for one offence would give immunity for all others.</P>
      <P>The amendments I am proposing in the great generality of cases have closed off all possibilities of combinations of the Offences Against the State Act and the powers given under this legislation.  The Deputy referred to people being arrested for minor traffic offences.  The type of offences to which this would apply would be offences that would carry a five year sentence.  In the Offences Against the State Act there is a schedule of offences. The possibilities of combining the two are certainly limited, even by the nature of the offences.</P>
      <P>I take the point which is being made. I have brought forward amendments Nos. 13 and 27 to strengthen the safeguards but to go further than that would give rise to a very serious problem in the rare exceptional case such as the one to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>(c)  When a person arrested pursuant to this section has been brought to a Garda Síochána station, the member in charge shall give to him, as soon as practicable, a statement in writing of the offence or offences in respect of which he has been arrested, and shall specify in the said statement and enter in the records of the station the time at which the said statement is given to that person.</P>
      <P>(d)  If a person who is being detained pursuant to this section in a Garda Síochána station is questioned for the purpose of the investigation, the member in charge shall keep a record of the names of the persons engaged in such questioning and the periods during which they were so engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  If a direction extending the period of detention is given pursuant <Col N="1073" /> to subsection 3 (b), or a certificate authorising the questioning of a detainee between midnight and 8 a.m. is given pursuant to subsection 6 (a) the officer of the Garda Síochána responsible for giving same shall as soon as practicable provide the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station with details of the grounds upon which such direction or certificate was given, and the member in charge shall without delay, enter the details of the said grounds in the records of the Garda Síochána station.</P>
    <P>(11) (a) Where a person is detained pursuant to this section he shall not be questioned for the purpose of the investigation for a consecutive period in excess of 4 hours.</P>
    <P>(b)  A period of questioning shall be deemed to be consecutive if there is not an interval of at least 1 hour since such person was last questioned for the purpose of the investigation. </P>
    <P>(12) (a) Where a person is detained in a Garda Síochána station pursuant to this section the member in charge shall, from time to time during any such period of detention visit the detainee, and in particular shall do so at least once every hour, and shall on the occasion of each visit inquire from that person whether he has any complaints concerning the circumstances of his detention.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where a complaint is made by or on behalf of a person arrested or detained pursuant to this section concerning the circumstances of his arrest or his detention to any member of the Garda Síochána such member shall forthwith communicate the details of the complaint to the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station who shall enter the details of such complaint in the records of the Garda Síochána station.</P>
    <P>(c)  Where a complaint is made by <Col N="1074" /> or on behalf of a person arrested or detained pursuant to this section, in connection with his arrest or the circumstances of his detention, the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station shall enter in the records of the Garda Síochána station details of any such complaint without delay. </P>
    <P>(13) (a) Where a person is detained in a Garda Síochána station pursuant to this section he shall, at any time during such a period of detention, be entitled to make and retain notes in writing.</P>
    <P>(b)  If such a person so requests he shall be provided with the necessary materials for the purpose of making notes referred to in paragraph (a).</P>
    <P>(c)  Where the detention of a person is authorised pursuant to this section he shall, without delay, be informed by the member in charge of his right to make and keep the notes referred to in paragraph (a) and that the materials to enable him to do so will be made available to him should he request them. </P>
    <P>(14)  Where a person detained pursuant to this section is questioned for the purpose of the investigation the entire of the questioning shall be recorded by electronic or other means.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 15, our position is that we accept the Minister's commitment to an amendment on Report Stage.  Consequently, we will leave it to the Minister to come back with an amendment and will consider it on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 16, basically these are the safeguards which we are proposing should be included.  In connection with subsection 10 (a) of amendment No. 16, we consider this is reasonable and we consider that as a general rule of law a person should be informed of the offence or offences for which he is being arrested.  Notwithstanding that there is a provision in the Bill for other offences to be raised subsequently, <Col N="1075" /> we have carefully avoided tying the Garda to the offence for which the person is arrested subsequently in terms of their discussions and interrogation.  Nevertheless, we consider the person should be informed of the initial offence or offences in relation to which he is being arrested on suspicion.</P>
    <P>We consider subsection (10) (b) of amendment No. 16 to be reasonable. There should be an appropriate record of the time to arrival at the Garda station.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On a point of order, I suggest that we discuss amendment No. 24 with amendment No. 16 as I intend providing for most of the concerns of Deputy Woods and his party by means of statutory regulation under amendment No. 24.  I do not think it would be possible for me to discuss amendment No. 16 without referring in detail to amendment No. 24.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with that.  I will quote subsection (10) (c) which we propose.  It states:</P>
      <P>When a person arrested pursuant to this section has been brought to a Garda Síochána station, the member in charge shall give to him, as soon as practicable, a statement in writing of the offence or offences in respect of which he has been arrested, and shall specify in the said statement and enter in the records of the station the time at which the said statement is given to that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 (6) (a) provides that an extension of time requires notice.  It is specified in subsection (6) (a) that a notice would be given to the person against whom the extension is being granted.  We are suggesting that, as soon as practicable, a statement of the offences in connection with which the person is arrested should be given and should be entered in the records of the Garda station.  We feel this <Col N="1076" /> would be essential subsequently.  Indeed, under the Offences Against the State Act there is a requirement that written notice be given.  We consider this should apply in this case also.  Subparagraph (d) of my proposed subsection (10) says:</P>
    <P>If a person who is being detained pursuant to this section in a Garda Síochána station is questioned for the purpose of the investigation, the member in charge shall keep a record of the names of the persons engaged in such questioning and the periods during which they were so engaged.</P>
    <P>It could be quite important subsequently and indeed an investigation could fail in court if the names of the people involved in the questioning were not recorded and kept for the subsequent court case or whatever.  Also, in the event of there being any complaint to a complaints tribunal it would be necessary to have the names of the persons involved in the questioning.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (e) of my proposed new subsection (10) reads:</P>
    <P>If a direction extending the period of detention is given pursuant to subsection 3 (b), or a certificate authorising the questioning of a detainee between midnight and 8 a.m. is given pursuant to subsection 6 (a) the officer of the Garda Síochána responsible for giving same shall as soon as practicable provide the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station with details of the grounds upon which such direction or certificate was given, and the member in charge shall without delay, enter the details of the said grounds in the records of the Garda Síochána station.</P>
    <P>There is a requirement that reasonable grounds would apply in seeking a certificate for questioning between the hours of midnight and 8 a.m.  Therefore the grounds, in brief form, would have to be recorded.  Otherwise there could be quite an amount of confusion about this subsequently. The Minister has suggested that he would make provision for such matters.  In this respect I might refer to his amendment No. 24 in which he says that he will make regulations regarding <Col N="1077" /> the treatment of persons in custody. Therefore the Minister's approach to this problem is to say: Yes, there should be such regulations &mdash; or, presumably, something like these regulations &mdash; that he will subsequently make these as regulations, that they would not be included in the Bill and they would not have statutory force.  Subsection (1) in the Minister's amendment No. 24 reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall make regulations providing for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda Síochána stations.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) in his amendment reads:</P>
    <P>The regulations shall include provision for the assignment to the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of a Garda Síochána station, or to some other member, of responsibility for overseeing the application of the regulations at that station, without prejudice to the responsibilities and duties of any other member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister recognises that there must be a person who has responsibility for overseeing that these things happen and he plans coming along with regulations subsequently.  Subsection (3) in the Minister's amendment reads:</P>
    <P>A failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall not of itself render that person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person or the admissibility in evidence of any statement made by him.</P>
    <P>and the final subsection reads:</P>
    <P>A failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall render him liable to disciplinary proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Minister is suggesting in his amendment No. 24 that we do not follow the line proposed in my amendment No. 16, that is, to give statutory force to the safeguards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but there is a problem of correspondence here.  If, on the one hand, the Minister is giving the powers in the Bill then we believe that he should provide safeguards at the same time so that they are seen to be in correspondence within the Bill.  I appreciate that the Minister's regulations shall have force but at this stage we do not know what they will be.  Presumably the Minister will talk about his amendment No. 24 shortly.  We do not know what the Minister has in mind here and we are giving powers in this section without including safeguards.  That is why we feel it desirable and indeed necessary for the operation of other parts of the Bill that these kinds of safeguards and records would exist.</P>
      <P>I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the regulations he proposes making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of Deputy Woods amendment and also in the context of this Bill it is most important, bearing in mind the powers we are providing, that we ensure all the relevant protections are there also.  We ensure the protections are there in the interests of the general public, to ensure that no abuse takes place in the implementation of the detention sections and also in the interests of the Garda themselves in order to <Col N="1079" /> ensure that no false allegations of abuse can be made against them.  I would regard the keeping of records as an essential part of this Bill and the provisions to provide for such keeping of such records as an essential part thereof.  I accept that there are two ways of doing this.  The first way is through the amendment proposed by Deputy Woods, which contains some flaws and does not cover all the areas about which I would be concerned, but it states explicitly, within the context of the statute, all of the various protections that are necessary.</P>
      <P>The second way of doing it is that proposed by the Minister, and I welcome the amendment tabled by him.  Speaking at some length on the Second Stage debate in this House, I very explicitly made the point that the Bill as originally presented made no provision for ensuring that all of the safeguards.  I believe are required would be there.  Certainly it contained no provision for a code of conduct such as has been and is being provided in other countries and jurisdictions where similar legislation has been enacted.  During the course of the Second Stage debate I referred to the example of the Police and Evidence Bill which has been the subject of long debate in the Westminster Parliament over the past 12 months, where there has been presented a draft code of police behaviour.  When that Bill was debated initially at Westminster no such code was presented and the code now in being is a third attempt to provide a comprehensive code, the original one introduced having been amended to a considerable extent.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister in tabling amendment No. 24 has acknowledged that it is in the interests of the general public and of the Garda themselves that a code of conduct be provided. The question now arises; is it more desirable that that code be in a statutory form in the sense of containing explicit statutory provisions, as Deputy Woods proposes, or is it better that it be done by way of ministerial statutory instrument or regulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could argue relatively convincingly for both approaches.  I would be <Col N="1080" /> anxious and concerned that before this Bill passes all Stages in this House we have sight of the proposed code, if it is a code to be provided pursuant to the Minister's amendment No. 24 by the insertion of his new section 6 in the Bill.  In providing these powers of detention we are entitled to have available to us &mdash; if not possible on Committee Stage then certainly on Report Stage &mdash; the draft of the code of conduct that the Garda will have to operate under in implementing these provisions.  I believe that, as it has been possible to debate that code at the same time as debating statutory reforms of this nature in a neighbouring Parliament, we should be able to do so here.</P>
    <P>I recall the Minister saying at an early stage in the Committee Stage debate that he might propose instead that this provision be enacted.  He gave the House an undertaking that he would subsequently, when introducing the code, table it before this House so that we would have an opportunity of debating the matter. That could be an acceptable procedure provided that the detention provisions are not implemented until the code is approved by the House.  The concern would be to ensure a co-ordination of the provisional additional powers together with the provision of the additional protections to ensure that adequate protection is there.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already undertaken that these detention provisions will not be implemented until the new complaints machinery is provided so logistically the detention provisions would not be brought into force until the Garda code of conduct is submitted to the House.  It is open to the Minister to bring individual protections into force by way of ministerial order and the main concern I would have initially is co-ordination so that we do not implement the powers of detention without being assured that a proper code of conduct provisions is provided.</P>
    <P>Should the Minister adopt the latter course it would not be possible for the code of conduct to be made available to the House before we complete the passing of the Bill.  If that approach were adopted the Minister would have to amend his amendment No. 24, the new <Col N="1081" /> section 6, on the Report Stage if it is not possible to do it on this Stage because that amendment provides that the Minister shall make regulations.  There is an obligation to make those regulations and, so far as I can see, though I could be wrong in this, to make provision as other legislation has done in the past formally for those regulations to be laid before the House.  In the context of other statutory provisions one has provisions in the originating legislation which provide that, if a statutory instrument is made, that statutory instrument must be laid before the House and provided no objection is raised within 21 days it thereby becomes law.  Now amendment No. 24 does not appear to make provision for the laying of the statutory instrument in regard to regulations to be laid before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so then I apologise. In the context of section 29 it states that every regulation made under this Act shall be laid before each house of the Oireachtas as soon as maybe after such regulation is made.  It goes on to say that if a resolution annulling such regulation is passed by each House within the next 21 days such regulation shall be annulled. I was mistaken in saying there is no provision for the laying of regulations as there is under section 29.  My point is that, because the provision of a code of conduct is so crucial in the context of the detention section, that manner in which we normally deal with the laying of regulations before the Oireachtas is normally simply to table that the code of conduct and, provided nothing happens within 21 days, that code becomes operative.  The only thing we can do within those 21 days is effectively annul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister points out that section 29 is appropriate but I do not believe that type of formula is appropriate in regard to this new section and I would ask the Minister on Report Stage to introduce a specific provision amending this to ensure the regulations will be laid before the Oireachtas and amendments to those regulations can be tabled and those regulations, <Col N="1082" /> as amended, can then be passed. We would not then have the difficulty, and the Minister would not have the difficulty, of presenting a code of conduct on which Members may raise valid points designed to amend those regulations in some way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has at all times shown a flexible approach throughout this debate and he has accepted valid points made by Deputies, and the amendments he has tabled are evidence of that.  It could very well be that a code of conduct produced by the Minister may have provisions the vast majority of which could be both desirable and acceptable but there could be one or two provisions which would call for amendment.  If the code of conduct, however, were dealt with as other regulations are dealt with all we could do is either accept or reject.  It would be in the interests of the House to ensure a constructive discussion on those regulations that a specific amendment be included so that the regulations would not become operative until they had been approved by the House.  That is my first point.  Secondly, the House should have both the power and the capacity to amend the regulations and not be confined to simply accepting or rejecting.</P>
    <P>I come now to the two different approaches, the approach of Deputy Dr. Woods and the approach of the Minister. Which approach should we adopt?  One can argue persuasively for either approach.  My concern would be to ensure that the protections are effectively provided.  The difficulty in trying to provide for every eventually in a statutory form as Deputy Dr. Woods' amendment seeks to do, could result in some protections not being provided, protections which should be there, or the courts might interpret the statutory provisions in ways not regarded as providing the additional protection.  It seems to me a power conferred on the Minister by way of statutory instrument to amend the code of conduct so as to provide a more flexible way of dealing with difficulties of that nature when the detention sections become operative provided those regulations could not become operative <Col N="1083" /> unless expressly approved by this House as opposed to the annulling procedure.</P>
    <P>This would ensure that no Minister could diminish the protections provided without a debate in this House.  It would provide a simpler form and speedier way of providing for amendments.  Amendment No. 24 in the name of the Minister, which says that the Minister shall make regulations, enables the Minister not merely to make one set of regulations but to amend them at a future stage.  Perhaps the power to amend the regulations by the Minister should be expressely referred to in the new section 6 also.  It may not be necessary but perhaps it should be referred to.  If you had this procedure whereby regulations would not become operative unless approved expressly by this House following a debate, we would have a flexible means of ensuring that, if we discover in the initial, teething stages of this legislation that all the protections which should be there are not there or that the courts are interpreting the code of conduct in a way which does not provide protection we regard as desirable, we would have an easier means of amending them.</P>
    <P>The points made by Deputy Woods in his amendment are very important in the sense that much of what is contained in amendment No. 16 I would envisage as being incorporated in the code of conduct which the Minister has in mind.  Unless there are explicit provisions to ensure that Garda records are kept of the offence for which somebody is suspected of having being involved in and for which they are being detained, there will be no means of monitoring whether somebody is being detained for a particular offence or whether they are being picked up purely on the personal whim of a member of the Garda.  I am sure the vast majority of gardaí would not behave in that way but we all know of individual instances of them not always behaving as they should.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that there is a need for a record to be kept of the offence for which someone is allegedly being detained, the time of commencement of the detention, the time of their arrival in the Garda station and the name of the garda who is <Col N="1084" /> responsible for holding someone by way of detention.  If someone is being held for the purpose of investigating an offence they are entitled to be informed as to what that offence is.  To ensure that there is no confusion regarding whether they were told they should be informed orally and in writing as to what the offence is. Deputy Woods' amendment provides that a person will be given, as soon as practicable, a statement in writing of the offence.  There can be certain instances where the statement in writing of the offence might be such legal gobbledegood that the person to whom it is handed may not understand what the alleged offence is.  They should be told, in ordinary language, what the nature of the offence is.</P>
    <P>There are also certain records which should be kept for which Deputy Woods' amendment does not provide. We come to an area of whether they should be in at this stage, whether a code should provide for it initially or whether it should be amended later.  For example, Deputy Woods' amendment does not state with regard to records at what stage someone is explicitly told they are entitled to see a solicitor or notify a solicitor or relation that they are being detained in a Garda station.  The records should indicate what attempt was made to make contact with the person's solicitor or relation.  It is not very difficult to do that, a garda can just insert a sentence indicating that he attempted to telephone a named solicitor or relation.  It is important that these records are there.  In the context of a search being carried out the records should expressly state when someone is searched in the station and what time that occurred.  It should also state if any items were found on that person.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods' amendment does not deal with another aspect which I raised on Second Stage but which is important in the context of a code of conduct.  There was a great deal of debate in the Westminister Parliament on their Police and Evidence Bill on an issue which has not given rise to any great debate in this country and which I am told has never been a problem in Garda <Col N="1085" /> stations but which should be expressly provided for in the context of a Garda code of conduct.  In the limited circumstances in which a strip search can take place under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; the Minister validly made the point that such searches can already take place under legislation expressly referred to, such as the Offences Against the State Act and legislation to control drugs &mdash; the code of conduct should expressly provide that someone can only be searched by a member of the Garda of the same sex as the person being searched.  That is not provided for in Deputy Woods' amendment and it is desirable in the code of conduct.  When the Secretary of State in England produced a code of conduct which did not expressly provide for this there was a major public outcry and he had to amend the code accordingly.</P>
    <P>We need a code of conduct.  I agree with many things expressed in Deputy Woods' code of conduct but it is not all embracing and does not cover everything which should be covered.  The proposal the Minister has by way of bringing in a code of conduct by statutory regulation is probably the better way of dealing with it, subject to the comments I made as to how those regulations should be presented to the House and how we should deal with them and subject also to ensuring that in no circumstances would the detention provisions become operative until such time as we have a complaints procedure and the code of conduct approved by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment in the name of Deputy Woods.  It is a perfectly logical amendment in the context in which we are speaking.  In order to preserve order and to uphold the law, citizens have to surrender part of what the Minister has repeatedly called their pool of liberties.  We are surrendering part of our pool of liberties in this legislation and, accordingly, we must ensure that there are proper safeguards.  Deputy Dr. Woods has enumerated a number of safeguards and the acceptance of his amendment would mean that those safeguards would be included in the primary legislation.  The Minister's approach is <Col N="1086" /> different and is contained in the new section 6 which he proposes to insert into the Bill and which states that he shall make regulations providing for a code of conduct for the Garda.  That approach is seriously deficient.  There is nothing certain in the new section 6.  Even though the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; which implies obligation, there is, as Deputy Shatter and Deputy Woods pointed out, no time scale within which the regulations shall be introduced.  The Minister envisages, obviously, in the new section 6 that they will be introduced at some indeterminate time in the future. How are we supposed to agree to legislation which, on the one hand, takes away part of the pool of liberties which we all enjoy while at the same time having to accept a promise from the Minister that these regulations will be introduced at some indeterminate time in the future?</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) of the new section 6 states what the effect of these regulations will be if and when they are introduced. It states:</P>
      <P>A failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall not of itself render that person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person or the admissibility in evidence of any statement made by him.</P>
      <P>If that is the case, what safeguard is provided for the accused by the introduction of these regulations?  If a garda ignores the regulations, what guarantee has the accused?  The legislation tells us that the evidence may nevertheless be admissible and the accused may be convicted.  What is the effect of the regulations?  What certainty do we have that the regulations will contain any safeguard?</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) of the new section 6 states:</P>
      <P>A failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall render him liable to disciplinary proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that means internal Garda disciplinary <Col N="1087" /> proceedings.  The question of discipline within the Garda is one thing. The question of protection of the accused who is detained in accordance with the provisions of this legislation is another. There is no necessary relationship between the two.  I ask the Minister to look again at the amendment put down by Deputy Woods.  As Deputy Shatter said, the safeguards in the amendment might not be adequate but, if the amendment is accepted, the safeguards in the amendment would become part of our primary legislation.  If they were part of our primary legislation a failure on the part of a member of the Garda Síochána to observe them would render the evidence thereby obtained inadmissible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably we will have an opportunity later to discuss the destruction of records under section 6.  I have some misgivings about putting into the Bill the statutory requirement proposed by Deputy Woods.  In the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill in the UK there was no difficulty in doing that.  The Minister is proposing to introduce regulations at a later stage which, under section 29, will be laid before the House.  Will the House have an opportunity to debate them before the Bill becomes law and to propose amendments to the regulations? Will it be necessary for the House to approve those regulations?  We are putting the cart before the horse to some extent.  We are being asked to approve legislation which will not become law before a complaints tribunal is set up.  We are told that at a later stage the Minister will introduce regulations.  When we are passing legislation of this nature we should be able to satisfy ourselves as to the content of any proposed complaints tribunal or provisions regarding the non-observance of certain regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill in the UK clause 5 provides that annual reports made by chief constables should contain information about searches recorded under clause 3.  Many clauses in that legislation set down specifically the circumstances in which disciplinary action may be taken against <Col N="1088" /> members of the UK Police Force for not observing certain regulations.  They found it necessary to do that.  Much of our legislation is very similar to theirs. Given the fact that they had to do that, and the controversy there was, we should be asking ourselves are we really serving the public interest by passing legislation of this nature and leaving regulations and a complaints tribunal and those types of safeguards until after we have passed the legislation.  I do not believe any other Legislature would go about its business in this way.  To some extent we are being taken for granted.</P>
    <P>I do not think the amendment put down by Deputy Woods covers all eventualities. Quite a number of proposals in the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill in the UK go further.  The place for these provisions is within this legislation. Deputy Woods has the right idea.  We should incorporate statutory provisions within this Bill to provide for the non-observance of the protection sections and to provide for a complaints tribunal.  It is reasonable to suggest that annual reports regarding the use of the Bill and statistics on the number of people detained should be made to the Minister for Justice as they will be made to the Home Secretary in the UK.  The House should be able to monitor this legislation.  This is a House of representatives and not just a Legislature. It is up to us to serve the common good and to ensure that the legislation we pass is working properly.</P>
    <P>The right place for these regulations and the complaints tribunal is in this legislation. I hope that when the Minister reflects on this matter he will find it possible on Report Stage to consider that. Alternatively he should let us have the details of the proposed regulations and the complaints tribunal before this legislation is passed.  That is what a Legislature is all about.  It might seem like a smart manoeuvre to get the legislation through as a nice operational job and then slip in the regulations.  Nobody will thank anybody for that.</P>
    <P>There is no big hassle in this House about the Bill.  We all want legislation passed which we believe to be necessary. We do not want anything that is not necessary. <Col N="1089" /> We do not want anything which would interfere with innocent people, or oppress an already oppressed innocent public.  We want to deal with criminals only.  It is the job of the Legislature to be sure that we are serving the public interest in passing legislation of this nature, and we should be certain about the regulations and the complaints tribunal before the Bill is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to say first that I am opposed to the amendment put down by Deputy Woods because I am moving an amendment myself, which provides for better safeguards by a different route.  Deputy Woods in proposing this amendment said he wanted the regulations providing for the treatment of people in custody to have statutory power.  I pointed out by way of intervention then, and I should like to repeat it now, that ministerial regulations should have statutory power. The statutory power of regulations made by the Minister under the powers vested in him are not inferior to the statutory powers of the primary legislation.  It is not a question of one being a greater or lesser obligation than the other.  The obligation is there, it is an equal obligation whether it is in the Bill or outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as originally published did not make provision for this or for regulations. The Garda Síochána have internal regulations which are used and complied with for the treatment of people in custody.  It was in response to the debate on Second Stage, and principally to the suggestions made by many of the people who contributed this morning, that I decided to introduce an amendment to allow for the bringing in of regulations so that there would be a published code for the treatment of people being detained under the provisions of the Bill and, indeed, under the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act.  The Ó Briain Report published in 1978 has been around for a long time, and many of the recommendations in it have been incorporated in the regulations which are applied by the Garda Síochána in garda stations at present. However, since 1978 no Minister for Justice has come to the House and <Col N="1090" /> announced that there would be ministerial regulations with the force of law to regulate the treatment of people in custody. I maintain that regulations are more appropriate for the level of detail which will have to be contained in the manner in which the gardaí treat people in their custody.  The primary legislation is the place for the principles of the Bill and a certain amount of detail, but the level of detail in the type of regulations I am referring to is more appropriate to regulations than to the primary legislation.</P>
    <P>I accept that it raises a question for Deputies.  Deputy Shatter made a point very forcibly in regard to this area and Deputy Mitchell has done so now. Deputy Mitchell also referred to the complaints procedure.  On the publication of the Bill I gave a commitment to the House, and that commitment stands. Subsequently, in reply to Deputy Woods on the Order of Business and later in the course of the debate on Committee Stage that the complaints procedure will involve legislation.  I said that it will not be an administrative scheme but one that will be provided for in legislation.  I will be bringing in a Bill to the House and every Member will have the same opportunity to debate it through all stages as they have in regard to the Bill under debate.  It will be an ordinary piece of legislation.  Under section 29 there is provision that the regulations made by the Minister will be brought before the House.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Absolutely. For the information of Members who are spending so much time in the Chamber debating this legislation I should like to state that the complaints <Col N="1091" /> procedure has passed through Government and is being drafted by the draftsman in the Attorney General's Office. We are proceeding at all speed to get it before the House.  The net point on the question of regulations is how the gardaí treat people in custody.  Under section 29 there is provision for any regulations made by me to be put before the House in the ordinary way.  If they remain before both Houses without a negative motion for 21 days they have the force of law. Deputy Shatter said he would like a more positive mechanism on this occasion.  It is a good idea and one which I will consider &mdash; I will not give a commitment &mdash; between now and Report Stage to put down a positive motion to enable Members discuss the regulations rather than leaving it to the mechanism of the 21 day period elapsing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from scoring debating points today we could spend some time with Members advising me as to what the scope of the regulation should be.  I am opposed to Deputy Woods' amendment for the reasons outlined and also because the regulations he is suggesting do not go far enough in some instances.  Certainly, they do not allow for situations that I would like to allow for under the regulations. Many of the provisions in the amendment cover ground that has already been covered.  Another flaw is that the Deputy does not say what will happen if the gardaí fail to comply with one of the provisions; it is left hanging there.  I shall deal briefly with the regulations suggested by Deputy Woods, indicate my thinking on them and deal with the amendment under consideration. Many of the suggestions made by Deputy Woods are either current practices provided for in the Garda code or are a part of the law already.  If they are provided for in the Garda code I intend to being them in under regulations.  If they are part of the current law it is not necessary to include them in the regulations. Some, for example No. 14 which relates to tape recording conflicts with section 26 of the Bill.  For that reason that is not acceptable to me, but we will discuss tape recording when we reach that <Col N="1092" /> section.  The Deputy's first proposal is that a person arrested pursuant to the section shall be informed, at the time of his arrest, of the offence or offences in respect of which he is being arrested. That is already the law.  The Christie v Leachinsky case in 1947 an English House of Lords authority, was followed here in the Re O'Laighléis, 1960 and nothing in the Bill detracts from that.  It is existing law and does not need to be put into the regulations.</P>
    <P>Under amendment No. 16 the Deputy proposes that when a person arrested pursuant to this section is brought to a garda station the member in charge shall enter into the records without delay the time of the person's arrest, the time of his arrival at the Garda Síochána station and the offence or offences in respect of which that person has been arrested. That is standard practice already in garda stations.  It would be inappropriate to have that type of detail in the Bill, but I intend to cover it in the regulations.  The gardaí are doing that already because it is part of their internal regulations.  I am telling the House that there will be legal obligation on them to do so, and that will be included in the regulations.  That part of Deputy Woods' suggestion is acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also proposes that when a person arrested pursuant to this section has been brought to a Garda Síochána station, the member in charge shall give him, as soon as is practicable, a statement in writing of the offence or offences in respect of which he has been arrested and shall specify in the said statement and enter in the records of the station the time at which the said statement is given to that person.  I do not see what purpose would be served by having that in the regulations, because the person at the time of arrest must be told what the offence is.  It is part of existing law, and I do not think Deputy Woods' suggestion in that regard is necessary.  However, I am prepared to take that on board if some Member makes a convincing case for it.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 16, (10) (d) Deputy Woods suggests that if a person who is being detained pursuant to this section in a Garda Síochána station is questioned <Col N="1093" /> for the purpose of the investigation, the member in charge shall keep a record of the names of persons engaged in the questioning and the periods during which they were so engaged.  That is acceptable in itself and can be incorporated in the regulations.</P>
    <P>In consideration of the regulations I should like to tell the House that the criterion on which we judge the validity of a regulation is that it provide a real safeguard and does not impose administrative chores on the Garda Síochána or interfere with their investigation.  I do not think there is any point in including something which increases the administrative chores of the Garda Síochána, something that interferes with their investigation, if it does not provide a safeguard.  The test should be whether it is a safeguard in the first instance.  We should not load the regulations with administrative detail for the sake of having long, elaborate regulations if they do not provide a safeguard. I will consider that in the regulations, in the context of what I have said.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment states that (10) (e):</P>
    <P>If a direction extending the period of detention is given pursuant to subsection 3 (b), or a certificate authorising the questioning of a detainee between midnight and 8 a.m. is given pursuant to subsection 6 (a) the officer of the Garda Síochána responsible for giving same shall as soon as practicable provide the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station with details of the grounds upon which such direction or certificate was given, and the member in charge shall without delay, enter the details of the said grounds in the records of the Garda Síochána station.</P>
    <P>Regarding the chief superintendent extending the period, we have had an argument and a vote already on whether it should be &ldquo;the opinion of the chief superintendent&rdquo; or changed to &ldquo;reasonable grounds for believing&rdquo;.  Obviously, that subsection is drafted in compatability with the previous amendment put down by Deputy Woods to change that provision of the Bill.  In the Bill as it <Col N="1094" /> stands I am not sure if that regulation would provide any safeguard, but it is intended within the regulations to regulate the procedures in the Garda stations and I will consider anything reasonable which gives a safeguard.  I will give the House more detail of what I have in mind subsequently.  The amendment continues:</P>
    <P>(11)  (a) Where a person is detained pursuant to this section he shall not be questioned for the purpose of the investigation for a consecutive period in excess of 4 hours.</P>
    <P>(b)  A period of questioning shall be deemed to be consecutive if there is not an interval of at least 1 hour since such person was last questioned for the purpose of the investigation. </P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is all the one amendment.  That is the substance of the recommendation of the Ó Briain Report and that is the practice in Garda stations at the moment.  Writing it into a regulation might create difficulty. To say that four hours is absolutely the longest period may not necessarily be a safeguard.  The courts have already recognised that what would amount to oppressive treatment for one person would not necessarily be oppressive treatment for another.  What might be oppressive treatment for a hardened criminal might extend a long way.  What might be oppressive treatment for somebody with no experience of Garda stations might be oppressive treatment in far less than four hours without a break. On the other hand, for the serious, hardened criminal who puts his eye on a spot on the wall and refuses to answer anything <Col N="1095" /> it might not be in the least oppressive if the four-hour period was exceeded.  The courts have been developing for a while what they consider to be oppressive treatment in the light of individual cases and they decide on the admissibility of evidence on the basis of whether the treatment was oppressive.  It would be impossible for us as a Legislature to specify by statute what oppressive treatment is because everybody is different from everybody else and what would be oppressive for one person would not be at all oppressive for another.  As I have repeated a number of times on Committee Stage, we should not proceed as if the courts did not exist.  The courts have a major role on the admissibility of evidence and we should allow the courts to develop their teasing out of what oppressive treatment is.  In a number of judgments already they have vindicated their present position.  That recommendation of the Ó Briain Report is already in practice in Garda stations, but I am indicating the difficulty of having it in a regulation, although I agree absolutely with the spirit of it.</P>
      <P>Subsection (12) of the amendment states:</P>
      <P>(12) (a) Where a person is detained in a Garda Síochána station pursuant to this section the member in charge shall, from time to time during any such period of detention visit the detainee, and in particular shall do so at least once every hour, and shall on the occasion of each visit inquire from that person whether he has any complaints concerning the circumstances of his detention.</P>
      <P>(b)  Where a complaint is made by or on behalf of a person arrested or detained pursuant to this section concerning the circumstances of his arrest or his detention to any member of the Garda Síochána such member shall forthwith communicate the details of the complaint to the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station who shall enter the details of such complaint in the records of the Garda Síochána station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> (c)  Where a complaint is made by or on behalf of a person arrested or detained pursuant to this section, in connection with his arrest or the circumstances of his detention, the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station shall enter in the records of the Garda Síochána station details of any such complaint without delay. </P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with the idea that the member in charge should visit a detainee periodically to inquire whether he has complaints and if complaints are made they should be recorded.  Records should be kept, and it is proposed to put that kind of provision into the regulation. There is no conflict there.  The provision suggested in the new section 6 to the effect that the member in charge or some other member would have responsibility for overseeing the regulations is included in my amendment.</P>
    <P>Regarding subsection (12) (a), the proposal in the amendment is that you put into a statute that somebody must be visited every hour, and if Deputy Woods' amendment is accepted, that will be the law and must be complied with.  That could bring about a ridiculous situation in the Garda station because accidentally it does the reverse of what it purports to do.  It does not provide the safeguard.  It provides for accidental harassment under the law.  If a detained person is asleep that provision would oblige the Garda Síochána to go into the cell and wake him up every hour and ask him if he had any complaints.  Of course he would have a complaint that he was awakened on the hour.</P>

In primary legislation such as this, if we write something into a Bill the courts subsequently will treat as the letter of the law, the flexibility to interpret will be gone from the court if we write it in and make it mandatory in that sense.  Deputy Shatter said that he supported my approach of doing this by regulation rather than by statute because if something silly should arise subsequently the Minister has the freedom under the regulations to change that and to do so quickly.  Many of us could speak in laudatory terms about the effectiveness of this House, and I have great respect for this House, but it does not move very quickly.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> No, I do not think that is so.  The point I am trying to make is that if we bring something into primary legislation, such as Deputy Wood's proposal that people be woken up every hour and asked if they have any complaints&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not want to make too much of that point. Specifying matters of detail by ministerial regulation allows for flexibility which is not there in primary legislation.  The nature of the proposal that a person should be visited periodically and any complaints recorded is acceptable.  That should be in the regulations and I do not see any problem.</P>
      <P>Subsection (13) states:</P>
      <P>(13) (a) Where a person is detained in a Garda Síochána station pursuant to this section he shall, at any time during such a period of detention, be entitled to make and retain notes in writing.</P>
      <P>(b)  If such a person so requests he shall be provided with the necessary materials for the purpose of making notes referred to in paragraph (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  Where the detention of a person is authorised pursuant to this section he shall, without delay, be informed by <Col N="1099" /> the member in charge of his right to make and keep the notes referred to in paragraph (a) and that the materials to enable him to do so will be made available to him should he request them. </P>
    <P>I will examine the inclusion of this provision in the regulations.  It places another administrative burden on the Garda.  Does it really provide a safeguard? If not, there is no point in giving another administrative chore to the Garda Síochána.  Under existing law a person in Garda custody can take notes. The suggestion is that the Garda would be compelled under the regulations to tell everybody they had a right to take notes and supply the necessary material. The Ó Briain report recommended that a person should be allowed to write out his own statement rather than dictate it to a garda and subsequently sign it.  That might be a more real safeguard than that proposed here.  I am open to advice on it.  Subsection (14) refers to electronic recording and is in conflict with section 26.</P>
    <P>My approach is set out in amendment No. 24 which states that the Minister shall make regulations providing for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda Síochána stations.  Deputy O'Dea did not see the force of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but it puts an obligation on me to do so.  I can implement this Bill either in whole or in part, section by section, by ministerial order.  The treatment of people in custody is so fundamental to the exercise of powers of detention that there is no question of section 3 being introduced without the ministerial regulations being law and being available to the Gards Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The same effect as anything in the Bill.  It is not inferior at law.  The regulation is as strong as the Bill in terms of its legality. It is simply a different way of approaching it.  A power has been given to Ministers to deal with matters of detail and it is appropriate that they should be dealt with in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> Deputy Mitchell and Deputy O'Dea raised a point about the amendment I am proposing.  There will not be an exercise of section 3 until the regulations are there for the Garda in relation to the treatment of people in custody.  The intention is quite clear.  It is being said openly now that the powers of detention under section 3 will not be brought into law by me until there are regulations governing the treatment of people in custody.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the new section proposed in amendment No. 24 states:</P>
    <P>(2) The regulations shall include provision for the assignment to the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of a Garda Síochána station, or to some other member, of responsibility for overseeing the application of the regulations at that station, without prejudice to the responsibilities and duties of any other member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to make one person in the Garda station responsible for the welfare of the prisoner by ensuring that the treatment of the prisoner complies with the statutory regulations laid down by the Minister.  The O Briain report has been quoted quite often by opponents of the Bill.  Obviously many of them have never read the report, otherwise they would not be quoting it so widely.  The report refers to the idea of the custodial guardian and my suggestion is very much in line with that.  I am using this mechanism to introduce the idea of a custodial guardian responsible for the person in detention.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of amendment No. 24 states:</P>
    <P>(3) A failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall not of itself render that person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person or the admissibility in evidence of any statement made by him.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea is strongly opposed to this but I suggest that his opposition is based on a misunderstanding.  Deputy Mitchell has also sought clarification.  The key <Col N="1101" /> phrase is &ldquo;shall not of itself render that person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody&rdquo;.  If a garda is in breach of a regulation, what he does is an illegality. At the moment there is an internal Garda code, but I will be introducing statutory regulations and it will be illegal for a garda to be in breach of a regulation.  The garda will be liable to disciplinary action. If the breach is otherwise criminal or if a civil wrong is committed, the garda would be liable for criminal or civil proceedings. No immunity is being granted.  For example, if a garda assaults somebody and it becomes the basis of a criminal proceeding, there is no immunity which means that it must be treated only as a disciplinary matter.  Of course it will be treated as a disciplinary matter but the right of the injured party and of the Director of Public Prosecutions to place charges is not in any way affected.  They key phrase &ldquo;not of itself&rdquo; does not mean that if there is a breach of existing criminal law or a civil offence, immunity is given to a member of the Garda Síochána.  The breach will not give rise to criminal or civil proceedings unless a criminal or civil offence has been committed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods's amendment provides that a garda would be obliged to put down the time of a person's arrest.  Is anybody seriously suggesting that if a garda omits to do so he should be treated as if he had committed a criminal offence or a civil offence?  Certainly it is a breach of discipline since the garda should obey the regulations concerning the treatment of people in custody under his care in the Garda station.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the admissibility of evidence.  A garda may make a mistake and not put down the time of a person's arrest.  A person may be arrested 100 yards from a Garda station and arrive at the station five minutes later.  The garda may record the time of arrest and leave blank the section dealing with the time of arrival.  In that case, is anyone suggesting that if that detained person is subsequently clearly guilty of something like murder, rape or armed robbery, the courts should be obliged to <Col N="1102" /> release him forthwith on the grounds of inadmissibility of evidence because the garda did not put down the time on the form?  I am saying here that it shall not, of itself, render the evidence inadmissible. The court will look at the regulations and at the treatment of the person in custody.  They can examine the nature of the breach of the regulations if such occurred and then will decide on the admissibility of evidence on that basis.</P>
    <P>If there has been a serious breach of the regulations, the House can be quite sure that in the tradition of our courts in this matter, they will not allow the evidence to be admitted: they will throw it out.  I want to maintain that freedom for the courts.  I do not want them tied into a situation in which, regardless of the weight of the subsequent evidence and of the seriousness of the crime, if a garda in a Garda station omits to comply with some minor detail of regulatory procedure, people who are guilty of serious offences will be allowed to go free on technicalities.  That is why section 3 is so phrased.</P>
    <P>It is strengthened in section 6 (4) which says that a failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall render him liable to disciplinary proceedings and that is right.  A garda in the course of his duties should know, and comply with, every detail of the regulations. If he does not do so, he should be subject to discipline.  As the House knows, the Garda Commissioner is the disciplinary officer of the Garda Síochána.  The idea, however, that a garda should be liable for criminal or civil proceedings on foot of something which is neither a civil nor a criminal offence is not acceptable.  On the other hand, no immunity is being given under this amendment from criminal offences or civil proceedings.  If a civil wrong or a criminal offence is committed, the garda can be proceeded against.</P>
    <P>Evidence can be admitted to court if the court decides that it is admissible and that there was no oppressive treatment of the detainee.  The courts will have to be the judge of that, but evidence should <Col N="1103" /> not be excluded on the grounds that a technicality was not complied with.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of this debate, the following matters should be dealt with by regulation: The duty to notify detained persons of their rights on arrival at the station.  Generally speaking, that would be the duty of the member in charge of the station who would be required to inform the person, both orally and in writing, of his rights and to obtain from him his signature as an acknowledgement that he has been so informed.  Such rights include the general conditions, in a physical sense, under which persons would be detained, their entitlement to proper meals and refreshment as appropriate, visits from family members and legal advisers, and medical treatment if necessary. We cannot have regulations which do not allow people to avail of medical treatment where it is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter pointed out very forcibly that the searching of persons, and in particular strip searching, must also be covered in the regulations.  Many sections of this Bill have been maligned and have come in for a lot of criticism, but the particular provision on search has been the most unfairly criticised.  This Criminal Justice Bill does not give any power of strip searching to the Garda Síochána. The debate has proceeded &mdash; not in this House but outside &mdash; almost on the basis that I am introducing a new concept of strip searching into Irish law and not alone that, but that I am also evading the issue of whether men could strip search women or <i>vice versa.</i> Under the Offences Against the State Act there is a power of search of individuals and under the Misuse of Drugs Act also.  There is no need for me to be explicit on the reason for the existence of that power of search.  However, that power of search is unqualified and under any normal interpretation of the law it could extend to strip searching and has been exercised.  In this Bill I did not want to give the Garda Síochána a power to strip search, so in the provision of the Bill it is stated that the power would be there to search as far as underclothing but not to strip search in the accepted meaning of the phrase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> To maintain the powers under the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Offences Against the State Act, they were excluded from the provisions of the Bill so that the existing unqualified powers which have been exercised for many years will continue to be exercised.  It is a Garda regulation, to which there can be no exception, that male members of the Garda cannot search women and female members cannot search men.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Strip search.  This is in the Garda regulations. I would intend that it would be written into the regulations also.  There is a major misunderstanding about the section in this Bill dealing with search.</P>
      <P>To sum up, I agree with most of the points made by Deputy Woods on the desirability of having regulations to guide the Garda force on their treatment of people in custody but do not agree with the mechanism which he is advocating.  I am saying that it is better to cover this by statutory regulation rather than as a provision in the Bill.  I point out again that a statutory regulation has a force as strong in law as any provision of this Bill would have.  With some of the details of a number of the Deputy's suggestions, I do not agree, sometimes on the grounds that they are unnecessary because they are part of the existing law, sometimes on the grounds that they do not go far enough &mdash; for example, he makes no reference to the strip searching problem.  I am opposing it sometimes on the grounds that it would be burdening the Garda with administrative detail without providing any safeguard.  I am opposing his amendment and ask the House to accept my amendment.</P>
      <P>The other major issues raised are what opportunities the House would get to have an input into the regulations.  Certainly they will have the opportunity today, but I shall come back on Report Stage with a comment on the suggestion made by Deputy Shatter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 29 gives the House the opportunity of discussing the regulations if <Col N="1105" /> someone puts down a negative motion saying that they are not acceptable.  I do not think there is a procedural difficulty, but must check the procedure on how I can put down a positive motion to enable the House to discuss the regulations. There is no question of the power of detention in the Bill being given the force of law by me through section 2 unless the regulations are there to enable the Garda to be guided on the treatment of people in custody, and there is no question of that.</P>
    <P>I stress very much the point made by Deputy O'Dea that the failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall not, of itself, render that person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings or, of itself, affect the admissibility of evidence of any statement made by him.  It is very important to focus on the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;of itself&rdquo;.  I think I have explained that pretty fully. I ask the House to accept amendment No. 24.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the Minister and welcome many of the points which he has made. Unfortunately, the debate is proceeding on the lines that the case for detention has been proved and I do not accept this. However, we are now being told that if the need for detention is proved regulations will be brought in governing that detention at a future date, providing we accept this principle of detention now. That is not acceptable to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the need for detention and I do not accept the idea that it should be acceptable to anybody in the House on the basis of regulations which we have not seen, regulating that detention in some ways.  The Minister has defined the kind of things he foresees as being in the regulations but we have no opportunity to judge the terminology that might be used in those regulations, the effectiveness of them, how they will be implemented and by whom.  While the Minister has made a fairly long and detailed case in support of his amendment the basic principle must be that if we are being asked to accept detention we should have <Col N="1106" /> before us a draft of the regulations which he proposes to bring in to regulate that form of detention.</P>
    <P>I believe everybody in the House accepts that this idea of arrest and detention for the purpose of interrogation is a new element in our criminal law and for that reason there is a need for very great care in how we go about it.  The least we can expect from the Minister when we are debating section 3 is that we should have before us a draft of the regulations which will govern detention.  I make that point very strongly despite the fact that his amendment says that the Minister shall make regulations providing for the treatment and so forth of prisoners.  Two years ago the Private Rented Dwellings Act went through this House and it had a provision in it that the Minister for the Environment shall make regulations. The regulations under section 26 of that Act have still not been introduced in the House.  The Act continues to be operated in the courts and now before tribunals. The people affected by that law are very severely hampered by the failure to introduce those regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us an undertaking that section 3 will not operate until such time as he brings in the regulations. I accept the Minister's good intentions in that regard but, if we take the views that have been expressed by representatives of the gardaí who say that as the Bill stands the administrative load which will be placed on the gardaí is unacceptable and that it renders the Bill ineffective, there is no doubt in my mind that between now and the introduction of whatever regulations the Minister proposes there will be fairly heavy lobbying of the Minister to make those regulations as ineffective and in the least way restrictive of the gardaí in a situation of detention. I fully accept the Minister's good intentions in this regard but from my brief experience in this House in this particular situation where it is proposed to change the law so drastically we should have every i dotted before us in the House before the Bill goes through and gets the acclamation of the vast majority of our peers.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Barra Ó</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> Briain report and said that those who oppose the Bill have been quoting it and if they had read it they would not be using it so extensively.  I am one of the people who opposed the Bill and I have read the Ó Briain Report.  I used that report to express the reservations which the Ó Briain committee had in relation to the whole area of the treatment of prisoners while in detention.  The Ó Briain report arose from the abuses of seven day detention under the 1976 emergency legislation. That legislation is still on the statute book and can be brought into effect at any time by the Government.  That report attempted to outline how that kind of emergency legislation should be used. Barra O Briain in a minority report indicated that he thought that detention for offences other than for the subversive type offence should also be liable to detention but he made it quite clear that he thought under no circumstances should that detention extend beyond six hours.  The Minister implied that because Barra Ó Briain added an appendix to the official report and gave his own personal views that that was the Ó Briain report it supports the idea of detention.  That is incorrect and is not a valid case to make.</P>
    <P>The Ó Briain report makes 21 recommendations in relation to how people detained under this emergency legislation should be treated.  The Minister said that a number of these recommendations have been implemented under ordinary garda regulations in garda stations.  I would like the Minister to enumerate for us before we move away from this particular section what precise recommendations of the Ó Briain report have been implemented, what precise recommendations in that report he considers to be unacceptable to him and what recommendations of that report have not been implemented and which are not unacceptable to him will be included in the regulations he says he will introduce.  In opposing the amendment from Deputy Woods the Minister made the point that the amendment as worded would require the person in charge of a station to wake up a person who was asleep in a prison cell.  I made the point, when the Minister <Col N="1108" /> said that, that he must never have spent a night in the Bridewell in Dublin or in Limerick.  I have spent a few nights in the Bridewell in Dublin and I assure him there is not the slightest possiblity that one would get an hour's sleep in the Bridewell.</P>

The President of the United States was invited to this country and we are fully aware of the entourage and the equipment the President brings with him.  I believe that the invitation extended to the President would include an acceptance that he would have an entourage and equipment with him.  With regard to the question of our neutrality, I do not think this in any way affects our neutrality.

I emphasise the fact that this is not the <Col N="1110" /> only example.  I recall when President Kennedy came here.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  I have no hesitation in rejecting the resolution referred to in the Deputies' questions, since it contains a number of proposals which are quite unacceptable to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> Moreover, as Deputies are no doubt aware, this resolution of the European Parliament imposes no obligation on member states.  It cannot, therefore affect our policy of neutrality.</P>
    <P>That policy is already well known to the Members of the European Parliament; besides, the contributions to the debate of the Parliament on this resolution by those Irish Members who spoke constituted a vigorous restatement and defence of our policy of neutrality.  In these circumstances it is, therefore, unnecessary for the Government to make representations to the European Parliament on the matter.  In any event, as Deputies should know, the European Parliament is not answerable to individual governments and it is not normal practice for governments to make representations to it.</P>

There was the Ferguson Report and also the Spinelli Report.  All I can say is that the Irish Members of the European Parliament generally, but in particular the Members of the Christian Democrats Group, have at all times been careful to explain to the European Parliament, so that it would be fully understood, Ireland's neutral position and endeavoured, as far as their limited numbers would allow, to influence the decisions of the European Parliament to take that into account.</P>

      <P>Cardinal Ó Fiaich in his statement of 26 April 1984 referred to the demand for &lsquo;some long-term Irish-born prisoners&rsquo; in Britain to be transferred to serve their sentences in Northern Ireland.  The Government have made representations to the British authorities on behalf of such prisoners requesting transfers, when it was judged that there were convincing reasons justifying such requests.</P>
      <P>In reply the British Government have indicated their willingness in principle to consider particular requests for which there are compelling humanitarian reasons.  I am conscious of the arguments in favour of transfer in certain cases.  I am deeply concerned by the hardship experienced by the families of some of these prisoners.

Does the Minister consider that the British Government's refusal in the vast majority of cases to transfer Irish prisoners serving sentences in English jails to prisons in the North of Ireland underlines a vindictiveness on the part of the British Government towards Irish prisoners?

The first relates to the question of where British soldiers who are convicted of offences are imprisoned &mdash; presumably that is put forward merely as a matter of fact, because that would be a matter for the British authorities. In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question I can say that this area has been discussed on a number of occasions at different levels with the British authorities.

What I must say is that the Government have made representations to the British authorities on behalf of certain prisoners requesting transfer when it was adjudged that there were convincing reasons justifying such requests.  But it would not be appropriate in the interests of those concerned to give details of any of the individual cases which have been raised.  It would be entirely in appropriate to do so and indeed not helpful to the cases that have been made on behalf of those individuals.</P>

There are two aspects to Cardinal Ó Fiaich's statement, the first being that Irish prisoners should be repatriated. The second aspect was that in the cases of specific prisoners who claim to be innocent of the crimes of which they were convicted Cardinal Ó Fiaich is very concerned that the cases of 11 in particular should now be re-opened because of the lack of evidence in relation to their convictions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to confirm that any illegal operations by Northern security forces are completely unacceptable and that the Government have made this plain to the British Government.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that there are occasions when the presence of Northern security forces in our jurisdiction may be authorised, for example, for official visits or for overflights.</P>

      <P>In reply to the first part of the question, I said the allegations are being examined by the Garda authorities at the request of the Minister for Justice.  From a personal point of view I <Col N="1122" /> would see nothing wrong with a discussion on the issue once the examination has been completed.  It will be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, because the investigations are being carried under his jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down the question to the Minister for Justice originally.  I am here because there is a cross-Border element in it.  Does the Minister agree that very grave allegations are being made on a very formal and serious basis?  They are not flimsy allegations which come up from time to time without substantiation. There is an allegation that John Francis Green was murdered by a member of the SAS on the south side of the Border. Does the Minister consider that there may be a British contact operating at Garda Headquarters?  That is an extremely serious and urgent matter.  It is one of the questions which arise very clearly in the allegations made.  There are further allegations in a <i>New Statesman</i> article of 11 May that further British agents are operating.  One is alleged to have been operating within Monaghan Garda Station.  These allegations will have to be examined in a most urgent way.  Will the Minister convey to the Minister for Justice the fact that we will have to have a very thorough report to the House on these investigations?</P>

Will the Minister ensure that a debate on that report and on our counter intelligence agencies will be allowed in the House at reasonable intervals?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the articles in the <i>New Statesman</i> indicated that during the mid-seventies, a period of Coalition Government in which Deputy FitzGerald was Minister for Foreign Affairs, members of the SAS were coming across the Border at a fairly regular rate and were taking part in what were regarded as dirty tricks, bombings, sabotage and even alleged murder on this side of the Border?  Will the Minister confirm that he is satisfied there is no second Crinion operating in Garda Headquarters? There were allegations at that time that more than Pat Crinion was involved.  Could the Minister give us an assurance that no one else is operating here?</P>

In reply to the second part of the question, I have already told the Deputy that I accept that the allegations are grave.  I told the House they are under examination.  With regard to giving a categorical assurance to the House along the lines suggested, I do not see how I could do that.  These allegations are under examination by the Garda.  I do not believe I or any of my colleagues can comment further on these allegations until the examination is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems faced by Crossmaglen Rangers GAA Club are a matter of serious concern to the Government.  Currently there are three main issues in contention between the club and the British authorities.</P>
      <P>The first is the retention within the British Army base of land owned by the GAA.  Some progress was made on this question in 1980 when part of the land requisitioned by the Army from the GAA club was returned.  However, some of the club's land still remains within the Army base.  My efforts to have this land returned will continue.</P>
      <P>The second issue is the use of a right of way across the entrance to the GAA ground by British troops.  I have examined this problem with the representatives of the GAA and have pressed the British authorities to find a satisfactory solution to it.</P>
      <P>The third question is that of compensation to the GAA club for damage suffered. This is a matter between the two parties concerned and is, I am informed, currently the subject of legal action.  I have, however, made known to the British authorities my desire for a speedy and satisfactory settlement.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House, as the Minister assured the GAA when he met a delegation on 25 March 1984, that we will continue to give the GAA all the assistance we can to help settle these outstanding difficulties as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the latter part of the question is concerned, the Deputies will appreciate that details of diplomatic exchanges are a confidential matter <Col N="1126" /> between the parties concerned.  They may rest assured, however, that the matter has been raised on numerous occasions with the British authorities, at both ministerial and official level, and will be raised as necessary in the future.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Conference on Confidence and Security-Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe (CDE) takes place within the framework of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), having received its mandate from the Madrid follow-up meeting of the CSCE which ended in September 1983.  The task of the CDE is to seek negotiated agreement on a series of militarily significant confidence and security-building measures designed to make military behaviour more open and more calculable &mdash; for example, measures designed to reduce fears of surprise <Col N="1132" /> attack.  If agreement can be reached on an ambitious series of such measures before the next CSCE follow-up meeting in Vienna in November 1986, this will open the way to a second stage of the conference dealing with disarmament.</P>
    <P>The first session of the conference, which began on 17 January and ended on 16 March, was addressed by the Foreign Ministers of all participating states.  The second session began on 8 May and will end on 6 July.  While the CDE is not intended to serve as a substitute for negotiations on disarmament conducted elsewhere, the fact that the conference is taking place is important at a time when the overall climate in East-West relations is not good, and when the major nuclear arms control negotiations between the two superpowers are broken off.  In these circumstances the political significance of the conference has transcended its technical character.</P>
    <P>During the first session three series of proposals for new confidence and security-building measures were tabled, the first series being tabled jointly by the 16 members of NATO, the second by Rumania, and the third series jointly by eight neutral and non-aligned countries. On 8 May the Soviet Union tabled six outline proposals already put forward orally by Eastern European states during the first session.</P>
    <P>Eastern and Western participating states have so far pursued divergent conceptual approaches to the work of the CDE.  In the proposals from Western participants, including neutral and non-aligned countries, the emphasis is on measures of a concrete and militarily significant kind.  The last of the six outline proposals from the Soviet Union would involve concrete measures, but the main emphasis in the Soviet proposals is on declaratory measures, such as a proposed treaty between participating states on non-recourse to the threat or use of force &mdash; an existing principle of international relations, enshrined in the UN Charter and repeated in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.  The fact that little progress has yet been achieved in the work of the CDE is in part attributable to difficulties in reconciling these divergent approaches. <Col N="1133" /> The work of the conference would also appear to be affected by the difficult climate prevailing in East-West relations, particularly in relations between the two superpowers.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation at Stockholm has not as yet tabled proposals, first, because proposals for concrete and militarily significant confidence and security-building measures, particularly proposals tabled by Western participants, including neutral and non-aligned States, cover much of what the first stage of the CDE could hope to achieve and, if agreed, would represent considerable progress: secondly, because the work of the CDE is at an early and still largely exploratory stage.  Whether the Irish delegation will in due course table proposals, alone or with others, will depend on how the negotiations evolve.  We and our partners in the Ten are concerned to see respected the criteria in the Madrid mandate that the confidence and security-building measures to be negotiated should be of military significance, politically binding and provided with adequate forms of verification. The Irish delegation have made this concern clear in addressing the proposals now before the CDE.  In the Minister's statement at the opening of the conference and in subsequent statements the Irish delegation have advocated that the conference should seek agreement not only on measures to bring about more openness in regard to military activities, but also on measures involving constraints or limitations on the activities of military forces.  We have welcomed the fact that the paper tabled by eight neutral and non-aligned participants incorporates this approach.  The delegation have also expressed our concern that the measures to be agreed at the CDE should be designed to meet not only the security needs of members of military alliances, but also the security needs of the participating states which are outside military alliances.</P>

      <P>I regret very much that the Minister of State felt the need to read through his reply as quickly as he did, because I would have liked to have analysed it as it was being given.  Can he list <Col N="1134" /> for me what common positions we have adopted so far with our EEC partners and issues on which we have taken an independent stance?  Can he say whether we have sought a nuclear freeze?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to the various proposals is a little complex. If the Deputy wishes I can give him an outline of what the state of play is. Towards the end of the first session the neutral and non-aligned states tabled a joint paper containing a mixture of proposed measures to bring about openness in the military area on the one hand and measures to constrain military activity on the other.  This was following essentially two other series of proposals which for simplicity I will classify as NATO proposals and Warsaw Pact proposals.  The NATO proposals involve six concrete measures to bring about openness in the military area including mandatory exchanges of military information and mandatory notification and observation of specified military activities in compliance with verification measures.  The Warsaw Pact outline proposals include assumption of an obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons and a treaty on the non-use of force, nuclear or conventional, to which proposals they attach the most importance.  Their other outline proposals involve the reduction of military expenditure, removal of chemical weapons from Europe pending negotiation of a ban on these weapons worldwide, the establishment of nuclear-free zones, ceilings on the scale of military manoeuvres and prior notification of major manoeuvres of ground, air and naval forces.</P>
      <P>In relation to the issue of a nuclear-free zone, this is included in the package presented by the Warsaw Pact countries.</P>

At that stage the opening speeches would have been of a general nature and my recollection of the speech, without being certain, is that there is no reference to a nuclear freeze in it.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that there was no mention of a nuclear freeze then, is the Minister of State aware that in the newspapers it was reported that Ireland is the only country not to have tabled proposals at the Stockholm Disarmament Conference?  Can the Minister confirm or deny this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw a report in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 6 May which indicates that Ireland is not the only country so far not to advance proposals.  I do not believe that that report is totally correct.  To give one example, I am aware that one member of the neutral and non-aligned group is not a co-sponsor of the neutral and non-aligned proposals.  However, I have outlined the Irish position at the conference and also the position of our delegation in regard to the tabling of proposals. In some ways it could be said that our position emphasises our situation as a militarily neutral country.</P>

      <P>The Minister has outlined the role of the Warsaw Pact and NATO countries.  Can he say if the Government have developed a policy on the role of the Western European Union and how the Government see the role of the WEU?  Secondly, could the Minister of State confirm that the policy enunciated by the Taoiseach is still Government policy, that is, that Government policy is to seek a balanced reduction of nuclear armament?  I emphasise the word &ldquo;balanced&rdquo;.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice Bill, 1983: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 16:</P>
    <P>In page 5, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following subsections:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(10)  (a)  A person arrested pursuant to this section shall be informed, at the time of his arrest, of the offence or offences in respect of which he is being arrested.</P>
    <P>(b)  When a person arrested pursuant to this section is brought to a Garda Síochána station the member in charge shall enter in the records of the station without delay&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the time of the person's arrest;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the time of his arrival at the Garda Síochána station;</P>
    <P>(iii)  the offence or offences in respect of which that person has been arrested. </P>
    <P>(c)  When a person arrested pursuant <Col N="1175" /> to this section has been brought to a Garda Síochána station, the member in charge shall give to him, as soon as practicable, a statement in writing of the offence or offences in respect of which he has been arrested, and shall specify in the said statement and enter in the records of the station the time at which the said statement is given to that person.</P>
    <P>(d)  If a person who is being detained pursuant to this section in a Garda Síochána station is questioned for the purpose of the investigation, the member in charge shall keep a record of the names of the persons engaged in such questioning and the periods during which they were so engaged.</P>
    <P>(e)  If a direction extending the period of detention is given pursuant to subsection 3 (b), or a certificate authorising the questioning of a detainee between midnight and 8 a.m. is given pursuant to subsection 6 (a) the officer of the Garda Síochána responsible for giving same shall as soon as practicable provide the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station with details of the grounds upon which such direction or certificate was given, and the member in charge shall without delay, enter the details of the said grounds in the records of the Garda Síochána station. </P>
    <P>(11) (a)  Where a person is detained pursuant to this section he shall not be questioned for the purpose of the investigation for a consecutive period in excess of 4 hours.</P>
    <P>(b)  A period of questioning shall be deemed to be consecutive if there is not an interval of at least 1 hour since such person was last questioned for the purpose of the investigation. </P>
    <P> (12) (a)  Where a person is detained in a Garda Síochána station pursuant to this section the member in charge shall, from time to time during any such period of detention visit the detainee, and in particular shall do so at <Col N="1176" /> least once every hour, and shall on the occasion of each visit enquire from that person whether he has any complaints concerning the circumstances of his detention.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where a complaint is made by or on behalf of a person arrested or detained pursuant to this section concerning the circumstances of his arrest or his detention to any member of the Garda Síochána such member shall forthwith communicate the details of the complaint to the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station who shall enter the details of such complaint in the records of the Garda Síochána station.</P>
    <P>(c)  Where a complaint is made by or on behalf of a person arrested or detained pursuant to this section, in connection with his arrest or the circumstances of his detention, the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station shall enter in the records of the Garda Síochána station details of any such complaint without delay. </P>
    <P> (13) (a)  Where a person is detained in a Garda Síochána station pursuant to this section he shall, at any time during such a period of detention, be entitled to make and retain notes in writing.</P>
    <P>(b)  If such a person so requests he shall be provided with the necessary materials for the purpose of making notes referred to in paragraph (a).</P>
    <P>(c)  Where the detention of a person is authorised pursuant to this section he shall, without delay, be informed by the member in charge of his right to make and keep the notes referred to in paragraph (a) and that the materials to enable him to do so will be made available to him should he request them.</P>
    <P>(14)  Where a person detained pursuant to this section is questioned for the purpose of the investigation the entire of the questioning shall be recorded by electronic or other means.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Woods.) </P>
    <Col N="1177" />
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that the Minister was opposed to the amendment put forward by Deputy Woods on the ground that it required the person in charge of the Garda station to visit the person detained once every hour and to inquire whether he had any grounds for complaints.  It is highly unlikely that a person, other than a hardened criminal or a person used to such conditions, being detained in any of the stations in the Dublin area or in the Bridewell would have any opportunity to sleep and therefore he would not in the normal course of events have to be wakened up to have these questions put to him.  The eight-hour rest period allowed for under the detention section is only eight of the 20 hours which is allowed and presumably the other 12 hours would be taken up with questioning by the Garda. It is not unreasonable to expect that the person whose duty it is to ensure the well-being of the person detained would have the right to go at regular intervals into the interview room and ensure that everything was in order and find out whether the person being questioned had any grounds for complaint.  I would urge the Minister to reconsider his attitude to the amendment.  There seem to be grounds for tightening it up, but if detention is to be accepted &mdash; I would not wish it to be &mdash; there is clearly a need to ensure that every possible protection is granted to those who are liable to be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As a layman with no legal experience I would not be too fussy about whether the safeguards for people detained in custody are enshrined in primary legislation or in regulations brought in by the Minister.  I listened to the Minister's assurances that he would consider introducing a motion whereby these regulations could be debated by the House.  I am satisfied that would be the better course, because this House could change the regulations in a more speedy fashion than if they were enshrined in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister has found merit in many of the suggestions contained in the amendment put <Col N="1178" /> forward by Deputy Woods.  I would urge the Minister to give favourable consideration to the suggestion that people in custody be given an opportunity to take notes and supplied with the necessary material.  It can be difficult for a person to remember what he did yesterday unless he makes a note of it.  The taking of notes would be especially important in a case which might not come before the courts for some months.</P>
    <P>I am pleased at the provision in subsection (3) of amendment No. 24 that if the Garda fail in some way to carry out the regulations it will not affect the lawful custody of the person.  The public have for too long been frustrated by the fact that people before the courts have been let off on technicalities.  This section will put an end to that.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of the Minister's amendment is crucial because it deals with the problem of gardaí who do not obey these regulations.  There may be minor discrepancies where a garda would forget to put in the name or the time accurately.  There could also be serious breaches of the regulations.  The Minister has told the House that strip-searching will not be allowed under this Bill.  It is allowed only in regard to the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Offences Against the State Act.  If a garda were to commit the serious offence of strip-searching a person under this Bill, what sort of punishment would he receive?  If we are giving extra powers to the Garda it must be guaranteed that people in custody will be treated lawfully and that any garda acting outside the law will be punished.  The Minister is aware that I have a problem in this area, and I would welcome an assurance in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the Minister is in agreement with many of the safeguards I have proposed.  I accept that it may subsequently be found that other safeguards are necessary.  This could possibly be changed, with experience.  We might get the best of both worlds by inserting the safeguards which are directly connected with the powers given within the Bill and also accepting the <Col N="1179" /> Minister's amendment, giving him the power by regulation to make other regulations and amendments in the future. The Minister has shown himself quite willing to make regulations along these lines and to ensure that these are suitable regulations, not creating any undue administrative burden.</P>
      <P>The requirements would be met by taking our proposed amendments.  The Association of Criminal Lawyers have said that the Act may come under the scrutiny of the European Commission on Human Rights.  If so, it would be essential that the statute include the powers which are the safeguards &mdash; that they would be seen to be in the Act.  On the one hand, one would have powers given to the Garda and on the other reasonable safeguards within the Act related to those powers, in so far as they can be related at this stage.  A power is also left to the Minister to make further regulations where appropriate.  By combining the two we should probably have a much better Act in the long run.  In that respect we agree with the Minister's amendment No. 24, in so far as it gives him power to make regulations providing for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations.</P>
      <P>Initially I talked only about subsection (10) of amendment No. 16 with all the further paragraphs.  Since we are taking all these together, I wish to say something about the other subsections.  On subsection 11 (a):</P>
      <P>Where a person is detained pursuant to this section he shall not be questioned for the purpose of the investigation for a consecutive period in excess of 4 hours. </P>
      <P>The Minister says that that is already fairly well the practice.  In fact, the practice would seem to vary somewhat at present &mdash; in some circumstances the period being longer, but I accept that may frequently be the practice.  Nevertheless, the O Briain Report recommends clearly on page 18, section 58, that the maximum consecutive questioning period should be four hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some studies and research are also <Col N="1180" /> worth mentioning.  One of the great disadvantages in this area at present is lack of experience of this kind of measure of detention on suspicion, but figures are available elsewhere.  A study was published in the <i>Criminal Law Review</i>, page 596, under the heading: &ldquo;Confessions and Police Interrogation of Suspects&rdquo; by Barry Mitchell, Lecturer-in-Law, Coventry, Lancaster Polytechnic.  This provides some interesting information on this kind of question.  In relation to the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure, they were concerned about interrogation of suspects by the police.  A number of studies were therefore undertaken under the auspices of the Royal Commission and some of the results of these are of considerable interest. Particularly of interest is the work of Baldwin and McCondrel in their examination of the importance of confessions in Crown Court cases held in Birmingham and London.  Nearly 86 per cent of defendants were questioned by the police for less than two hours.  In effect, they did not seem to need very greatly extended periods of questioning, much of their required information being obtained in a fairly short time.  Those accused of non-sexual violence were for the most part interrogated very briefly. Nearly 89 per cent were actually questioned for less than one hour.</P>
    <P>From conversations I have had with members of the Garda force in relation to this matter, a great deal of the information required will come in the first four hours in any event.  I know that the Minister can argue that there will be cases in which it will take many hours and many days, but these are exceptional cases.  We must look at the statistics when we are bringing in legislation for general law. We are not talking here about subversive crime but about any crime to which a five year sentence can apply.  I mention that in support of subsection (11) (a) of my amendment suggesting that a continuous period of interrogation in excess of four hours should not be undertaken.  Also a break in this period of interrogation should be of an interval of at least one hour since the person was last questioned for the purpose of the investigation.  The <Col N="1181" /> whole intention is to try to keep to normal questioning and away from any form of torture by mental abuse, or wearing people out.  This is in line with what the Garda think is necessary in the vast majority of cases and the Minister says that this is already fairly close to the practice.</P>
    <P>Subsection (12) (a) is as follows:</P>
    <P>Where a person is detained in a Garda Síochána station pursuant to this section the member in charge shall, from time to time during any such period of detention visit the detainee, and in particular shall do so at least once every hour, and shall on the occasion of each visit enquire from that person whether he has any complaints concerning the circumstances of his detention. </P>
    <P>Mention of a member in charge brings in some element of responsibility and the concept of the custodial guardian which the Minister appears to accept as a valid concept.  The Minister has mentioned the question of waking somebody up during that period and others have mentioned it also, but that is not a serious problem.  It would be simple to amend the legislation so that somebody sleeping would not be disturbed.</P>
    <P>Apparently, at present a log book or day book is kept in Garda stations and a good deal of this information on visits, meals and so forth is logged.  The Minister has said that he would not be inflexible in relation to this area and that periodic visits would seem to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Subsection (12) (b) is as follows:</P>
    <P>Where a complaint is made by or on behalf of a person arrested or detained pursuant to this section concerning the circumstances of his arrest or his detention to any member of the Garda Síochána such member shall forthwith communicate the details of the complaint to the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station who shall enter the details of such complaint in the records of the Garda Síochána station. </P>
    <P>The purpose there is to put an onus on <Col N="1182" /> any member who may be involved, even if he happens to be the person doing the questioning, to convey the information to the member in charge who will then enter it in the book.  If the complaint is made about the person questioning, he may not want to convey it to the member in charge, but we could put an onus on such interrogator or questioner to convey that information to the member in charge.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) states:</P>
    <P>Where a complaint is made by or on behalf of a person arrested or detained pursuant to this section, in connection with his arrest or the circumstances of his detention, the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station shall enter in the records of the Garda Síochána station details of any such complaint without delay. </P>
    <P>The Minister has given an undertaking that there is to be a complaints commission so there will have to be provisions like this to fit in with the operation of the section.  That is why I believe it is important to have them in the statute.  Subsection (13) (a) states:</P>
    <P>Where a person is detained in a Garda Síochána station pursuant to this section he shall, at any time during such a period of detention, be entitled to make and retain notes in writing. </P>
    <P>I believe it is important that a person should be in a position to assist his or her memory subsequently in any court proceedings that might take place.  The Minister said he would consider this.  From some of the cases we have seen it is quite clear that a person's recollection of the details subsequently are quite important. Even in relation to the protection of the gardaí who are doing the questioning this is very important to ensure that there are no misrepresentations of what happened or forgetfulness about what happened. Then there is the question of the length of time that one is interrogated for.  It is only reasonable that a person should have available, if he or she wants it, <Col N="1183" /> material to take notes during such a period.</P>
    <P>The final subsection, subsection (14), states:</P>
    <P>Where a person detained pursuant to this section is questioned for the purpose of the investigation the entire of the questioning shall be recorded by electronic or other means.</P>
    <P>The Ó Briain Report suggested that the feasibility of such studies should be looked at.  I hope the Minister will at least undertake such feasibility studies.  There is a lot of evidence from elsewhere that there is resistance among the Garda to any of this type of recording, that there might be a suggestion that their interrogation would not be of the highest order and fairness.</P>
    <P>Various kinds of electronic means have been used.  In one instance the video recording would ensure that there were no physical acts which were particularly threatening or upsetting for the individual. If a person is bruised that will be seen afterwards.  It is possible to have physical aggression which would be taken up on a video screen.  We saw on Second Stage that there were instances in the United States and there were particular States where this actually applies and that kind of video recording is made.  The full recording of sound needs a lot of questioning. There are various reservations because in some cases the main questioning has been done before the recording has been turned on &mdash; that is one of the allegations made &mdash; and consequently the final questioning tends to be a very quick one.  As it stands at the moment it is fair to say that there is not enough established about this whole area and how best to use it.  One of the arguments put forward by the Garda is that if a person sees a taperecorder he or she will not give other information which would be given by word of mouth.  That could be a practical difficulty.</P>
    <P>I put this amendment down so that we could encourage the Minister to carry out feasibility studies and pursue the question of recording by electronic or other <Col N="1184" /> means to try to get suitable recordings. The two people, McConville and Philip Morell have done an interesting study in relation to recording.  This is referred to in the Criminal Law Review, 1983, page 158 and subsequent pages.  They talk about where it was introduced in some of the areas and where there was considerable suspicion about the system.  They say that one immediate result in both areas was that the number of suspects interviewed dropped from the level obtaining in the pre-experimental period. The second clear effect on the police, they said, has been on the duration of the interrogation.  In both Dundee and Falkirk taped interviews, were with only minor exceptions, considerably shorter than those reported during the pre-monitoring period.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be considered.  At this stage I could not say any more than that the Minister should carry out the feasibility studies.  The Ó Briain Report suggested that feasibility studies should be initiated at once to establish if video taping of interrogations in the investigation of serious crime is a viable proposition and, in addition, tape recording should be tried on as wide a basis as possible to discover if this would be feasible.  As the Minister pointed out this was quite some time ago.  It is time those feasibility studies were undertaken.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister is broadly in agreement with having safeguards. There are, quite naturally, some differences in regard to some of the details. The main difference is whether it should be in the Bill or whether it should be purely by regulation.  Those which are directly related to the powers given in the Bill should be in the Bill and the Minister should have power to make regulations beyond that, where he sees fit.  As the Minister said, many things which were mentioned here are being done as part of a code of practice, so the ones we are talking about should not involve much additional administrative work.  I appreciate that this is a problem.  It is surprising that there has been so much comment along the lines of safeguards bringing about an increase in the administrative workload.  If many of them are being <Col N="1185" /> done as part of a code of practice it can hardly have any real influence on the workload if those others are contained within the Bill as specific requirements. I take the Minister's attitude in relation to it but I believe we should have within the Bill the ones that are directly related to powers that are in the Bill.  The Minister could then consider what other regulations he wants to have and he would have that power generally to make regulations where he considers this necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is basic agreement in relation to the need for regulations or a code of practice when people are in custody.  Two view points have been put forward in relation to whether it should be in the Bill, statutorily set out, or brought in by way of regulation.  Initially, I felt it did not make a lot of difference.  Probably in reality it would have the same effect.  However, in relation to the time scale and in relation to any amendments which might need to be brought in it might be slightly quicker to bring them about by regulation.  At times there seems to be a slowing down in the legislative process.  I was glad the Minister was able to report progress on the complaints procedure.  I hope this will come before the House soon.  The Minister indicated it was at an advanced stage and perhaps he cannot be more definite on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that some progress was being made with regard to regulations.  Perhaps in the aftermath of this debate he will have to consider if some other items should be incorporated in the regulations.  They will have to be twofold. Certain points such as the time of arrest will be recorded.  There is also the question of people in detention and their basic entitlements in the way of refreshments, meals, visits by their relatives or their solicitor and medical treatment if that is necessary.  The place of detention will obviously be a prison but it will have to be up to a certain standard.  In drawing up the regulations the Minister must ensure that basic justice is given to the detained person.  However, the regulations must not be such as to ensure that a <Col N="1186" /> person on a serious charge and where there is substantive evidence that he is guilty can walk away from the charge because of the fact that one little point was not adhered to when he was detained.  We must ensure that the procedures and administration in a Garda station are carried out in an efficient way. The regulations will have to cover a wide area.  Regard will have to be had to the basic entitlements of people to which the Garda will have to adhere when interviewing and detaining people in custody.</P>
    <P>I hope the regulations will be brought before the House and that we will have an opportunity to discuss them and if amendments are necessary I hope we can put them forward.  I am sure the Minister will have regard to points of view that have been expressed in this debate and elsewhere.  It is important that the Minister should bring forward the regulations as soon as possible.  Some of the proposals put forward by Deputy Woods are to be commended.  There is always room for improvement in any legislation that is brought before the House and I am sure Deputy Woods accepts that.  We would have liked to discuss the regulations with the Bill.  However, I understand the Bill will not take effect before the regulations and the complaints procedure are in force.  This is the right attitude because the House will have an opportunity to discuss them.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement on the need for regulations or a code of practice. The measure will have to be drafted carefully. It will have to be specific in some instances but not to the extent that it will totally mesmerise the Garda so that at every point they will have to write down what they are doing at all times.  In other words, the court must be free to interpret that the person detained was dealt with in a proper manner and if some points were omitted, then the Garda can face disciplinary measures on another level. In the case of a person who is substantially guilty, the fact that one item was not adhered to when he was in detention should not mean that he can walk scotfree from a very serious crime.</P>

      <P>Outside this House <Col N="1187" /> I have expressed my reservations about section 3 in its entirety and its challenge to the civil liberties of the law-abiding citizen.  I see the section as extremely dangerous by any standards of the legal system of any nation.  I realise that my party have accepted it in principle and as I am a democrat in that party system and as I accept the majority view I accept that the section, after being clarified, must be given passage through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern but we are at present dealing with amendments Nos. 16 and 24 and at the end of this discussion we will be dealing with the section.  Perhaps therefore the Deputy's general remarks could be retained for that part of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to amendments Nos. 16 and 24.  I was merely giving a preliminary introduction to my observations on those amendments. I accept that the section will pass through the House but I accept it extremely begrudgingly.  One has to keep repeating that if one criticises this Bill it is then suggested that one is in some way anti-Garda.  My record over 20 years in this House has been anything but anti-Garda; I am extremely pro-Garda.  That is why I am now expressing these views.</P>
      <P>I come now to Deputy Woods's amendments, in particular amendment No. 16, which proposes the insertion of various subsections at the end of section 3.  These are reasonable amendments.  Again, reverting to the principle of the Bill, I must say that it is a most bureaucratic one with pieces of paper for this, that and the other which one has to sign.  I do not know that that constitutes a very good system, but in the meantime it has to happen.  Indeed the number of documents one may have to sign indicates the treacherous nature of the Bill itself, the mere fact that one has to have such additional safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods's amendment is extremely proper.  I totally disagree with the Minister's amendment No. 24 where he says that he intends making regulations in order to in some way perfect the Bill.  This Bill demands that anything pertaining <Col N="1188" /> to it should be incorporated in the body of the Bill itself, that everything should be up front.  We should not be seeking another regulation for this, that or the other thing.  Indeed it is a Bill about which I personally have the gravest of doubts.  I am accepting it merely by virtue of the party system which must be seen to be working&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be reverting to his old argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality of Deputy Woods's amendment is that his proposed new subsections be incorporated in the Bill itself.  In order to indicate how reasonable is Deputy Woods's amendment I might quote subsection (11) (a), which says:</P>
      <P>Where a person is detained pursuant to this section he shall not be questioned for the purpose of the investigation for a consecutive period in excess of 4 hours.</P>
      <P>I consider that a person being questioned for four hours is being given a hard time. I do not know if a person has to be questioned.  It would not be unreasonable to expect that the Minister would accept that amendment.  I might quote further subsection (11) (b) of that amendment which says:</P>
      <P>A period of questioning shall be deemed to be consecutive if there is not an interval of at least one hour since such person was last questioned for the purpose of the investigation.</P>
      <P>I would not give any kudos to the Minister for accepting that portion.  Then, Deputy Woods's amendment goes on to deal with the various other proper protections of a person so detained under section 3.</P>
      <P>We come then to the Minister's amendment No. 24, the first portion of which reads:</P>
      <P>6. &mdash;(1)  The Minister shall make regulations providing for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda Síochána stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> (2)  The regulations shall include provision for the assignment to the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of a Garda Síochána station...</P>
    <P>The third paragraph of the Minister's amendment reads:</P>
    <P>(3)  A failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall not of itself&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;This is something the Minister might explain to the House&mdash;</P>
    <P>render that person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person or the admissibility in evidence of any statement made by him.</P>
    <P>That is a strange paragraph which I would ask the Minister to explain very carefully and in detail.  The final part of the Minister's amendment reads:</P>
    <P>(4)  A failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall render him liable to disciplinary proceedings.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I presume &ldquo;disciplinary proceedings&rdquo; are those contained within the proposed Garda Complaints Tribunal or those within the current Garda regulations, another question the Minister might answer in detail.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods's amendment proposes the incorporation of its various parts in the Bill itself whereas the Minister's amendment is to be effected by regulation. Subject to whatever the Minister may say about those proposed regulations, I contend that Deputy Woods's amendment should be accepted in its entirety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the regulations will be introduced, debated and accepted by this House before the detention powers being given in this Bill are implemented.  Nobody in the House can stress the importance of that sufficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> It is of great importance that we concentrate on, and have the Minister reply to, the question of the availability of facilities regarding such detention.  Certainly I would endorse the feasability and, hopefully, the implementation of, for instance, electronic recordings within Garda stations because there is a need for them.  Without going into the sophistication and technology of electronic video recordings and so on, the detention powers given in this section would require a certain amount of space and comfort that I believe may not be available throughout the country at present. They are of importance and relevance and, if not available, I should like to know what are the immediate proposals for making them available?</P>
    <P>We all have our concerns about this section but there is no point in our continuing to debate it unless we feel that the very basic facilities are to be provided for the protection of people being detained, that not alone are they fully safeguarded but that a basic standard of comfort is also provided.  There is a need for us to concentrate totally, in regard to the introduction of any regulations or in agreeing to any amendments here, on the need for the Garda Síochána being trained in their implementation.  I will leave it at that at this stage.</P>

Perhaps it is necessary in the context of the present crime situation to erode civil liberties to some extent but the Minister has also accepted that, when there is legislation which erodes civil liberties in a democracy, there must also be adequate safeguards.  Unfortunately <Col N="1191" /> there is a wide divergence between the Minister's actions and his words.  He has not provided adequate safeguards in this Bill.  What are the safeguards provided? He tells us the regulations will be implemented regardless of how detailed, how wide, or how specific these regulations are.  The Bill states in black and white that a breach of these regulations will not of itself render the evidence inadmissible.</P>

      <P>I accept that, but the situation is that there are no safeguards being introduced to alleviate this Bill. That is the reality.  Our amendment suggests certain safeguards.  It is not radical. With all due respect to Deputy Woods, he proposes in this very imaginative amendment the minimum obvious safeguards <Col N="1192" /> needed.  That is the point.  Deputy Shatter says our suggestion is inadequate. If that is so, why would the Minister not agree to accept the amendment?  There are obvious minimal safeguards which should be included in the primary legislation. That is our view.  The accused should be told what his offence is.</P>

An obvious safeguard is that the accused should not be questioned for four hours, that he be given at least one hour in order to complain about his detention, if he has any complaints about the circumstances of his detention.  This is a minimal safeguard and I cannot see why the Minister will not agree to it as part of the primary legislation but rather include it under some regulation which the court may decide the Garda may break at will.  This is not a criminal justice Bill.  The justice element is missing.  There are no adequate safeguards and the Minister will not accept even the minimal safeguards contained in our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's amendment providing for regulations, I welcome the fact that there are to be regulations but, like some of the previous speakers, I feel the regulations should be scheduled.  I agree circumstances could and would no doubt arise from time to time under which it might be necessary for the Minister to make amending regulations depending on how the regulations work out in practice. There is no reason why the Bill should not provide that the initial set of regulations be part of the Bill itself and the Minister be given power to amend the regulations from time to time in the usual way.  By tabling the amendments Members would have an opportunity of examining them.  That is one point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point is that, if the provisions regarding regulations are to be of value, a copy of these regulations should be shown to a person taken into custody so that he would know what his rights were. <Col N="1193" /> The way the amendment is framed would indicate that this is more in the nature of guidelines to conduct for the Garda.  That is very welcome.  It is right and proper that there should be guidelines but that is only one side of the coin.  The other side of the coin is that the guidelines should be a protection and safeguard to a person deprived of his or her liberty. That would involve a condition precedent whereby a copy of the regulations be produced to any person taken into custody and that person be given a reasonable opportunity of studying those regulations so that he or she would know exactly what his or her position was.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment of Deputy Dr. Woods in relation to questioning, I am concerned about the implication that is being brought into the debate, both in the wording of the original and in the amendment by Dr. Woods. It becomes implicit almost even on Dr. Woods amendment, which is directed towards alleviating the situation, a person could be detained under section 3 and interrogated or questioned against his will for a period of four hours quite irrespective of his physical condition at the commencement of the four-hour period and quite irrespective of what his mental condition might be or his state of health generally might be.  There could be situations in which, because of a person's physical or mental condition, he or she should not be subjected to questioning at all or any comment raised if he or she refuses to be questioned if the physical or mental condition was such as to render such questioning unjust.  There should be some provisions written into the regulations.  In appropriate cases independent medical opinion or certificate should be required by the custodial garda or whoever is in charge of the particular situation.</P>
    <P>The position, as I understand it, under the general law is that a person may not be subjected to interrogation or questioning in any case unless he or she consents to be questioned or interrogated.  If that is so that should be made very clear and the impression that questioning can go on for many hours, irrespective of whether or not the person wills it, is in <Col N="1194" /> itself quite a fearsome punishment to someone who may well at the end of the day turn out to be not guilty of anything at all.  It should be made quite clear both in the eventual wording of the section, as amended, and in the regulations, that a person is not obliged to undergo grilling and interrogation whether it is for eight hours, four hours or half an hour and that they may refuse to undergo that questioning process.  I would not like it to go abroad by implication, as even Dr. Woods's amendment would have it, that the four hours at a go are perfectly all right and that as long as you do not exceed the four hours it will be acceptable.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the proposed regulations could not be incorporated in the legislation because persons detained might use those regulations <Col N="1195" /> as part of their defence and that they might get off on a technicality.  I remember him saying that because he made a personal remark about me at the same time.  The Minister should consider incorporating the regulations in the proposed legislation which he told us have been cleared by the Cabinet to deal with an independent complaints tribunal. Surely it would be possible to incorporate those regulations in that legislation?  To say that incorporating them in this legislation could give a good defence on the basis of a technicality to somebody prosecuted under this section does not do away with the possibility of introducing these regulations by way of Statute.  They could be incorporated in later legislation, presumably to be brought in before the summer recess, to deal with the setting up of the complaints tribunal since the Cabinet have already cleared it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he would like to have a debate on the code and that the technical procedure for doing so would require the putting down of an amendment to a later section.  I hope that such an amendment will be put down and that we will get an opportunity to debate the code.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make further points arising from contributions made by other Deputies.  It has been suggested that it would be worth while to let persons who are detained and who wish to make statements write the statements themselves.  That is not always a practical proposition in view of the fact that there is a fairly high degree of illiteracy, certainly among those who end up in our prisons.  We know, from the very scarce statistics available, that 80 per cent of convictions in the courts arise from confessions.  To suggest that persons should write their own statements is not a solution to the problem and it highlights the difficulties which Deputies have in discussing regulations without having those regulations before them and being asked to pass a detention section without knowing precisely what the safeguards are going to be to protect persons who are brought in under that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> Assuming that we present copies of these regulations to persons who are detained, the same problem of illiteracy arises.  The Annual Report on Prisons and Places of Detention 1982 states on page 20 that adult basic education, including literacy teaching, is an area of major development since a very large number of prisoners appear to have received little education before imprisonment. A large proportion of people in our prisons and places of detention most of whom are in prison as a result of making confessions, are not able to read or write.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to intervene in this debate because I am so much in favour of passing this Bill.  Listening to the views expressed on this and other amendments, one must ask whether this House is passing legislation in order to be helpful to the suspect or to facilitate the criminal.  My interest is to see that the Bill is passed as soon as possible to put an end to the appalling lawlessness throughout the country.  The sooner the House comes to grips with that aspect of the legislation the better.</P>
      <P>I have had experience of people being brought to police stations for questioning, some guilty and others innocent.  I want to lay special emphasis on what has been referred to by many Deputies in speaking on this amendment.  Many people do not understand legal phraseology and usually when they are brought into a Garda station for questioning, legal phraseology is used.  The surroundings of a Garda station are no encouragement to a person of nervous disposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When replying to questions asked by the Garda many people say yes when they should say no.  One or two cases in my constituency come to mind.  They were dealt with by the courts and convictions were handed down.  I am absolutely satisfied that those convictions were wrong.  Knowing my constituents who were involved, I am quite satisfied that in no circumstances would they tell me an untruth in the secrecy of my house.  Perhaps I am living in a fool's paradise. Knowing their background, I do not think I am.  A constituent of mine was <Col N="1197" /> charged with and convicted of stealing an alarm clock.  When he was being questioned he did not know whether he was saying yes or no.  He just wanted to get out.  In the Garda station he said: &ldquo;I will say whatever you want me to say, so long as you let me out, and my parents do not learn that I was here&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These people are entitled to the benefit of safeguards under the law.  The Minister represents a rural constituency as I do.  I want to assure him that, when they are approached by the Garda authorities, numerous people do not answer correctly through no fault of their own but through fear.  Quite a number of people cannot make written statements.  Members of the House know the appalling situation that exists even with our great standards of education when we read some of the letters our constituents write to us.  It is extremely difficult to make out the writing. The good old copperplate writing is gone.  It is not taught any more.  A biro is used and we no longer have properly shaped letters.  Many people find it difficult to describe anything in writing.  They ring us up and say: &ldquo;We do not want to write to you about this.  We are not too good at it.  We will talk to you about it&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very glad if the Minister would bear in mind another problem.  It is covered by the amendment we are discussing. The Garda authorities may be pressing for a conviction.  The pressure may be on for a full investigation into a particular crime.  It may be suggested that the Garda in a station or a sub-district are not sufficiently alert according to Garda headquarters and that they must endeavour to get a conviction.  The older members of the Garda force such as chief superintendents, superintendents and inspectors are far more reasonable than <Col N="1198" /> some of the young gardaí who want to get a conviction to have that conviction registered in their favour in an effort to obtain promotion in the force at a later date.</P>

      <P>If you say I am, I accept your ruling.  I want to convey to the Minister my anxiety about giving safeguards and protection to the non-intellectual who may be brought into a Garda station and who can convict himself by what he says.  We must protect such a citizen, but I hope the House will not spend too much time in an effort to provide safeguards which will enable criminals to drive a coach and four through the regulations.  Amendments may be suggested to help the non-intellectuals who are numerous in our community. We may be described as anti-Garda. Deputy Andrews referred to that a few moments ago.  Far from it.  I admire the integrity of the Garda, but the entire force are not angels.  All Members of this House are not angels.  Angels are few in organised communities.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to see the regulations written into the Bill.  We may not always have a conscientious Minister for Justice as we have now.  I have every confidence that the Minister will be cautious about making regulations, and that there will be provisions in them to ensure that even the dumbest in our community cannot convict themselves in a Garda station on their own admission, or statement, or evidence.  The Minister should consider this amendment carefully.  All Ministers for Justice in the past were not angels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice must be concerned to safeguard the rights of citizens. I am a great believer in the rights of individuals and citizens.  I do not want the strong arm of the State to deprive them of rights and privileges.  When statements <Col N="1199" /> are being made and when questions are being asked in Garda stations, a solicitor should be present.  In the Incorporated Law Society there are men of dedication and integrity.  We can boast of the very high standards in the legal profession.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to thank Members for their contributions. A lot of the matters referred to this afternoon were dealt with this morning but I shall deal with the new points raised.  I am opposed to Deputy Woods's amendment, first because I believe a statutory regulation is a better way of providing the safeguards which it is my intention to provide for people who are detained by the Garda in custody under any circumstances.  Secondly, I am opposed to the amendment because certain portions of it are irrelevant in that they are covered already by existing law. That certainly applies to his suggested subsection (10) (a) and, as a consequence of that subsection (10) (c) which becomes irrelevant.  The suggested subsection (14) is in direct conflict with section 26, the provision on electronic recording.  I do not have any intention of accepting something <Col N="1200" /> in an amendment which can be adequately discussed in section 26 when we reach it.</P>
      <P>More fundamentally I am opposed to the amendment because the regulations the Deputy is suggesting do not provide sufficient real safeguards.  We would need to go beyond that to ensure that the safeguards which are the concern of all Members who have contributed are provided. For example, there is no reference to strip-searching in the Bill and the regulations should cover that.  If one looks at Deputy Woods's amendment one will notice that all paragraphs begin with such words as &ldquo;a person arrested pursuant to this section&rdquo;.  The Deputy's amendment proposes to give safeguards to those arrested under the powers in section 3. The regulations will give powers to all people detained in custody.  That is more extensive than what Deputy Woods is proposing.  People arrested under the Offences Against the State Act will be given safeguards in my proposal.  Those brought to a Garda station, charged and detained in the station overnight before appearing before a district justice the following morning will be given safeguards under the regulations.  Deputy Woods's amendment is seriously defective because it confines the safeguards solely to those arrested pursuant to section 3 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa took me up on the Ó Briain report.  I intend to refer to that report when the House is dealing with the section.  The Deputy asked me to outline the parts of that report that have been implemented.  I should like to refer to a statement issued by Deputy Gerry Collins, when he was Minister for Justice, after the Government of the day had examined the Ó Briain report.  That statement, which was issued through the Government Information Services, indicates the sections of the report that were acceptable and those that were not.  If necessary I will read that statement to the House but it would be better if I gave the Deputy a copy of it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I can give the Deputy a copy of the statement issued by Deputy Collins and give him an indication &mdash; it is not meant to be conclusive &mdash; of what has been implemented.  For example, Garda regulations were amended as a result of the Ó Briain report.  For instance, No. 4527 states that when questioning of a suspect is permissible such questioning should be conducted in a fair and humane manner; not more than four members should be present at any one time and, where possible, the questioning should be confined to two members.  It states that persons should not be questioned for a continuous period in excess of four hours without a reasonable break and such a break should be at least one hour if circumstances permit.  It also states that questioning between the hours of midnight and 8 a.m. should only be carried out where there are exceptional circumstances, for example, if there is a danger to persons' lives or a danger of serious damage to property.  It also states that members in charge of the station should ensure that prisoners are securely confined.  There are also regulations about confinement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to illustrate to the House that there would be a danger of a person listening to us, somebody in the press gallery or public gallery, thinking that there were no regulations at present guiding the Garda in the treatment of people in custody.  There are regulations and they were revised as a result of the Ó Briain report.  They incorporate many of the recommendations of that report. These internal Garda regulations, and other regulations which the Minister sees fit to draft, will now be statutory.  I propose to bring forward statutory regulations. In making them statutory the section of the amendment which has given <Col N="1203" /> Deputy O'Dea so much concern arises &mdash; a failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations should not of itself render that person liable to criminal or civil proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person or the admissibility in evidence of any statement made by him.  This morning I explained what I meant by that. That does not give any immunity to any member of the Garda Síochána.  If the member of the Garda Síochána in his behaviour or treatment of a person in custody does anything to suggest that he has committed a criminal offence or has engaged in a civil wrong against the person in custody he will not be given immunity. Existing law will provide for that but the transgression of a regulation will not of itself wrongfoot the garda and make what is not a criminal offence a criminal offence or make what is not a civil wrongdoing a civil wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>I took an example from Deputy Woods's amendment and said it was quite acceptable.  In his subsection (10) (b) the Deputy proposes that the time of a person's arrest and arrival at a Garda station should be recorded.  He also proposes that the offence or offences in respect of which he was being arrested should be recorded.  That is quite acceptable and should be in regulations.  However, if a garda does not put down the time of arrival of a person at the station it should not make a criminal out of the garda.  He would have broken the regulations and should be disciplined for doing so but he should not be liable to a criminal or civil charge.  More seriously, if evidence is got during the period of questioning and the question of the inadmissibility of that evidence arises in court, and if there is a clear-cut case against the defendant who is in the dock for murder, the fact that the garda did not fill out a form and put down the time of arrival at the station should not be grounds in itself for releasing that person and letting him go free on a technicality.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am trying to explain the effect of that part of my amendment which has been challenged.  People have stated here, and outside, that the safeguards I am providing are no good because of section 6 (c).  That is necessary and has to be in any form of regulation or otherwise we will make a cod of the system.  It is up to a court to decide if evidence is admissible or not. The courts have done this quite frequently.  If the defence presents to the court that such and such a regulation was not complied with the court can decide whether the evidence is admissible.  In the case of putting down the time on a form, for example, if nothing hinged on it they would consider the evidence to be admissible.  On the other hand, if anything amounted to oppressive treatment of any sort, if the court decided that the breach of regulation was such that it constituted oppressive treatment of the detainee, the evidence would not be admissible.  The part I am talking about would not of itself render the garda liable to criminal or civil proceedings and would not of itself constitute oppressive behaviour and consequently make the evidence inadmissible, but it does not provide immunity.  If a garda assaults somebody who is in detention there is a law there already to deal with that and of course he would be liable to criminal and/or civil proceedings as a result of that; but the breach of the regulation would not of itself criminalise what is not a crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle talked about the notes being provided for a person.  That is a fair point and Deputy Woods referred to it also.  As I understand the law as it stands, a person in Garda custody is entitled to make notes, so the issue would be whether it would be required by regulation of the garda to inform such people of that right, and I will consider that in the regulations.  Deputy Woods said that there was no experience to draw on. There is experience to draw on in this country because we have the Offences Against the State Act under which people have been detained for quite a long time, 24 hours plus 24 hours.  I take the point <Col N="1205" /> that the regulations must provide for records to be kept.</P>
    <P>This House has already passed an amendment which says that these sections of the Bill will be subject to review after five years or four years &mdash; we will decide on Report Stage &mdash; when the Bill must be reviewed.  When regulations say that records must be kept then you have the basis for valid judgments when the House comes back on the next occasion to review the situation and see what needs to be changed or dropped or amended or added.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods quoted from a report which indicated that it is sufficient for many people to be kept about an hour in custody, and I agree with that.  We hope that the period of detention will be very short.  We are setting down in this Bill the maxima of 12 hours, six plus six.  I understand that that report was of a survey in Britain and that the British at the moment in their House of Commons are looking for detention periods to detain people for up to 96 hours, 48 plus 48 for ordinary crime, not subversive crime. While research in England indicates that the vast majority of people detained there are detained for one hour, one and a half hours, two hours, the authorities and Government there find that it is necessary to go back to Parliament and seek detention powers whereby they can detain people in certain circumstances for up to 96 hours.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Section 26 of the Bill deals with electronic recording. I have an amendment down for that and there will be quite a long discussion on it.  It was recommended in the Ó Briain report.  There was an acceptance by Deputy Collins in the statement to which I have referred already that feasibility studies would be conducted.  No <Col N="1207" /> feasibility studies of any sort were conducted and when I had this Bill drafted and before it was published I set up a small committee with an official of my Department, a member of the Garda Síochána and a person with qualifications in electronics who is on the staff of UCD. They have been in Scotland and England and they are looking at video as well as audio recording.  It is advisable to await their final report before finalising the system. Field trials will have to be carried out.  This is a tricky area.  We will have an opportunity to discuss it under the section of the Bill that deals with it.</P>
      <P>Deputy David Andrews asked about the status of the regulations and he referred to subsection (3) of the amendment I am proposing.  I repeat what I said this morning, that law implemented by ministerial regulation is not inferior law to law implemented by statute.  It is not first class law or second class law.  It has the same force of law and it will be as binding by regulation as it would be by statute in the House.  It is a question of what is appropriate.  Precedent and practice are that you do not go into a great amount of detail in primary legislation. Power is given to Ministers to deal with detail in this way.  I went beyond that this morning and said under another section of the Bill that regulations will have to be brought before the House and after 21 days will become law unless a negative motion is put down.  I have gone beyond that and said, subject to procedural difficulty, I am prepared to put down a positive motion to enable Deputies to discuss the regulations.  The powers under subsection (3) will not be implemented until the regulations are implemented because the regulations safeguarding the rights of detainees are essential to the section.  The regulations safeguarding the rights of detainees are so essential and Deputies on all sides are so concerned about them that it would be wrong of me to use the powers under the Act to implement the detention section while leaving the regulations until some indefinite date.  There is no question of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Monica Barnes spoke about <Col N="1208" /> the facilities available at Garda stations. There has been a major building programme in progress for the past couple of years.  Three new Garda stations are being constructed at present in Cork, for example, and many other new Garda stations are being built throughout the country. I said earlier in the debate that it would not be a question of using every Garda station in every village.  We are talking about using three or four larger stations in each division.  These are large, well constructed modern buildings with the necessary facilities.  Of course this matter must be kept under constant review because buildings can become run down.  I accept the spirit of what Deputy Barnes has said.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mervyn Taylor spoke about having a Schedule to the Bill.  Perhaps he meant something half way between my position and that of Deputy Woods.  I do not know of any precedent whereby regulations can be a Schedule to a Bill.  I am not sure it would work.  I cannot see any difficulty in the procedure I am outlining. The Bill as originally drafted did not have provisions for these regulations.  It was not that the regulations were considered unnecessary but simply that regulations already exist for internal use by the Garda Síochána.  On the advice of the House, it was felt that it would be better if these were public and had a statutory base.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor also made a point about the duration of questioning.  I did not quite follow him.  It was in reference to the four hours and Deputy Mitchell subsequently made a point arising from it. The Ó Briain report recommended that the longest continuous period of questioning in a detention period should be four hours.  He was talking about the 48-hour situation because he was dealing with subversive crime.  This recommendation was implemented in the Garda regulations.  Regulation 45 (2) (7) states that a person should not be questioned for a continuous period in excess of four hours, without a reasonable break.  Such breaks should be at least one hour where circumstances permit.  Perhaps the point being made by Deputy Taylor was that the duration of the period of questioning <Col N="1209" /> should be by the consent of the detainee or that the very fact of the detention should be by the consent of the detainee in the first instance.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The whole basis of section 3 is to overcome the difficulty where people will not co-operate with the Garda, refuse to answer any kind of questions and refuse to go to the Garda station when invited to do so. The power is being explicitly given to arrest people, take them to the station and question them over a period.  If they refuse to answer any question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is clear.  Deputy Mitchell talked about a person getting off on a technicality.  The question of the technicality would arise under the regulations in the same way as under the Bill since the regulations have the force of statute.  We should not tie the court in either a statutory regulation or in the Bill into a situation where they are forced against their better judgment because of a technicality to decide that a person has been treated oppressively, that evidence is not admissible and consequently a person walks free where it is quite clear that he is guilty of a serious offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Oliver Flanagan for his contribution and support for the Bill.  The safeguards I intend to bring in by regulation will go a long way to meet the <Col N="1210" /> difficulties which he has outlined, going from particular instances of people in his own constituency to the general area concerning people who are illiterate and so on.</P>
    <P>A Deputy made a point about handing a copy of the regulations to a person being detained.  It is envisaged that the regulations should provide for a form of notice to be given to the person setting out his rights.  Perhaps they could be displayed on the wall.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not think handing a person a copy of the existing Garda regulations would be of help but I do not see any difficulty in meeting the point raised in the way I have indicated.</P>
      <P>I am asking Deputy Woods and his party not to press their amendment for the reasons I have outlined, with which they may or may not agree.  The safeguards being proposed by Deputy Woods apply only to people being detained under this Bill and do not apply to people being detained under the Offences Against the State Act or people in custody after being charged waiting to be taken to court.  That is not far enough.  I would have to reject the dual approach. I do not think it is appropriate to legislate by going a bit of the road here and holding back positions on what we might do further down the line.  The regulations should be the main <i>corpus</i> of the safeguards and should only be changed by a Minister if they are seen not to be working in practice, preventing the course of justice from proceeding and interfering with the common good or alternatively if they are not real safeguards.  The flexibility given to a Minister on regulations is better.  I am asking the House to accept my amendment and I am opposed to the amendment put forward by Deputy Woods.</P>

      <P>I will accept the Minister's amendment but I believe the dual approach is the right one.  The Minister has specifically stated that statutory regulations are better.  As far as the House is <Col N="1211" /> concerned, statutory regulations are not better.  Most people here have considerable concern about section 3.  It does not matter what they are doing in Britain or Belgium or anywhere else.  We want to see appropriate safeguards in the section.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly pointed out that my amendment referred specifically to the section.  This is the section which brings in the new powers of arrest on suspicion, something which is quite foreign to us.  We are naturally concerned about it.  The safeguards we are proposing are related to the section.  Of course we will welcome the introduction by the Minister of statutory regulations enshrining the internal code of practice, which is not now available to the public.</P>

      <P>The fact is that the present Garda regulations are not available to us and that is a fact.  The Minister can check it with his officials.  One cannot get those regulations and we in this House do not want that uisce faoi thalamh situation. The Minister is saying that some regulations had been brought in since the Ó Briain Report.  These may or may not be complied with, we do not know.  I accept the Minister's statement that, by and large, they are being applied.  We are bringing in special powers, specific regulations which will relate directly to section 3 and in my amendments I have tried to get the necessary safeguards accepted.  I accept that the Minister means to bring in plans, but quite honestly and sincerely these safeguards should be present in this Bill, irrespective <Col N="1212" /> of what happens subsequently or in what way the Minister broadens them to cover the Offences Against the State Act or other legislation.</P>
      <P>We are now about to pass a section which basically is repugnant to most of us.  We are prepared to accept the section because basically we believe that the majority of the Garda force are men of integrity who have served us well and will continue to do so.  However, as Members on the other side of the House have pointed out, there are Garda officers who will abuse the situation.  Any superintendent or chief superintendent will tell you that at the moment in his own area he has problems with specific people and will have to be vigilant about them.  It is to be hoped that he will be.  The fact that the Minister has not the regulations available at the moment is a separate question. They should have been ready with the Bill and be included in the Bill in so far as they are relevant &mdash; particularly to this section.</P>
      <P>In many of the areas &mdash; for example, the Complaints Commission &mdash; the Minister has suggested that we pass the Bill and he can be relied upon to bring in the regulations afterwards.  I accept his sincerity in that, but that is not the way it should be.  The homework should be done before he comes into the House. The regulations regarding the Complaints Commission should be examined at the same time as the major steps which are being taken today.  With regard to the regulations, the Minister's party will support him in the House.  His Whip will bring in both the Labour Party and Fine Gael to support him in defeating my amendments, so I must rely on the Minister to bring in the regulations in the way in which he has promised &mdash; that they will be comprehensive and will meet the obvious requirements.  I am quite prepared to withdraw subsection (14) of the amendment which says:</P>
      <P>Where a person detained pursuant to this section is questioned for the purpose of the investigation the entire of the questioning shall be recorded by electronic or other means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>on the grounds that the Minister is carrying <Col N="1213" /> out feasibility studies and will deal with that matter in due course.  However, the other measures should be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that there will be other provisions in relation to the section on strip searching and so forth which might require appropriate safeguards.  If the Minister is providing these safeguards, we shall be quite happy with that.</P>

      <P>I am expressing the views of many Deputies when I say that it is not so much that they should be an integral part of the Bill, and I suggested earlier a schedule to the Bill.  What motivated other Deputies and myself was that we should know at this point what those regulations should be.  I do not mind their being dealt with by way of statutory regulations, on reflection, but we would prefer to know the content of the regulations. The procedure according to section 29 of the Bill for laying down regulations before the House and the negative resolution and so forth are not really satisfactory so far as the Members of the House are concerned.  Perhaps in theory it is, but the practicality is that the voluminous measure of regulations put forward, the procedure for dealing with them being to leave them in the Library, results in the overwhelming bulk of the Deputies not knowing what regulations are brought forward and even if they did&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  But the procedure is that even if a Member is aware of the regulations, the likelihood of his being in a position to avail of the normal procedure laid down in section 29 of the Bill is remote, at best.  I certainly cannot recall any occasion where a resolution annulling a proposed resolution was ever brought before this House.  When one considers the massive volume of regulations brought into law, one realises why Ministers prefer this form of regulation to legislation which is obviously seen and debated on the floor of this House.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to express my appreciation to the Minister for having indicated that he would envisage a framed, extracted, simplified form of the regulations which would be shown to a detainee.  That would be very welcome. I would suggest that perhaps Item 1 on that information data be an indication to that person that he is not obliged to answer questions, or to respond to questions, which is the position as the Minister has clarified it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to the key question which was highlighted in the Minister's last response &mdash; the question of the answerability or amenability of a Garda officer for failing to comply with the statutory regulation made under the Minister's amending section.  I can well appreciate that where a garda has, as it were, his own internal rules of conduct which, as the Minister indicated, is the present position, in the event of a breach of one of those Garda internal rules of conduct it would be acceptable enough that the method of dealing with such a breach would be a Garda inquiry &mdash; an internal disciplinary matter within the Garda force.  That would be fair, reasonable and acceptable for that kind of regulation, but what is proposed here is a move into a different arena altogether.  We are talking here about bringing in statutory regulations and as the Minister himself rightly pointed out they are as binding as a statute of the Oireachtas.  What will be the position if we are going to have a measure of law as binding as a statute of <Col N="1215" /> the Oireachtas and all it amounts to in effect is no more than a guideline to the members of the Garda Síochána, for the breach of which there is no sanction?  It consigns those statutory regulations with the full force of law to being no better and on a par with an internal Garda directive or arrangement.  Are we to have the situation where the members of the Garda Síochána are to be in that privileged position that they will have the luxury of regarding instruments of law as no more than a guideline for them as distinct from everybody else who, when they breach a statutory regulation of this House, find themselves in a criminal position?  It might not be a criminal position ending in imprisonment.  It could be a matter of a fine.  There is a statutory regulation for shopkeepers regarding display of prices.  There is a statutory regulation regarding filling up forms to tax one's car and to insure one's car.  There are a million regulations that members of the public have to comply with.  It is only a matter of filling up a form but if a member of the public does not do that he is liable to be charged on summons and brought into the District Court and may be fined £5, £100 or some other sum on a repeated offence and so on.  That is the position so far as a member of the public is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that if the garda does not fill in the form you would not want to make that a criminal situation.  Why should his position be any different from that which applies to any other member of the public who fails to fill in a form and fails to carry out the terms of a lawful statutory instrument?  The same law which applies to a member of the public should apply to a garda when he breaches a statutory instrument of law which, as the Minister quite rightly said, is as binding as a statute.  If those regulations are laid down as a statutory instrument of this House and if they are breached, there is criminality &mdash; it may be slight depending on what it was &mdash; on the part of the member of the Garda force.  In my view it would be a dangerous precedent to introduce a situation where instruments <Col N="1216" /> of law, as passed by this House, could be relegated to have as their sole sanction an internal Garda disciplinary procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been talking about this amendment for some time and the Minister continues to show reluctance to accept it or to see the sense in it.  His response to our proposals is to make the regulations.  Those regulations state specifically that a breach of them may make evidence inadmissible but of itself it will not render evidence inadmissible.  The Minister has explained his approach.  I listened carefully to it and I cannot make much sense out of it.  I fully agree with the Minister that he needs to be concerned that a breach of a very minor regulation, such as failure to fill in a form, will not render evidence inadmissible which will allow a person to escape conviction for a very serious offence when there is a clear case.  His solution is to leave it up to the courts to decide in each individual case.  The courts may decide that a breach of a very minor regulation will not be sufficient to prevent a person from being convicted when otherwise there is a clear-cut case in a serious offence. Breach of a much more fundamental regulation, such as regulations leading to questioning, will presumably render the evidence inadmissible depending on what the court decides.  While breach of one minor regulation might not render the evidence inadmissible in a case like this, breach of a number of minor regulations may render the evidence inadmissible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the Minister not direct his Department officials, if that is his reason for leaving the matter to the courts, to decide what regulations can be broken without making evidence inadmissible and what regulations cannot?  Surely it is the Minister's function to decide that instead of leaving the matter to the courts?  The fact that the fundamental decision of this sort will be left to the courts to decide in each individual case is typical of the indecisive approach of the Government to the many problems that have confronted them for the past 18 months: leave it to somebody else, set up a committee and in this case, put it over <Col N="1217" /> on the courts.  I am sure the Minister, being an intelligent man, understands the sense of our amendment and the spirit in which it is put forward.  I cannot see why he cannot accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few things about Deputy Taylor's contribution and then something about what Deputy Woods previously said.  I do not believe Deputy Taylor would be correct if he was implying or suggesting to the House that all breaches of a rule laid down in a statutory instrument or of a direction given in a statutory instrument such as a set of regulations brought a criminal sanction with them.  That is not so.  There are a massive number of things which statutory regulations require to be done and which they rely on the administration to do.  If they are not done they may or may not invalidate the end result of what the administration are trying to achieve but they do not necessarily, except in a very small minority of cases, carry a criminal responsibility with them. I would not fault the Minister's subsection for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not read that subsection as conferring on a member of the Garda Síochána who neglects some provision of the Minister's regulation a criminal or civil immunity in respect of his entire behaviour during the interrogation.  That could not be so and if I thought it was I would be very much against it.  If a garda, who carries out or participates in an interrogation, assaults the person who is being interrogated, which is a civil wrong and a crime, I presume he would be just as much liable under these regulations as he was before.  It is merely a breach of some of the Minister's regulations, if there is nothing else in the picture like a failure to enter up something in a book or a failure to observe some time limit or some formality, which does not go to the root of the prisoner's rights, so to speak. That is something which I could swallow. I do not really see that every small quite accidental neglect or even a deliberate neglect of some rule ought necessarily to bring a civil or criminal responsibility with it.  If a garda breaks the Minister's regulations and also commits a crime or <Col N="1218" /> a civil wrong the regulations do not purport to give him immunity and could not do so, in my view.</P>
    <P>If I have not misunderstood Deputy Taylor and another Deputy, I think they have exaggerated the import of subsection (3).  I hope the Minister is trying to follow the kind of line the courts have laid down recently which tends towards the statement that not all breaches of strict legality will infect the custody itself with illegality.  Not all breaches of rules are so far-reaching or so fundamental as to vitiate the fact of the custody itself and render it illegal and render everything that flows from it illegal, such as confessions obtained during its course.  I presume that is all the Minister is trying to express, and if I am right in that I do not think he is doing anything that changes the law from what it is today.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in saying to the House that regulations are as much the law of the land as statute itself.  I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that many areas of law &mdash; not perhaps criminal law but areas that are in a general sense ones of police and administrative control &mdash; are contained in regulations. For instance, there are the prison regulations: an important case was conducted recently, <i>The State (Richardson) v. Governor of Mountjoy</i>, where the applicant for <i>habeas corpus</i> was a lady who complained of the revolting sanitary conditions that existed then in Mountjoy and which I hope have since been remedied. The case proceeded largely on the basis of breaches or neglect of the prison regulations which she was able to prove. That was a case where the rules were not contained in statute but in subordinate legislation but the person concerned was just as entitled to rely on that subordinate legislation and travelled just as far on it as if it had been an Act.  The same situation applies to aliens.  The entire nuts and bolts of control of aliens depend on the aliens regulations.  They are authorised by the Aliens Act but the small print of the rules are contained not in the Act but in the regulations.  As everyone knows, the bread and butter of planning law is contained in planning regulations which are made under virtue of the parent Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> What interests me is not so much the idea that the Minister is going to make regulations rather than append a Schedule to the Act but rather his suggestion that the regulation should be made by positive resolution of the House rather than being subject merely to annulment by negative resolution.  That is a handsome offer by the Minister and I am happy to settle for that, though I do not know if the Opposition will settle for it. I presume it means the regulations will not come into force until they are made by this House.  If I misunderstood that or if the Minister has some other plan in mind, I am sure he will correct me.  If I am right it means there need not be any apprehension about the regulations until they are brought forward for discussion here as in the case of every other provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The power to make regulations which the Bill contains presumably contains power to make amending regulations. When in Opposition I remember making points similar to those made by Deputy Woods and Deputy O'Dea, namely, that while we knew Deputy O'Malley, or whoever was Minister for Justice, did not intend to behave like a tyrant or a savage, we could not be sure about all Ministers who might come after him.  I made the point then that we did not like putting a general power in the hands of the Minister that a successor might abuse.  The reason I mention that now is because the power to make regulations of this kind presumably carries with it the power to make altered regulations.  If the Minister intends to change this amendment on Report Stage in such a way as to achieve the regulations by positive resolution, I should like him, if possible, to put in that any altered or amended regulations should also be subject to the positive resolution of the House, and not merely to a negative resolution which does not affect retrospectively anything done under cover of the regulations in the interval between making them and their hypothetical annulment.  That leaves a wide gap for abuse; but by adopting the positive resolution the Minister will avoid that.  However, I should like to be assured <Col N="1220" /> that that positive resolution will also be applicable to any altered or amended regulations hereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite right to say that there is not any first-class or second-class law.  That is not the argument that has been made.  The argument that has been made is with regard to the desirability of having the regulations made by ministerial order or by statute. There is no question of first-class or second-class law.  Both have the power of statute.  The question is whether the House should seek the right in this instance to ensure that the regulations are passed.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to legislation in the United Kingdom with regard to the 96 hours.  To put the record straight, the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill in clause 39 empowers a magistrate's court to issue a warrant authorising the detention of a person for up to 96 hours without charge from the time the detention began if this is necessary for the investigation of a serious, arrestable offence.</P>

      <P>I was not very satisfied with the Minister's reply to a question I raised on amendment No. 24.  If there is a serious breach of the regulations it is up to the court to decide if the evidence is admissible.  The Minister has indicated that strip-searching will be included in the regulations.  If a person is strip-searched in detention in the first six hours and if he is not brought to court but is let off, what effect will that have on the garda who broke the regulation?  Will there be a criminal sanction against him? If the Garda authorities deal with the problem, will there be any scheduled list of penalties that will be enforced by them?  The public want an answer to that question.  If a garda acts outside the law and breaches the regulations he must be punished severely.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I want to apologise to Deputy Doyle because I omitted to answer his question.  There is a scale of punishments.  Deputy Kelly dealt with the question of regulations and the situation is as he stated.  There are <Col N="1221" /> ministerial regulations that do not involve civil or criminal responsibility. The subsection being discussed now does not confer any immunity on a member of the Garda Síochána.  For example, if a garda assaults someone he would be liable for both criminal and civil proceedings with no immunity.  Deputy Taylor raised the situation of a shopkeeper who is obliged under penalty of a fine in the District Court to comply with certain regulations regarding pricing and he asked why should the Garda be different. They are different for this reason: they are one of the three disciplined forces in this country and they have internal regulations regarding their discipline which are quite severe.  A garda who is in breach of a regulation could be disciplined in anything from a caution to a reprimand, to a reduction in rank, a reduction in pay or dismissal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes, of course.  Let me take the specific example which Deputy J. Doyle has raised.  If a male member of the Garda Síochána, in breach of existing regulations or in breach of the proposed statutory regulations that I will be bringing in, strip-searches a woman who is in detention, then he would be liable not only for dismissal from within the Garda Síochána but he would be liable for civil proceedings on the grounds of a gross invasion of privacy and a lot of other consequential things.  I think also he would leave himself open to a criminal charge of indecent <Col N="1222" /> assault, if not actual assault.  Therefore, there would be no immunity given in that case and the full rigour of the criminal and civil law and the disciplinary proceedings of the Garda Síochána would apply.  In my opinion that would be a clear-cut example of where somebody would be dismissed from the force.</P>

      <P>While I respect the views of the Minister and Deputy Kelly, I disagree with them.  If the Minister must have his darned regulations then he might clarify the position in paragraph 6 (3) of his amendment No. 24 which appears to be somewhat ambiguous.  The Minister and I, and probably other lawyer Deputies and others who are conversant with the law, know there is no immunity for gardaí &mdash; in the very unlikely event of an individual being assaulted in custody, false imprisonment and so on.  We know that the Garda themselves can be open to these types of sanctions.  I accept what the Minister says in that regard but the section itself is most unclear.  Perhaps it would be helpful to the Minister's case that that be clarified by way of an additional amendment, perhaps something to the effect that this provides no immunity from ordinary sanction or whatever &mdash; I do not know how the parliamentary draftsman would do it.</P>
      <P>I do not think the regulations should be independent of the Bill.  While I agree that the regulations themselves have the same force as statutory instruments and they are not conferred with second-class legal citizenship, nevertheless I believe we should see the whites of their eyes and the only way that can be done is by having them enshrined in the Bill itself.  If we must have the regulations then let us have them by way of an additional Schedule to the Bill.  I accept that the Minister has said there is no precedent for that, but is it not time we created a precedent?  Let us be a little bit daring.  I would not wish to diminish the purpose of the provisions of the Bill but I must again express my personal reservations about the propriety of the Bill and section 3 in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might revert to Deputy Woods's amendment which I believe is reasonable. It may be somewhat bureaucratic <Col N="1223" /> but then the Bill itself is riddled with the need to issue documents for this, that and the other thing and I have no doubt but that confusion upon confusion will reign. I have no doubt but that the lawyers will have a field day in that regard and that once more the taxpayer will be called on to pay for the legal aid demanded nowadays by the citizen.  That is why I believe it is not unreasonable to suggest that Deputy Woods's amendment be incorporated in the Bill with the exception of subsection (14) of that amendment which he endeavoured to have withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I have serious doubts about the recording of matters by electronic equipment or other means which could be fairly intimidating on the ordinary citizen.  However, hopefully the ordinary citizen will not become too involved in the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  Hopefully the provisions will deal rather with the criminal element in our society.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposals in Deputy Woods's amendment are reasonable, are up front and should become part of the <i>corpus</i> of the Bill.  Indeed there is a huge query mark over the generality of the Bill.  I would hope Deputy Woods would push his amendment to a division, because it is most important that the democratic process be seen to be working publicly.  I will be requesting him as spokesman for our party to push his proposals to a division.</P>

      <P>I have not spoken in this debate since this morning, so I hope Deputy Gay Mitchell will not mind.</P>
      <P>I might refer to the Minister's earlier attack on a so-called claim existing inside and outside the House that we should ape other Common Law countries and look at what is going on in Britain and other European countries.  Over the past few months I have read practically every article, as I am sure has the Minister and other Members, in newspapers, magazines or whatever, any information which was available, in relation to this unfortunate Bill.  Nowhere did I see or witness that claim that he contended existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Woods's amendment, it must be honestly said that he has <Col N="1224" /> tried to provide safeguards here.  Perhaps they are not as wide-ranging or do not go sufficiently far in the Minister's view, but at least they are an attempt to provide safeguards, which is one of the big worries people have about this Bill.  The Minister can duck, weave and dodge all he likes but the fact of the matter is that he has nothing on the table &mdash; there is no alternative on the table.  There are merely promised regulations.  This point has been reiterated many times, with the Minister reverting to the regulations that will come.  The suggestion has been made very clearly that the regulations should be here now, that at least we should know what they are.  In response to Deputy De Rossa's queries earlier as to what regulations there were in force, the Minister said that some of the Ó Briain regulations were in force, but in enumerating them he got only to one and a half.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to what former Minister G. Collins actually did when the Ó Briain report came out in 1978.  There was a further report written, as a result of that one, in which it was stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the same problem the Minister had, in that it came out in April 1978.  This was a booklet on Crime and Punishment written at that time, edited by Seán MacBride, Part II, under the heading &ldquo;Police Custody and Interrogation&rdquo; by Kevin J. White, Chairman, Irish Amnesty International, where it was said:</P>
      <P>Amnesty welcomed the report and found its recommendations to be &lsquo;constructive proposals for effective safeguards&rsquo;. Minister for Justice Collins appeared equally warm towards them. The Government, he announced, had decided to accept the proposals.  But he added a vital sub-clause: the acceptance was subject to a number of <i>&lsquo;reservations and exceptions&rsquo;.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And he went on to list at considerable length a litany of reservations and exceptions.  Recommendations were <Col N="1225" /> rejected as &lsquo;unacceptable&rsquo;, &lsquo;impracticable&rsquo;, &lsquo;requiring further examination&rsquo; and needing &lsquo;careful consideration&rsquo;. After all the reservations were added up, the report had been emasculated. All the significant and potentially effective proposals were smothered in verbal obfuscation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods and others have referred to regulations, but we do not know what those regulations are.  We are told there are regulations already in existence. Yet there is nothing for us to go by.  We are about to radically overhaul the criminal law.  We are about to implement proposals that will affect the whole community. We have no safeguards in the Bill and we have no proposal on the table and everything would suggest they should be at the moment in the Attorney General&rsquo;s Department and with them near to surfacing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the point I was going to make would not be relevant.  I thought they were that near and surfacing and we could perhaps wait for them but it is asking a lot of this House to accept this section and the Minister&rsquo;s amendment No. 24 on which I have not heard any legal person who commented approving of the Bill.  This may be asking too much of this House.  Deputy Woods has tried.  I thought his amendment was very constructive.  He came up with suitable safeguards.  Deputy Andrews and Deputy O&rsquo;Dea expressed dissatisfaction with section 6 of the Minister&rsquo;s amendment. I think it is a bit unfair.  Deputy Andrews mentioned the point that he would like safeguards incorporated in the body of the Bill for the same reason I and many other people would like them to be incorporated, people inside and outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entrusted with the job of ensuring the protection and safety of innocent members of the community and, while I <Col N="1226" /> am not suggesting we are being hood-winked or anything like that, I think it is fair to say, as others have said, that this is just not yet ready and we are not in a position to comply with the request to pass this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some of the suggestions Deputy Woods made in amendment No. 16 are very welcome and if they can be added to or expanded in any way, if they do not go far enough, we should consider that for the Report Stage and when the Minister comes back we could have those incorporated.  I definitely find it very difficult to understand the constant resistance to bringing forward these regulations, bringing all in at the same time as the Bill, when there is such consternation within certain groups in the community and on the part of responsible people both inside and outside this House.  We are all concerned about this legislation and it is just not satisfactorily explainable.</P>
    <P>Clauses (1) to (4) of this amendment are very worrying.  Perhaps my understanding of them is just not deep enough and I have to go on other people&rsquo;s opinions and on what I read and comment made.  Section 6 consists of the most incredible statement that the failure of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall not of itself render that person liable to any criminal proceedings.  That does not bother me, the criminal proceedings, because I do not think there is very much likelihood of a person, who is in custody and has undergone interrogation, who is on his own and unable to communicate with anyone, being able to prove anything anyhow, certainly to the extent of being able to take things as a threat in a criminal or civil proceedings against someone who would abuse that provision.</P>
    <P>What concerns me very much is the inadmissibility in evidence of any statement made.  It will not be effective and I just do not accept the reasons given by the Minister.  There are other disciplines. There is an enormous body of people who have to observe regulations, fill in forms and abide by certain rules and, if they do not do so, they are sometimes penalised.  That is happening every day <Col N="1227" /> and, if there is a serious case being brought or a serious charge being made against someone, I do not see why we could not have someone responsible to fill in a form properly and do whatever is necessary.  If there are problems in that area I suggest they could be corrected. There are in excess of 200,000 people on the dole at the moment and many of them are well qualified to do simple jobs like that.  It just does not wash.  Given the incidence of crime, the number of gardaí, it will not wash that the simple procedures outlined here cannot be safeguarded. The person likely to suffer will be the youthful person rather than the hardened criminal.</P>
    <P>Under amendment No. 16, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), the Minister informed us these are already in effect and he referred to the case of Christy <i>versus</i> Ó Loinsigh. That is good and the only two things that I would have anything to say about is times &mdash;&ldquo;without delay&rdquo;&mdash; and also in section 10 (c) the statement in writing of offences &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;.  I do not think the safeguards are tight enough because they can be so easily abused. &ldquo;As soon as possible&rdquo; could be hours. &ldquo;Without delay&rdquo; might be a bit more restricted than that.  It is not the same as immediately and I do not see why a certain time limit could not be imposed, half an hour or an hour, because we are talking about the Garda and when one has had the experience of having to go, for example, to a hospital, there is inevitable delay.  We are not very efficient people and I just want to ensure people will bend over backwards to see that someone is not put out when he or she is detained and so I would like, therefore, the safeguards to be more explicit.</P>
    <P>Also in section 10 (3) the Minister said that there was a guardian mentioned. There is a difference here between the Minister and Deputy Woods in that the guardian in the agreed report is a member of the force who is not connected with the investigation.  That same criterion should apply in that amendment.  The Minister said that subsection 10 (d) was acceptable and could be tightened up. There is only one problem running <Col N="1228" /> through this for the person in custody. He cannot verify that a member in charge will enter details in the records and that proper procedures will be followed because he or she will be isolated in an oppressive atmosphere and cannot tell whether instructions are carried out at a certain time.  He may not have a watch if he has been stripped and searched and could lose track of time.  It all points to the necessity for having another person present during questioning, either a solicitor or an independent witness.  The Ó Briain report mentioned a roster of solicitors who would be available for that purpose and perhaps that scheme could be adopted.  Deputy Woods&rsquo;s admirable attempt to come up with safeguards is all that another worried member, Deputy Andrews, and I have to go on.  Deputy Andrews said he would like to have it incorporated in the body of the Bill. Unless and until the vague regulations which the Minister is talking about are incorporated in the Bill we will not be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I should also like to repeat and emphasise the point which Deputy De Rossa made that if this Bill becomes law and we are promised that the regulations will also be introduced, there will be pressure and lobbying from the Garda to water down &mdash; Deputy De Rossa did not use that phrase &mdash; those regulations.  I have no doubt that will happen and that there will be strong pressure on the Government to do this.  I also venture to suggest that the reason this Bill is in its present form and that most of those extra powers are included is because of the successful pressure over the last couple of years by the Garda Síochána in lobbying on this matter. We are not being told the reason for keeping the regulations separate from the Bill.  Public opinion has only recently awakened to the dangers of the Bill but it is now very concerned.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 16 subsection (11) four hours&rsquo; maximum questioning was mentioned and we referred to the Ó Briain report.  The Minister said that while four hours might be oppressive treatment for one person, that might not be necessarily so in the case of another person.  I accept that, because a hardened <Col N="1229" /> criminal could withstand four hours&rsquo; questioning.  However, in order to break down the criminal the innocent person has to suffer.  We are saying that in order to break down a criminal, we must have a minimum of four hours' questioning. Statistics show that 90 per cent of the people arrested under the Offences Against the State Act were not charged. Therefore, innocent people will suffer because of the criminal.  The balance of the Bill is in favour of the criminal.</P>
    <P>The question of the detainee getting a copy of the documents does not seem to be thought out well enough but it is indicative of the way we should be going because it makes a very good shot at getting many safeguards in, and God knows, the Bill needs safeguards.  I did not enjoy the jokes about waking up people when they are asleep every hour because those of us who have visited these places know that it is impossible to sleep.  I am reminded of the graffiti on the walls in these places which says &mdash;&ldquo;it is no use standing on the seat, the crabs in here can jump ten feet&rdquo;.  There are cockroaches, bugs and noise in a police station.  There is also terror, fear and tiredness.  To make a joke about rousing someone from sleep shows how far removed we are from reality and how little we understand and know what many deprived people have to go through.</P>
    <P>Subsection (13) (a) says that a detainee is entitled to make and retain notes in writing.  I hope he will be allowed to keep such notes but I do not know what safeguards he will have against such notes being used against him.</P>
    <P>Dr. Woods' amendment has helped the Bill in that he has suggestions for safeguards but, as we were asked to discuss section 24 at the same time, I cannot be as reassured about amendment No. 24 because this amendment has caused consternation to the opponents of some sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section 6 says that the introduction of regulations providing for the treatment of those in custody are at the same time providing that any breach of those regulations will not affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> There is no mention of the judges rules.  I do not know why they are ignored.  Possibly it is because it is envisaged that the regulations will be brought in.  We are ignoring the judges' rules which are administrative directions and which are observed at the moment.  If they are breached it is at the discretion of the judge whether such a breach affects the lawfulness or otherwise of the detention. That puts us in another very serious situation.  These sections ignore the judges' rules.  What happens between the time the Bill becomes law and the time the regulations are made?  I know section 3 will not come into operation until the regulations are operative.  So we are back to square one.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that situation conflicts with the judges' rules.  I understand that if we put these safeguards in the Bill they are subject to interpretation and perhaps changes as a result of interpretations in the courts, and that a statutory instrument would be more flexible. I cannot get away from the conviction that, if there is to be a statutory instrument, the Minister should bring it before the House before we are asked to decide on this Bill.  All the uncertainties could be removed.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the regulations must provide real safeguards. That is fine, but we have not got real safeguards in the Bill.  We have no indication of what those safeguards will be and we have no way of assessing them. All we have on the table is amendment No. 16.  I would like to hear a comment on why the judges' rules are ignored, and on my point about the regulations and the point that if we have not got real safeguards we have nothing.  Perhaps these safeguards in the amendment do not go far enough, but they could be adjusted between now the Report Stage. These two amendments suggest to me that the Bill should be suspended until the regulations are brought forward.  If they are not ready the section should not come into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has given rise to great concern.  We seem to be going around in circles.  Two views are being expressed.  The first is the view I originally expressed to the effect that, on balance, the Minister's proposal that the safeguards to be provided by way of regulation was desirable, provided the regulations come before the House and be approved by the House before they become operative, and provided the detention sections of the Bill did not come into operation until the House had adopted and approved of an appropriate code of conduct to be provided in the regulations.</P>
      <P>Shortly after I spoke the Minister expressed the view that he was prepared to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to provide that the regulations would require a debate in the House and the formal approval of the House and any amendments to such regulations as may be tabled by the Minister or his successors would require a similar approval.  Deputy Andrews, Deputy Skelly, Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Woods and Deputy O'Dea expressed concern about the detention provisions of the Bill. I am concerned about them on the basis that, if we are to have detention provisions, the job of this House is to ensure that all relevant safeguards are there, and that the detention provisions do not become operative until the safeguards are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In adopting the approach he adopted this morning and which he reiterated this afternoon, the Minister has given us that assurance.  It is fair to acknowledge that to the Minister.  I also share the view that many of the worries expressed by Deputies would not have been expressed, and we would not have spent so long in debating these two amendments, if at least a draft of the proposed code of conduct had been made available.  It has not been made available.  It seems to me that what the Minister has agreed to in the House allays the worries which have been expressed.  I do not understand the point <Col N="1232" /> that, unless all these safeguards are included in a statutory provision, there is something not quite right about it.  The regulations will have the same force of law as a statute.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House much longer. We seem to be going over and over it again.  I accept the view that the amendment proposed by Deputy Woods clearly lists some of the aspects which should be dealt with in a code of conduct, but he left out a great deal that should be dealt with.  Whereas I fully accept the intention behind Deputy Woods' amendment, No. 16, in my view it is inadequate.  If that were to be the total content of the code of conduct and the safeguards, I would have even greater misgivings about the detention section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The practical and sensible way to deal with this is to provide a uniform code of conduct which clearly lays down what the safeguards are.  If the detention provisions cannot come into force until such time as we have that code of conduct, and if that code of conduct must be effectively legislated through the House by an approval formula such as I have suggested and the Minister has accepted, it seems that this House will still exercise all the controls necessary to ensure that the safeguards are there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Skelly expressed the view that the code of conduct might be watered down, or that it might not fully reflect the protection which in his view should be made available.  If that happens, we will have an opportunity to express that view in the House and to propose amendments to that code of conduct to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Detention will not yet have come into force and that is the point. If the Minister is willing to accept the view and expressly state to the House that the detention provision will not be brought into force without the code of conduct being enacted also that is the safeguard requirement being met fully on <Col N="1233" /> the basis of the worries being expressed by Members.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to illustrate some of the inadequacies and areas not dealt with in Deputy Wood's amendment that I believe should be dealt with in the code of conduct as I did this morning but I should like to make a point that was not referred to in amendment No. 16 which I believe will be included in the code of conduct.  In the context of all the records the Garda will have to keep, and in the context of those records being kept pursuant to Deputy Wood's amendment, or a code of conduct provided by way of regulation, at the end of the day I would hope the code of conduct will provide that the person being detained will have made available to them a copy of the record of what took place during their period of detention.  If they have a complaint to make or if regulations have not been properly followed they should have a copy of that record made available to them.  A requirement that a copy of the record be made available to the person detained will place a particular onus on the Garda to ensure that they comply with the code of conduct.  Deputy Woods did not deal with that in his amendment. There was criticism earlier of those who looked at what was happening in the United Kingdom or elsewhere but in the parliament in London they are making with similar legislation and are making provision for the making available of the record to the person detained.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that we have all said everything that can be said about this section.  I welcome the fact that the Minister by his agreement to accept proposals made earlier this morning has acknowledged the genuine worries of Members and my view has adequately met them. He has provided a mechanism whereby the House can specifically ensure that all the safeguards we wish to see operational in the context of persons detained will come into being before the detention provisions are brought into force.</P>

When the Minister brings in the regulations the power to detain will be on the Statute Book.  As far as I am concerned that is the key point in regard to these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I intended making.  I believe I was the first Member to raise my concern about this. I am not impugning the Minister's integrity one way or the other but the House is dealing with a very unusual piece of legislation.  It goes to the very basis of the whole philosophy of civil rights and the <Col N="1235" /> approach by the Government and the law enforcement agencies of the day in that regard.  I do not intend voting for the Minister's amendment.  I will vote for the Fianna Fáil amendment because I believe it is the correct one.  We are being asked to give the Minister some powers.  I accept Deputy Shatter's explanation that the Minister intends bringing forward the regulations on Report Stage.  I would be obliged if the Minister dealt with that matter again briefly.  If he has given the undertaking I do not want him to repeat it but if he has not he should support what has been stated by Deputy Shatter.</P>
      <P>The House is being asked to adjudicate on regulations although we do not know anything about them.  We have a rough outline in the amendment but the regulations may be comprehensive or short. We do not know what the regulations will contain or the safeguards that will be in then.  I am certain that if the Minister gives an undertaking that they will be reasonable and proper regulations and that the citizens protection will be paramount we can accept that.  It must be remembered that the Garda Síochána have rights in relation to the Bill also. Their rights should be protected.  Are we being asked to pass the Minister's amendment on the basis of the promise the Minister has given, that the amendments will be before the House on Report Stage?  It should be remembered that on Report Stage we can only make a contribution once to an amendment.  That is very restricting and is a problem we will have to confront on that Stage.  That is not right because there may be aspects of regulations that may be questioned by other Members following one's own contribution. A Member may wish to raise queries having listened to the contributions of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister the proposed regulations in contemplation or in rough draft? I accept that the Minister may not be able to answer those questions now and I do not wish to take him short.  Will the Minister tell the House if the regulations are in draft form in the desk of some civil servant in his Department?  If not, we are being asked to take too much upon ourselves <Col N="1236" /> here.  In the context of this legislation we should not be asked to take things on trust.  This is too serious a piece of legislation for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the amendment has been discussed for a long time but I should like to be allowed another short gallop on this theme.  It would be a pity if Deputies Andrews, Skelly and others who have spoken on this were to be divided about this.  If I understand the Minister correctly some of the apprehensions expressed are groundless.  For the purpose of argument let us assume that the Minister had not intended to introduce any regulations but merely to have the powers of section 3 with the existing law about custody and the treatment of people in custody as it stands.  In what way are persons in custody, or those who may be in custody, worse off under the Minister's regulations than they are now? Would they be worse off under the Minister's regulations?  If I understand the Minister correctly his regulations do not purport and could not purport to suspend or diminish any other persons constitu-tional or legal rights when they are in custody.  People have such rights when in custody, a whole rake of them.  There is no way that the Minister can set these at nought by regulation.  There is no way that the Dáil could do so by a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in custody have to be properly treated.  There is a raft of decisions, going back in particular over the last seven or eight years, adding up to a dimension of due course of law, particularly in the context of fair procedures, the personal rights of people and so on.  Those things have to be respected.  I do not understand these regulations to be purporting to abridge any of those rights.  On the contrary, I assume that what the Minister is trying to do is to give another dimension to these rights by tacking into them formalities such as entering things in books and so on.  The concern shown by the House is very much in order and correct. We must be concerned about this.  The direction it is taking is perhaps undeserved. I was not listening when the Minister introduced his amendment but perhaps he did not make his point clear.  I <Col N="1237" /> understand that his amendment in no way diminishes existing rights but on the contrary is an attempt to regularise or reinforce them.</P>
    <P>I would be very sorry to have a difference with Deputy Skelly on a point like this.  I admired his very practical allusion to the realities of life inside a police station and the assumption of Deputies that it was like life in the tourist class of the <i>SS Aquitania</i> where you would expect to be woken with a morning cup of tea before your interrogation was resumed. That point was well taken.  However, I say to Deputy Skelly and those who share his apprehension about the effect of these regulations, suppose for the sake of argument that the Minister's regulations were word for word identical with the very well drafted amendment No. 16 which Fianna Fáil put down.  Subsection (10) (e) of that amendment requires a member in charge of a Garda station to enter in the records of the station the details of the grounds for extending the period of detention. Suppose, because he himself has not had any sleep or is neglectful or possibly because he is insufficiently and perhaps deliberately or culpably inattentive to the prisoner's rights, he fails to do that.  I do not see that it should be a criminal offence. Certainly it should be a disciplinary matter if he disobeys a regulation, but I cannot see that it should be a matter for criminal or civil proceedings and neither does the Fianna Fáil amendment purport to make it such.</P>
    <P>All that the Minister's regulations purport to do, assuming for the sake of argument that those regulations were word for word the same as the Fianna Fáil amendment, is to say that that failure alone will not vitiate or make illegal <i>ab initio</i> the custody or render inadmissible an admission made in the course of it.  If something else is done over and above that, if the man is assaulted or his personal rights are infringed, if he is not allowed to get in touch with a solicitor and so forth, these are very serious breaches of his rights and they may very well vitiate his custody; but the breach of the black and white of the Fianna Fáil amendment, assuming that it is adopted by the Minister <i>in toto</i>, will not of itself <Col N="1238" /> amount to something which invalidates the custody.</P>
    <P>The same goes for Deputy Skelly's apprehensions about the Judges' Rules. I do not understand the Minister's regulations as having any effect on the Judges' Rules.  If I did I would share Deputy Skelly's anxiety.  I do not take the Minister's regulations to be intended to qualify or whittle down the effect of the Judges' Rules in the slightest degree.  I am sure that the Minister, an honest man, will not have me, who intends to vote for him, under a misapprehension about this. If I am and if the Minister intends that the Judges' Rules be affected by these regulations, I hope that he will say so honestly.  However, I do not think that that is his intention.</P>

      <P>There seems to be some confusion in the minds of Deputies opposite about the effect of our proposed amendment.  Deputy De Rossa and Deputy David Andrews made the valid point that we are now being asked to pass the section without knowing what the safeguards may be.  That point would be met at least partially if our amendment was accepted because at least the minmum of safeguards would be included in the section as passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has made the point that the changes proposed by us in our amendment do not constitute a full and adequate code of conduct for the Garda.  We never pretended that they would, and if our amendment is accepted we have no objection to the Minister going on to draft a full code of conduct for the Garda. The only difference is that if our amenment were accepted the proposals which we are putting forward to protect the person in custody would not be subject to the constraints in section 6(3) in the Minister's amendment No. 24.  We want to see to it that there are at least some regulations the breach of which will render the evidence inadmissible.  That will be the effect of our amendment.  We want to have this amendment accepted as part of section 6(3) and then that section will not be subject to the constraints which the Minister tells us will apply to the <Col N="1239" /> regulations which he intends to introduce.</P>

      <P>I am not going to delay the House.  We have put down amendment No. 16 to have the whole question of safeguards well discussed.  We have had a very good discussion.  I do not agree with what has been said here from time to time about repetition.  There was very <Col N="1240" /> little repetition and Deputies have made very constructive suggestions and proposals in relation to this area.  I have withdrawn subsection (14) in my amendment No. 16, and I propose that amendment No. 16 be accepted.</P>

      <P>When I moved the Adjournment last night, I had been <Col N="1243" /> speaking about the courses available to girls attending rural home economics colleges.  I was proving the point that the courses are just as relevant today as they were earlier.  The Minister for Agriculture said because the colleges had been in operation since the 1900s the courses were outdated.  I have proved quite clearly that the courses on dairying and on farm accounts are still very relevant and very important in farming.  There is also a course in poultry-keeping which includes incubation, rearing, management, costing of layers, broilers, turkeys, ducks and geese, including nutrition and diseases.  The aim of that course is to put the student in a position to set up and manage a poultry enterprise.</P>
      <P>There is also a course on horticulture available, which covers cultivation, sowing and management of vegetables and fruit and propagation of shrubs and house plants.  The aim of that course is to make these students capable of cultivating a plot suitable for family needs and of managing a nursery unit.  This brief which I have before me has been prepared by the people in the rural home economics colleges, those on the ground who know what they are talking about.  Having given the House the details of the two courses, I wish to quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i>, Wednesday, 16 May 1984, page 9 under the heading &ldquo;£200m imports of food.&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>The £750m annual import bill could be slashed by nearly one quarter if a strategy was drawn up to increase production of potatoes, processed vegetables, cereals, eggs... </P>
      <P>It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>...the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Austin Deasy, urged a greater specialisation in the areas where we have a competitive advantage. </P>
      <P>It further states:</P>
      <P>If grown and processed at home, potatoes and frozen chips could save us £22 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was substitution potential of nearly £19 million in processed vegetables, <Col N="1244" /> while the poultry sector could cut more than £11 million off our egg imports. </P>
    <P>The courses in the colleges in Ramsgrange, Ardagh, Claremorris, Portumna and Dunmanway are doing exactly what the Minister for Agriculture is suggesting should be done.  These colleges are in operation and the Minister has the expertise available there to teach these young people the management of poultry and horticultural production.  Is he so hypocritical as to suggest, on the one hand, that we need to do this and on the other, to close the colleges?  I wonder how much he knows about the whole business, or was this decision taken by the Departmental officials without informing him of the exact situation?  What has appeared in today's paper is a complete contradiction of what he proposed to do.  I cannot understand this and I am sure that our farmers cannot, either.  After tonight, I am sure that the people of Ireland will not understand.  Are we serious about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;protecting our industry?  Are we serious about imports? I think that we are not.  My time is very curtailed.  In contradiction to what the Minister said yesterday evening, 60 per cent of girls who attended the RHE colleges returned to farms.  This is as the result of a survey carried out over 15 years &mdash; from 1965 to 1981, not a survey of a few months as the Minister carried out trying to fool the people.  He will not fool the Members on this side of the House, or the people involved.  The remaining 40 per cent of girls are now in gainful employment.  Is there any educational institution here, in Europe, or any part of the world which can boast of 100 per cent success as the RHE colleges can?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had many deputations to the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty.  It appears that the Minister for Agriculture has refused to meet us.  Our last deputation was on 1 February.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, understands the situation on the ground very well because <Col N="1245" /> he is a farmer, and a good one.  I believe that he has had no hand, act or part in this disgraceful decision.  I ask him tonight to give us some hope, to get the finance from somewhere &mdash; whether from the YEA or elsewhere &mdash; but for goodness sake to protect something which is worthwhile.  I know that the lime subsidy and the AI subsidy have been done away with by the Minister so there remains about £7 million which will not be used, but which was provided for agriculture.</P>

      <P>I would like to direct the attention of the House to the fundamental point stressed by the Minister last night in his amending motion, that is, that in the allocation of State support for agriculture in these times of extreme pressure on public funds it must be an essential feature of Government policy to give priority in the provision made for agricultural education and training to the activities which contribute directly to increasing agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night we had Deputy Reynolds in the House making a very good case for balancing our books.  We can compete in Europe only on the basis that we are competing in a level field.  It is probably contributing to some of the unpopularity of the Government that we have taken some very tough decisions to ensure that our balance of payments is corrected.  As Deputy Byrne in particular knows, the <Col N="1246" /> farming community with lower inflation and with lower interest rates will be able to compete.  In the overall scene we must act responsibly towards the economy because we are up against the problem of paying our way in the world.</P>
    <P>We have got to increase our earnings from exports, among which agriculture is a key factor.  The natural economic climate must be right.  Nobody connected with farming needs me to tell him that a top priority must be to reduce the very high level of inflation which has been ravaging the agricultural sector over the past five years.  If we were to take one single factor over the last few years I would put even the recession below the inflation factor.  While there was a European recession, even worse than the recession was the fact that we allowed our inflation to go out of control and our farmers became uncompetitive.  Farmers know that the price of their products has been eroded by the very rapid price increases they have had to pay for their production imputs and indeed for the consumer goods on which they spend their net family income.</P>
    <P>We are talking about filling the supermarkets now.  It must be the aim of everybody on both sides of the House that we fill our supermarkets with Irish food.  The first priority is that of education.  The Government are not losing sight of that fact because, as the Deputy knows as well as I do, we have quite a lot of students in our agricultural colleges.  We have an agricultural college in Ballyhaise.  We have one in Clonakilty and we have the one which the Deputy knows best, the huge one in Kildalton.  We have Mellowes College, Athenry, County Galway; Gurteen, Ballingarry, County Tipperary; Mountbellew, County Galway; Multyfarnham, County Westmeath; Pallaskenry, County Limerick; the Salesian College, Warrenstown, County Meath; Rockwell College, Cashel, County Tipperary; and Saint Patrick's, County Monaghan.  We have 50 places in Ballinafad.  As well as that there is great interest shown by the vocational education scene in agricultural education.  Perhaps this is where we started out originally on the wrong foot.  In my <Col N="1247" /> grandmother's time they had agricultural education as a subject in the national schools.  They were taught how to grow things and to feed a household from the produce of a very small farm.  They were taught how to make cheese.  In my grandmother's case it proved to be a very valuable export market to French fishermen coming into Ballycotton.  We were actually exporting cheese from small farms as far back as 150 years ago.  We are not depending on four or five boarding schools for agricultural education.</P>
    <P>We have got to embrace the vast young population who are going into agriculture if we are to be serious about agricultural education.  We are talking about thousands of people each year.  We have to try to cope with educating them.  That is the problem facing this or any administration. If we are serious about filling our supermarkets with Irish food we will have to devote a lot more of the time of this House to looking at matters such as cheesemaking.  I do not believe it should be the prerogative of just a few schools. I believe there is a large and expanding market.  It is not necessarily one for the commercial co-operatives but one in which a number of young people, those with horticultural training, could partake. I suggest that this be done in a local VEC school or attached to our co-operatives and that that type of training would be provided.  If a few young people got together, got the milk from the co-operatives, made the cheese and then sold it back to the co-operatives, who would do the marketing, that would be the proper way to do it.</P>
    <P>The whole area of horticultural production seems to be at fault in relation to imports.  There is no point in talking about one or two places.  It is a large market which has to be filled and we have to involve a lot of people.  The whole technology of plastic tunnels and horticultural crops will have to be learned by people going to classes at night and getting the ACOT people involved in a parish by parish basis.  If we are to have young people involved seriously in horticultural crops I believe we will be talking about the second son at home.  Land <Col N="1248" /> leasing certainly comes into this.  I saw in Denmark a few years ago where in the teeth of a recession a few young people leased about ten acres of land.  The only knowledge they had was from growing up on farms.  The technology for growing the most sophisticated crops was given to them by local advisers.  They were on the way to making their first £1 million out of ten acres of plastic tunnels heated by round bales of straw and biomass.  That is the sort of thing we should be doing a lot more of.  The restructured ACOT are now doing a good job.  The Agricultural Institute are leading the way.  The information is readily available.</P>
    <P>In my short time in the Department I have noticed a growing awareness by shop owners, both the supermarket owners and the owners of small shops, of the importance of promoting Irish foods. Perhaps the housewife is responsible for this but in any event shop owners are showing a great sympathy and understanding with regard to the promotion of Irish commodities.</P>
    <P>I agree with speakers on the other side of the House who have pointed out we have a major task facing us, but I do not think that the five colleges mentioned by Members opposite are the solution. Education is the answer and this has to start in the national schools.  I have spoken on the matter to people in the VEC and I know they have many courses relating to tillage and to the care and servicing of machinery.  The regional technical colleges are also interested in agricultural education.  In the past perhaps we were inclined to look to areas other than agriculture for jobs, and that was only natural because the scope for work was quite considerable.  In the past leaving certificate students had a wide range of jobs they could do but that situation does not exist now.  Many young people are now finding their way back to the farm.  In my view many jobs could be created in horticulture. Training is needed and it can be provided by way of part-time courses or the 100-hour courses being carried out at the moment.</P>
    <P>In the face of declining real prices over a long period it is quite unrealistic to expect farmers to expand output.  Therefore, <Col N="1249" /> the reduction of inflation is one critical element in the policy to raise farm output.  Policies against inflation allow no easy options.  Success can be achieved only by pursuing difficult and unpopular remedies.  It must involve reducing the level of Government borrowing and, in turn, this must call for decisions on the allocation of Exchequer resources to agriculture, decisions which, as in the present case, may be unwelcome and unpalatable.  In times of stringency the only defence for not doing something is that the money is not available or that it has to be spent elsewhere.</P>
    <P>A further priority must be that of improving the economic efficiency of our agricultural production.  The contribution of agriculture not only to the national well-being but to farm family incomes is determined to a major extent by the level of efficiency achieved at family farm level.  A significant improvement in farm efficiency requires, apart from the farmer's own contribution, that the advisory and educational resources of ACOT be specifically directed towards securing a substantial improvement in efficiency and output at farm level.  That is a point I should like to stress.  Up to now the people in ACOT put emphasis on dairying. In fact, every bank manager more or less told farmers that if they wanted to succeed they should go into more milk production.  Now we know we are approaching the upper limits and a person who wishes to expand will have to consider other areas of agriculture.  However, I admit that grain and cereal growing would have limited appeal because the margin of profit would be quite slim.</P>
    <P>In future the general thrust of ACOT advice will be to train farmers in other areas of horticultural production.  There is no magic formula needed for that and a specific educational programme is not needed.  I should imagine that the constituency of Deputy Kitt is basically grassland but even in such an area people can adapt to new situations.  Irish farmers could never be accused of not producing commodities; in fact, our fault could be that we over-produced in certain areas.</P>
    <P>A great challenge is facing tillage farmers. A wide range of crops can be grown <Col N="1250" /> with substantial profit.  I have no worries about the farmers if they get the lead and the necessary co-operation from ACOT. Irish farmers will be able to compete with other European farmers if they are given the same conditions.  If they can get money at the same rate as their competitors they need not fear any competition. The training and education being provided by ACOT advisers is more than adequate to help our farmers.</P>
    <P>In my area there is intensive horticultural production and also a processing industry.  People there have adapted very quickly to the new technologies.  Problems arise but the ACOT people are able to cope with them.  There are many other people employed in the agri-business: there are those involved with seeds and sprays and the universities in Cork, Galway and Dublin are doing valuable work in training people who, in turn, train ACOT advisers.  There is an amount of experimental work and technology which is readily available to farmers and which is being availed of.</P>

      <P>What has the Minister for the housewife?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish housewife, like those everywhere else, is a well educated young woman who, in the words of Cardinal Newman, will have a broad spectrum education and will be well able to cope with the problems.  Mind you, even when such young women leave areas like Grafton Street to go out on to farms they do immensely well as farmer's wives and very readily adapt to the farming scene. The Deputy must know that also from his experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When ACOT are engaged in the job of using the funds made available to them, for the reasons I have outlined, it is vital that they concentrate on areas of advice in education which will have the greatest impact in raising farm production and in increasing the efficiency and skills of the people who will come into that industry. On that basis there can be little room for argument that the process to be followed must be to maximise the degree of ACOT support for our educational services, geared specifically to agricultural and <Col N="1251" /> horticultural production.  There has been an accelerated drive in this direction on the part of ACOT.</P>
    <P>As was mentioned by the Minister himself last evening, the launching of the certificate in farming in the past two years has constituted a major breakthrough. Over 1,000 young people are already participating in a three-year course which combines formal training at an agricultural college or a local farm training centre with supervised working experience on a well-run farm.  At the same time there has been a steady expansion in the numbers attending the colleges.  At present there are over 900 students in agricultural colleges and 200 in horticulture.  The emphasis in the future should be on embracing a lot more people, substantial numbers of them, which would obviously have to come about by way of part-time courses and courses conducted by ACOT, which courses should be related to a particular area.</P>
    <P>One thing that has emerged from the Inter-Departmental Report is that there is tremendous scope for import substitution, about which Deputy H. Byrne spoke last evening.  For example, there is tremendous scope for import substitution with regard to food products.  Perhaps we are somewhat over-sensitive, when we talk about buying Irish, that in some way or other we will upset our exports scene. The British are not at all apologetic about asking their people to buy English.  They are running a very successful &ldquo;Food from Britain&rdquo; campaign at present, the sort of campaign in which we should be engaging. Certainly the goodwill exists on the part of our housewives.  Hopefully there will be introduced in this House within a matter of weeks legislation governing the National Potato Co-operative.  With the establishment of this co-operative there will be approximately 12 centres around the country working in conjunction with the IAWS when, for the first time, we shall have our potatoes presented in a manner acceptable to the consumer in line with the methods used by our EEC competitors.  In other words, they will be produced and prepared for the shops similar <Col N="1252" /> to Dutch or any other European imports.  Being of a better quality, there is no reason why we should not compete.</P>
    <P>The skills involved in dealing with these and other horticultural crops will be acquired through the advice of the ACOT people, through more involvement in agricultural education in our VECs where I personally should like to see more emphasis being placed on agriculture. If we are to get the message across to a large number of people fairly quickly then it must be done by way of specialised day courses because, if one is talking about filling a gap of, say, £20 million, £100 million or £200 million in our imports scene then we must involve an awful lot of people.  There is not much point in talking about a select few, in five venues, achieving anything dramatic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is.  If we are serious about tackling this problem of educating people for agriculture, then the way to do so is through our advisory services, through their involvement in the ordinary day schools curriculum, perhaps with a little more support from the IDA, although we are receiving good support from them at present.  There should be a lot more emphasis placed on career guidance in guiding people into the areas of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not now speaking about cutbacks or otherwise, I am talking about the ones there already.  I should like to see them giving the sort of advice I am suggesting, that they would advise more people to move into areas of agriculture where there is a future and where jobs are to be found.  With a lot of goodwill on the part of everybody many jobs can be created.  If one examines how our competitors have tackled the unemployment scene one will see that in countries as poor as Denmark the experiment I suggested even in dairying has been carried out by the Danes themselves.  What <Col N="1253" /> started out as an experiment in a kitchen has now grown into a widespread industry. If a country such as Denmark &mdash; with the type of summer weather they get, which is little or none and with their short daylight hours &mdash; can export horticultural produce to Germany, then there is something wrong with us; we should be doing the same.  That is where the thrust of my advice would go, to get more and more young people involved in entrepreneurial exercises, providing jobs, initially filling our supermarkets with our produce, eventually getting into the exports scene, taking on the Dutch, Germans and others at their own game.  I might give the House one small example of what I mean, that is in the case of what are called Frenchfried chips, where the United Kingdom market at present is wide open to export into this market place.  It must be remembered that there is no miracle about growing potatoes or making chips.  The facts are that we import up to £15 million worth rather than engage in their export. There is no good reason we should not be doing so.</P>
      <P>I have a lot of sympathy with the movers of this motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the decision of the Government has been taken in the light of the constraints on our Exchequer, spelled out by the Minister last evening. As he indicated himself last evening I sincerely hope he will examine all of the possibilities.  I personally will interest myself in pursuing those possibilities.  I know that in Deputy J. Walsh's constituency the people themselves are meeting with a high degree of success in a local effort, about which I will allow him the privilege of telling us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we all put our heads together on this there is an awful lot that can be done. That is what I would like the House to do, that after this debate is over we would sit down and ascertain whether, with the help of the Youth Employment Agency, the Department of Labour and anybody else we can find, we can find a use for these colleges, in a much more expanded <Col N="1254" /> role, when a great number of day pupils could be accommodated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I cannot agree to the amendment moved here last night by the Minister.  If the Minister says that priority in agricultural spending should be given to activities which contribute directly to increasing agricultural production, how can he then exclude colleges which have done such great work down through the years?  Speakers on the Government side are not recognising the contribution these colleges have made to the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>The second point is that the Government cannot expect we will have immediately increased agricultural production from these colleges but in the long term they are the colleges which will form the basis for increased agricultural production in the years ahead.  My main point is that they are the only suitable establishments in which to train girls in farm home management.  Surely the Minister and his colleagues will agree that farm management is all about partnership, and the existence of these colleges recognises the important role of the housewife in the business of running the farm and the home.</P>
      <P>The closure of these colleges will be discrimination against rural Ireland and particularly against the women in rural Ireland.  Excellent training has been given in these colleges and those who attended the courses have certainly benefited from them.  We have had nothing at all from the female Minister for Education concerning the lack of funds for these colleges.  Does she think this type of course is available at second level?  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Neither can the Minister for Agriculture say these courses are available in agricultural colleges.  The Minister said tonight that we have fine agricultural colleges and I agree totally with him but I would remind him that he is talking about a different type of course. We have a Minister for Women's Affairs who has been very vocal about discrimination against women.  Has she, I wonder, any views on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency students have attended Portumna college and from <Col N="1255" /> north Galway they have attended Claremorris. Both these colleges have courses organised by the Sisters of Mercy and I would like to put on record now our appreciation of all that these Sisters have done over the years.  Religious are involved in the running of these colleges and there is a demand for this type of course.  They are similar to the courses in the home economics colleges and we all know how many applications there have been over the years for places in Sion Hill and in Sligo.  A question was tabled by Deputy Jim Tunney last week concerning additional accommodation in Sion Hill and it was answered as follows by the Minister for Education, Mrs. Hussey:</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place with the authorities of St. Catherine's college of home economics in regard to their application for additional accommodation.  The matter is now under examination and a decision will be expedited as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>That shows there is a demand for this course.  I would stress also that the residential nature of the colleges is very important.  Accommodation is not available in other institutions.  I am informed the sum of £57,000 is the allocation for Portumna college this year.  When you take the wages and salaries out of that, which amount to some £47,000, you are talking about £7,000 for capitation and equipment.  Surely that is a very small amount to ensure this particular college continues in operation.  I put that to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton.  It is a very small amount and when one looks at the figures for other colleges we are talking of a very meagre amount indeed out of a total agricultural budget.  What will become of the staff employed in these colleges? Where will they find alternative employment? The only alternative I can see is that they might possibly be involved in night classes.  Otherwise they will be redundant.</P>
    <P>I emphasise these colleges have given good ground-working plans in home management.  They have assured future employment in agriculture despite what <Col N="1256" /> the Minister said last night.  They have given courses in dairying, poultry, cheese production and so on.  With regard to the poultry industry the Minister is probably aware that by completing a course in one of these colleges a girl can go on to become a poultry technician.  Every year from 12 to 15 girls do that poultry technicians' course in Athenry and go on to work in the commercial poultry units.  If the Minister has any doubt about the benefit provided by these colleges &mdash; judging by what he said last night he does not seem to have much regard for these colleges and what they have done &mdash; I would ask him to talk to the teachers who have been involved in these schools or, better still, talk to the past pupils who have gone to these schools and who will tell him very clearly that they have got tremendous benefit from these colleges. They have been able to get employment in the agricultural industry or on the farm working in partnership with the husband in running the farm and the home.</P>
    <P>Last night we had the Minister giving a quotation from the Fianna Fáil document &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo;.  He gave two quotations in which there was not one mention of these colleges.  He just used the two quotations to pad out his speech when he realised he could not hopefully blame Fianna Fáil for all our problems. He also said the courses were out of date. They are certainly very relevant.  Farm accounting and budgeting are very relevant. The Minister mentioned food imports.  With food imports so high it is important we should continue these colleges in operation.  The Minister wants practical examples of where to save money.  May I say to him that we have provided something like £11.7 million in the capital programme for AI and lime subsidies.  What will become of that money if the schemes are not restored? We have reduced the Land Commission allocation by a quarter this year.  How will those savings be used?  Surely they could contribute towards the continuation of these colleges.  If the Government allow these colleges to close in a few years' time we will be talking about opening these colleges because they are so important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> Finally, I would appeal to Deputy Connaughton, the Minister of State, to use his influence with his Minister and the Government to get the money &mdash; it is not a large sum &mdash; to keep these colleges in operation and continue those very useful courses in management of the farm and of the home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion on which my colleagues have spoken so widely and I call on the Government to provide the funds necessary to continue the operation of the five rural home economics colleges.  It is a basic structure for the development of farm home advisers, poultry production, budgeting, farm records, cheese making, etc.  The Government say in their amendment that priority in the provision for agricultural education and training should be given to activities which contribute directly to increasing agricultural production.  This is an area in which you would be increasing agricultural production and would give the basic ideas and values of producing, budgeting and advising.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee on food imports put the emphasis on many areas, especially poultry production.  The regrettable feature of the recession is that it is used as an excuse for curtailing or withdrawing funds from the five rural home economics colleges.  The Department did not think about the damage they were doing and did not closely examine what those colleges were providing for students.  At present our greatest problem in relation to the agricultural industry is that there is no well thought out plan.  If a close study had been made of the cost-benefit analysis they might have had second thoughts.</P>
      <P>The Minister said last night that it was a matter of funding.  If you are involved with a health board or a local authority the priority seems to be the non-availability of funds.  There are so few areas where you can reduce spending and everything is liable to be axed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that future financing might come from the Youth Employment Agency or the EEC.  He was depending on another Minister and various agencies and, in the heel of the hunt, on money <Col N="1258" /> from the EEC.  We always seem to be wondering where these funds will come from and that is not the proper basis for developing any structure, especially a sound agricultural policy.  We would be glad to see funding coming from any area to ensure the continuation of those colleges but the Minister should have consulted us.  If he had said that he had been in consultation with the Minister for Labour or negotiating with the EEC for funds it would have been far more desirable than saying in a wooly way that he hoped to get the money to keep the colleges going but that it was not his responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the benefits which would accrue from buying Irish products and he appealed to the food industry to reappraise their attitude towards the domestic market.  I have been pursuing this matter for the last ten years.  This area is crying out for development although of course it is hard to change the situation overnight when you are importing goods to the value of £753 million.  If we could even reduce that figure by 5 per cent or 10 per cent a year for a few years it would ensure thousands of additional jobs.</P>
    <P>Teachers are being made redundant in these colleges although there is work for them.  The same applies in the health board in my area because a senior civil servant pushes a Minister to cut back on spending.  It is a dangerous policy to follow. When I first learned that these colleges were to close I raised the question of the poultry industry.  The report to which I referred said that 25 per cent of our eggs are imported which amounts to a sum of £11.4 million.  The area I come from is the best developed as far as poultry and egg production are concerned but we could develop it much further and additional jobs could be provided. The report also mentioned that we imported meat to the value of £40.6 million and £16.3 million could have been substituted by home products.  Ministers are continually telling us that representatives from various Departments are closely examining these matters but they should be concluded as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> I left a meeting which I was having with the horticultural committee of the IFA and they say it will need drastic measures to compete with imported products.  The time has come for the kid gloves to be taken off because, if money is being provided by way of grant aid, we will have to learn to produce potatoes, vegetables or any other product to the standard of the imported goods.  The price will have to be right also.  I spent many years attached to a co-operative which was involved in the potato business, seed packaging and exportation.  It is up to the Department to ensure that every assistance is given to producers.  In 1982 we imported frozen chips to the value of £11.9 million and £18.6 million worth of processed vegetables.  Much of that could have been produced at home and many jobs could have been provided if we had made the effort.  Think of the pride which people would have to see Irish produce in our supermarkets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion to continue funding the rural home economics colleges and I do not accept the argument that there is no money. That is nonsense.  Last week I asked here how much money was spent on renting Government offices last year.  A sum of £17 million was spent in this area and it was established recently by the Committee of Public Accounts that many of those offices are unoccupied.  Surely we could pick up £500,000 in that area alone, as one example.</P>
      <P>For industrial training last year up to £100 million was spent, and £18 million of that was given to consultancy firms, accountancy and legal firms.  I wonder what benefit that was to the whole industrial scene where we have 250,000 people unemployed.  The Youth Employment Agency handed back £11 million last year because they did not know what to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the young people going back to farming?  I do not accept the Minister's speech last night which, I suspect, was written for him by some important person in the Department of Finance <Col N="1260" /> who have had the whip hand over agriculture for the past couple of years.  It is a pity that the good ideas of the two Ministers were not allowed to be implemented because of the dominance of the Department of Finance over agriculture. I do not accept that the young girls attending these colleges do not go back to farming.  Perhaps they do not go back immediately, but many of them marry farmers and end up in farming.  The training they get in these colleges is of tremendous benefit to them.</P>
    <P>The discrimination against women in farming is absolutely outrageous.  In all other areas of activity women are getting progressively better treatment and conditions. Unfortunately, the farmer's wife does not get fair treatment.  A PAYE woman worker gets 15 weeks paid maternity leave, whereas, for the poor farmer's wife, were it not for the grandmother or the mother or the mother-in-law looking after the place while she is away, the situation would be awful when she returned to the farm.</P>
    <P>Here we have another example of discrimination against women in agriculture. I appeal to the Ministers involved to give women going into farming the same opportunities as women going into other occupations.  As everybody knows, other occupations are drying up.  More and more of these girls will be staying on the farm, or going back to the farm.  This very meagre and small amount of money could help these courses to be continued.</P>
    <P>In Dunmanway in my constituency the principal has to go around cap in hand trying to collect a few pounds to keep the college going.  The people in the area and the farmers' daughters want the college to stay in business.  They are very annoyed that the Minister for Agriculture would not even meet a deputation from the college to look into the matter.  He told us last night he was looking at the Youth Employment Agency and AnCO to see if they could get a few bob from them.  The Minister's office has already communicated with the college and told them there are no funds and they cannot help them.  They were told they would have to close down sooner or later.</P>
    <P>These colleges are doing an excellent <Col N="1261" /> job.  Their certificates are recognised and farmers' daughters who inherit the farm can get stamp duty exemption.  If the son inherits the farm he does not have to pay stamp duty at 3 per cent.  If a daughter inherits the farm because these courses are not available she will have to pay 3 per cent stamp duty.  The colleges are closing down because the Minister says there is no money.  There is not enough commitment on the part of the Ministers involved.  There is no use in coming in here and saying they cannot find the money.  Enough money is being squandered every week in many areas to keep these colleges going for the next ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>In five minutes it is almost impossible for me to say what I would like to say.  The decision to close these colleges makes a mockery of the Coalition Government's claim that they have concern for young people.  That decision shows the Government in their true light.  It shows that the right wing, monetaristic policies of the Government put the young people a poor second to right wing extremism and a book balancing exercise.</P>
      <P>I should like to speak briefly about Claremorris.  I am not sure whether the Minister was talking about Claremorris as one of the colleges from which they got some information.  I had the privilege of being at a graduation ceremony in Claremorris some years ago.  In the college they have a farm.  The pupils have the full range of farming activities and not only the activities which the Minister seemed to subscribe to in his speech. There appears to me to be a contradiction in that speech.  He said we had to increase our earnings from exports among which agriculture is a key factor.  In another paragraph he said that in the face of declining real prices over a long period it is quite unrealistic to expect farmers to expand output.  I do not know how we can increase our earnings if we cannot expand output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government continue with the <Col N="1262" /> policies they are adopting now, they will throw an average of 40 pupils in Claremorris onto the scrap heap.  In the disadvantaged areas served by this college, Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal and Mayo, there is no other place where young girls can get education in farming which would help them to play a part in farming activities in the west.</P>
    <P>One wonders how much it will cost to close down these operations.  One wonders what will happen to the buildings and the people in Claremorris who will be out of work.  One wonders where these people will get work.  They have special skills which cannot be used readily in other employments.  This decision is a disgrace.  It is one of the worst decisions taken by the Government.  Let me emphasise that.</P>
    <P>There is a rumour in the colleges that this Government did not take this decision, that it was big bad Fianna Fáil.  Two budgets later they have the cheek and audacity to say Fianna Fáil were closing the colleges.  It is easy to know why they are far behind in the polls if they expect people to be fooled by that codology. They had the opportunity.  They could have put the £6 million they took from the decentralisation programme into the colleges.  That £6 million was in the Estimates for the 1982 budget.  They are not worried about the colleges.</P>
    <P>I accept that the two men opposite have the interest of agriculture at heart, but they were not able to break down the resistance of the Department of Finance. The Department decided that there would be very little protest from the colleges.  They knew if they took the money from some place else there would be protests.  That is the main reason for the decision to close the colleges.  I ask the Ministers to go back to the Department of Finance and get the miserly amount of money which would keep these colleges open and the young girls and their teachers in them.</P>

      <P>I am not in the slightest bit interested in who said they would or would not close the colleges.  I am interested in keeping them open either as they are or in a different form.  I was glad to hear the winds of change sweeping through the Chamber last night and tonight.  I support Deputy Noonan's motion in which he calls on the Government <Col N="1266" /> to procure the funding to enable the five rural home economics colleges to remain open.  One of those colleges, Ardagh, is in my constituency.  The other colleges are situated in Claremorris, Dunmanway, Portumna and Ramsgrange. The capacity of the colleges is 260 girls for full-time residential education.  It may be that the colleges when established many years ago had a very important curriculum to fulfil.  I maintain they have fulfilled that and over the years have sent out into the world many young women who have fulfilled their role admirably. I take the point put forward by Minister Deasy last night, and hinted at by Ministers of State Connaughton and Hegarty, that perhaps there was another source of funding that the colleges could look to to enable them remain viable.</P>
      <P>Before the Department of Agriculture bow out and renege on its long-term responsibility to these colleges it should make adequate provision for the future and continuing funding of them.  Last night the Minister said that in view of the possibility of the colleges having a role to play in the context of general youth employment and training programmes within the province of the Youth Employment Agency his Department had been in touch with those agencies and facilitated the college management association to enter into negotiations with them in the matter.  He said he understood that a decision by the Youth Employment Agency was currently awaited on the submission made to them by the association on the use of the colleges as rural enterprise centres.  I am privileged to have received a copy of the proposal from the association to the Youth Employment Agency in which they set out honestly and fairly the history of the colleges to date and where they see they can change to accommodate the objectives and plans of the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see Deputy Taylor-Quinn present, the sole female representative of the Coalition who say they are so committed to the feminist cause.  The Coalition should give expression to their feminist principles and not just talk about them.  It is easy to go on television and <Col N="1267" /> do a full programme on the importance of women joining golf clubs &mdash; I am all for women joining them and having full membership of them &mdash; and of the importance of having the correct types of forms so that women do not feel affronted when presented with a particular type of form; but that is not feminism, that is only old blather.  It is not putting feminism into action.</P>
    <P>If the Government close Ardagh, Claremorris, Dunmanway, Portumna and Ramsgrange 260 young women will be deprived of the opportunity to study farm and home management and financing arrangements for them.</P>

I accept that, but students are lucky if they have three class periods per week for that subject.  There is a concentration of those subjects at the RHE colleges for five days each week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very rude to interrupt when a woman is talking.  Two hens cackling will not help the cause.  Maybe one hen cackling at a time will.  This contrasts directly with 1,000 places available for boys who wish to enter the farming scene.  However, to stand up here and say who is to do it, who is not going to do it or who did or did not do it is like Agatha Christie in reverse.  The positive way to do it is to put forward proposals on how these rural colleges can remain open.  I propose positively here tonight that these five rural colleges become rural employment and enterprise centres.  I address this proposal particularly to the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton. Remember that these colleges are all in rural areas serving a rural hinterland where there are not the manpower agencies which are available in large urban <Col N="1268" /> centres.  These colleges can play such a role in the future.</P>
      <P>The five colleges coming together have made proposals to the Youth Employment Agency as to their role in the future format of Youth Employment Agency funding.  The main purpose of their submission is to demonstrate that the colleges have developed a role largely different from what was intended originally. That is forward looking and positive. They say also that their role is to educate responsible citizens who will give leadership in community organisations.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, spoke very warmly and eloquently on his own subjects of vegetable and potato growing and about the need for small community groups to come together and small enterprises to be allowed to grow and flower.  That is the way business and industry will develop in future.  The days of the Japanese and the Americans coming here and waving a wand and creating 1,000 jobs in the morning which fold up two years later are over. That is not the way of progress in industrial life.  The way of progress is the cooperative movement, groups coming together, ideas flowering among people, enterprise, entrepreneurship, giving expression to ideas.  These rural colleges have encouraged these over the years and women who have left them have gone, some to nursing, some to agriculture, some to catering and some marry and have very fulfilling roles as full-time partners on a family farm.  On the subject of men behind women and women behind men I put forward that women play equal roles on a farm and in a partnership.</P>
      <P>The five colleges in their submission state:</P>
      <P>In responding to a changing environment the rural home economics colleges have become important institutions for creating employment, including self-employment, for young people in rural areas.  The education they have given in their courses, whilst confined and restricted, is broad in that it enables the young person to look at opportunities in her life when she goes out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> I would like to tell a story which was told to me of a girl who did a course in Ardagh and in that year's course she was found to have an aptitude for the confectionery business, cake making and so on.  When she went home she researched her area and travelled about a catchment of a certain number of miles.  She researched what market there would be for wedding cakes, christening cakes, 21st birthday cakes and so on.  She drew up proposals for the pricing and costing of her cakes. She prepared brochures, she went into every little village and town in the area, put her brochures on display and told the people there what she intended to do. That girl is fully employed now and two others are employed with her.  Her skills were first perceived and then developed in Ardagh School of Home Economics. This is the type of education that school has given in the past and can continue to give.</P>
    <P>They make the point that no rural agency is capable of doing the work that the colleges have been doing in relation to unemployment in rural Ireland, that there will be an adverse economic effect on the already economically weak community who service the colleges, probably giving rise to further unemployment, if the colleges are closed and that to close them would be a serious mistake.  They are open to suggestions, but the main suggestion made is that the objective of the five rural colleges be restated to formalise their role in reducing unemployment. They wish to put themselves forward not alone as they have been heretofore, rural home economics colleges teaching in specialised areas of farm lore and knowledge; they wish to put themselves into the job finding, job training marketplace and to that end they have made a submission to the Youth Employment Agency.  That agency, through lack of proper submissions costed and researched, were not able to use up their allocation of funding last year and had to send back to the Exchequer approximately £11 million.  This proposal, with its objectives stated accurately, makes a very worthy case for <Col N="1270" /> examination by the Department of Labour.</P>

      <P>I have said to Deputy Taylor-Quinn that two women shouting at each other is bad form.  The Ministers of State, Deputy Connaughton and Deputy Hegarty, are here tonight and have proved themselves open and perceptive to the ideas put forward by us on this side.  I accept the goodwill they have expressed towards these colleges. Deputy Kelly is madly prompting Deputy Taylor-Quinn.  I want to see that goodwill expressed forcibly and completely.  I ask the Coalition partners to vote for our motion tonight.  I know that is only a wish in the moon, but I might as well say it. They should take heed of our motion which says that the Government should provide the funding.  I do not care which Department provide the funding.  I do not care whether it comes from the Department dealing with women's affairs, the Department of Labour or the Department of Education.  I am surprised that the Minister for Education is not here tonight to lend her ear and her goodwill, if not her voice, to the educative potential of these institutions.  I do not care which Government agency decide to fund these five colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there is a spirit of willingness within the Government to look afresh at the situation.  Our spokesman, Deputy Noonan, with Deputy Kitt and Deputy Byrne, have put down the motion that the Government keep the colleges open.  Who first had it in his head to close them I do not care, but I care that the colleges remain open.  These five colleges of rural economics educate 260 girls and have full employment for 52 people. They are in Ardagh, which is in County Longford, in my constituency; in Claremorris, In Dunmanway, in Portumna and in Ramsgrange.  I press the Government to consider deployment of Youth Employment Agency funding to answer directly the very admirable and realisable case put forward by the Association of Rural Home Economics Colleges to the Youth Employment Agency.  I commend <Col N="1271" /> that to this Government.  I ask the two Ministers of State and the Minister himself to come back here to this House and report on how this proposal is perceived.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Criminal Justice Bill, 1983: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a fairly extensive discussion on this section and have considered a large number of amendments. This debate gives us an opportunity to examine the section as a whole and as now amended.  It is essential that we in this House and the public at large should realise that section 3 creates, for the first time since the foundation of the State &mdash; other than, of course, in emergency legislation &mdash; the power of arrest of any citizen on mere suspicion and his or her detention purely for questioning or interrogation.  Some Deputies have said that much time has been spent in discussing this Bill, but this was essential because of the nature of the power which it is conferring.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have reluctantly but inevitably accepted the granting of this new power in the present circumstances and because the Garda force believe that it will assist them in dealing with crime.  We are placing our confidence in the Garda force in this respect and trust that they will understand our request for suitable safeguards and amendments to ensure that those among their ranks who might not comply with the generally very high standard of the Garda force will not be able to abuse this legislation in the way in which it would be open to abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the new powers of arrest and imprisonment or detention being such a new and fundamental departure from the practice heretofore, we are convinced that the section must be accompanied by a Garda Complaints Commission on the one hand and minimum safeguards for persons in custody on the other.  The Minister has been very helpful here in the debate on the section and has made commitments and promises regarding legislation which will cover these safeguards. He has been quite forthcoming in that he is prepared to consider positive regulations and safeguards and to bring in a positive motion in the House relating to the regulations.  However, it is important to emphasise that the Bill should at <Col N="1275" /> this stage have had beside, with, or within it the appropriate regulations and clauses concerning the Complaints Commission. Today we are bringing in legislation without knowing about the Complaints Commission or the regulations.  Because the Minister has supporting him the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, we have no alternative but to accept that situation. It is for the Members of this House a blinkered approach to the introduction of legislation, which is regrettable.  It would have been far better for all of us if things had been otherwise.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to improve the situation, on behalf of my party I have put down a number of amendments, the spirit of which certainly, I think it is fair to say, has been accepted by the Minister, both in relation to the necessary safeguards and the Complaints Commission.  I find it very difficult to see how this section could come before the House without the Minister being in a position to deal with these matters.  If I, as a member of the Opposition, without the Minister's support and back-up, could bring in something along the lines of what will be necessary, it should have been possible for him to bring in these clauses and put them before the House at this stage.</P>
    <P>The effect of the section as amended is that there will be arrest on suspicion.  I am a little concerned &mdash; and would like the Minister's views on this &mdash; as to how it will apply and where it will be applied. I feel that it would be applied mainly in the large urban centres, with some of which I am very familiar and other Members of the House also, where the level of crime is at present so high.  Consequently if it is to be applied mainly in those centres it should be possible to provide the facilities and resources for those centres so that this section can be implemented in the areas in which it is likely to be used frequently because of the level of crime in them.  The Minister might consider improving the facilities and resources in those areas in particular. I would like to have his view on where he sees the section being applied most.</P>
    <P>We also have the question of detention after arrest.  We know that at the moment <Col N="1276" /> it applies to those over seven years.  There was some confusion about that earlier on but the Minister, following the debate on the section, has given us an assurance that he will come back on Report Stage with an amendment along the lines we have suggested.  I suggested that the measures in this section should not apply to children under 12 years of age.  The Minister agreed to consider at least that level for Report Stage.  We welcome the Minister being so forthcoming in that respect and we look forward to his amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>We also now have in this section detention for six hours followed by six hours with eight hours rest and whether you are disturbed or called during the eight hours.  With regard to six hours followed by six hours I have some reservations about the need for the second six hours because it would appear that most of the information required would seem to be ascertainable within the first three or four hours.  I accept that there will be circumstances in which a longer time might be needed.  It is a pity we could not have isolated those instances.  I know the Minister will mention cases like murder and rape and I do not believe any of us would be concerned with the extra period applying there.  Even the little information we had from studies done in England showed that for offences which did not involve sexual matters there seemed to be a very quick decision and early information provided. This might indicate that there are some particular offences for which the double period might be appropriate but that for the majority of offences the six hours might be appropriate.  The Minister could perhaps consider this for Report Stage.  Those accused of non-sexual violence are for the most part interrogated only briefly.  Nearly 89 per cent are questioned for less than an hour.  This seems to indicate some very distinct categorisation there, that in perhaps a very broad area the six hour period would be more than sufficient whereas for specific offences a longer time would be required. We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have much information by way of evidence on past experience in this area to tell what sort of crimes and what sort <Col N="1277" /> of cases would tend to need longer periods and if those could be categorised in any way.</P>
    <P>We have also defined and teased out fairly well the kind of offences to which the section will apply, those for which the five year sentence applies generally.  We know this can cover fairly simple crimes, from shop-lifting and larceny generally up to the very serious crimes.  We have not succeeded in finding a means of categorising those.  It is another question whether that is possible.  I cannot help feeling that, if we had more information even on the lines of that available in England, it might be possible to do some more categorisation.  I felt from the beginning that should have been possible but I accepted the Minister's view that larceny is larceny and you could not draw a line at a certain level in relation to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister conceded a number of things during the debate on this section. He has agreed that the section will cease after five years unless it is brought back into being by both Houses of the Oireachtas. That is one of the concessions he has made.  We also know that he is considering the question of age and will come back to us on it.  I am still concerned about extending the detention for the second period.  I believe, following the discussion we had on our amendment, that it should be satisfactory for a superintendent to give that authorisation rather than a chief superintendent, and if a superintendent gave authorisation that it should be possible for him to have reasonable grounds for the extension.  I appreciate the Minister's argument that the chief superintendent may be at quite a distance from the scene and it would be more difficult.  I feel very strongly that there should be reasonable grounds for extending into the second six hours.</P>
    <P>I believe, following the discussion we had, that it would be quite in order to allow a superintendent or higher officer to give the extension there.  After our discussion here I looked at the British Criminal Evidence Bill, page 34, section 38.  It provides &ldquo;where a police officer of the rank of superintendent or above, who is responsible for the police station at which a person is detained, has reasonable <Col N="1278" /> grounds for believing that ...&rdquo; he may authorise the extended period.  It was interesting to see from the discussion we had that they had taken the line I suggested earlier, that perhaps we could change it from chief superintendent to superintendent and install the reasonable grounds.  That is something that could be considered on Report Stage.  In any event, it is probably reasonable to give the power to a superintendent or a higher officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would entrust the decision to a superintendent but I think that quite justifiably we could look for reasonable grounds.  The superintendent would be closer to the situation and it would be a more practical way to deal with the matter.  On checking the British Act subsequently I found they had taken that line.</P>
      <P>We have also considered the matter of questioning between midnight and 8 a.m. and the Minister has agreed to consider an amendment on this matter for Report Stage.  There are some difficulties with regard to questioning in hospital and we will look at that before Report Stage. The Minister has given an undertaking that he will consider clarifying that section on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his amendments the Minister has done much to overcome the difficulties in relation to rearrest, especially with regard to the combination of 12 hours <Col N="1279" /> and 48 hours.  I hope the Minister will accept the spirit of what we have been trying to get across.  We are providing in this section for detention for a wide range of crimes, apart from the specialised subversive offences and offences against the State, but we are anxious to have some means of closing off extensions after 48 hours.  I appreciate that the Minister did this quite successfully in one amendment but there seems to have been a loophole even in that that could be closed.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister was mistaken when he said that the Offences Against the State Act provided for 48 hours followed by 48 hours detention.  As far as I know it is 24 hours followed by 24 hours.  The Minister also referred to the British situation and spoke of 48 hours followed by 48 hours.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the point that the Offences Against the State Act provides for 24 hours detention followed by 24 hours, making a total of 48 hours.</P>
    <P>The House has considered the matter of safeguards and some Members have pointed out that other kinds of safeguards were not included.  One such safeguard is the question of medical examination.  The provisions of this section are likely to be used quite extensively &mdash; for example, in cases of larceny and possibly shoplifting &mdash; and many of the detentions will probably be very short, possibly for one or two hours.  Therefore, the question of medical examination will hardly apply. However, it could apply in a certain proportion of cases.</P>
    <P>I had prepared fairly extensive amendments providing safeguards with regard to medical examination as a result of experience gleaned elsewhere.  This brings out the broad and extensive nature of the section.  In practice a very large proportion of the crimes involved will be disposed of fairly quickly in questioning and, consequently, one wonders to what extent one should go in relation to safeguards on medical grounds.  The British have built in medical and a whole series of safeguards in the Act, including the responsibility of custody officers at police stations.  They have spelled out the duties of a custody officer before charging <Col N="1280" /> arises, they have talked about the issuing of certificates and have defined clearly the responsibilities in that area and also in relation to persons detained.  Subsection (10) of Part 4 of their Act states:</P>
    <P>Before authorising a person's continued detention, the review officer shall give (a) that person (unless he is asleep) or (b) any solicitor representing him an opportunity to make representations to the review officer.</P>
    <P>They considered that point and put it into the legislation.  Perhaps one of the amendments I had down as a safeguard would be appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously they were thinking on similar lines.  The whole question of medical examination is a major one.  I did some work on that but I did not refer to it here because the whole matter would get too extensive.  I suppose that is part of the problem with the section.  It is so broad that there would have to be a section relating to medical examination.  I presume the Minister will cover that point in his regulations.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given an undertaking that section 3 will not go ahead until the regulations and the legislation for a complaints procedure is passed by the House. I take it this is a commitment made by the Minister and he can confirm or deny that when he is replying.  Many people are asking us if this section dealing with detention on suspicion will reduce crime, or what sort of contribution will it make to the reduction of crime.  The Minister has not so far given us any indication of the reduction he expects there will be from the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  I know that is a difficult thing to do.  Nevertheless I presume he has some idea of the practical, beneficial effect it may have.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us how he feels this section will affect crime and what contribution it will make towards its reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would tell us also what is the present position in relation to <Col N="1281" /> crime, or perhaps for the year 1983, which is now well behind us.  The Minister must now have a fair idea of what happened in relation to crime generally in that year.  We know that in 1982 the rate of increase in crime slowed down very considerably, the rate of increase in that year having been 9 per cent compared with 22.8 per cent increase in 1981.  My understanding is that the rate of increase in 1983 will have slowed down even further. I would welcome hearing from the Minister on that subject in reply.</P>
    <P>We must then ask ourselves: why is it at present being pulled back and what are the factors that are bringing this about? I believe personally that the deployment of men on the beat, the changes that are being made, getting more of them out into the community, on the beat, is having its effect on crime.  In some of the major crime areas &mdash; while citizens generally will not recognise the fact at this stage because the general level of crime is so high at present &mdash; the official position probably would be that the crime rate again this year is dropping.  It is important to establish what is our position now.  I believe it would be very wrong if we went on thinking, after the passage of this Bill, that they were the special powers of detention and arrest on suspicion that had been the sole or principal contributor.  We should monitor the position henceforth in the interests of the review which will take place, in any event at the end of five years.  This should be done in a factual, analytical and statistical way by the collation of any data or information that can be gathered and which will prove useful in this respect.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any doubt but that the provisions of this Bill will contribute to a further reduction in the rate of crime.  That is why we are agreeing to it in principle but it will be important to quantify the extent to which it will contribute ultimately.  Perhaps by looking at some of the major urban centres very closely it will be possible to adequately monitor what is happening there.</P>
    <P>Of course there are a lot of other factors affecting the drop in the crime rates which we have discussed at various stages in this House.  We know also that a considerable <Col N="1282" /> amount of crime is drug-related. Teasing out that problem, dealing with it specifically, must substantially contribute to a reduction in crime.  We know that the juvenile liaison officers have had very considerable success in their work and that the further development of that system could prevent many more young people entering a life of crime, by catching them at a very early stage.  We are aware also that many of the crimes being committed are by people back on the streets &mdash; as soon as they have been put away &mdash; in which respect the provision of corrective facilities, whichever they may be, is vital.  We are aware, particularly from the centre city area, that the Garda on the spot can tell one that had they somewhere to put a certain number of people then there would be a dramatic drop in the level of crime but that, even when they went to look for 'fit person orders' there was nowhere to put these people.  Therefore, they are frustrated in that respect, another factor which could contribute to a reduction in crime and which must be pursued at the same time as the implementation of this Bill.</P>

If we were to discuss this section again I would not like &mdash; nor, I believe, would other Members of the House &mdash; to have people claiming that arrest on suspicion had brought about or was the principal factor in the reduction in crime. There are other factors which have been analysed in various committees of this House which can contribute substantially to its reduction.  It is important that we quantify the impact of this section and, in so doing, that we be aware of the other elements at play.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not realise I was going that far.  I was just indicating some of the main elements which have an influence on the level of crime.  I would hope that the Minister would analyse and engage in some research on the application of this section, when implemented, in line with the spirit of the discussions we shall have had here in the House.  Incidentally the huge backlog in the courts has been pointed out in other areas.  For instance, in the year 1981, the amount of crimes remaining at year end in respect of which proceedings had not been completed amounted to 17,968, and there is a table accompanying that figure.  This gives one some idea of the need to expedite crime proceedings and the impact that that can have.  I know the Minister will be devoting his attention to all of these areas and that the efforts which he and his Department will be making in that respect will have their beneficial pay-off in the reduction in crime.  In relation to all of these factors we should endeavour to ascertain what will be the impact of this section in the long-term.</P>
      <P>There is one other point I should like to make in relation to this section.  I am concerned about the use of the provisions of the section subsequently, say when somebody is taken away for questioning, particularly under this Bill.  I remember Deputy Taylor being very disturbed here one day when he discovered that one would be an arrested person.  He had contributed to the debate and discovered that, from the very beginning, one would be an arrested person, while he had been thinking in nicer terms, such as a person having been detained whereas, in effect, one is arrested at the outset.  This is something which could be used against people because nobody likes it to be said about them that they were arrested.  At present, if one says that somebody was arrested, it is very serious.  It means that there must have been some basis.  Afterwards one might think that perhaps there was insufficient evidence but that where there is smoke there must be fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be particularly concerned about that in some areas.  I deal often enough with young people who have been through the courts and I know the <Col N="1284" /> difficulties they experience subsequently in getting jobs, references and so on.  This section will mean that quite a large number of people, young people &mdash; I am thinking of the 16, 17 or 18 year-old age group rather than in terms of the 9, 10 or 11 year-olds &mdash; who, because of their nature anyway tend to get near to or be involved in some of these activities.  Indeed if we all looked back into our youth we would remember that we had been close to some of our friends somewhere who had been up to something or other and that, fortunately, we had been able to remain at a distance from whatever was taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people will know that you are in the station for 20 hours. I considered the question of publishing names of people who have been arrested and detained for a period of six or 12 hours.  I thought about the desirability of having an amendment to deal with it in <Col N="1286" /> this section but I found considerable difficulty in formulating such an amendment. I thought of something along the lines that no person shall publish or cause to be published the names of the persons arrested without such persons agreeing to it.  There is a system which operates whereby people who have been detained or arrested or who have a black mark against them have a problem as far as employers are concerned.  I hope that the powers in this section will not be used and that information concerning people who have been detained under this section will not be given out to people generally because I can see considerable potential abuse if that were the case.  I know a number of young people who, because they have been involved and been in a station for a period, have a black mark on their character.  This section should not lead to that situation and the Minister should find a way of dealing with it.  Perhaps it is not feasible for us to put down an amendment to the section along those lines because the press have the right to know when a person is detained in a station for six hours.</P>
      <P>With the Minister's assurances in relation to the amendments which he proposes to make on Report Stage, the steps which he proposes to take and those which he has already taken, we will be supporting the section as a whole and we look forward to the Minister taking the other measures which he has promised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers that are now being provided for detention under section 3 with the various amendments that have been passed or which will be introduced on Report Stage are providing the Garda with a power they have sought for some time on the basis that they feel hampered in the fight against crime.  They expressed the view in recent years that this is an essential part of the Garda armoury in the fight against crime to afford them a proper opportunity to investigate offences and to prosecute successfully those who are guilty of committing offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us in this House are uneasy about the powers of detention that are <Col N="1287" /> now being provided and it is fair to say that that applies to Deputies on all sides of the House.  That unease and concern have been expressed in the length of time we have taken in dealing with this section and the amendments tabled to it.  We have tried to perform a very delicate balancing act of providing powers to the Garda while seeking to provide the required protection against abuse of those powers.  I hope we have gone along the road of providing the necessary protections. We will only complete that as we debate other sections and when we come to further amendments which are to be tabled on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>In recent times, in a number of cases which came before the courts there have been examples of, to put it mildly, excessive zeal on behalf of a very small minority of members of the Garda.  Those instances have caused great concern to Members of this House and have influenced them in their concern about section 3 and the extension of detention powers. The behaviour of that very small minority is deeply regretted by the vast majority of gardaí who fully and properly perform their functions, do a great service to the community at large and have the full support of all Members of this House.  In fairness to the vast majority of gardaí who do their jobs properly and on whom we depend for security in the State and the prevention and investigation of crime, a message should go out from this House that the power of detention, the power to hold someone for the purpose of conducting an investigation which is a power of a different nature from the ordinary arrest and charge procedure must only be used where it is genuinely believed that someone has committed an offence and where detention is positively required for the proper investigation of an offence.</P>
    <P>The need for these powers has been expressed as a need which will assist the Garda not merely in the investigation of crime but in successfully detecting those who have committed crime and in prosecuting them in the courts.  The statistics seem to indicate that under the Offences Against the State Act prosecutions are <Col N="1288" /> brought against only one of every nine or ten persons detained.  When we come to review these powers if we find that only one out of every ten or 20 people detained have been prosecuted successfully, this would be an indicator that these powers were being abused or that they are not fulfilling the functions the Garda suggested that they could fulfil.</P>
    <P>We are now putting our trust in the Garda force and accepting the view they have expressed that the provision of these powers will improve the detection rate, the investigation of crime and the conviction rate, and that persons who should be convicted and who have been involved in the committal of offences will be brought before the courts and successfully prosecuted. In this House we will be looking very carefully to see how these powers operate.  I will be very concerned if it emerges that far more people were detained under the provisions of the section than were successfully prosecuted through the courts.</P>
    <P>In the context of the safeguards provided it is fair to say many groups in the community have expressed general worries and concerns about the detention provisions.  Those groups are representative of a broad spectrum of Irish society. The Minister is to be commended for taking in tow the concerns expressed by many of these groups in the amendments he has tabled and in the amendments he has indicated he is willing to accept on Report Stage.  We in this House have done a good service by the manner in which we have dealt with this aspect of the legislation so far.  I disagree with the view expressed by some of the Garda representative bodies that by going through this legislative process we are dismantling the Bill in some way or providing a Bill which will not assist the Garda.  The general powers provided in this Bill will be of great assistance to the Garda and greatly reform the law in a number of ways.  The detention provisions, with the built in safeguards, are in the interests of the Garda force generally and should be of assistance to them.</P>
    <P>A number of groups have expressed the view that the use of the detention provisions could be counter productive in <Col N="1289" /> some sections of the community and, rather than improving community relations or assisting the Garda, could alienate sections of the community with whom the Garda should have greater contact in their role of community policing.  In exercising the powers of detention the Garda will have to be careful about the manner in which they exercise them in local communities.</P>
    <P>The Irish Commission for Justice and Peace very neatly expressed the concern I am expressing on 12 April 1984 when they issued a commentary on the Criminal Justice Bill as it stood at that stage with the amendments tabled.  They said it is not necessarily true that crime is most effectively pursued or that community support for the police is most in evidence in jurisdictions where police powers are greatest.  They said the rule of law can be undermined as much when the powers invoked to protect it are too great as when they are too few.  I hope the Garda will be cognisant of that in the manner in which they exercise and operate their powers under this section and in the context of the detention provisions.</P>
    <P>It is important that we do not see a development in parts of Dublin or Limerick or in particular sections of the community, where people are being detained for reasons which may appear to come within the ambit of the legislation, but which clearly do not, and in other sections of the country or in parts of Dublin or Limerick those powers are never exercised.  We must ensure that they are not used in a sense as a weapon to intimidate the poorer sections of the community.  It is in those areas that community policing and good Garda relations will achieve more than will be achieved by the operation of the detention provisions.</P>
    <P>As we go through sections 4 and 5 and other aspects of the Bill we will deal with other amendments and other proposals relating directly to the provisions of section 3.  We will be teasing out the original provisions and the amendments proposed.  In the context of the immediate impact of detention on local communities, something which is not dealt with in this Bill or in any amendment <Col N="1290" /> tabled, the Minister may wish to consider giving a formal statutory role to the juvenile liaison officers in the interests of young people who are detained by virtue of the operation of section 3.  The Minister has agreed to table an amendment on Report Stage to exclude from the possibility of detention children or young people under a particular age.  We have already debated whether that age should be children under 12, 14 or 15 years.  We will still have a group of young children between the ages of 14 and 17 years, or 15 and 17 years, or 12 and 17 years as Deputy Woods suggested, who may be detained under these sections.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a formal statutory role for the juvenile liaison officers.  They are more likely to be able to deal with the problems the operation of the detention sections could create within local communities in a delicate and understanding way than members of the Garda who have not worked in the area of the juvenile liaison officer scheme.  The time is long overdue when that scheme should have been given a statutory format and base.  The Minister cannot do that generally in this legislation.  I hope we will see it when we deal with the reform of juvenile law and children's law.  I would like to see it included specifically in this Bill and, if not in the Bill, I would like to see some role being given to the juvenile liaison officers in the context of the rules or regulations the Minister will introduce pursuant to the new section 6 which we debated earlier today.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that we will spend a further number of days debating this Bill. This has been a long day.  I expressed the view earlier that at some stages we were being repetitive.  I did not mean to offend any Deputy when I said that.  Perhaps it is better that we should be repetitive and give consideration to all aspects of the Bill before it becomes law, rather than to nod it through the House without adequate consideration.  I hope we can move on fairly quickly from dealing with section 3 in a general way and get down to the meat and the nitty gritty of sections 4 and 5 which we need to look at carefully and make further progress with the Bill this evening.</P>

      <P>We have a pluralist constituency whatever else may be said about the rest of Ireland.  One of my concerns about section 3 is that we have not had sufficient statistics or evidence to show that there was a need for such powers of detention.  All we can hope for is that in the five-year period after it passes through the House the evidence and statistics will be available to show if there was a need for this section and, more importantly, that there was not abuse of it.  I hope that not alone will we get statistics of the number of people detained and convicted but that during that time an effort will be made to find a better way to organise our legal system.  It is to be hoped that at the end of the five years we will have an opportunity to remove this legislation from the Statute Book rather than add to it.  There is a fear that when such legislation is introduced there is a tendency to prolong it.  History has not shown that we have been able to repeal such legislation as often as we should.  I would like to think that in the five years there will be a look at the area of penal and law reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fears have been expressed on behalf of vulnerable sections of young people who may not have had educational <Col N="1292" /> advantages.  I hope the section will not be used in an unfair manner against such people.  There is a fear that the thrust of section 3 will be used in this manner: &ldquo;if we cannot get somebody for one crime let us get him for another&rdquo;.  That is a genuine fear on behalf of those who feel that they are not competent to cope with the type of interrogation that may take place under the Bill.  We must do everything possible to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in this regard.  I welcome the decision not to detain children under these provisions.  It would have been horrendous had that happened but the 14 to 17 age group are vulnerable. We must ensure that they are protected and that the safeguards in the regulations are clearly defined for them.  It is not sufficient to rely on them reading complicated legal documents.  They should be made aware of the safeguards in simple language.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we have had a lengthy debate on this legislation because it indicates that Members have gone into the provisions dealt with so far in great detail.  While it may take days to get through this legislation here, we must bear in mind that if we do not introduce the proper safeguards some people will be detained in less luxurious surroundings than here.  I accept that the provisions of the section cannot be implemented until the Minister introduces the safeguards he has promised but I fear that once the section is passed there will be a pressure on us to pass the regulations although we may not be satisfied that the safeguards are solid enough.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that there will be a full debate on those regulations and that he will be free to hold up the operation of the section until Members are satisfied with regard to the safeguards.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Bill is being introduced in isolation.  I would have preferred to have seen it introduced as part of a package of reform.  For instance, gardaí have said that section 3 is necessary because they do not get enough convictions of real criminals.  However, our prisons are very overcrowded.  The law has come into disrepute in this regard.  Are there any <Col N="1293" /> plans for rehabilitation and training and not just for providing additional accommodation? We should not be clogging up or overcrowding prison buildings and not offering any hope for the future for the prisoners when they are released.  The area of community service orders must be taken in conjunction with the provisions of the Bill.  How will we manage with the outdated court procedures we operate and the long lists of delays?  We are all aware that people have to wait for trial for long periods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I must treat the section with the gravest of reservations. If I was an Independent Member at this stage of the proceedings I would be voting against the section because of the grave doubts I have about its operability. My view is that the reservations are based on the question of its workability or operability.  A tremendous amount of paperwork is involved in the operation of the section and that will increase its bureaucratic nature.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given a number of undertakings the most important of which is that he will introduce regulations and that he will examine the question of the presumption of innocence and children under 12 as suggested by the spokesman for Fianna Fáil, Deputy Woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A most important question is that of the Garda complaints tribunal.  We must await the Minister bringing that promise to the attention of the Dáil in due course. We are passing section 3, a most fundamental section to the Bill, <i>in vacuo.</i> I am not suggesting that the Minister is misleading the House in any way and we have a fail safe situation with the passage of the Bill through Report Stage when <Col N="1294" /> we will have an opportunity of reviewing the undertakings given on Committee Stage, by the Minister.  The Minister gave very serious undertakings in relation to the complaints tribunal, the regulations and their introduction, and a review of the age limit and how this section would affect children.  Deputy Barnes expressed concern about young people between the ages of 14 and 17.  It was not an unreasonable expression of concern on her part and I share it with her.  There is, admittedly, a five-year review when the Bill generally will be brought back into the House and we will have an opportunity at the end of that five-year term of seeing how the Bill operates.</P>
    <P>We should urge caution in the passage of this section from Committee Stage to Report Stage.  Perhaps we should give the section to the Minister.  Possibly Deputy Woods, spokesman on Justice for Fianna Fáil, has given the undertaking that the section be passed from Committee Stage to Report Stage but when it reaches Report Stage we should have a serious look at the section again, having regard to what undertakings the Minister will have discharged by that time.</P>
    <P>There may be a need for the section in the sense that undoubtedly there is an emergency, particularly in the city and county of Dublin, in relation to the whole question of law and disorder.  This section may deal with it, and I use the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; advisedly.  I have serious doubts about the operation of the section in relation to a reduction in the crime figures. One of the main reasons for the introduction of section 3 is to assist the Garda &mdash; and I hope it will do so &mdash; in the reduction of the ever-increasing crime figures.  On a number of occasions outside the House I have suggested that this and other sections will do very little if anything to reduce the crime tally.  I felt that only a major extension of the resources and manpower of the Garda technical department, for example, throughout the country would be sufficient to reverse that trend.  I also pointed out that it was crucial that there be more forensic investigation of serious crime.  I have mentioned also that prison accommodation at the moment is inadequate, <Col N="1295" /> as Deputies have pointed out.  Many criminals are being released without serving anything like their full sentences, yet this Bill enables the Garda to catch more criminals who it is intended will serve their sentences to completion.</P>
    <P>These are the difficulties in the operation of this section, which has been debated seriously.  Members on all sides of the House have discharged their obligations to the people who elected them and have done a good job in relation to the section itself.</P>
    <P>In support of my view that it is not so much sections of this nature that are required, but rather that the technical resources of the Garda should be increased, I mention that in the May edition of the <i>Garda News</i>, the general secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, Patrick Rogan, said on the Criminal Justice Bill that the difficulties of implementing the Bill had increased.  I do not want to take Mr. Rogan's statement out of context.  He said that at the end of the day the burden of implementing these procedures properly would rest almost completely on sergeants and inspectors and that the net effect of these provisions was that considerable extra resources would have to be made available for the effective operation of the Bill.  He said that this would entail the appointment of extra sergeants, additional clerical staff, improvements in accommodation, training in new procedures and installation of extra telephones.</P>

      <P>I was raising these points and relating them to section 3.  We have dealt adequately, however effectively, with the section.  It will create tremendous problems for the Garda <Col N="1296" /> Síochána.  We are told that the section is being introduced in ease and in aid of them to make their job less difficult.  I think it will make their job more difficult and we will have to place a tremendous burden of trust on the shoulders of the implementing gardaí.  We can do that without too much fear.  Nevertheless it will cause problems which are not envisaged at present but will occur when the section is brought into operation.  I am concerned also for the citizen.  If one person is brought in under this section and is in any way maltreated, which I hope will not happen, therefore the section is a bad section because it allows such a thing to happen.  I have the gravest of reservations about the section and at this stage I would vote against it, but having regard to the undertakings given by the Minister I think the section should be allowed to go on to Report Stage.  I urge the House when the section goes to Report Stage to take a very serious view of it.  By then we will have the undertakings given by the Minister before us and we can adjudicate the situation.</P>

      <P>My comments on the Bill are already on the record of the House section by section, and clause by clause under this section, but I want to raise two points which I had not the opportunity to raise because they did not arise on the amendments.  To some extent, particularly in relation to this section, we are putting the cart before the horse because we are leaving the questions of the independent tribunal and the regulations to a later stage.  I will not go over that ground.  I have already made that point and I do not want to develop it here.  I heard the Minister say that he would consider incorporating a section on Report Stage and that an automatic review would take place in four or five years.  On the last occasion we were talking about three or four years and I hope the Minister would come nearer to three years than to five years. Certainly I hope he will not depart from the original four years he mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put on record the views of the Association of Criminal Lawyers who <Col N="1297" /> sent a letter to Deputies dated 30 January 1984 enclosing a copy of a submission they made to the Minister for Justice.  On section 3 (1) the submission states:</P>
    <P>This section purports to increase the powers of detention for the Gardaí to cover any individual who is suspected of having committed an offence meriting five years or more in prison.  However on a literal interpretation it does not do so owing to the phrase &ldquo;for the which the sentence is fixed by Law&rdquo;. This can conceivably extend to any offence for which there is a sentence for instance careless driving, dangerous driving, drunken driving.  As such therefore it is badly drafted.</P>
    <P>If there is a drafting problem with section 3 (1)&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Regarding section 3 (3), Deputy Woods has suggested that the Minister's proposal with regard to a chief superintendent might be left with a superintendent. I appeal to the Minister to leave the section as it stands.  The provision is that a superintendent should be able to act for a chief superintendent if one is not available. I would prefer to leave it like that. The wording of the section is good in that regard and it would be going outside the general tenor of the debate to adopt the suggestion made by Deputy Woods.</P>

      <P>That will not prevent me from dealing in detail with this section. I do not regard our contributions to this debate as a waste of our time because we are here to go through legislation. <Col N="1298" /> Section 3 is one of the key sections of this Bill.  It is not the only important section which seriously restricts the freedoms and liberties of citizens.  Representations that have been made to me and other Deputies have concentrated to a large degree on this section.  The argument put forward for the right to detain &mdash; arrest and detention as opposed to arrest for charging &mdash; is that there is a crime emergency or crisis.  I would strongly argue that this is not the case.  People who have made the point that there is a crime emergency have not produced any evidence to back up their claim.  There has also been the argument that the Garda need the power to detain in order to improve their conviction rates.  There has been no serious debate as to how that conclusion was reached.</P>
      <P>I refer to a number of articles published in Garda publications.  Superintendent Tom O'Reilly from Store Street Garda Station published two articles in the <i>Garda Review</i> in January and February in which he compared crime rates in a number of countries including Ireland, the United States, Wales and New Zealand. We are often told our crime levels are at least as bad as those in the US but he showed that the US has fifteen times more crimes of rape per 1,000 of population than we have.  For criminal homicide, the official term for murder, the American figure is 12 times the Irish rate. The rate of burglaries is one-and-a-half times more in the US and the larceny figures are twice the figures in Ireland. Clearly those who claim that our crime figures are in line with figures in the United States are not sticking to the facts. Other figures were quoted for Wales and New Zealand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the argument that the Garda need powers of detention in order to reduce the level of crime because there is a crime emergency. Deputy Woods quoted figures which indicated that there was a decline in the rate of crime in this country last <Col N="1299" /> year and that the decline was continuing into this year.  We do not know why the decline is occurring because the reason for crime and the reason for the high level of crime against property as compared with crime against the person is not being analysed.  The Chair may feel I am wandering somewhat from the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you are wrong. We are talking about the restriction of a person's rights, a serious change in the law from the position where a garda has the right to arrest for the purpose of charging to a position where he or she will have the right to arrest for the purpose of detention for up to 20 hours so that the person arrested can be interrogated or forensic tests carried out.  That is a considerable change in the law.  I am trying to show that the demand for that change in the law is not based on any real argument which can be borne out by statistics. The argument cannot be sustained that there is a crime emergency or that detention will in any way reduce the rate of crime.</P>
      <P>I refer to a publication entitled <i>Innocent Until Proven Guilty</i> produced by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and written by Raymond Byrne, Thomas A. M. Cooney, J. Paul McCutcheon and Paul A. O'Connor, all of whom were involved with the law in some way.  They take up this question of the need for detention and I quote from page 27 of this booklet at the paragraph entitled &ldquo;On Arrest and Detention&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>The validity of the criticisms of the present law may be questioned.  The critics have suggested that the present law constitutes an obstacle to the business of law enforcement and conviction. However, the fact remains that suspects are interrogated and confessions and self-incriminating statements are made despite the alleged inhibiting features of the law.</P>
      <P>&mdash; that is, as it presently exists &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> Moreover, the critics have failed to acknowledge the extensive nature of the powers of arrest and detention conferred by section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  The offences to which the section applies cover the range of activities of professional and subversive criminals, of whom so much concern is expressed. Indeed, it could be surmised that, in as much as there is a failure to convict such criminals, that failure is not the product of inadequate police powers, but of inefficient police and prosecutorial practices.  The value of interrogation as an investigative device and of self-incriminating statements as evidence vital to the securing of convictions has been questioned recently.</P>
    <P>Here there is a note, No. 72, which is as follows:</P>
    <P>Baldwin &amp; McConville, Courts, Prosecution and Conviction (Oxford, 1981) pp. 126-158.</P>
    <P>The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>A definite conclusion cannot be drawn but the importance of a recent research is that it undermines the assumption that an increase in police powers is the panacea required to cure the perceived crime problem.</P>
    <P>That part of existing research claims that the increased police powers which are being sought in this House by many Deputies will not be the panacea which they believe it will be.  It must be frequently said that the evidence to date, taking arrests under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act as an example, shows that the conviction rate derived from such arrests would not lead anyone to believe that detention in itself will result in a greater conviction rate or a lessening of crime in some way.</P>
    <P>A question was put down by Deputy Mac Giolla for written reply on Tuesday, 6 December 1983 seeking information from the Minister for Justice for each year from 1972 to date of (a) the number of persons arrested under the Offences Against the State Act, (b) the number of persons charged under that Act and (c) the number convicted under that Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> The reply gave the details for each year from 1972 to that date of arrests under section 30.  However, the other information sought was stated to be not readily available and could only be provided by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time.  The figures given for arrests are interesting.  For 1972 the number arrested was 229; for 1973, 271; for 1974, 602 &mdash; an increase of over 300 in one year; for 1975, the figure went to 607 &mdash; an increase of five; for 1976, to 1,015 &mdash; an increase of almost 400; for 1977, to 1,144; for 1978, it dropped back to 912 &mdash; a drop of about 200; for 1979, it jumped again to 1,431 &mdash; an increase of over 400; for 1980, it jumped to 1,874 &mdash; an increase of over 400; for 1981, it went to 2,303 &mdash; an increase of almost 500; for 1982, it went to 2,308 and up to October 1983 there were 1,857 arrests.</P>
    <P>From the year 1972 to the year 1982 &mdash; I almost said the year 2000 &mdash; it went from 229 arrests to 2,308.  The reply indicated that the Garda did not have the time to ascertain how many people had been charged or convicted as a result of those arrests.  However, a document sent to me in the post from the Civil Rights Organisation &mdash; and I am sure that it was sent to other Deputies also &mdash; indicates that they did some research for the years 1981 and 1982.  For the year 1981, the figure was in the region of 230 out of 2,303 and for 1982 the number of those brought before the courts was 230 approximately out of 2,300.</P>
    <P>Less than 10 per cent of those arrested and detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act were brought before the courts.  We must assume that the other 90 per cent of the 2,300 people arrested in 1982 had not any or sufficient evidence against them to be brought before the courts.  The 48 hours detention, which is the power given under section 30, did not provide any of the evidence necessary to bring those people before the courts.  One must assume on that basis that those people were innocent. Based on our experience there are clearly no grounds to believe that the power of detention will improve in any significant way the detention rate or the <Col N="1302" /> conviction rate, although the Garda say that they need these to combat the high level of crime.</P>
    <P>The point must be made also that the Offences Against the State Act of itself is emergency legislation.  An interesting statistic, if you could call it that, relating to this question on detention under section 30 is that the Report on Crime in 1982 issued by the Garda Síochána Headquarters in July 1983 gives on page 16 the indictable offences which became known to the Garda during the year ended 31 December 1982 and in column 69, under the heading of breaches of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, there is not a single breach of that Act listed there for 1982.  Yet 2,030 people were arrested and detained under that section.</P>
    <P>I know that there are scheduled offences listed under the Offences Against the State Act and it is clear that those arrested under that section were subsequently charged under other Acts.  Legislation introduced to deal with an emergency &mdash; the title of the Act itself, &mdash; Offences Against the State Act, indicating the type of legislation which it is &mdash; is being used fairly freely to detain people who are suspected of crimes other than offences against the State.  That must be borne in mind when we are debating the giving of additional powers to the Garda, particularly when we are asked to wait until this Bill has gone through the House before we see sight of the regulations which will govern the type of detention which we are authorising and the type of independent complaints tribunal the Minister has promised us.</P>
    <P>He has also promised us that the section on detention will be amended to raise the age limit from seven, which is the age limit which applies at the moment, to some point.  We do not know yet to what point.  We sought to have an amendment accepted which would not affect any person under the age of 16.  If people over 16 are brought before the court and are found guilty they are sentenced to imprisonment or sent to St. Patrick's Institution.  The Minister has not yet clarified for us exactly what age he intends to have this Bill applied to.  It could be eight, nine, ten, 11 or 12.  Before <Col N="1303" /> Easter the Minister indicated he was thinking of something in the region of 12. The Fianna Fáil spokesman was anxious for 14 and we were anxious for 16.  Does anyone believe if the Minister comes back with an amendment to make it 12 years, that these detention sections and all the other sections we will be discussing in due course should apply to a child of 12½, 13 or 14 years?  I certainly would not like one of my children to be brought into a police station under this detention section.  I have a child under 16 years and I have one aged ten years, and even with all the guarantees the Minister has given and the spokesman for the Fianna Fáil Party requested today, I would not like to see one of my children go into a police station under that detention section.</P>
    <P>It is not only our feelings in relation to this matter that must be considered.  We have all had constituents contacting us about this Bill.  I will not go through all the incidents in detail but in the last few weeks three incidents have been brought to my attention.  All of them relate to my constituency where gardaí appeared to over-step the power they have.  All of the incidents have been referred to the Garda authorities and inquiries into them are taking place.</P>
    <P>I would like to relate one of them where a woman with a young girl of 14 years of age allowed her to go with a youth group in the area to a disco in town.  She went in at 11.30 to collect her daughter from the disco.  When she got there she discovered her daughter had just left and had gone home in the bus. She was stopped by two young men standing outside the disco whom she did not know and they delayed her.  She insisted she wanted to follow the bus because she did not want her daughter walking home alone from the terminus. One word followed another and she decided to go around to the station, which was only a few hundred yards away, to complain about the attitude of the two men, who it turned out were gardaí who produced their identification.</P>
    <P>She went into the station to complain about their attitude and she was told, to &ldquo;f-off&rdquo;.  That woman was then taken into <Col N="1304" /> the station and told she was arrested. They threatened her with a body search. I am not talking about frisking her.  I am talking about a situation where a bangharda proceeded to put rubber gloves on her hands and a very big garda &mdash; she said he was seven feet &mdash; proceeded to wind her arms up her back and forced her into a room to have her body searched.  Obviously that woman became hysterical.  She was subsequently charged with violent behaviour in the Garda station. She defended herself in court and the charge was thrown out.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of incident which leads me to feel that gardaí should not be given additional powers of detention.  That was a situation where a parent was looking after her child, who insisted she wanted to care for her child and she was doing the best for her trying to protect her. When she went to the Garda station to make a complaint about the way she had been treated by other gardaí she was abused, manhandled and subsequently charged arising out of a situation which was not of her making.  When her husband came to the station to find out where she was he was physically ejected from the station.  When he came back into the station and demanded why his wife was being detained he was physically ejected again from the station.  All of this has been made in a formal complaint to the Garda authorities.  I met the chief superintendent from the area when I brought the woman and her husband to see him. I am making the point very strongly that that is not an isolated incident.  I can give another few incidents of the same type.</P>
    <P>It is important when we are talking about giving any extra power to the Garda that we recognise that they are a fine body of men but they are no saints, they are people who have to deal with problems every day of the week and the nature of their job leads them to be aggressive.  We must ensure when we are passing legislation that in every single respect decent, honest citizens of this city or country do not end up being abused, mistreated and manhandled in any way.</P>
    <P>I feel that any time we spend here debating this particular section is of the utmost importance.  I very much regret <Col N="1305" /> that Deputy Woods, the Fianna Fáil spokesman, has taken the view that because it would appear that the majority on the Government side have accepted the Bill it is inevitable that it will go through and therefore, we must not oppose it, we will not press for votes on it or will not argue it out.  It is a deplorable situation that the largest party in the House should adopt that attitude.  I am not trying to make a political point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this serious and sensitive matter on the Adjournment. I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Kirk, and I understand that the Minister wishes to give some of his time to one of his colleagues. We have agreed to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a certain sense of regret that we have to seek time to raise on the Adjournment the occupation of the GAA grounds at Crossmaglen in 1984, the centenary year of the foundation of the GAA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> Since 1971 the St. Oliver Plunkett Park in Crossmaglen has been occupied by the British Army and since then they have refused to move from the grounds despite all the encouragement of the GAA and various other people who have made representations to the British Army and to the British Government.  The fact that GAA grounds are occupied by the British Army is absolutely reprehensible and anyone who is familiar with the circumstances in Crossmaglen will realise there is no need for the British Army to occupy the playing area there.</P>
    <P>Since 1971 it has been a history of confiscation, destruction and intimidation of the people in Crossmaglen, the members of Crossmaglen Rangers Club and players from other clubs who participate in matches played there.  The British Army moved in with Land Rovers and other army vehicles and they defaced 50 per cent of the playing area.  They did that at a time when the maximum damage would be done to the playing grounds.  In the process they succeeded in destroying the drainage system in the playing area of the GAA property.</P>
    <P>There have been robberies and attempts to burn the Rangers Hall which is in the area adjacent to the playing grounds and there has been continuous intimidation of players during matches. We had the example of one match where the Army moved in with rifles and intimidated one of the players participating in the match.  On another occasion a helicopter landed in the middle of the playing grounds while a match was in progress. That this should happen in Ireland to one of the greatest voluntary organisations in the world that has done so much to promote Irish games for the betterment of the culture and general well-being of the youth of the nation is totally deplorable.</P>
    <P>Tonight we call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use his office, his influence and his powers of persuasion on the British Army and on the British Government to remove immediately the occupying forces from the playing grounds of Crossmaglen.  Many people see the occupation of the grounds as an attempt to intimidate the people in that south Armagh village.  The troubles have gone <Col N="1307" /> on in the Six Counties for the past 15 years and Crossmaglen has been in the cockpit of much of those troubles.  The British Army consider it is necessary for them to have a base there but I do not believe that.  They have no right to be in Crossmaglen, or in any part of the Six Counties.  However, they are there and politicians in Dáil Éireann must encourage them at every opportunity to remove themselves from the grounds.</P>
    <P>This matter has been raised on many occasions but unfortunately the appeals made have fallen on deaf ears.  I hope that in this, the centenary year of the foundation of the GAA, the British Government in a gesture of goodwill to the Irish people will ask the British Army to remove themselves from the grounds in Crossmaglen.  It would be a gesture that would do much for the relations between the two Governments and it would be much appreciated by the GAA authorities and by the Crossmaglen Rangers.  The British Army should not have been there in the first place but if they remove themselves it would do much to defuse the feeling of resentment with regard to the presence of the army in the village and on the playing grounds.</P>
    <P>Crossmaglen Rangers Football Club is a long established club.  It has been there virtually since the foundation of the GAA.  It is in an area that may not be as well endowed economically as many other parts of the country.  The raising of funds to provide the fine premises they have, the hall and the changing facilities does great credit to the committees who have been in charge of the affairs of the club.  It is a source of great annoyance to them to find that these facilities cannot be utilised properly and made available to the people of the area.  The British Army can drive in at will and knock down entrance gates and boundary walls.  Their right to do that can never be questioned. They claim to have a special powers vesting order but there have been many occasions where they have gone beyond the legality of that vesting order.  The question of compensation for the damage done has not been brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> I do not wish to develop the debate any further as three other Members wish to speak and I shall leave them to cover the various aspects of the matter.  I appeal to the Minister tonight to use his good offices to get the British Army out of Crossmaglen as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Border Deputy I wish to add my voice to that of my constituency colleague, Deputy Kirk, in deploring the occupation of the Crossmaglen Rangers Football Club.  As we all unhappily know, Crossmaglen is an extremely sensitive area.  I find it almost impossible to believe that the British should be so insensitive as to occupy the central area for leisure activity such as is the Crossmaglen Rangers Gaelic Football Club.  Crossmaglen club has a tremendous history and, in more recent years, more often than not their members have been County Armagh football champions.  In an area, where almost everybody in the town and surrounding hinterland has been alienated, it is incredible that the British Authorities do not recognise that fact.  I would add my voice to that of Deputy Kirk in urging the Minister for Foreign Affairs to do what I know he has been doing at regular intervals, that is his utmost to get the British Army to vacate those grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say also that this is not a new phenomenon, or something that has occurred in the last 20 months during the term of office of the present Government. Crossmaglen Rangers' grounds have been occupied for at least ten years. In those ten years no Irish Government have been successful in their efforts to get the British Army to vacate them.  I might allude to the recent statement by Mr. Paddy Buggy, the outgoing President of the GAA, and indeed congratulate him on his great courage in suggesting that the GAA should open their doors for admission to RUC men.  That is a tremendous example of political courage. The time is ripe for some kind of reciprocal gesture on the part of the British Authorities.  I can think of no better way in which to illustrate some kind of goodwill than by the British Army vacating the Crossmaglen football grounds.  I say <Col N="1309" /> this with absolute certainty: the British Army, for one reason or another, have alienated everybody in the Crossmaglen area, indeed in the Border area generally. I have no doubt that, through this insensitive action, probably they have driven hundreds of young people into the evil arms of the IRA.</P>
    <P>The time is long overdue for the British Government to recognise how insensitive was their occupancy of those grounds and that they should vacate them immediately. I have no doubt that the Minister present has made repeated efforts &mdash; he has told me so many times before in private conversations.  In this, the centenary year of the GAA, I would urge him to continue his efforts to have those grounds vacated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very sensitive, serious matter.  The fact that there are four people in the House from three different provinces speaking on the subject is a clear indication of the interest taken by eminent and former members of the GAA, in their capacity as players and officials of the association.</P>
      <P>The first point with which I should like to deal is that made by Deputy McGahon &mdash; I understand he was expressing a personal viewpoint &mdash; when he referred to the statement of the outgoing President of the GAA in which, according to Deputy McGahon, he suggested that the association should open its membership to members of the RUC.  That would be a matter for the association.  The point I should like to make to Deputy McGahon is that when an appropriate climate or opportunity is provided for the association to expand, develop and play their games in an open, free, democratic situation then, and only then, can it be considered appropriate for any member of an alien army to become a member of a national Gaelic, 32-county organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Oliver Plunkett Park is the only available recreational area in Crossmaglen in County Armagh.  Within the GAA it is one of three county grounds, the primary grounds within the county. These grounds and indeed the clubhouse and social centre on those grounds were <Col N="1310" /> built by the members themselves and the facilities there were provided without any Government or local authority aid.  Since 1971 the British Army have occupied a number of areas of the property and have caused considerable damage thereto.  In recent years a number of small areas have been returned to the club but at present two portions of the property are still retained by the British Army.  The right of way &mdash; taken under a requisition order in 1976 &mdash; and also a corner of the field, now enclosed within the Army base, has meant that the loss of both those areas has resulted in serious disruption for the club and its members.  The right of way, while unspecified in width, was indicated on a map accompanying the requisition order, to include one of the two entrances to St. Oliver Plunkett Park and extending to the rere of the Army base.  However, without amending the requisition order, the right of way has been extended by the British Army to include both entrances to the park and covers all of the access to the hall and playingfield.  Each time the club committee have erected gates on either of the entrances to enclose the property the British Army have removed those gates and, on a number of occasions, parts of the boundary wall.  Indeed recently they removed part of that wall between both the entrances.  As a consequence the entire area has been reduced virtually to a commons, a roaming area for stray animals and so on.  No serious repairs can be carried out and no major improvements undertaken on the grounds or property while the present situation obtains.</P>
    <P>Successive Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland have stated that they have no wish or intention to disrupt the satisfactory running of this club.  Mr. Roy Mason, MP, when Secretary of State, assured the GAA that the right of way would be used only for emergencies, for example, when the base would be under attack, which has not as yet happened in Crossmaglen.  Mr. Humphrey Atkins, MP, when Secretary of State, informed the GAA that the right of way was required to enable large lorries carrying building materials to get to the rere of the base.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The building work on the Army base has been concluded since 1975.  Therefore there is no reason whatsoever that this right of way should be required by the British Army.  In the past seven years there have been two minor attacks near the base.  The GAA had been assured by the British Army that, when the building work was completed, there would be little or no use for the right of way.  There are already two entrances available to the Army on the Culloville Road.  If an entrance to the rere of the base was ever justified at all times a more suitable entrance was available to the Army, namely, the vacant site of Crossmaglen Technical School, owned by the Ministery of Education and which has been derelict for the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>Therefore the situation is that there has been utter provocation of the nationalist people in Crossmaglen and in the South Armagh area since 1971.  The British Government through their army, have confiscated the property &mdash; they have destroyed it &mdash; and even the perimeter fence around the grounds has been destroyed by them.  Helicopters have landed in the field during games, preventing their completion.  There has been an amount of wanton damage done to the existing clubhouse and property, due basically to the fact that helicopters fly in at very low levels over the building.  As a result of constant vibration the whole structure is threatened and is constantly cracking at one end of the clubhouse.</P>
      <P>Negotiations have taken place with various officials of the Northern Ireland Office, and indeed with people in London, over a long period.  Any time that any amount of progress has been seen to be made those officials have been removed from the positions they held and placed in some other section of the Northern Ireland Office, no longer being available to the GAA or their legal advisers in order to conclude negotiations. Consequently utter confusion reigns and no progress has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, as yet neither the <Col N="1312" /> Minister nor his Minister of State has visited Crossmaglen.  With my colleague, Deputy Kirk, and Senator Rory Kiely from Limerick I visited the Crossmaglen grounds when we saw for ourselves the situation obtaining there.  Not alone did we see the damage and destruction done but, while there, we saw the British Army enter the grounds, carry out manoeuvres around the grounds, enter through the perimeter fence at places where they had already used wire cutters to cut holes in the fence rather than use the adequate number of gates available to them.</P>
    <P>It is time that the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his Minister of State visited Crossmaglen to see the situation at first hand.  We want the Minister to ensure that the British Army are removed from the ground and that they declare their intent to do so now.  We want the British Government to pay compensation to the Crossmaglen club to cover the damage and destruction done to the ground, for the confiscated property which is within the Army base and for the inconvenience caused to members in their efforts to visit the ground.  In the centenary year of the GAA and Olympics year, this is the only sports ground in the world where members are prevented from using their own facilities.</P>
    <P>There has been political procrastination by the Northern Ireland Office and the British Government since 1971.  Mental and physical violence have been imposed on the nationalist people in Crossmaglen.  The British Army have put up road blocks at various points and have prevented games from being played to a finish.  They have also prevented people from getting to Mass on time.  The Army are supposed to be there in a peace-keeping role but they are trying to create conflict so that they can justify their offensive activities among the people of Crossmaglen and the South Armagh area.  In this historic year, when the New Ireland Forum have published their report, new initiatives should now be taken.  In view of the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be having discussions with the British Government regarding the Forum, I hope that one of his priorities will be to seek the removal <Col N="1313" /> of the British Army from the Crossmaglen grounds.  It is time that they did so. It is part of the intransigent situation which has prevailed in Northern Ireland for many years.  I hope that an effort can be made, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government, to get a breakthrough for the people of Crossmaglen and that the British Government will remove their alien administration and Army from the North of this island.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this matter.  I am sorry that the concentration on this problem by this and the other House has taken place over a relatively short period of time.  There was an Adjournment Debate in the Seanad last week, there was an extensive Question Time today here on the question of Crossmaglen GAA pitch and now we have this Adjournment Debate.  We need a more sustained period of interest over a longer time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies have rightly said, this serious aggravation of a very honourable GAA club in Crossmaglen has been taking place since the early seventies.  There is no doubt that the GAA Club in Crossmaglen has been, to put it as its very mildest, seriously inconvenienced by the manner in which the British Army have been using their grounds to get access to their barracks in Crossmaglen.  Many people in the area think that this aggravation is unnecessary and that the use of the grounds as an access route is not warranted.  It has been said that the British Army should remove their presence in the centenary year of the GAA.  I do not see what that has to do with the case. They should remove their presence, whether it is in the 90th or the 101st year of the GAA.  That is not a relevant argument. There have been five or six Governments and seven or eight Ministers for Foreign Affairs since this problem started and, as the Minister of State for my Department said when he was answering questions here today, it is not customary to list the number of representations or approaches which have <Col N="1314" /> been made in this regard.  However, in 30 or 50 years' time, whenever the records of this period will be made known, it will be seen that nobody has been more active in this regard than I have been during the last 18 months.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will outline his Department's policy on the use of public refuse incineration as an alternative energy source; if he will ask the ESB to undertake a feasibility study on this matter with a view to reducing our dependency on oil and the allocation to that body of responsibility for the development of policy in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am very interested in the development of <Col N="1139" /> refuse incineration.  Several feasibility studies have been conducted for various local authorities.  My Department partly funded one such study for the Bray district, the report of which will be made available to bodies with a genuine interest in setting up an incineration scheme. The ESB have been involved in some of these studies, but are not at present responsible for policy formulation.  I do not intend to change this situation, nor do I, at the moment, see any necessity for further studies.</P>
      <P>I understand that the quality of heat from refuse is such that using it for electricity generation may be difficult, with the result that refuse incineration is usually associated with district heating. Refuse incineration/district heating schemes are widespread in other countries, particularly in continental Europe. In these countries there is usually a network of existing district heating schemes, which is not the case in Ireland.  Any Irish scheme, therefore, would entail the laying of new, heavily insulated, flow and return pipelines, which is a heavy burden on the economics of the scheme.  Another consideration is that the areas most suited for refuse incineration/district heating are often also those most attractive for expansion of the natural gas network, in which the State has already invested heavily.  For these reasons, the economics of individual schemes are primarily determined by local rather than national considerations.  My general policy is to encourage refuse incineration, where it is shown to be economic.  However, my understanding is that in those countries where refuse incineration schemes are economically viable, the saving of the alternative cost of disposal of the refuse is a significant contribution to this financial success.  It appears that normal refuse disposal costs are significantly more expensive in many countries than they are in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have consistently and actively emphasised, at all levels in the European Community, the central and compelling importance of responding effectively to the current unemployment crisis, especially among young people.  In pursuit of this, the Government have been pressing strongly for a significant increase in the resources allocated to the Structural Funds, which are, of course, of particular importance to the less-developed countries and regions of the Community.  There is now agreement in principle among our partners that such funding should be made available and it is hoped, therefore, that these funds will begin to play a more significant role in the Community, once new own resources become available, as envisaged, in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The text on the objectives of the Structural funds, which was before the March European Council and on which there was general agreement in principle, stated that the European Council considered that these funds should become &ldquo;effective Community policy instruments&rdquo; aimed, <i>inter alia</i>, at &ldquo;combating unemployment, in particular youth unemployment&rdquo;.  Under the Structural Funds, there is, of course, a range of support for, and assistance to, Ireland <Col N="1141" /> which helps in maintaining employment and reducing unemployment here, either directly or indirectly.  The Government have insured that the maximum return is achieved from these funds under their existing regulations.  Secondly, the Government have been insistent that under any review of these and other policies, such as the current review of the Regional Fund, the particular interests of Ireland, especially given our relative underdevelopment and our high level of unemployment, should be appropriately taken into account and responded to.  I believe that on any objective basis the Government have been successful in their efforts.  A recent example, which will help to maintain employment in and further the development of the dairy sector of the economy, was the particular concession made to Ireland in the super-levy negotiations.</P>
    <P>The wide range of support which we receive from existing Community policies is set out in the six-monthly Report on Developments in the European Communities which is produced by my Department and is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Deputy can rest assured that the Government are committed to maintaining and developing this support, especially in the areas of unemployment and new policies, while achieving the creation and development of new strategies which will respond relevantly and effectively to the particular problems which confront the Community, and in particular its less-developed member states, such as Ireland.</P>

      <P>There are no grants available to local authorities from my Department for the installation of refuse incineration equipment.  Any proposal to provide for refuse incineration would be a matter in the first instance for the local authority concerned.  However, I am advised that incineration costs can be up to seven times as great as disposal by landfill and that the economics of heat recovery are extremely marginal even in densely populated areas.  In this respect, the Danish situation is not quite comparable to ours in that district heating systems existed in urban areas before refuse incineration linked to such systems was introduced.  I understand that the Department of Energy keeps under review the general question of using waste as an energy source and my Department maintains contact with that Department in this matter.</P>

      <P>Decentralisation is a term often used to describe the transfer of certain offices to areas outside of Dublin.  This programme is a matter for Government who decided, in connection with the 1983 budget, that because of cost factors it should be cancelled.  This decision was announced by the Minister for Finance, in his 1983 budget speech.</P>
      <P>The responsibility of the Minister for the Public Service in such a programme would extend only to the determination of appropriate numbers, and arranging for the transfer, of staff to the centres concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in making payment <Col N="1147" /> in this case is due to a defect in sections 56 and 57 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  Those sections did not give full effect to the clear intention that all claims and court proceedings which related to the operation of the national postal and telecommunications services before 1 January and which were not settled by that date would be dealt with by An Post or Bord Telecom Éireann, as appropriate, from 1 January 1984 on the reorganisation of those services.  As worded, those sections covered claims etc, to which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs only was a party but not claims etc. to which the State or the Minister for Finance was a party.</P>
      <P>That defect will be corrected on enactment of the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Bill, 1984, which was circulated to Deputies on 5 April 1984.  Arrangements will be made for payment to be made in this case and in other cases as soon as the Bill is enacted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The method of paying the various social welfare benefits varies from scheme to scheme and is largely determined by the nature of the payment involved.  In the case of long-term benefits, such as pensions and children's allowance, where the periods of entitlement can be established well in advance, books of vouchers cashable at post offices are issued to recipients.  Some 362,000 pensioners and 454,000 families on children's allowances are paid by this method.  Payments to 82,000 unemployed persons living more than 6 miles from their local unemployment office are also made at post offices.</P>
      <P>An Post, through its country-wide network of post offices, provides a very acceptable level of service to social welfare recipients which, it is considered, would not necessarily be provided by a cheque payment system.  The possession of a pension book provides pensioners with a sense of continuity and security which a cheque system might lack.</P>
      <P>The changeover to a system of complete payment by cheque would not necessarily, therefore, be to the advantage of social welfare beneficiaries.  Apart from this it would require fundamental administrative changes and an input of resources that would have significant cost implications and would not be feasible in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administration of the Department's services is continually under review with a view to its improvement to <Col N="1160" /> the advantage of beneficiaries by the use of modern technology and administrative methods.  The method of payment of benefits receives special attention in this respect.</P>
    <P>While the problem of security at post offices is primarily a matter for An Post, it is understood that considerable progress has been made in reducing losses due to robberies at post offices.  Security arrangements are regularly reviewed and improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am informed by the Garda authorities that, following consultation with the local Garda officers, they consider that the provision of a Garda station in the Cherry Orchard area would not be warranted at present and that the current arrangement whereby the area is served from Ballyfermot station makes the best use of Garda resources.  Apart from any other consideration, the provision of a separate station at Cherry Orchard would absorb additional Garda manpower on station manning duties, thus reducing the number of members available for outdoor patrol duty which is most important in the prevention and detection of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities state that foot and mobile patrols from Ballyfermot station are operated to the maximum extent possible in the Cherry Orchard area and that the opening of the new station at Ronanstown earlier this year has enabled an improved Garda service to be provided in the Ballyfermot Garda district generally.  They propose to assign an additional Garda to Ballyfermot station from the next group of recruit gardaí who <Col N="1167" /> are due to complete their training on 7 June and to keep the policing arrangements for Cherry Orchard and the other areas served from the station under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation for the Employment Incentive Scheme in 1984 is £3 million.  An evaluation of the operation of the scheme was carried out recently.  As a result I introduced a number of changes expanding and improving the effectiveness of the scheme with effect from 30 April 1984.  In brief the principal changes are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the scope of the scheme has been expanded to include all sectors (except the public sector and financial activities) as against agriculture and manufacturing industry before 30 April 1984;</P>
      <P>&mdash;non-commercial as well as commercial activities are now included;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the restriction on newly established businesses has been removed;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the £25 premium has been increased to £30 and the £45 premium payable in respect of the long-term unemployed has been increased to £60;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the qualifying period of unemployment is now 13 weeks for the £30 premium and 52 weeks for the £60 premium;</P>
      <P>&mdash;in order to encourage permanent employment, premiums will not be paid in respect of employment which does not last for 24 weeks;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the local offices of the National Manpower Service are now more closely involved in the operation of the scheme and are responsible for approving applications by employers to participate;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;an employer may receive premiums in respect of not more than two jobs in the period 30 April 1984 to 31 December 1984.  This restriction is intended to increase the cost effectiveness of the scheme by directing it towards smaller operations.  The evaluation study to which I have <Col N="1172" /> referred showed that the incentive offered by the scheme was most effective in encouraging additional recruitment in small firms. </P>
    <P>The operation of the scheme has been amended to provide for the making of a single payment to an employer at the end of 24 weeks employment of an eligible worker.  As a result only a small proportion of the premiums in respect of recruitments in the second half of 1984 will fall to be paid this year.</P>
