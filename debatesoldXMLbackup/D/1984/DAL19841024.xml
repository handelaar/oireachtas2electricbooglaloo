      <P>Last week I put down a Private Notice Question to the Minister for Communications regarding the provision of a car ferry service from Wales to Cork for the coming tourist season and my question was disallowed.  Yesterday I put down a similiar question to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and <Col N="220" /> Tourism which was also disallowed.

    <Title>Land Bill, 1984 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The owner occupier system of land tenure is as deep rooted in our society as our Christian beliefs. This Bill is a first step, perhaps a small step, to change that serious attachment to land ownership.  I do not think we can afford to condone such a rigid and inflexible system of land ownership without making some attempt to create a greater level of mobility.  That mobility would ensure a greater level of resource utilisation which this Bill is all about.  If it does nothing else but soften the attitudes which attach to the unwarranted status of the mere possession and ownership of land, then this Bill will be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated, and will continue to <Col N="224" /> be stated, that agricultural land is Ireland's major natural resource.  One could go so far as to say that Ireland is unique among her European partners as regards the extent to which her economy depends on agriculture.  As long as a considerable proportion of the country's land resources remain under-utilised and unproductive, then agriculture is not making the contribution it could and should make to the development of our economy.  It was mentioned here last evening, and it has been mentioned time and time again, that we import £800 million of agricultural products almost every year and that figure is increasing.  We have the capacity to produce most of these products.  This would provide extra jobs and there would be a great saving to the Exchequer.  Admittedly, we could not produce some of our imported products. People might say that because of the difficulty in marketing the surplus agricultural products which we already have, there is no point in trying to bring further agricultural land into production.  That is a defeatist approach and we should not even contemplate it.  The French, the Dutch and the Danes do not have the same climatic advantages we have but we have not applied ourselves to this problem as much as we should and until we do we will continue to have a deficit in our balance of payments, a high external debt and a large number unemployed.</P>
    <P>This Bill prepares the way for improved land utilisation and productivity through a leasing system.  The rigidity inherent in the system of owner occupancy can be lessened and a new and welcome form of land mobility achieved. I am looking forward to that, and so are the many people who never had control over their land for the following four or five years.  They are at present operating under the conacre system which is not in the best interest of the person renting the land or the person leasing the land nor is it to the benefit of land management and land use.</P>
    <P>Leasing can provide land for young people without a major initial investment. In other words, having to pay 16 per cent to the lending agencies for the <Col N="225" /> initial investment is a severe impediment to buying land.  Some people bought land when it was high in price, and because of the change in the market, the change in the demand for products, the increase in input prices and the lessening of productivity, they could not repay their loans. This brought down the price of land, which is not a bad thing.  The advantages of young people owning land cannot be over-estimated.  They will focus new ideas on land use.  These people, equipped with modern knowledge, skills and training, can achieve a new level of agricultural resourcefulness.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary to protect the lessor from being cheated out of his land under the present legislation in the event of somebody wanting to lease his land beyond the 11 month system.  The Minister has carefully examined the old Land Acts and they will be repealed under this Bill.  Under existing legislation the tenant is more than favourably protected. Accordingly, any inhibiting factors in respect to leasing must be removed so that this form of land use can be attractive to the present owner.  Under no circumstances do people who own land want to find themselves in a situation where five years hence they cannot recover their land.  That is their fear.  The Minister has made it clear in section 3 of this Bill that all the relevant sections of old Land Acts will be repealed.  Perhaps we will have an opportunity of discussing these further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>What are the advantages to the lessor under the leasing system, which we hope will be successful and be supported by Deputies on both sides of the House? The existing conacre system leads to the exploitation of land.  Nothing is put back into the land because a farmer rents the land for 11 months in anticipation of getting a good crop, and that is that, unless there is a possibility of getting the land the following year.  That type of arrangement exists between farmers.  The conacre system is ongoing.  It would be better if the leasing system were tied up for four, five, six or ten years.  The lessor has a guaranteed income and the assurance <Col N="226" /> that the land reverts to the owner after the expiry of the lease.  I would not promote this Bill without that assurance. It is vitally important that we give that guarantee to anybody wishing to lease land.</P>
    <P>The Bill and the scheme is designed to get at the older farmer whose land is under-utilised.  There is much land in the country that is under-utilised, even in my own county.  Much of it is half-stocked or quarter-stocked.  The system of taxation on the accounting basis is an inhibiting factor.  There is no great incentive to farmers to produce over and above what is necessary to ensure a reasonable subsistence level for themselves.  Farming is a high investment industry.  I am glad that the system of taxation has been changed in relation to land or at least a different principle of taxation is mooted to be introduced.  I am confident that system will be an effective one in time.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement regard it as a confidence trick perpetrated on the PAYE sector but nothing could be further from the truth.  They should make some attempt to understand the investment in farming, the high risk nature of the industry and particularly the high input costs.  If they realised that every year the returns are lower and lower they might understand the situation better. We do not want to crucify the innovative and energetic farmers who manage their land efficiently.  I am glad the system of taxation is being changed.  I realise that the adjusted acreage concept is something new for many people outside farming but it is not new to farmers.  The old PLV system was found objectionable because of the great variation applied to land throughout the country.  Some land with a low PLV was much better in quality than land with a higher PLV.  The system was unfair and it is gone now. Perhaps the new system can be modified, changed and made more effective as the years go on.  We must see how it works.</P>
    <P>The person who leases the land will benefit under the Bill.  He will have no major investment in the short term.  He can plan his farm policy over a period; he can know what he will do with the <Col N="227" /> land and what improvements he can make over a period.  We want to give more opportunities to young people.  Too few of them are getting their hands on land and when they get it it is too late. They are subject to their parents for too long.  The parents will not release the land to them until they are reasonably assured of some income for themselves. The retirement scheme was a complete failure.  It was unattractive and only 39 people availed of the scheme in five years. There was no point in having personnel to administer a scheme that was bringing benefit to so few people and, consequently, the Government dropped the scheme.</P>
    <P>The leasing system will help the young people.  They will bring to the job new verve and energy and an overall view of agriculture in line with their training, education and with developments taking place in farming.  Employment will benefit also.  For many years thousands of farmers' sons have left the land.  They have done this because they have no control over the situation and they have not sufficient income to plan their lives.  In Ireland many farmers do not marry until they are in their forties or later and that is because they had no property but I hope the situation will change.  They may say they will have no security of tenure but they will have as much security of tenure as anyone in industry or in other occupations.</P>
    <P>The lease models that have been thought out by the IFA, the Incorporated Law Society and the Allied Irish Bank have been found to be extremely well suited for this type of scheme.  There is no problem here.  Yesterday evening I was grateful to Deputy Sheehan for the statistical data he placed before us in relation to land leasing in EC countries. We were a dismal last as far as leasing was concerned.  In the United Kingdom the figure was as high as 47 per cent or 48 per cent and in Germany where there is also a great demand for land the figure was considerably in excess of 20 per cent. Italy was one of the lowest with 18 per cent.  Perhaps there is a similarity <Col N="228" /> between our two countries.  There is an over-rigid, inflexible attachment to land that we must try to break down.</P>
    <P>I thought the Opposition spokesman on agriculture was over-critical of the Bill.  I could not go along with that kind of destructive criticism but perhaps this was not intentional.  To be fair to the Deputy, he mentioned that there was a lack of financial incentive in the Bill to achieve the desired result regarding mobility of land and to some extent I would go along with that.  He mentioned the White Paper on land policy which Fianna Fáil issued in December 1980. There were some important points in that paper and if these measures had been implemented perhaps there would be a more fair distribution of land.  There is no guarantee under the leasing system that the better organised farmer will not lease a lot of land.  That is a possibility and we cannot protect anybody against that.  However, there are incentives in the recent national plan in relation to certain incentives such as tax concessions for young people.</P>
    <P>With regard to land policy in the White Paper, it was stated that there should be a surcharge to provide assistance to smallholders in the sale of land.  That would be very difficult to operate and it might be regarded as unconstitutional.  There was also the point about an upper limit on land acquisition.  We would love to see land in the hands of farmers who would work it full time.  There is an anomaly here in that people who grew up on the land, who left it for one reason or another and who now wish to get back to the land again cannot do so under existing legislation because they are prevented from buying land.  I disagree with that.  I hope it will be looked at again at some stage.  There should be some way in which such people could get back to working full time on the land.  This leasing Bill provides for that and that is another advantage it has.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of the updated retirement scheme mentioned in the White Paper.  I hope that before long we will have a proper, well thought out, advantageous <Col N="229" /> retirement scheme for farmers.  No section of the community is more entitled to protection in their old age arising from their input and their contribution to agriculture. The compulsory powers of the Land Commission were removed.  The Land Commission were an exceptionally effective instrument in achieving worthwhile mobility of land.  They brought about many improvements in the land structure in my own county.  Not everybody would agree with everything they did.  Were it not for political interference of a very serious nature, the Land Commission could have worked most effectively.</P>
    <P>I had many consultations with various personnel in the Land Commission.  They are well up in their knowledge of the land scene.  They try to achieve a measure of fairness and equity in the proposals they put forward.  They were not always accepted because it was politically inopportune for Ministers in the past to agree to their proposals.  I saw people getting land &mdash; and I am sure Deputies on the other side of the House saw this &mdash; who were not entitled to get it.  It was totally under-utilised and within a few years they sold it for housing sites, and so on.  Much of the land which was available for purchase is no longer available.  The Land Commission have land.  Where there was no title to the land they purchased it, and they were able to achieve title.  That was a very important development.  They registered the land properly and we are greatly indebted to them for that.</P>
    <P>As we knew it, the Land Commission no longer exists.  The personnel and the legislation are there.  Somebody else will operate in a different way.  The same legal constraints still apply to the purchase and sale of land.  Compulsory acquisition is gone and perhaps that is not a bad thing. No one likes to acquire land compulsorily. There are other ways and means of getting people to release their land. Leasing is one way in which that can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I should like to give a few facts and figures which further justify the introduction of this land leasing scheme.  I hope it will ensure a greater level of flexibility <Col N="230" /> and mobility than we have.  We are very far down in the European league in that regard.  I take it that the figures given to us by Deputy Sheehan were accurate.  I understand 61 per cent of all our farmers have less than 50 acres; 25 per cent are over 65 years of age compared to the European average of 6 per cent.  That is a big difference.</P>
    <P>Thirty-five per cent of the land is owned by farmers without direct heirs; 85 per cent have no education beyond the national school.  That does not mean they are not intelligent, enterprising farmers, but it points to the need for a shift towards a younger, more viable, better educated farmer.  A very small figure, 2 per cent, have been to agricultural colleges.  I hope some change can be made in that regard. Somewhere between 3½ per cent and 6 per cent of our land changes hands each year and 80 per cent of this is through gift or inheritance.  This exposes the difficulty the Minister is facing in trying to ensure the success of his new scheme.  I wish him every success and I will work with him to promote it.</P>
    <P>To tackle this problem is by no means an easy task.  Deep rooted problems of an historical origin will only be tinkered with to some extent by this Bill.  I hope the Minister does not mind me saying that.  There is a lot of work to be done and perhaps as we observe its progression and development, we will be able to make changes and modifications.  At least this is a start.  I had hoped for a more imaginative approach with a greater financial incentive to achieve the much needed level of land mobility.  We are living in difficult times.  The Minister appreciates the fact that he got support from all of us who are concerned about the level of land mobility.  We must try to bring pressure to bear on the powers that be to provide these incentives rather than being critical of the lack of incentives.</P>
    <P>In the national economic and social plan <i>Building on Reality</i> specific recognition was given to a special tax concession for young farmers leasing land.  The specifics of that recognition need further elaboration and clarification and I hope <Col N="231" /> that, when the Minister of State is replying, he will advert to that.  I have already mentioned income tax and the new concept of the adjustable acreage.  This needs clarification in relation to the leasing of land.  If 70 adjustable acres are leased who is responsible?  Is it the person who leases the 70 adjustable acres?  Will he have to pay or the person who leased the land and will the income accruing be subject to taxation also?  These matters will have to be clarified to ensure the success of this operation.</P>
    <P>The super-levy was mentioned yesterday evening.  I was very disappointed that 58,000 or 59,000 tonnes of milk went astray some place because of statistical bungling.  The farmers I represent are extremely concerned about the fact that that will take money out of their pockets. I hope Deputies on all sides of the House will lend their support&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The quota system is operating rather unfairly.  It does not permit a young man coming into farming to take advantage of the levies.  If he produces milk for the first time he is subject to the full impact of the levy. That is a serious disincentive to becoming involved in leasing and has to be clarified. There must be some method by which a concession could be afforded to a young farmer who wanted to become involved in dairying for the first time.  The quota system should operate to his advantage to provide a further incentive for land leasing.  There may not be a need for <Col N="232" /> direct financial incentives and the other type of incentive would be far more effective. It would enable young people to plan over a five year period to produce milk and get a reasonable price for it.</P>
      <P>I do not know how much land is available for leasing.  Figures like 1,000,000 acres and 3,500,000 acres have been bandied around.  The more we have the better chance we have of success.  Each year the conacre system is effective to the tune of about 1 million acres.  Because of the longer period of leasing, various safeguards would have to be built into the scheme.  The farmer leasing land on an annual basis takes account of the market situation and there must be a periodic review of leasing in relation to rent.  That is a matter for the farmers, for the lessors and lessees in drawing up the contract.  The leasing system will not eliminate the need for land for the landless youth.  Quite a number of young people will never be able to operate and work the land and use their knowledge and training.</P>
      <P>Leasing is a novel concept.  It needs promotion.  Without the goodwill of every section and of the different organisations and all political parties it will not be a success.  Some think that there is the inherent danger that we are going back to the days of Irish landlordism to which I referred briefly yesterday.  That thinking is retrograde and would kill this scheme overnight.  It would be a great tragedy if that were to happen.  The members of the Opposition never had the courage to come forward with legislation of this nature.  They were critical, but Deputy Joe Walsh was the least critical.  He is a very knowledgable man and understands the agricultural scene better than most Deputies.  The attitude of the Opposition is one of wait and see how it goes, that they will be on the right side of the fence and will be able to criticise it if it does not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan, encountering that approach, said &ldquo;It is better to light a match than to curse the darkness&rdquo;.  That sums up the thinking behind this Bill.  It is a first attempt.  On Committee Stage, I shall be asking about various sections <Col N="233" /> of the Bill.  Sections 70 and 71 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act of 1860, are specifically mentioned.  That Act gave a certain right to the tenant. At that time the landlord system was in complete control and there was only piecemeal protection for the tenant, to try to keep him interested in renting land. Sections 3 and 7 of the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1870 gave disturbance compensation, which was useful.  Davitt and Parnell fought tooth and nail for that legislation.  The 1881 Act provided that the lessee could sell his right in leasehold. That is a very dangerous right.  The person who leases land can sell that leasehold to somebody else and eventually a long train of people are involved and the owner of the land does not know what is happening.  We all welcome getting rid of that measure.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with this development. He has put a great deal of work into it and has travelled the length and breadth of the country.  He has been exposed to criticism which he has been more than capable of handling and he has been able to put the spear aside.  People are very concerned that they may lose their land.  I do not think that that will arise, because the legislation has been clearly thought out.  While it does not have everything we had hoped for, it is a first step, like the various protections for tenants.  From 1860 up to 1903 the land of Ireland was brought into private ownership.  This Bill may equally achieve the desired objective of bringing unproductive land into the hands of those who can more effectively and productively utilise it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on any Bill relating to agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture began his speech yesterday by saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to exclude agricultural leases from certain provisions in the Statute Books which might have been regarded as inhibiting <Col N="234" /> the development of leasing as part of our land tenure system.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly that that is the first step.  However, the Minister in his speech in 1983 on the Estimates said that in his belief fears on this point are more imaginary than real but that, nevertheless, he will take steps to put the people's minds at rest.  There is obviously a conflict of interest there.  It clearly demonstrates that the Minister is fairly far removed from the actual situation on the ground when he says the fears are only imaginary. They are far more than imaginary, let me say here.  The Minister of State said yesterday in relation to ownership of land that it is sacred.  It is very difficult to get a farmer to change his mind on that aspect.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that landowners persist in holding on to land long after they are able to work it fully.  This was clearly evident from the fact that when we had a farmer retirement scheme only 607 farmers in the whole of the country participated in it.  It was a great pity that that scheme had to be abolished, like many other abolitions which we have had since. I shall be talking about these abolitions and their effect at a later stage.  The Minister suggests it is the use to which the land is put that is of importance and that the rigidity in the system must be replaced by mobility.  Everybody would agree with those sentiments.  The Minister says that he would like to make stepping stones out of the stumbling blocks which exist at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and know that it is a start.  I compliment the Minister for it. However, there is nothing to support the Bill.  The Minister says that no cash incentives will be made available.  He says that we have to get away from the attitude that nobody will do anything, even something that will benefit himself, without getting a grant or subsidy at the taxpayer's expense.  All of us particularly those who are involved in farming, know that in order to get farmers to change their minds with regard to the ownership of land there must be an attractive retirement system.  In the retirement system as <Col N="235" /> operated earlier only 607 farmers participated. That was not nearly enough; still 607 farmers participated and made their land available.  Without some cash incentive you are going nowhere and unless this cash incentive is provided we will not have land available for leasing.  This is evident even in what Deputy Dowling had to say.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that he was determined to ensure that the old system of landlordism is not revived.  I hope he is sincere in this because only in the very recent past we have seen evidence of it.  In County Wexford, and I am sure in other counties, the ACC have put in receivers to take over farm property even though the assets of the farmer far outweighed his liabilities.  That in itself is allowing &mdash; I am not saying &ldquo;reintroducing&rdquo;&mdash; the landlord system to come back here.  On that farm in Wexford we had a repetition of what happened in the last and previous centuries, and that was eviction.  We all have vivid memories of the pictures in our history books of a battering ram outside the door and husband, wife and young children put to the road.</P>
    <P>The system now put in operation by the ACC is no different from that and it is scandalous that any Government would allow it.  It was allowed, tolerated, maybe encouraged by an alien Government but I ask the Government and the Minister to ensure that this does not happen.  We had enough of it in the past.  The ACC were built up to encourage agricultural development and the farmers engaged in and deposited with the aims and objectives of the ACC.  At one stage the ACC were a very small body and the banks owned the biggest buildings in every town.  Now the ACC own the biggest buildings in every town and the executives sitting in plush seats in those heated offices built by the farmers are kicking the very people who built those buildings for them out on to the road.  It is as serious as that, and while Members opposite might smile they know very well that what I say is accurate.  Of course, in those instances the ACC gave the money very <Col N="236" /> generously in 1976, 1977 and 1978 to farmers for development.  The farmer developed his property, reclaimed land, developed his farmyard, and then the ACC refused to give him the money to stock the land or to reseed it and so on, with the result that he never was able to make the repayments on the land.  If you starve a person of cash for stocking it means that the interest on the repayments is accruing over the years, and that is where we find ourselves now.  I say to the Minister that he must let us get away from this question of eviction.  Let him be sincere in ensuring that the landlord system does not resurrect itself again.</P>
    <P>I noticed that right throughout the Minister's speech he was very particular in his suggestion that the lessor and lessee will be treated equally and this is very desirable.  No lease will ever be successful and nobody will ever be encouraged unless this is so.  However, I am a little worried about his suggestion that compensation will not be paid to a lessee following his term of leasing.  If a lessee moves into a place and develops it &mdash; obviously if he has it for a number of years the object of the exercise is that he would develop it &mdash; and possibly puts new buildings on it, surely at the end of the lease some sort of compensation must be made to that person.  I suggest that consideration be given to that very aspect.  If a lessor gets back his property in a better state than when he let it I am sure he would be agreeable to some reasonable terms arrived at with the lessee.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881 certainly must be removed and the Minister's intention here is to ensure that the lessor is entitled to retain undisputed possession of his property on termination of the lease.  That is right and must be continued.  If we do not enshrine that in any legislation then we are going nowhere as far as land leasing is concerned. We all are aware of the necessity for land leasing and land mobility.  I will not say that most of the land of Ireland but certainly one-third of it has not been made proper use of.  Of course, it is ideal to put the land into the hands of those <Col N="237" /> people who will make the most out of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise here, once more, that this Bill is not, and was never intended to be, a great charter for the promotion of leasing.</P>
    <P>Yet in the same paragraph he said:</P>
    <P>... an all-out effort to promote the leasing system....</P>
    <P>He is going to proceed with an all-out effort to proceed with the leasing system. That is a contradiction in terms.  He said on the one hand that he is only going to remove the obstacles and on the other hand he is going to promote leasing.  As Deputy Dowling and I have said and the Minister knows well, unless he is prepared to put some money into the business then this leasing will never get off the ground.  He has made a start but unless the money is put there to back that start we will have the very same situation this time next year.  The Minister went on to say that:</P>
    <P>... the removal of these inhibiting provisions will not, of itself, succeed in getting leasing established....</P>
    <P>Why does he do this at this stage if he is now agreeing that it will not get leasing established?  He must answer the House on that aspect.  Further on he said:</P>
    <P>My Department are taking a positive role in promoting it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech yesterday was loaded with contradictions and all I can say is that he believes, as I believe, that money is required but he is being curtailed by the Department of Finance.  I know from personal contact with the Minister that he is anxious to get this leasing off the ground, yet he is saying that it cannot be done for want of cash.</P>
    <P>In his speech he mentioned the Land Commission.  Of course, everybody is aware that the Land Commission is absolutely necessary still, particularly in relation to land mobility.  Now the Minister has abolished it and that, as I have said previously, was a retrograde step as is <Col N="238" /> evident from reading today's <i>Irish Independent</i> lead story by Paul Drury about buying a country estate the £3 million Dallas way.  The story was about a Texan who obviously had plenty of money &mdash; it is suggested in the newspaper that he was a millionaire 200 times over &mdash; who said when he came to Ireland recently &ldquo;Gee, I would like something like that for myself&rdquo;.  He made the comment after he had seen some large estates owned by Earls and Dukes.  He remarked that Ireland appeared to be a very pretty country and he thought he would like an estate here with a big old house where he could spend three or four weeks of each year. Later in the course of the interview he said he would probably prefer a larger tract of land, up to several thousand acres.</P>
    <P>That interview makes it fairly clear that the Land Commission is still necessary. Already there has been reaction from the ICMSA and the Land League.  They have expressed concern that Americans generally with the strength of the dollar may buy up large tracts of land.  To them land here is very cheap.  When the Land Commission was functioning such land would have been made available to small farmers. This J.R., or whoever he is, also said he intended spending three or four weeks each year in Ireland.  We all know what will happen to the land for the remainder of the year.  The Texan intends buying the land as a hobby but we must remember that 300 acres of land could accommodate four farm families.  The only way we can do that is to ensure that our land is transferred to such people. However, the abolition of the Land Commission is only the beginning and all large estates will be bought by foreigners.  The American I referred to said money did not matter to him.  He said that a figure of £3 million had been mentioned but he could easily have said £30 million or £300 million.  That is what we are up against and it is an indication of the fallacy of the decision to abolish the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister of State that when the legislation comes before the House to wind up the activities of the <Col N="239" /> Land Commission it will be resisted by us.  What does the Minister intend doing to protect our farmers from such rich people?  Deputy Dowling condemned Fianna Fáil in his contribution but I must point out that in 1980 a White Paper issued by us contained a protection against such marauders.  I hope the case I have referred to is investigated and such moves by foreigners are resisted.  It is bad enough to hear of people from member states buying our land but it is a disgrace if Texans can take over our land for use as a hobby without any benefit to the nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State about a year ago suggested that the Land Commission be given a new role in land leasing but I wonder what the position is now seeing that the Government's plan proposes to abolish the Land Commission.  Who will promote the idea of leasing?  Very fancy brochures were produced last year by the Land Commission to encourage groups of farmers to buy land and I should like to know what has happened to that scheme. Will it be scrapped?  I should like to compliment the Minister on his proposal in regard to building society mortgages.  The move is welcome.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline to the House the number of properties involved in the group purchase scheme introduced last year?  The age at which people take over land here must be a matter of great concern. Some years ago the average age of farmers taking over property was 42 years.  Coincidentally, the average age for a farmer to marry was also 42 years.  At that time somebody passed the remark, &ldquo;Two milestones around a farmer's neck in one year&rdquo;.  What proposal has the Minister of State to bring that back to an acceptable level?  We must ensure that those interested in staying on the land are given the land at 25 years of age, or as near as possible to that.  The Minister told us he was convinced that State intervention in the open market was essential in eliminating undesirable land purchases and in giving developing farmers and qualified landless people an opportunity to <Col N="240" /> compete for the purchase of land with some hope of success.  Surely that represents a contradiction in policy when one considers that the Government have decided to abolish the Land Commission. That must be considered in conjunction with the story I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>I agree that a start has been made but the Minister cannot expect any success if he does not provide the necessary finance.  I repeat that if our economy is to be got off its knees it must be done through agriculture.  That is a view I have expressed on many occasions but it has been lost on the general public although those involved in agriculture accept it. We have not had much success in the promotion of agriculture in recent years. In fact we hear daily of schemes that were beneficial to agriculture being scrapped. Half of our workforce depend, directly or indirectly, on agriculture.  Surely it makes sense to keep as many people as possible on the land.  That is one of the aims of Fianna Fáil and it will continue to be.  It is generally accepted that small farmers are more productive than big farmers and, from that point of view, are more beneficial to the State.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline the effect the proposed land tax will have on land leasing? Who will pay the land tax?  Will it be the lessee or the lessor?  Will both people be caught in the income tax net? That must be made clear to those considering leasing land.  One reason why the farm retirement scheme did not get off the ground was because in one instance it was discovered that the lessor and the lessee would have to pay tax.  As a result the people involved decided to stay as they were.</P>
    <P>Two Labour Party Senators sent a letter on this issue to Wexford County Committee of Agriculture.  It was disturbing.  The Labour Party apparently now want to claim credit for introducing the land tax.  When two Labour Senators write to members of county committees in order to have their letter read out it is poor form and is something that should be taken up by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It was rejected out <Col N="241" /> of hand in Wexford.  They have reached a new low when they engage in this kind of cheap politics.</P>
    <P>The land tax has caused an amazing controversy.  Fine Gael Deputies opposed it publicly, yet last week they voted for it.  It is amazing that they would do a U-turn on such an issue when, locally and nationally, they indicated they were against it.  I was particularly interested in the activities of the three Fine Gael Deputies in my constituency who issued a statement on official IFA paper stating that they would oppose a land tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The land tax is closely related to land leasing.  The land tax will discourage the very Bill the Minister is promoting here today.  If land is to be leased to a lessee he will have to have some enterprise in which to engage.  We have a milk quota, which means that very few lessees will have an opportunity to go into that enterprise.  We have a sugar beet quota and so that enterprise can be ruled out.  There is the possibility of a beef quota.  We have discussed alternative enterprises in the recent past particularly since the imposition of the milk levy. If we do not have alternative enterprises for farmers to engage in land leasing will not get off the ground.  If a farmer cannot see a profit in an enterprise he will not engage in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beef industry is one where I expect in the not too distant future we may have a quota imposed.  We must ensure that we find a trade for our enterprises in countries outside the EC.  So far we have been very successful.  The success came under a Fianna Fáil Government who established a lucrative trade with Libya. I was disappointed to discover last Friday that the Libyan trade, worth somewhere in the region of £130 million to this country, has been discontinued.  That will have disastrous effects on our economy and on the cattle trade.  Land leasing will definitely not be as attractive as it might have been if the Libyan trade was continued. This trade was established a few years <Col N="242" /> ago.  It was very successful and could have been expanded with a little encouragement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a Libyan problem but an Irish one.  Everyone is aware <Col N="243" /> of our strong attachment to land.  This had been with us through the years and is likely to continue because of our history. For over 600 years we have been trying to own our land.  Now that we have succeeded, ownership of land is sacred and it will take an enormous crowbar to get land on the market for leasing.  The Minister has not given any incentive to farmers to lease land.  In any land agency the Minister might be thinking about establishing it would be important that they could not invoke a compulsory purchase order.  I am anxious to hear the Minister of State's view on that.</P>
      <P>It is most important that there be a proper agricultural guide index to set a national figure for rent increases.  That could be compiled by an independent body &mdash; for example, the agricultural institute.  This is an absolute must.  If agreement is reached beforehand between a lessor and a lessee, there would be little difficulty about the term of a lease.  In 1977 and 1978 things were very good in agriculture.  The whole scene changed dramatically in the years 1981-82 and 1983-84.  Such fluctuations would have to be taken into account in the framing of land leasing legislation for introduction at a later stage.</P>
      <P>To provide for circumstances in which a lessee dies or for some reason is not able to meet payments for land, would the Minister consider including in the legislation provision for guaranteed payment to a lessor by way of insurance bond?  I should like to hear his views on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear also whether tax liability will apply to both parties.  There is a belief among the urban population that they are paying a far greater share of tax than farmers are paying and this might lead to the non-farming community insisting that both sides pay tax.  This, in turn, could mean the killing of the goose that lays the golden egg.  I do not know how social welfare payments might be protected but the Minister must ensure that no obstacle is put in the way from that point of view.  He must be strong enough to resist any interference <Col N="244" /> from the non-farming community and to bear in mind that the purpose of the exercise is to create a climate in which land leasing will be both acceptable and encouraged.</P>
    <P>Regarding who might qualify for the leasing of land, what has the Minister got in mind?  Would a prospective lessee have to have a certain acreage or less than a certain acreage?  What educational requirements would be required of a prospective lessee?  We all know of many excellent farmers, both young and not so young, who have been far more successful perhaps than those who have been fortunate enough to take a degree in agriculture; but I am wondering whether we are moving too far too fast with a view to bringing about a situation in which only farmers of a certain level of education will qualify for land.  Regardless of whether he has had a good education, the farmer who has proved himself should be considered to qualify in terms of the leasing of land.</P>
    <P>However, it is desirable that all our farmers would have a basic education. We should continue, therefore, to encourage farmer education.  It is well known that farmers generally have had far less education than many of their counterparts in industry.  The insistence of the Government that agricultural colleges be closed is very disturbing.  I am referring to home economics colleges.  In my constituency the three Fine Gael TDs indicated their strong support for the continuation of those colleges.  The farmer's wife plays a large part in his success as a farmer.  That is why it is important that education in the sphere of agriculture be available to young girls who are likely eventually to return to life on farms.  The courses conducted by ACOT have been very successful and of great benefit but there is room for an extension of the courses even if at some cost to the local revenue.  While emphasising the necessity for farmers to be educated we must not discriminate against the farmer who has not had the benefit of an education but who has proved himself in farming.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that improvements effected <Col N="245" /> by way of land reclamation and so on must be taken into account on the expiration of a lease.  The IFA and the co-operatives have produced a master lease which is very interesting.  It is a document to which we should pay a good deal of attention.  However, I am concerned that the co-operatives would have too great a role to play in the leasing programme.  I would have preferred if the Land Commission had been continued or if some other such agency were involved in this programme.  There would be a danger of a conflict of interests in the event of the co-operatives becoming involved.  One can conceive of a situation in which a person might owe a considerable amount to the co-ops in respect of seed, fertilisers and so on.  That person would then be in a compromise position.  The co-ops might think in terms of taking land from a lessor and giving it to a certain lessee.  The Minister must have regard to this aspect.</P>
    <P>Obviously, when we are talking about the leasing of agricultural land we must talk also of tax exemptions.  Portion of the moneys received would have to be tax free and not taken into consideration when eligibility for benefit is being assessed. Again, the Minister must not allow himself to be compromised in this respect by outside influences.  Unless there are benefits to be derived from leasing, a scheme will not be successful and that is why I submit that favourable low interest rates be made available.  This question has been raised many times in this House.</P>
    <P>The difficulties experienced by farmers in the past few years make obvious the need for proper incentives. The amount of investment in agriculture in the past two years has been minimal and that will continue to be the case unless there are favourable low fixed interest rates.</P>
    <P>A proper and attractive retirement scheme for farmers is absolutely essential. I look forward to the introduction of such a scheme so that the older farmers will be encouraged to make their lands available for leasing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1984, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, including certain services administered by that Office and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>This is to enable the transfer of £12 million from subhead K3, which is for IDA's building operations, to subhead K2, which is for IDA capital grants and to provide an additional £7 million for capital grants from savings elsewhere in the Department.</P>
      <P>The IDA's capital budget is divided into two subheads &mdash; capital grants and building operations.  The capital grants subhead is used for the provision of industrial grants, equity participation and loan guarantees, and the building operations subhead is used to finance IDA's building activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the year ending 31 December 1984 IDA were approved grant-in-aid of <Col N="247" /> £104.5 million for capital grants.  In addition IDA were permitted to avail of £12.5 million of their own resources made up of grant repayments and reimbursements from the European Social Fund.  The IDA's approved expenditure, therefore, on this subhead is £117 million.</P>
    <P>The IDA now require approval for total expenditure of £152 million on capital grants, an increase of £35 million.  This has arisen because of the increased level of grant claims amounting to £25 million, mainly in relation to training and new industry grants, and because of a change in accounting practice which has been recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General whereby £10 million has to be paid from the capital grants subhead to the building operations subhead.  I am proposing that this £35 million shortfall on capital grants be met as follows: £12 million &mdash; Already approved for building operations, and not now required, to be transferred to capital grants; £11 million &mdash; Surplus own resources on building operations to be transferred to capital grants; £1 million &mdash; Additional own resources on capital grants being realised from the European Social Fund and grant repayments; £4 million &mdash; Borrowings &mdash; IDA will be allowed temporary borrowings of £4 million; £7 million &mdash; Additional grant-in-aid for which I am now seeking the approval of the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the building operations subhead, the IDA were allocated £12 million grant-in-aid and were also authorised to retain a maximum of £10 million own resources, giving a total budget of £22 million for building activities.  In the event, IDA's own resources are now likely to reach £36 million &mdash; £26 million greater than expected.  This has arisen because of the strengthening of the US dollar which has made it more attractive for American companies to exercise purchase options on factory buildings and because of the payment of £10 million from the capital grants subhead to the building subhead on the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Because of the increased level of own <Col N="248" /> resources in the building operations subhead, the £12 million grant-in-aid already approved by the House is not now required. I propose, with the approval of the House, to transfer this £12 million to the capital grants subhead.  For technical accounting reasons only £6 million of this may now be transferred, the remainder being found from the subhead dealing with the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>The IDA require approval for an additional £3 million expenditure on building operations, bringing total expenditure to £25 million.  This £3 million is necessary to commence work on three enterprise centres.  One of these will be located in Cork and the other two in Dublin at Tallaght and East Wall.  I regard these enterprise centres as an important development. I particularly welcome the centre in Cork because there have been a number of closures recently in Cork which have had an initially demoralising effect.  I use the word &ldquo;initially&rdquo; advisedly because I believe that since then there has been an increasing realisation on the part of the people of that city that their future is in their own hands and minds and that they are looking for opportunities to set up Cork owned enterprises to provide employment there.  The establishment of an enterprise centre in Cork is, therefore, a major step forward in recognising the climate of enterprise that now exists in the city.</P>
    <P>I must also draw the attention of the House to the location of the other two centres, which are in Tallaght and the East Wall area of Dublin.  The East Wall area has been the victim of industrial decline, being an area of long established industrial and trading activity, some of which is being replaced by automation in the port and elsewhere.  This enterprise centre will provide an opportunity for people, some of whom will be using the enterprise allowance scheme, to set up enterprises for the first time.  It follows the considerable success of a similar enterprise centre on the other side of the river at Pearse Street where there has been a notably large number of people availing of that very valuable facility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> The other centre is in Tallaght, which has also been considerably affected by unemployment and, while there are quite a number of industries in the area, many are employing people who are not from Tallaght and who commute long distances. There is a need to establish enterprises which will employ Tallaght people in Tallaght.  These three strategically and well chosen enterprise centres will represent a major contribution towards assistance by the IDA to native Irish enterprise, which is the main but not the only route towards a solution of our employment problems.</P>
    <P>The additional £3 million will also allow for capital contributions in regard to IDA's Ringaskiddy property and for modifications to factories for clients in a number of areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This still leaves IDA with a surplus of £11 million own resources in the building operations subhead.  I also propose to transfer this £11 million to the capital grants subhead as outlined earlier.</P>
    <P>The savings elsewhere in my Department's Vote, to provide £7 million additional grant-in-aid to IDA's capital grants subhead, are as follows:</P>
    <P>SFADCo grants to industrialists, £1 million: Of the total allocation of £5.75 million for these grants in the current year, there will be a saving of £1 million on expenditure.</P>
    <P>National Enterprise Agency &mdash; capital expenditure, £2 million: Only £300,000 of the allocation of £3 million for the NEA has been drawn down to date and anticipated commitments are such that no more than £1 million in total will be utilised in 1984.  This is due to the NEA only recently becoming operational with a view to progressing opportunities appropriate for investment by the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>National Development Corporation &mdash; capital expenditure £1 million: An allocation of £7 million was provided for the NDC in 1984.  As indicated in the national plan, legislation to establish <Col N="250" /> the corporation will be presented shortly.  However, the NDC are unlikely to be operational for some months and so savings will be made under this subhead, £1 million of which will go to IDA's capital grants.  For the technical accounting reasons I have mentioned earlier I also need to transfer temporarily an additional £6 million from the NDC to IDA.</P>
    <P>Bread Subsidy &mdash; £3 million: Savings of £3 million are anticipated on bread subsidy requirements in 1984 as a result of the decision to halve subsidy rates and because of a downward trend in rates of claims from bakeries.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper on Industrial Policy the Government set out the direction which future industrial policy is to take. The IDA have been given a challenging role in this policy and if they are to meet this challenge and to continue to stimulate the growth of industrial output and international services with the aim of creating viable jobs in the economy, then it is essential that these additional funds be made available.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, 1983 saw a further decline in the overall level of manufacturing employment, but the performance of the manufacturing sector was marked by a significant growth in the volume of output and in the level of industrial exports.  The total value of the output of Irish industry has risen to £11,500 million of which £8,000 million represented expenditure in the Irish economy.  The increase in output of 7 per cent represented the highest growth in the EC. Industrial exports increased by 14 per cent in volume to £5,400 million.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to the figure which I have just quoted.  The total value of the output of Irish industry which takes place within the Irish economy is £8,000 million of the total of £11,500 million. There is no doubt that there is considerable repatriation overseas of some of those profits but it is important to note that eight-elevenths of the money generated by industry here remains in this country.  It is also worth noting that a number of Irish companies have subsidiaries <Col N="251" /> overseas and that they will be repatriating profits to Ireland from their overseas subsidiaries, so it is a two-way process.</P>
    <P>The very encouraging feature of the recent industrial scene has been the dramatic increase in the numbers of feasibility studies and research and development projects approved.  The increase in the approvals of these type of grants reflects the growing awareness in the Irish industrial community of the vital importance of investment in these areas of activity if Irish manufacturing is to remain competitive.</P>
    <P>In future there will be fewer grants available for fixed asset investment and for machinery.  Our future prosperity will be based on using grants and incentives in areas that will result in the largest increase in incomes and employment in Ireland.  This will come about by introducing a much more selective approach when considering cases for grant assistance. Grant aid in years to come will be confined to firms which are either exporting or producing substitutes for materials which are already being imported unless they provide high technology inputs for internationally trading firms.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the decline in the overall level of manufacturing employment in 1983.  The White Paper has set a target of 3,000 to 6,000 net additional jobs in manufacturing for each of the next ten years.  I am aware that this target is very ambitious when considered in the light of events in other countries where the number of jobs in manufacturing is actually falling, such as Japan and the US.  However, I consider that the targets are realistic in view of our success to date.  It is important to remember that we continued to have an increase in manufacturing employment right up to 1979 when practically every other industrialised country had been experiencing decline.  We have shown an ability to beat the trend and there is no reason to believe that we are not capable of doing it again in the next decade.</P>
    <P>It is clear therefore that we are trying to achieve significant increases in the <Col N="252" /> numbers of people employed in manufacturing industry.  It would be a significant achievement for Ireland if we were able to achieve better results in this area than our European partners.  This is what we are aiming to do in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
    <P>I am looking to the future with optimism. The decline in manufacturing employment is being halted.  Site visits throughout the country by industrialists from abroad are almost one third higher in number so far this year than for the equivalent period in 1983.  I consider that this is quite significant in the context of assessing trends in investment from abroad.</P>
    <P>I commented earlier that there would be a move away from reliance on capital grants.  In the past the view was taken that the best way of securing a project &mdash; and consequently jobs &mdash; was to get people to make a large physical capital investment which we would grant aid and which they would not be anxious to walk away from.  While that remains true to a good extent, what holds people in a country is the level of technology they are using which gives them a domination in the market place and the level of specific training and job experience of their work force, which cannot easily be replicated in other countries because processes are becoming so complicated.  It is a welcome trend that the training level and competence of the workforce is becoming a critical factor in both attracting and retaining industry.  This is an area in which Ireland has significant advantages over practically any other country in Europe because of our young, educated and, might I say, English-speaking population which offers opportunities in Ireland to firms who wish to invest and have access to the European market which they cannot obtain in any other country in Europe.  I include the United Kingdom in that because their workforce is not as young and adaptable as ours.</P>
    <P>With regard to investment from abroad, I wish to refer to the controversy about the repatriation of profits by foreign companies located here, arising from a leaked internal Central Bank <Col N="253" /> Report.  There was nothing in this report which was new and the issues raised were dealt with when the Government were examining the revisions they needed to make to the balance of payments statistics. The leaked paper was completed before the information incorporated in the balance of payments statistics was to hand and if the author had had access to this information he would not have reached the conclusion he did.</P>
    <P>However, it did give rise again to questions about the worth of overseas investment in Ireland.  I must emphasise the importance of overseas industry to our industrial development.  There are 800 foreign firms located in Ireland employing about 80,000 people.  These companies spent £2,000 million in Ireland in 1983.  This compares with IDA grant expenditure at £76 million in 1983 on foreign industry.</P>
    <P>Repatriated profits of overseas companies in Ireland amount to approximately 13 per cent of the sales revenue of these firms and 55 per cent of the profits earned by these companies in Ireland. The balance, that is 45 per cent of their profits, is re-invested in Ireland.  It must be remembered that the so-called profits earned in Ireland by an affiliate of an overseas company are not necessarily profits actually earned by the Irish company. In many cases the so-called profits associated with any overseas company established in Ireland are absolutely necessary to offset the development costs incurred abroad for the products being manufactured in Ireland, without which those products could not have been manufactured here.</P>
    <P>Thus, so-called profits for the Irish subsidiary are not all profits in the books of the parent company.  Before any industry is established here by a foreign company there has to be a very large amount of research and development expenditure.  Usually that is undertaken using borrowed funds acquired by the parent company in a location other than Ireland.  Once the factory is established here those borrowings have to be repaid. The money comes out of Ireland to go <Col N="254" /> towards their repayment by the parent company.  It appears in the Irish books as if that money is profit leaving the country but it is money which the company must have in order to repay loans incurred for development costs.  If such costs had not been incurred there would not have been a project in Ireland.  They are not profits in that sense.</P>
    <P>Likewise in many cases there are foreign industries in Ireland who maintain a marketing sales force throughout the world to sell their Irish products.  That sales force is paid for by company headquarters outside Ireland and appears as a cost in the books of the parent company. The money which must necessarily go out of Ireland to pay for the marketing of the products manufactured here appears in the Irish books as profit leaving the country but it is not profit to the company.  It is money the company must get if they are to pay for the marketing of the goods produced in Ireland.  These two examples &mdash; research and development and marketing &mdash; illustrate that not all of what appears to be profit is in fact profit in the hands of the company sponsoring the project in Ireland.  It is important that those facts should be known and Deputies should not put forward criticism based on an inaccurate foundation.</P>
    <P>The fact that Ireland is a profitable location for overseas companies is a major element of the IDA's overseas promotional programme.  If this were not generally the case we would not attract these companies to Ireland in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to increased site visits by industrialists from abroad this year. I consider that this is significant in the context of assessing trends in investment from abroad.  Grant approvals for small industry have also increased significantly on last year's performance.</P>
    <P>The IDA have a key role to play in the achievement of the Government's objectives in relation to job creation and the maximisation of value added in the Irish economy.  This is in addition to the challenging target of doubling manufacturing output over the next ten years.  The additional funds which I am providing for the <Col N="255" /> IDA will greatly assist the authority in achieving the goals set for them.</P>
    <P>While I have pointed out in this contribution the importance to this economy of foreign investment, I would like to say that the whole thrust of the Government's industrial policy over the next ten years will be to maximise native generated industry.  This is being done by providing funds for the type of cost factor that inhibits native as distinct from foreign industry from establishing here.  For example, we will be providing for the first time technology acquisition grants and new forms of grants for marketing abroad.  In most cases foreign companies already have their technology &mdash; they have generated it abroad &mdash; and in most cases they already have a well established marketing operation, so they do not need grant assistance.  On the other hand if a small Irish company, or a large Irish company with a less than high profit level, is to break into the international market, it needs to acquire new technology in its manufacturing process either by joint ventures or by simply buying into a licensing arrangement so that it is producing a product which is the best that market can offer.  Equally such a company needs to spend considerable amounts of money on marketing because most Irish manufacturing companies have tended in the past to rely either on the Irish market or on the Irish plus the British markets.</P>
    <P>This is a very unwise strategy for Irish industry although in many cases it is a strategy they had little choice but to engage in, for a number of reasons.  By putting all one's eggs in the sterling basket one is exposing oneself to fluctuations in the relationship between the Irish £ and the British £.  Whereas if one can spread one's export portfolio over a number of areas, including the EMS countries where the relationship with the Irish £ is more stable, the company is in a much more strategically strong position and can afford to take temporary losses for currency reasons on one market, say the sterling market, because of the successes on the EMS market or <i>vice versa.</i> If companies are to get into that strategically <Col N="256" /> strong position they must make a major marketing effort.  We are putting special emphasis on providing additional funds for Córas Tráchtála Teoranta next year to enable them to help Irish companies to diversify and develop significant market strength.</P>
    <P>That is a very important point because the two major features in the industrial White Paper &mdash; the technology acquisition grants and the three new schemes for marketing &mdash; are specifically designed to help native Irish industry to develop into an internationally trading operation and to become strategically strong companies. We will also be providing in the legislation for the National Development Corporation so that it may have a role, if necessary, of investing equity in certain strategically strong Irish companies, to add another brick to the construction of strategically strong Irish companies.</P>
    <P>I realise that for some small Irish companies this approach is beyond their ken because essentially they are serving a local market and in the short term future it is hard for them to see themselves getting into even the British market. What can we offer them?  We have been working very hard with the major supermarket groups &mdash; I will be meeting some of the wholesale trade in the next few weeks &mdash; to try to get them to stock more Irish goods.  I do not approach this by telling them that it is their duty to stock Irish goods because they are Irish or are working in Ireland and making a profit here.  That is a good appeal to make but it can only get one so far, because if people find that by stocking more Irish goods they are losing money, they will stop.</P>
    <P>What we are trying to do is to get the supermarkets to develop some sort of a long term contractual relationship with small Irish suppliers, particularly in the food area, so that if in the initial few months the suppliers' quality of production or delivery schedules are not up to standard, for perfectly understandable technical reasons, the supermarkets would have patience with the suppliers and help them so that within a reasonably <Col N="257" /> well defined period they can reach a stage where they are as good as any other producers. This approach is particularly important to the development of the food industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the fact that we have a tremendous asset in the form of our agricultural raw materials which we are inadequately using to develop the food industry.  There have been some notable examples of people who have been very successful in this area &mdash; one such example is represented in the House at the moment &mdash; but we would all agree that there are too few successes of this kind.  One of the reasons for this is that many of these producers do not have the initial capital to get over the first year when they are getting rebuffs from retailers and so on, with the result that their businesses collapse and large quantities of our agricultural produce go into intervention, which, while it is welcome, is ultimately the worst way in which we should be disposing of our goods if we are interested in value-added.  We are trying to get a more positive attitude from the retail supermarkets, many of which are international, who have very substantial resources and are making substantial profits here, to use some of those profits in their own interests to develop native Irish supplies and to provide access to their retail outlets in Britain and elsewhere for their Irish products, once the Irish product has developed a quality image in the chain operating in Ireland. I would like to commend the work of the Irish Goods Council in supporting these initiatives.</P>
    <P>There is another area where Irish suppliers do not fully realise the opportunities that exist for them.  I am thinking in particular of the retail trade.  Increasingly as margins are getting tighter and interest rates are high, retailers do not want to carry large stocks.  If one is importing goods, say shoes from Taiwan, one must import them in very large quantities, otherwise one will not get a consignment. This means that somebody, the wholesaler or the retailer, has to carry at considerable cost large stocks of these imported goods.  If, on the other hand, <Col N="258" /> they buy their goods in Ireland, where they can be produced almost to order as they are sold, so that within a week or two the manufacturer can produce what the supplier needs, there is no need for the retailer, the wholesaler or the manufacturer to carry large stocks.  This is particularly important at a time of inflation and high interest rates when carrying stocks costs a great deal of money.  I urge any Irish manufacturer in a small segment of the market who is not capable of responding to all these initiatives, to use this sales point in regard to stocking levels and to point out to retailers the wisdom in stocking Irish goods &mdash; because they will not have to stock as much and they can buy as and when they need, rather than buying in large quantities.  This is something which is important and which should be sold by anyone who has an opportunity of influencing the trade.</P>
    <P>If we are to have the industrial revival we need, that will not be achieved by management alone.  I tend to endorse the views attributed to Mr. Edwards, who worked formerly in British Leyland, when he blamed &mdash; in the case of Britain &mdash; most of the problems of British industry on British management.  He said that in his experience most trade unionists were perfectly reasonable so long as they were spoken to reasonably.  That is probably fairly true in Ireland also.  Two things are wrong here.  The first is an attitude of management in traditional industries which looks on the manager's role as giving orders and other people's role as fulfilling them.  It is an almost military style approach to management and it reduces the role of the individual worker to that of a surrogate machine. In other words, the worker has a certain number of hand movements to perform and as long as he does that reasonably well he will be retained and if he does not he will not be retained.</P>
    <P>The idea that a young, educated workforce in Ireland can be reduced to the role of a surrogate machine performing relatively routine actions on a repetitive basis is impossible to conceive.  Therefore, we must have a different approach to management <Col N="259" /> which through discussion draws on imaginative qualities, intelligence and ability.  This can be very laborious and time-consuming for management but it is essential if we are to get a better industrial output.  This approach to management, which is a co-operative, teamwork approach rather than a directive approach, is one that can and must be underpinned by a system of workers having a shareholding in industry.  If workers own part of an industry through a shareholding scheme, for which the Government have offered generous tax incentives, then almost automatically there will be a transformation in management practices and in the practices of the workers.</P>
    <P>There have also been problems on the workers' side in the sense of artificial job demarcation in many industries, where one person says he will not do another person's work even though both people know that they are probably jeopardising their jobs.  That continues because workers are ill-advised in many cases.  That attitude has to change and if it changes there is a great future for Ireland in industry.  We have what other countries do not have, namely, a young, educated and English-speaking productive workforce situated within the largest market in the world, the EC.  Those are advantages very few other countries have.</P>
    <P>If we look at our opportunities and our advantages, if we accentuate them sufficiently and give ourselves confidence in one another, I have not the slightest doubt that we can overcome the many problems we face today.  I believe that criticism has a role to play in this House and elsewhere so far as Irish industry is concerned, but in whatever criticism we have to offer I hope we do not demoralise the public who are working.  They are looking to this House for a message of confidence by the politicians in the people, one that accentuates what we have and what we can achieve if we make greater efforts than we have been making in the past.  That is an approach which I have noted in some of the contributions from the other side of the House and it <Col N="260" /> is one I endorse heartily.  The only way forward, if I may use that phrase, for Irish industry is one of confidence, of investment and of seeking to build strategically strong Irish companies based on good marketing programmes, good technology and our existing assets of the best educated, youngest and most adaptable workforce in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will always get my approval and co-operation in any steps he proposes to eliminate the crisis in employment at this time.  At the outset of my contribution I wish to comment on the documentation we got on this Estimate. It is a pity the Minister did not spell it out in detail.  I am quoting from the revised Estimates for the Public Service for 1984.  While it may be the system to quote items as &ldquo;F3&rdquo;, &ldquo;K3&rdquo; and so on the Minister should have outlined what these vague references mean.</P>
      <P>Let us take the first item, subhead F3, £1 million.  The provisional outturn in 1983 for this subhead was £4,495,000 and the 1984 estimate was £5,750,000.  From my reading of those figures it is proposed to extract £1 million from the figure of £5,750,000.  What does subhead F3 stand for?  The revised Estimates, refer to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, grants to industrialists (grant-in-aid) A, and costs of grants to industrialists in connection with industrial, commercial and trading enterprises at Shannon airport.</P>
      <P>The next subhead is K3, £6 million. The 1983 provisional outturn was £19,500,000 and the 1984 estimate is £12,000,000, a cut of £7,500,000.  Listed under subhead K3 are the following items: IDA building operation; grant to the authority to defray the cost of the acquisition of land for industrial development purposes, the development of industrial estates and the construction of factories.  I hope this reduction will not have an adverse effect on the acquisition of or the development of industrial estates and the construction of factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead Q2 has a figure of £2 million. That refers to the 1984 estimate for the National Enterprise Agency.  It is now <Col N="261" /> proposed to take £2 million from the grant-in-aid of £3 million.  I hope that the removal of two-thirds of its allocation will not hinder the development of the agency.</P>
    <P>The next subhead is R.2.  The 1984 estimate is £7 million.  That is the much vaunted by this Government National Development Corporation.  The Government are removing from the National Development Corporation which we heard so much about the entire £7 million bar the £10 allocated to them in the 1984 Estimates for Public Service.  Subhead BB is the next veiled item in relation to bread subsidies.  The 1983 outturn was £39.795 million and the 1984 figure was £41 million.  These figures are to be extracted from subheads F.3, K.3, Q.2, R.2, and BB and are to be transferred to subhead K.2. Subhead K.2. represents additional grants to enable the authority to perform the following functions:</P>
    <P>£7,000,000 (i) The provision of grants for and the acquisition of shares in undertakings in relation to industrial development in the designated areas.</P>
    <P>£12,000,000 (ii) The provision of grants for the acquisition of shares in undertakings in relation to industrial development outside the designated areas.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister did not spell out what these were.  Can he give us more information on where this money is being transferred to in subhead K.2?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking for proposals from the Government.  We are looking for a commitment from them for the provision of jobs and employment.  On that account we support the proposal to vote additional grant aid funds for the IDA.  While the Minister must be given due credit for his efforts, the Government are being unfair to him in not providing him with the money to enable him to carry out IDA projects he has outlined in his speech.</P>
      <P>The important thing is that companies approved for grants by the IDA and needing them to partly finance acquisition of equipment and so on, should be paid those grants speedily and with the minimum of delay.  In many instances firms are waiting for the payment of moneys and while they are waiting they are acquiring bridging loans from other financial institutions which are costing them much more money.  I should like to see a speeding up in that respect.  Otherwise those companies will be or could be excessively dependent on expensive bridging finance from banks while waiting for the IDA grant cheques.</P>
      <P>Presumably, the introduction of this Supplementary Vote means that the IDA have run short of funds for companies due grant payments, and that the IDA are currently holding the fort on paying out of grant claims at this time.  Unfortunately, the cost of financing such delays must be carried by companies whose cash-flows are no doubt already hard-pressed. This sort of situation can only exacerbate the difficulties so many companies face, through high charges for electricity and telephones, areas in which Government should be aiming to minimise industry's overhead costs.</P>
      <P>The charges in turn affect a company's potential to employ more people, which surely should be a major objective of any sensible Government policy.  Right through this debate I hope the emphasis will be on the employment of more people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil are committed to creating an environment which will encourage job creation.  Every time we were in Government we tried to create <Col N="263" /> jobs and employment.  It is the stamp of Coalition Governments that they had the very opposite effect.  In my position in Opposition I will do all I can to change what the Minister said, that the people are demoralised.  I hope I can contribute to the restoration of confidence in the people in the matter of employment, job creation and industry.</P>
    <P>I will expect the institutions of the State, which were set up to encourage and promote job creation, to actively pursue that objective.  And those institutions include the major one, the IDA, which, over the years, have had at their disposal considerable state funds, aimed at creating jobs.</P>
    <P>We accept that the nature of jobs is changing, and has changed quite dramatically over the past 20 years.  We know that we have had many industries and companies that have not been able to keep pace with technological changes and which have suffered major job losses. We in Fianna Fáil recognise this and we took the necessary steps to provide funds for new technology.  When this Government took office the foundation had been laid for tremendous developments in the micro-electronic industry.  Many other technical advances have surfaced.  It was depressing to read on the front page of a national daily today of 70 jobs being lost in a high technology industry in County Cork.</P>
    <P>It must be said, and it is both disapointing and alarming, that after 20 years of industrial development our manufacturing labour force is still more or less the same, despite the growth in our population. We will be encouraging the Government in every way we can to take note of the situation and to ensure that it is not allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>It is particularly disconcerting that at a time when our unemployment level is at a record high, with 220,000 unemployed, the IDA, our premier agency responsible for the creation of jobs, should be seeking to put their emphasis on the concept of wealth creation and downgrading their objective &mdash; and indeed, our major social <Col N="264" /> need &mdash; of job creation.  We do not deny the need for major national wealth creation, but at a time when so many people are unemployed, surely it is just not good enough for the IDA, with the support of the Government's White Paper on Industrial Policy, to declare that their future focus should be on wealth creation.  With 220,000 unemployed, surely the emphasis should be on finding ways of creating jobs instead of just caving in, and saying: &ldquo;We cannot do anything about it&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Jobs are a result of increasing the pool of wealth&rdquo;.  We know that wealth creation is important, but so is job creation.</P>
    <P>We have seen the IDA move away from their former job approvals measurement basis during the past couple of years.  That is no bad thing, especially when one looks at the figures for actual jobs created as compared with the announced job approval figures.  Clearly &mdash; and I suspect that the IDA must have been aware of it &mdash; job approvals has never been an adequate measure.</P>
    <P>Last year the IDA could manage to sustain only a quarter of the jobs they approved in 1981 and by the end of this year once a mere 25 per cent of the jobs approved in 1982 will actually be in place. This rather unhappy performance is revealed in the Authority's annual report out recently.  It discloses that only 40 per cent of the jobs approved in 1981 and 1982 will be sustained five years after the approvals have been given.</P>
    <P>It is the first time that the IDA have blushingly admitted such an out-turn and the pressure for the disclosure has come from the July White Paper on Industrial Policy published when the Dáil was in recess and we were not given the opportunity of discussing this famous or otherwise White Paper depending on one's viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is felt that the preparation of the tables issued with that report was at least one of the reasons for the IDA's annual report coming two months later than its normal date.</P>
    <P>But instead of moving the goalposts from job approvals to wealth creation, it is vital that the IDA should keep their <Col N="265" /> focus clearly on their primary objective &mdash; not at any price, let me add &mdash; of getting jobs.</P>
    <P>We are concerned that the IDA's recently published annual report, referring to the White Paper on Industrial Policy, should see the central focus of new policy as the target of doubling the manufacturing output over the next ten years and capturing the maximum added value within the country aimed at generating further investment and additional employment in the economy.  While we can subscribe to these objectives individually we feel that the emphasis on the social importance of job creation has been gravely relegated by the Government and the IDA.</P>
    <P>As our premier job creating body, perhaps we should ask the IDA how and where jobs could be developed, acknowledging their input in respect of the need to create wealth, instead of having it relegated to being just a function of wealth creation.</P>
    <P>We can see and judge the success of job creating policies of which there are none in the Government's so-called national plan.  I hesitate to call it a plan because, of course, it is a document that had one tremendous success, a political success in warding off the decimation of the parties in Government and the parties themselves.  But there is a large question mark now over the whole question of value statistics for the economy, such as growth in output of Irish industry or the value of exports as quoted by the IDA in their annual report.  The Taoiseach's own economic adviser, Dr. Honohan, has highlighted the dubiousness of some of our economic data.  In the circumstances it seems that the IDA should concentrate their work on job creation.  Our 220,000 unemployed people would certainly appreciate it.</P>
    <P>If I may be parochial, I welcome the decision by the Minister to include with those for Tallaght and the East Wall road the enterprise centre for Cork.  I am glad that he accepted my suggestion last week. We in Cork need only a small bit of encouragement from the Government and will do the rest ourselves.  I am also <Col N="266" /> aware that he must have been very conscious of the statement made by his own two colleagues a couple of weeks ago when announcing that the enterprise centre was going ahead.  They said that if the Government did not do something for Cork, Fine Gael would be decimated there.  I could tell them that, with or without the enterprise agency, they are decimated anyway.  They told us their centre was going ahead and we now find that it takes a Supplementary Estimate. Were they aware of this when they put the announcement in the local papers that the centre was going ahead?  Yes, it is going ahead after a Supplementary Estimate is introduced here and has my approval.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been very mute and I hope that Deputy Carey notices that they have been transferring money from his area, SFADCo, to encourage us to carry on with the enterprise in Cork. We succeeded in doing that much and I had something to do with it.  We will press on.  I am not going to trot out the litany of the needs of the Cork area but I will refer to one area in which the IDA have had up to now no involvement whatsoever. It is known as Mayfield, covers an area of 179 miles and is a suburb located north west of the city, about 2.5 miles <Col N="267" /> from the city centre.  It contains a population in excess of 15,000.  The Minister may not be aware and if not I am making him aware, that Mayfield lacks the necessary facilities and services to cater for its increasing population.  It has suffered even more because of the lack of industrial development in the area.  I give the Minister a statistic from a survey done by the local community association and hope that his Department and the Industrial Development Authority will take note of it.  They say that it is an amazing and ironic fact that the fastest growing suburb in the city has only 23 people employed locally.  I hope that reference will have some positive results and that consideration will be given by the IDA, the Minister and the Government to this area.  We cannot allow a location of that size and population with so few at work there to go unattended.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that manufacturing jobs were declining.  It will be recalled that we in Fianna Fáil opposed the imposition of VAT on footwear and clothing. No doubt, all are aware of the position in manufacturing industry, and I take the textile and footwear industries as an example.  The loss of jobs in those two industries between December 1979 and June 1983 amounted to 8,800.  Since then that figure has risen to 9,100.  I contend that the policy of the Government, which we opposed, of putting VAT on clothing and footwear has contributed enormously to the further decline of employment in textiles and footwear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gives some time to linkage &mdash; that was his term for what we in Fianna Fáil had organised as import substitution.  I spoke last week in another debate on the unsatisfactory amount of effort being put into import substitution development.  There is a tremendous availability of employment in import substitution. The Minister mentioned in his contribution the food area.  I mentioned last week, and I restate, the £800 million of imported food at least 50 per cent of which &mdash; and that is a very conservative figure &mdash; could be grown and processed at <Col N="268" /> home.  Because it is not in the document produced recently we must emphasise to this Government at every opportunity we get here in the House the need for job creation now and in the years ahead for our young, well-educated population who have just left school and who will be leaving school in the immediate and long term.</P>
    <P>I charge the Government that they are not giving the proper emphasis to the development of job creation.  Let me restate that if there is in the country at present a feeling of demoralisation much of it has been created by the ineffectiveness of the administration over the past two years.  Do not let them be fooled by the idea of the well-handled publication of this recent document that all is well. Nevertheless, as I said earlier, they will have my full co-operation and that of the Fianna Fáil Party in any effort that they will make to restore confidence in the minds and attitudes of the people and, more important, in instilling in them a feeling of hope for the future because at present they have a feeling of hopelessness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on some of the statements he made.  In fact, some of the more important views he put forward are not, unfortunately, in the speech supplied to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He dealt for a while with the question of the attitude of management and workers and the breakdown in relations between them.  I agree entirely with him that many of our industrial problems today arise from mistrust and from the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude in industry.  I welcome any suggestions that would come forward from any Government Department to eliminate this appalling problem. I and my colleagues on the other side from the Cork region know better than anybody else the results of this type of problem in our industrial sector today which has caused the reduction in effectiveness of many of our industries in the Cork region.  Some people say that it has caused the closure of some of these industries.  Therefore, I welcome further thoughts and I would like to speak to the <Col N="269" /> Minister at some stage about my thoughts on the matter.  I welcome the views put forward today on this great problem of the relationship between management and workers.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to some of the comments made by my colleague opposite, and this gives me an opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment as spokesman for industry.  However, to lay the blame for the problems in any region on the present Government is just being dishonest.  If we are to eliminate the problems in our industrial sector we must take a more in-depth look at those problems and come up with answers rather than criticism.  I agree entirely with the comments made about import substitution.  I stated in the House last week during my contribution to the debate on the economic plan that the importation of fruit, vegetables and processed foods is a national scandal and I urge the Minister to use all his powers to reduce the imports of these commodities.  If we are to create employment in a realistic way we should introduce and set up industries that will be based on our own resources.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the closure &mdash; not in my constituency but in the Cork region &mdash; of an electronics firm.  I also question the wisdom of us allowing industries to set up in this country who just set up assembly units and do not set up units which will undertake research and development.  If we allow them just to set up assembly units they can set up assembly units in Hong Kong or Taiwan far more cheaply.  By encouraging them to introduce the research and development side of their industry into this country we can keep them here far more easily.  That is one of the problems that faced the industry at Fermoy, and it was so easy for them just to pick up bags and move out when circumstances were not to their liking.  To imply that it is the fault of this administration that factories such as this closed down does no credit to the people who are being put out of work. We must look at the underlying reasons and come to some agreement on them.</P>
    <P>Before going on to what I have prepared on this item today I would like to say <Col N="270" /> that recent statements which have been made again today in the House by Opposition spokesmen that the ills of our country have been brought about by this present administration are quite untrue. We can sit down, examine, discuss and come to conclusions as to how we get out of the grave problem that we have, but just to offer top-of-the-head remarks and solutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not have to tell any Member the projects in Cork that will benefit from that.  There will also be a new scheme for social employment, providing jobs for the long term unemployed in the next 12 months and a new training and placement scheme for the long term unemployed to be known as the alternance scheme.  It has also been announced that a pilot project will be set up in Cork under the auspices of the Youth Employment Agency, to be known as the community training and employment consortia.  That scheme will link the education authorities with community organisations and improve the co-ordination of effort between these groups.  An additional £1 million will be allocated for educationally disadvantaged areas.  I know that Deputy Wallace is aware of the areas in Cork which will benefit from this.</P>

      <P>For meaningful progress to be made in the Cork area it is essential to continue to stimulate and support a positive community based initiative.  Any proposals made should not be perceived as a handout but as an instrument for the people to maximise the job creation potential of national and local resources and promote the area to this end.  Apart from immediate action required on specific fronts the ideal way to harness and co-ordinate the use of local resources would be to form a Cork development authority, perhaps as a follow through to the Government task force.  This body would be similar to SFADCo and would offset many of the influences they have abroad.  It would make a significant input to policy in the area.  It would have the capacity and freedom to act, have access to adequate resources and be accountable locally and nationally.  The establishment of a body which would merely monitor and report would be a useless exercise and would not receive my favourable consideration. Some of the key resources available should be borne in mind when <Col N="277" /> considering the context in which the Cork development authority is being proposed. We have great facilities and potential in Cork.  We have a deep water harbour with 1,200 acres of land in public ownership adjacent to it.  We have an international airport which is capable of being extended.</P>

We have a regional technical college with emphasis on technical education and business studies. We have the most sophisticated AnCO training centre in the country.  We have natural gas at our disposal and an oil refinery with extensive storage facilities and a deep water berthage.  There is massive potential for future development.</P>
      <P>Ringaskiddy must be our priority at present as well as areas within the city which have been designated as special areas for incentive grants.  As regards incentive grants, statements made in the Cork area recently that the delay in establishing and setting up these special areas has been instrumental in creating job losses are irresponsible.  I am glad the Minister clarified the position yesterday when he said that within two months of making the announcement the matter was in the hands of the EC.  Base political advantage has been taken of the position and many inaccurate and untrue statements have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy got his answer on the issue yesterday.  With national commitment, the Cork area could become the cradle for major industrial enterprises and its development and promotion for heavy industry would have major spin-off benefits for the entire region.  Since the announcement by the Minister earlier this year I have been told that interest in the Cork industrial region <Col N="278" /> and in Ringaskiddy has been amazing. The number of inquiries and visits by foreign industrialists to Ringaskiddy has reached an all time record.  The announcement by the Minister of the duty free zone, which was opposed by the Leader of the Opposition, and the announcement of special areas for grants has attracted this interest.  To say that we can create industries overnight because we announce these schemes is unfair to the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectives of such a Cork development authority would be to ensure the realisation of the potential for economic development in the greater Cork area as a location for manufacturing industry particularly port-orientated industries.  It would maximise and highlight the potential for employment opportunities in Cork.  It would promote the growth of small indigenous industries throughout the south-west region.  In such a plan we could not take Cork in isolation.  The whole of the south-west is <Col N="279" /> tied up in this.  It would develop the tourist potential of the south-west region and promote the area at home and overseas.</P>
      <P>I ask that the ferry between Cork and Wales be given the go ahead at an early date.  I appeal to the Minister for Communications to do everything possible to ensure that the ferry runs this year, which is the 800th anniversary of the granting of the charter to Cork.  It would ensure the growth of the harbour and airport for trade and passenger services.</P>
      <P>In the pursuit of its objectives a Cork development authority would be better able to act as a watchdog or early warning system for potential redundancies and closures.  It would contribute to the resolution of problems between potential industrial developers and objectors or concerned community groups.  I have made my views known on the question of third party appeals especially when areas have been zoned for industrial development.  A further role would be to stimulate action on derelict areas.  I am glad that the economic plan complements one of the objectives I am putting forward for this authority and that is that next year's Finance Bill will contain a tax incentive for the refurbishing of houses and multiple dwellings.</P>

      <P>The issues discussed in the RTE &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on Thursday last were fully known to the Government at the time of the publication, last May, of revisions to the balance of payments and national accounts statistics.</P>
      <P>This is obvious since I dealt with these issues in my contribution to the debate in this House on the revisions on 31 May last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach advert to the crucial aspect of this matter, that is, that the same person who prepared the paper for the Central Bank, Dr. Honohan, in which he outlined the doubt that arises about many of these statistics, particularly in the export area, was also the principle author of the document, <i>Building on Reality</i>?  Is it not extremely serious that in preparing one document, not only did he not advert to the contents of the other but did not mention the doubts that existed about the validity of the figures in the second document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are no principle authors of national plans.  They emerge by a rather more complex process.  The point the Deputy seems to miss is that when Dr. Honohan wrote the article he was then in the employment of the Central Bank.  That was in February last and he was seeking from outside the system to identify problems in respect of the national accounts and industrial statistics which subsequently were identified and dealt with in the revision published in May last.  It happens that he was first on the mark as it were, even from outside and without the benefit of inside knowledge, in identifying these problems. While he did not have the benefit of precise knowledge of how CSO figures are prepared, he also quantified, as it turned out in retrospect, almost precisely the scale of the revision of the figures required. All that was dealt with in the House in May last and I am grateful to Deputy <Col N="281" /> Haughey for drawing the attention of the House to the fact that my economic adviser had the skill and prescience to identify this problem at a time when others had not done so.  The implied compliment is one I receive gratefully on his behalf but other than that I am not clear as to what point the Deputy is trying to make.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's capacity for bluff is becoming increasingly enormous. On the question of the economists and the authorship of the plan my information, which has been confirmed in a number of directions, is that Dr. Honohan was the principle author of that plan. In that connection would the Taoiseach not regard it as significant that the six or seven economists who have left the Department of Finance in the past 12 months have been at pains to point out that they had nothing to do with the preparation of the plan?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to deal with these points.  The figures used in the national plan in respect of balance of payments and so on are, of course, the revised figures which were published in May following a revision by the CSO to deal with the very issues raised so presciently by Dr. Honohan from his position outside the system in February last.  Every revision made was taken into account so far as the figures in the plan were concerned.  The Deputy is well aware of that and should not attempt to suggest otherwise.  He refers, too, to the six economists leaving the Department of Finance.  The Deputy made the flagrantly unjust, absurd and cheap allegation that six economists had left the Department because they were in some way dissatisfied with the manner in which the plan was being produced.  A journalist approached the six economists to discover whether there was any truth in the allegation but each of them pointed out that they had not been involved in the preparation of the plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has often addressed a public meeting himself and, I might add, with considerable effect.</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not advert to the fact that since the document was published an increasing number of persons, experts of one kind or another inside and outside the public service, have thrown serious doubt on the validity of the statistics, projections and assumptions in the document?  Would he not also advert to the fact that one of the principal authors of the document was aware of certain dubious elements in the statistics in his capacity as an official of the Central Bank, and that nowhere in the document published &mdash; this is what I fault him primarily for &mdash; did he infer that there might be some doubt about the statistics and the figures he was using even though he himself had prepared a very careful paper illustrating clearly where the doubt lay? That is what the Taoiseach has to answer. After all, it is the same man who prepared both documents and yet in the second document he makes no reference whatever to the doubts which he clearly expresses in the first document.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is very complimentary to Dr. Honohan in suggesting that he prepared the national plan.  He was one of a number of people who worked on it and the Deputy is over-kind to him in this respect.  He did a lot of very useful work on it but the Deputy should not overstate the position in that respect.</P>

      <P>I have nearly given up trying to get anything through to Deputy Haughey.  The paper in the Central Bank was prepared and dated last February. Following that, a revision occurred of the relevant statistics which validated the order of magnitude of the revision indicated by Dr. Honohan.  I think Dr. Honohan mentioned a figure in the order of 5 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in regard to the GNP and the revision effected was in the order of 4 per cent.  The same applies to the industrial figure so what he had suggested turned out to be correct.  The figures in the national plan are revised figures &mdash; revised after a full examination of all the material available by the CSO, discussed and debated in this House on 31 May very fully and which stand as the most accurate available data upon which to base plans in this country, just as plans in all countries are based on the available national accounts and balance of payments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's further supplementary gives me an opportunity to reply to a point I missed earlier.  He referred to Mr. O'Leary as a member of the board &mdash; he is not a member of the planning board, he is an economist working for them.  He indicated in that programme that he was concerned about the existence of high profits based on transfer pricing.  The Government were fully aware when the industrial policy document was produced that the transfer pricing mechanism can affect the question of how much of the value added in certain industries is retained in this country.  If the Deputy carefully reads industrial policy, he will find that the wording there in respect of using value added retained in Ireland as a criterion of successive policy was consciously based on the analysis referred to by the Deputy in regard to Mr. O'Leary and Dr. Honohan.  I am more than happy to be able to clarify that point as well for the Deputy.  If the Chair permits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is satisfied with the quality of cement being imported; and if it is up to Irish standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I continue to be concerned at the quality of imported cement.</P>
      <P>The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards operates a certification scheme for cement complying to the Irish standard for cement.  Manufacturers certified by the institute under the scheme are licensed to use this standard mark. The use of this standard mark is an assurance of high quality.  The scheme is open to both Irish and foreign manufacturers. An Irish manufacturer is licensed to use the Irish standard mark.  Two Northern Ireland companies are licensed in respect of the re-importation of Irish manufactured cement.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about claims that imported cement complies with the Irish standard for cement, IS 1:1963, when, in fact, it does not satisfy the standard.  These claims are being investigated by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Where a purchaser has doubts as to the quality of imported cement, he should request Irish certified cement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is telling us that he is only now investigating the matter, when about 50,000 tonnes have already come in?  Is he aware that there are many foreign producers selling here who have no access to this licensing scheme?  Is he satisfied regarding the quality of imports from foreign producers? Are they licensed under the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a voluntary scheme.  People are free to sell cement in this country whether it complies with the standard or not.  However, if they claim that it complies with the standard when it does not, then they are liable to prosecution. As soon as Irish Cement <Col N="292" /> complained to us that some people were claiming that their cement complied with the Irish standard when this was not the case, action was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when so many cement products are being imported, is there any way to monitor the quality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a ready-made system of monitoring, namely, the existence of an Irish standard.  If people are buying cement I strongly advise them to buy it only when it is stated to comply with the Irish standard.  If it is claimed to comply but it does not, I am quite sure the licensed suppliers will be quick to complain, as in this case, and ready procedures exist through the Director of Consumer Affairs to bring them to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the extent of penetration of the Irish market by foreign cement manufacturers?  Is it open to the Minister to provide by regulation or otherwise for a certain standard in relation to imports of foreign cement?  Can the Minister make a regulation to ensure that only cement up to that standard will be permitted to come in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the supplementary does not, strictly speaking, arise on this question.  However, I can tell the Deputy that Irish Cement supply 95 per cent of the market. Secondly, I have powers under the Act to make mandatory standards only where matters of human safety are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that if a person wanted to have a product tested he would have to bear the expense himself and that it would be fairly costly?  People are buying products which may contain cement which is not up to the Irish standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have answered that.  If it is not claimed to comply with the Irish standard a person buying it does so with his eyes open, knowing there is a <Col N="293" /> risk.  However, if a person buys something which falsely claims to comply with the Irish standard I am quite confident that the competitors who are complying with the standard will be quick to complain about that abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.  I have considered the report of the review of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards by the National Board for Science and Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My response to the main findings of <Col N="294" /> the NBST review was set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy, published on 12 July 1984.  Copies of the White Paper were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The White Paper stated that the future role of the institute in industrial development is as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  the seeking out of companies and sectors where product and process improvements will lead to significant output growth and quality improvement &mdash; Chapter 13, paragraphs 5 (iv) and 17;</P>
    <P>(b)  the identification of opportunities for technology transfer and linkage. To this purpose IIRS staff will be transferred to major IDA offices abroad.  A special unit has been established within the IIRS with specific responsibility for linkage &mdash; Chapter 5, paragraph 18; Chapter 10, paragraph 7; Chapter 13, paragraphs 5 and 13;</P>
    <P>(c)  the intensification of the institute's advisory services for the promotion of quality control &mdash; Chapter 10, paragraph 11; and</P>
    <P>(d)  to assist in the promotion of small industry, IIRS technology specialists are being located in all of the IDA regions &mdash; Chapter 10, paragraph 14.</P>
    <P>I have asked the board of the institute to implement this revised role without delay.  I have also asked the institute to proceed with a number of other operational changes arising from the NBST review.</P>
    <P>The NBST also considered the question of the overlap of services between the institute and An Foras Forbartha in the environmental field.  I have decided that the present institutional arrangements are the most effective.  The role of the IIRS is concerned with ensuring that industry can meet environmental standards whereas the role of An Foras Forbartha is purely regulatory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that if this report is soundly based it is scandalous that a body charged with <Col N="295" /> giving good management advice and assistance to a wide range of firms should themselves be so poor in organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say anything in my reply to suggest the inference contained in the Deputy's remarks.  I know there have been certain individual instances where the institute has been subject to criticism, including some from myself regarding a building they constructed at a cost above that intended.  However, every organisation in the course of its life needs to have an infusion of new ideas and a period of self-criticism, including perhaps criticism from outside, so that it may renew itself.  I do not see that necessary and normal process as in any sense giving grounds for despondency within the IIRS and among the many people within that organisation who work very conscientiously for the benefit of Irish industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to it in the last paragraph of my reply.  I have decided that the present institutional arrangements are the most effective because the IIRS is concerned with helping industry to meet these standards, whereas An Foras Forbartha is in the role of a policeman looking at the matter from the penal rather than the facilitative angle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans at present to introduce legislation to ban below cost selling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will know, the subject <Col N="296" /> of below cost selling in the grocery trade has already been the subject of a public inquiry by the Restrictive Practices Commission. The commission, in their report, came out clearly against such a ban which would effectively, represent a form of resale price maintenance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Small Businesses considered this matter recently and made special reference to it in their report published last week?  They came out strongly in support of a recommendation that the Minister should reconsider his position in regard to low cost selling.  Would the Minister agree that it is common legislative practice in most other European countries that there is a ban on low cost selling and that all the major multiples in this country have indicated their support in having this matter legislated for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My primary interest in a matter of this kind is that of the consumer who is anxious to obtain a product at as competitive a price as possible, and I am sure the Deputy shares that concern and that that was the view he held when he was in my area of responsibility as Minister. I have to admit that I have not yet read the small businesses committee's second report which is a very detailed and comprehensive document setting out recommendations on a host of subjects of which this was only one.  I have read the recommendations but one can never judge the recommendations in any report without reading the text.  I would not wish in any way to appear to be dismissive of a report prepared with such care, but that report was prepared by a small businesses committee whose specific mandate was the concern of small businesses.  The Government and this House, while they have to take into account the concerns of small businesses, have other wider legitimate concerns to take into account as well, such as the concern of the consumer and I will be studying the report with <Col N="297" /> great interest with that wider consideration very much in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's concern so far as the consumer is concerned, but the point at issue is that, while most of the multiples would have been against the introduction of this type of legislation in the past, they have clearly indicated in the report that they are for it because they feel it would protect the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This makes me even more sceptical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister further agree that the market share of the multiples has grown enormously in the last ten years.  It now stands nationwide at 58 per cent of all sales and in the Dublin area it is 81 per cent?  Would the Minister not agree that the market share being controlled by a few multiples is undesirable and that the consumer needs protection from what might turn out to be a monopoly by the multiples?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a wider question. While the figures the Deputy gives may or may not be correct &mdash; and I am sure they are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not argue with that because I am sure the Deputy is right, but I must point out that there is intense competition between the multiples and there is no question of there being an monopoly.  I have available to me very extensive powers under the mergers and monopolies legislation to act to prevent monopolies or even dominant positions being created through mergers. The local authorities already have extensive powers in the Planning Acts to regulate the creation of new supermarkets where they might be considered to be a threat in the existing fabric of the community in a given area.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to designate Wexford for higher grant purposes. I am satisfied that the Industrial Development Authority are making every effort to attract new industry to <Col N="301" /> County Wexford and these efforts will be maintained.  In 1983, job gains in County Wexford exceeded losses by over 100 and manufacturing employment increased by 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>A number of existing companies have been assisted by IDA to expand their operations and have increased their workforce as a result.  The IDA have also worked closely in assisting a number of takeovers which has helped to maintain jobs in the county.  The IDA are making special efforts to promote small industry activity in the county and special units for this purpose have been provided in Wexford town, Enniscorthy and Gorey.</P>
      <P>Other facilities which the IDA is actively promoting for new industry are two 40,000 sq. ft. factories in Wexford town and a 28,000 sq. ft. factory at New Ross. Land totalling almost 200 acres is also available for future industrial development at four locations in County Wexford.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that at present there are 6,500 people approximately unemployed in the county, that is, one in five are out of a job?  Why is the Minister consistently refusing to designate County Wexford which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country when other areas that have a lower rate of unemployment have been so designated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Government took office the rate of increase in unemployment in Wexford has been well below the national average whereas when the Deputy's party were in office it was above the national average.  That is an indication of our concern in this matter.  I have also pointed out that manufacturing <Col N="302" /> employment in Wexford increased last year and this was during the tenure of office of this Government.  I do not happen to believe it has much to do with who is in office.  I think much depends on the activity of people in Wexford and the IDA but as the Deputy has introduced this partisan matter he should check his facts a little better.</P>

      <P>It seems to me the Minister is not aware of what is going on in Wexford.  This may be because he refused to meet Wexford County Council on a number of occasions.

      <P>So far as meeting Wexford County Council is concerned, they happen to be one of two county councils in the entire country whom I have met with regard to industrial development.  I do not think that having the same meeting and using the same arguments with every county council is a useful exercise. Because of the intervention of Government Deputies in Wexford who were particularly concerned that I should meet their colleagues on Wexford County Council, including those from the Deputry's party, I agreed to do so.  I have met Wexford County Council to discuss the matter and I am glad to say that since then the rate of manufacturing employment creation in Wexford has been among the best in the country.  Further, I do not accept the statement of the Deputy that the low level of grants has anything to do with the situation.  Any project in Wexford that needs support gets it under the present scheme.  Unfortunately what is lacking is a sufficiency of new projects.  I <Col N="303" /> hope the Deputy will use his considerable influence in County Wexford to encourage people who have ideas with regard to setting up industries to do so.  As I have indicated in my reply, there are facilities such as advance factories and land available to anybody who wants to set up an industry in the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The embargo on public service recruitment, first introduced in July 1981, will continue to remain in force throughout the period of the national plan, and applies to all non-commercial State bodies.</P>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála at present has ten fillable vacancies three of which are for sales and marketing executives.  I am advised that these vacancies will be filled by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>I am at present in consultation with Córas Tráchtála regarding the staffing arrangements necessary to enable that body to implement the proposals relating to export marketing contained in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate the number of foreign sales executives operating under the aegis of CTT outside <Col N="308" /> Ireland at this time?  Would he further indicate if an application has been made for CTT to increase the number of these executives in the market place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would be fair to say that CTT have been applying at all times for more staff.  I have not got the information as to how many of the CTT staff are located overseas.  I can get the report for the Deputy.  I expect the CTT annual report will be published in the next three weeks, or so, which will contain all this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the shortage of executive staff is not having any adverse effect on promotions by CTT?  Is he satisfied that the shortage of staff is not an impediment to their function of selling?  If he is not satisfied, will he take action which is required to ensure that this body are not hamstrung in any way because of the lack of these executives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a very brave man who would say that if CTT were to get more staff they would not be able to make good use of them.  I am quite sure they would achieve extra exports if they got these extra staff.  I am not saying I am satisfied.  However, I am also well aware that CTT like every other Government agency must work within the embargo.  The embargo is there for very good and well-understood financial reasons.  I fully support the application of the embargo to CTT.  I would like, if I could and if circumstances were to change, to provide additional staff for CTT.  I have to say that is impossible at the moment because we have anembargo for broader well-understood and good reasons.  As the Deputy is probably well aware, it is my intention to provide additional funds for CTT to implement the many new responsibilities they have been given in the White Paper on Industrial Policy next year and in subsequent years during the period of the national plan.  I share the belief which I know is widespread in this House that we need to have <Col N="309" /> greater emphasis on export marketing which we were discussing this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that his reply is inconsistent with the stated aim in the national plan of generating more export markets?  Since we are so dependent on exports, does he not think there is a justifiable case to be made to have the embargo lifted in the area of export promotion?  For that reason, and because of the fact that we are seriously short of sales executives abroad, would he not consider applying to the Government to have the embargo lifted from CTT?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was anywhere in my view where it would be a good thing to lift the embargo it would be here. I am not prepared to recommend the lifting of the embargo because, as the Deputy knows, if we lift the embargo from one body we have to lift it from them all.  There is no end to the demands and very good cases made why body X, body Y and body Z should have more staff.  I am afraid I cannot change that position as of now.  However, I will continue to do whatever I can within the overall constraints of Government policy to obtain more financial resources and, if possible, more staff for CTT.  I agree they are a key element in the drive to provide more jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the lack of sales executives in CTT is keeping Irish industry from reaching its full potential in job creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could never be sure whether that is absolutely true.  I would be inclined to believe that if CTT got more staff they would make good use of them, and would get more exports for us. There is always a point beyond which you cannot provide more staff because all staff cost money.  They are paid for by the taxpayer and you are into a trade off between the additional benefits of additional staff and the additional disbenefits <Col N="310" /> that the cost of paying them would cause in taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy could produce one instance where that was the case.  I want to give him the overall picture.  So far as the major company are concerned, their prices in the period for 1976 to 1984 increased by 174.9 per cent, whereas the consumer price index for the same period increased by 223.1 per cent.  Therefore the increase in the price of school books supplied by the <Col N="312" /> largest supplier was below the consumer price index.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures on which I am basing my question are supplied by school teachers.  They have given me a fairly detailed breakdown and I can supply the Minister with that, for his information.  They clearly indicate that from 1980-81 to 1984-85 there has been a 100 per cent increase in the price of a range of books required by first year boys in post-primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very interested to get that information, with particular references to the books and the companies supplying them.  I have indicated that the pattern, in fact, has been the prices overall over the longer period should be below the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, could I ask the Minister if he will ensure tighter control on the pricing of books?  That is a cost which parents must meet every year, quite apart from the question of books being changed so often.  There would appear to be grounds for concern at the rate of increase in price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe in tighter control in this case.  That could not only cost the taxpayers money but can lead to greater price increases than would otherwise occur.  There is a damming up of price increases during a time when the company may be incurring losses and then when they come to get an increase it is huge, well above what they would otherwise have claimed because of the back-up of costs incurred in the period when the prices were kept down. Very often the maximum price set by the NPC becomes the minimum price charged in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competition in this area leads to lower prices.  The Deputy was not present when we were discussing another matter, resale price maintenance, but so long as you do not have a monopolist situation, which is important, competition is the best way of keeping prices down.  Up to now, this one company were subject to detailed price <Col N="313" /> control because they had such a dominant position in the market.  They decided for a 12 month trial period to go on a less stringent price control mechanism which I hope will lead to better competition and lower prices.  I know that the Deputy and, indeed, the parents on whose behalf he is speaking will welcome that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that we shall be able to resume the debate this afternoon in a calmer atmosphere than when I was speaking this morning.  I have said that there should be some balance to the influence which SFADCo have in the industrial scene here and I set out the influence that they have in siphoning away industry from other regions.  I said what I felt should be done in that region as a follow up of Government support of the task force.  I set out what I felt should be the structures of that authority, their role and objectives.  I said that one of these roles was to stimulate action on derelict areas and other negative aspects of the environment of such areas.  Some of the terms in the economic plan did just that and I mentioned those that would stimulate action on derelict areas.  The authority would be used to influence management-worker relations in situations where employment was threatened. That complements totally what the Minister said today in the closing part of his speech, that the prevailing &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude in industrial relations was seriously affecting certain areas of employment.  This authority would have a direct influence on management-worker relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, it would provide a definite link with the national development corporation or other appropriate bodies, at the same time having a definite local role. The authority would need to look, as a matter of priority, at the employment situation, naturally enough, in the Cork area.  Even though the Government have designated certain areas in that region for special grants and have identified Ringaskiddy as a duty-free port area, much more must be done.  Something must be done for underdeveloped areas like Cork.  They should be treated similarly to the Belfast area.  I advocate that the Cork area be treated as an integrated operation by the EEC in the same manner as Belfast and Naples in the past have been.  This would follow from a study done by a <Col N="371" /> UCC staff member in recent months.  Aid could be based on that survey.</P>
    <P>The Government have done much to generate employment in small industry in the Cork region in recent times by the setting up of a small industries division of the IDA.  However, much more could be done by making funds available for promotional video films for abroad, outlining the positive aspects of Cork and its resources.  I am glad that the Cork Harbour Commissioners have recently issued a very attractive publication which will be sent to all areas abroad outlining the attractiveness of the Cork region and setting out the special grants and incentives which will be available to industries in that region.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of appealing for a reconsideration of the recent decision by the Minister for the Environment not to go ahead with the public inquiry for the low river crossing between Blackrock and Dunkettle.  There is no point in pretending that that project will go ahead within the next two or three years.  It is a programme earmarked for the late eighties or early nineties.  It would have a 62 per cent labour content.  At this stage, the preliminary work should be continued and the public inquiry should be held.  I have been asking the Taoiseach and the Ministers privately to reverse that decision and go ahead with the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The port and the airports in the region are important for the industrial wellbeing of the area.  All possibilities must be looked at for the improvement and expansion of services from Cork Airport. Aer Lingus must be pressurised or persuaded not to allow their policy and influence to preclude the introduction of new international services using smaller and more economic aircraft.  We met a deputation from Aer Lingus last week and I am always puzzled that they have to use large jets in and out of Cork going to the British mainland.  I have always felt that it would be more economical to use smaller aircraft.  There must be an improvement in the navigational aids in Cork Airport and early consideration must be given to the runway facilities <Col N="372" /> there.  If we have not an airport that can get industrialists and goods out of the area fast, the attractiveness of the area is diminished.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the Estimate and the implications it has for the Cork area. I ask the Minister to consider seriously the suggestions I have made in relation to the development authority for the Cork region.  People say that setting up authorities for regions is counter-productive and that you are just attempting to pull industry from one region to another, but I have been worried for a long time at the influence that SFADCo has for regions like Cork.  The results of that influence are there for us all to see.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity of speaking on industry.  I was taken aback in the forenoon to hear Deputy Allen bring it to a local level debate and to such small issues as basketball courts.  We have a very serious situation in the Cork area where we have lost industry after industry.  Some of our proudest industries have suffered under this administration.  We should be talking seriously about the creation of solid jobs that can bring our very high unemployment numbers to lower levels.  The Deputy went around in many circles and into the areas of communications and unemployment, and he spoke about such things as a ferry development.  We have been discussing the development of a ferry service for the Cork region for some time and we have not seen any concrete proposals or suggestions coming from the Government.  I am convinced that with a very small subsidy there would be a very large pay back on that ferry service if it was reintroduced.  We cannot allow the grass to grow under our feet at this time of the year when many of our hotels and people in the tourist industry are making preparations for the coming season.  Since it has been dragged into this debate I urge that the Minister use his influence with the Government to see that this ferry is initiated immediately and developed so that people can prepare the necessary plans and documentation to bring the many tourists back to this island to do <Col N="373" /> business in the Cork region.  This matter has been raised in this House.  The financial loss to the area over the past year has been very serious for many hotel people and small industries.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about the Cork area, SFADCo and industrial ghosts.  We do not have to go to the Shannon area to find industrial ghosts.  They are numerous in the Cork area.  We have lost our textile industry at Youghal.  This present administration lacked policy in the development of the oil refinery at Whitegate and they show lack of commitment to develop it further.  The dockyard is still in existence but possibly the 500 jobs there are now threatened, and this is an area of glorious opportunity for further development. We have seen the development of a very fine fishery protection vessel, a P.21, and we could have sold easily a further fishery protection vessel to countries of the Middle East if this Coalition Government had had the will to go ahead and grant permission for the manufacture of that at that fine shipyard development which has excellent machinery and equipment unique in western Europe.  Many of the people employed there and many people in industrial business in this country are worried about the future of that shipyard if it is not put into proper care and maintenance.  It is still working, all is not lost, and I appeal at this late hour for some concrete developments as a result of very serious talks with the management and board of that company so that we can build another fishery protection vessel which can be marketed to some Middle East country.  I understand that some research has been done in this area but the follow-up was not great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the IDA, I read in last Sunday's <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> about the massive expenditure of £4.5 million and I thought that the whole industrial structure and the problems of 220,000 unemployed people are not being taken very seriously.  We should have decentralisation of the IDA; the IDA should come down the country where the problems and the unemployed are.  We should have much more regional thinking within the IDA.  There is no point in having a large <Col N="374" /> number of people locked away in big office blocks in Dublin very far removed from the real problems.</P>
    <P>I am glad that my colleague, Deputy Myra Barry, has sought to raise on the Adjournment the closure of the high technology factory at Fermoy.  This has come as a great shock and a great surprise to all of us because we believed, and the Taoiseach had said, that the development of industry in the Cork area depended upon high technology industry.  We have a number of bodies dealing with industrial research and development such as the IIRS and the National Board for Science and Technology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we been getting the real, true high technology industry in this island?  We have lost out.  We have seen what is happening in the very modern development in the Cork area at Fermoy.  Is the budget that we have in that area sufficient for development?  I am thinking about the National Microelectronics Research Centre in Cork which has a mere seven of a staff and a budget of £0.6 million, and we take the budget for the whole industrial scene as something in the region of £433 million. It is time that we had more serious investment in this area of research because this is where many of the jobs we will be looking for in the years ahead will be created.  If we have not a serious approach in that area we are only wasting our time with an investment of a mere £0.6 million.  As someone who is fairly new to this House and to the political scene, I am surprised that we must transfer moneys that have not been spent in one section of the IDA to the other section.  It looks like a three-card trick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> If you look further at the Cork-Kerry region you will see that we created a certain number of jobs last year.  I talk about those created from our own natural resources.  The number of jobs created in that area was 1,850 but less than one-third of those came from agriculture or handcrafts.  We must take a serious look at that type of development.</P>
    <P>There are too many agencies involved in the industrial area.  I understand that 23 different agencies, which cost the State £433 million in 1983, are involved in the industrial sector.  One agency is involved when industries are being set up, while Fóir Teoranta, the rescue agency, is not called in until a company gets into difficulties. Why is it necessary to have two organisations dealing with industries at those stages?  Is it not true that there is a great waste of taxpayers' money in this area because of a lack of co-ordination?  I do not think the staff from the IDA, Manpower or the county development teams would understand the problems faced by a family business employing about 20 people and it is unlikely that any representatives would call to see such concerns.</P>
    <P>Most of our small industries are family concerns and the organisations I have mentioned should have the staff to give advice to them.  The owners of such concerns have many problems to cope with. They must deal with the financial position of the company, the management structure and the production scene.  Those people must be given assistance by advisers from State agencies.  CTT have done a good job in promoting exports but the IIRS, the NBST and the National Microelectronics Research Centre should be amalgamated.  The budget of the latter agency is not what it should be if we are serious about attracting such industries to the Cork area.  AnCO is the training organisation for many industrialists.  That excellent organisation has done great work down the years.  It must be developed further if our young people are to get basic training in management and production skills.</P>
    <P>The other bureaucracy, the Youth <Col N="376" /> Employment Agency, is in competition with AnCO but has not done anything satisfactory in the area of job creation.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he was having discussions with the multiple trade on the question of food processing.  Our food processing industry has been allowed to slide and we have an overdependence on selling goods into intervention.  Our suppliers are held to ransom by the multiples who seek large concessions.  The Minister has gone about dealing with this problem in the correct way and he deserves praise for his efforts. We are all aware that bulk imports are not satisfactory.  Many small industries such as those involved in textiles and footwear have been put out of business because of bulk imports.  That must be corrected but I accept that the Minister is dealing with this matter in the right way.  This side of the House will assist the Minister in every way possible in dealing with this.</P>
    <P>The cost of energy is hitting all industries.  I understand that energy costs are between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the total cost of industries.  In my area three of the largest food processing industries which process approximately 40 per cent of the country's total milk supply have failed to get a satisfactory deal from An Bord Gáis.  Many people are employed in those industries which are involved in downstream processing, something that must be encouraged.  I urge the Government to give preferential treatment to native industries and co-operative societies.</P>

      <P>Any assistance given to the industries I have referred to in regard to energy costs would be a welcome shot in the arm for them.  We must look at their employment record and what the future holds for them.  We know the problems there are in agriculture but it is one area where jobs can be created.  The cost of natural gas should be examined.  I do not believe in giving it away but the charge should be realistic.</P>
      <P>I am sad and worried about the Cork area.  I understand other Deputies wish to contribute but I cannot let the opportunity pass without referring to the closure of the Dunlop plant.  This was most unexpected.  Was there enough consultation with the management and board of the company?  Did the Minister and the IDA make efforts to continue the operation? We know that there were problems with the Ford motor company but we did not know there were problems with Dunlop.  When this company closed it killed the life of Cork.  A further explanation is needed.  Was there sufficient consultation between the industry, the Government and Government agencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's application to the House for the Supplementary Estimate for the IDA.  This organisation is primarily concerned with employment and manufacturing industry.  They have had an injection of confidence since the Minister took office. He has succeeded in giving them a fillip which has been translated into action in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency when the chipboard <Col N="378" /> factory in Scarriff failed financially for the third time the IDA put a package together and I am glad to say that next week a new company will start in full production.  My only regret is that there will not be the same rate of employment. However work will begin again and the east Clare area will manufacture chipboard for the entire community.  I congratulate all those who undertook this.  It was not an easy task because the Departments involved pulled against each other. The Department of Fisheries and Forestry and other Departments were not conditioned to help the company.  However the IDA, as they have been doing, put a package together which I hope will prove to be viable and profitable for us in Clare.</P>
    <P>In their 1983 report the IDA said that five or six companies per week were coming to them for assistance.  They said they had enough expertise to put 100 rescue packages together with the aid of Fóir Teoranta.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to the IDA.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in office the IDA were asked to put a package together by Deputy O'Malley but they refused.  The result was that the chipboard factory went under, which had been predicted by the IDA.  We can rely on the IDA's expertise.  The honesty with which they approach matters has to be commended.</P>
    <P>There should be greater emphasis placed on attracting companies which would provide service industry jobs.  I am thinking of industries such as those located at Shannon, for example, Guinness Peat or the Universal Insurance Company.  These service industries could locate here very comfortably.</P>
    <P>We have great facilities in Clare and in the mid-west region.  We have third level education in Limerick, good schools and open fields.  The high technology industry which the IDA have concentrated on in recent times is responding in the mid-west region to the promptings of the IDA.  The Taoiseach recently opened a major unit for Wang which is acknowledged as being a major development. High technology is far more advanced in <Col N="379" /> the US and in Japan.  A recent study conducted for the EC revealed that out of 42 different types of high technology industry, Japan leads in 13, the USA in 34 and Europe in two.  Any company locating here is at a disadvantage in that the greater part of research and development is done in the Far East or the US. In the EC and particularly in emerging countries such as ours there is a great need to update research and development. The IDA in conjunction with other EC agencies should examine any proposals in high technology or research and development programmes.</P>
    <P>The workforce, particularly in the mid-west region, have proved themselves to be very efficient.  Industrialists who have started new industries and research and development units have been agreeably surprised at the quality of their employees.  I hope the IDA will continue to expand in the services and high technology areas.  I hope they will bring about a reduction in the unemployment rate.</P>
    <P>What is most disheartening about a debate on the IDA is that criticisms are made about them and about companies which have failed.  We hear all about what should or should not be done but we hear very little about policy.  We do not hear whether the IDA are promoting a policy or spending too much money buying land for the development of advance factories in certain areas.  We do not hear if the land was bought properly or not or how policy is devised.</P>
    <P>The IDA require the assistance of the locally and nationally elected representatives. They should assist the IDA to bring us out of the mire we are in rather than cringeing and whingeing the way they did this morning.  I know that Cork has received reasonable aid.  Some of the companies that closed there were national monuments.  However, national monuments and big factories closed in my constituency and there was not a word about it.  We got on with the job.  The mid-west is the only area which has not shown a major loss of jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the IDA and SFADCo for their work.  We are delighted to have them.  I want to see them continue to work in the US.  The role of the IDA in attracting industry from abroad has been criticised but nevertheless it has been satisfactory.  They have brought in a range of various manufacturing industries some of which, especially on the chemical side, are heavy industries. There is an abundance of natural resources in the mid-west region.  The Shannon Estuary offers great prospects and if there is a major development role for SFADCo the Minister should consider putting them in charge of that development. An appeal on those lines was made by Deputy O'Malley on the last occasion on which we were debating the IDA.  I supported the Deputy then and I reiterate that call now.  Such bodies as the Kerry, Clare and Tipperary county councils and the Limerick Harbour Commissioners should co-operate in the development of the estuary and thereby make possible the establishment of heavy industry there.</P>
      <P>During the year we welcomed the opening of the Alumina plant at Aughinish. When Moneypoint comes into operation there will be full power on the north side of the Shannon.  In the context of the Minister's linkage proposals he should consider using the services of SFADCo and the IDA to bring together all the various agencies so that in a unified way capital resources for the development of the Shannon Estuary can be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall I am satisfied that the Minister is moving in the right direction but I agree with other speakers that there is a need for greater and immediate action in the area of import substitution.  Perhaps SFADCo and the IDA could come together in this respect, too.  There are moves in various areas of the mid-west region towards import substitution.  I understand that, for instance, in north Tipperary the Junior Chamber of Commerce are sponsoring a competition which relates to food processing.  I am <Col N="381" /> not saying that there is major confidence in the mid-west area but there is a return of some element of confidence there.  I am confident that the implementation of the national plan combined with the efforts of the IDA and of other State agencies will result in bringing us out of the recession we are experiencing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally the Opposition are the ones who are accused of being negative and of undermining the morale of the people but in the past week there have been three significant statements from Ministers which are likely to have a detrimental effect on the morale of our people.  I hope that in the short time available to me I will be able to make some contribution to raising morale and to pointing to a better way.</P>
      <P>The first statement I refer to is the one made yesterday by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism when he said that in the past five years there has been a 135 per cent increase in unemployment.  We all know that most of that has happened in the past two years.  While the Minister was stating a fact, he was helping to undermine the morale of the people.  The second statement to which I refer was made by the same Minister today when he said that, despite the growing levels of grant for the IDA, the level of employment in manufacturing industry is declining rapidly.  Again, all that is fact but it is not helpful coming from a Government who should be promoting a climate suitable for investment.  The third statement &mdash; and the one on which I shall base my contribution &mdash; was made within the past week by that harbinger of good news, the Minister for Finance.  He acknowledged here, for the first time, that our levels of direct taxation are the highest in Europe and that our levels of indirect taxation are the second highest in Europe.  The reality is that, taking both those factors together, we can boast of the highest levels of taxation in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While those three major admissions point to the problem, they also suggest <Col N="382" /> the solution.  Speaking today about foreign companies the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism said that they have located in Ireland rather than elsewhere because we offer the most attractive package of incentives.  Put simply, that means that the reason they invest here is that we are paying them more of the taxpayers' money than is the case elsewhere.  It is fine to pay taxpayers' money at the level at which we are paying it if it results in extra employment.  The only justification for a package of incentives or for the role of the IDA is the generation of employment for our people in their own place, but the reality is that it is all the other way.  There was a promotion effort today in which there was a certain input from the Government and understandably so in terms of trying to attract foreign industry, particularly US based industry but we are told that while US firms account for 40 per cent of manufacturing exports, they account for only 18 per cent of manufacturing employment. That represents a big gap between the ratio of exports and the ratio of people employed in those companies.  It is a matter that we must give our attention to.  We are told that there was a significant growth in output and in industrial exports but the Minister has acknowledged that at the same time there is a serious and continuing decrease in manufacturing employment.</P>
    <P>Why are we providing these incentives? Are they for the purpose of giving employment in our own country or simply to allow the Minister quote such statistics? Today, too, the Minister told us that 55 per cent of the profits of overseas companies are repatriated.  We knew that 12 months ago following the black hole saga.  We appreciate that if we are to attract these companies we cannot lock up their profits but the figure for the repatriation of profits does not tell the full story of what the taxpayer is contributing since those profits are tax free, the extra subsidy being provided by the Irish taxpayer who, properly, is interested only in the jobs that are generated at home.</P>
    <P>On the question of finding a better way, I admit that there were some such <Col N="383" /> indications in what the Minister said but not many.  First there is the matter of tax levels.  Is it any wonder, our being at the top of the tax league in Europe, in the past couple of years particularly, that the key personnel we require to reside here and to work in areas such as product development, especially in the technologies and in marketing, having regard to the need to promote our marketing expertise, do not want to know about us? Of course they have regard to what they would pay here in personal income tax compared with what they would pay in the US or in Britain.  We have no hope of promoting the kind of added value required through product development, through marketing, and through the skills of top level executives by attracting them in, much less encouraging them at home, while we have penal levels of taxation which do not compare with anywhere else in the world.  That must be corrected.  I suppose we all tend to repeat ourselves and sometimes even to quote ourselves but I have been screaming about this for the last two or three years.  Even now it does not seem to have sunk in that the hostile tax climate here is doing so much to frighten away all kinds of activity sought by the IDA, which uses so much taxpayers' money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy any evidence of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have lots of evidence but I have not time to make the Deputy aware of it now.  It has been quoted in all the business magazines and is a reality.  The Deputy will find evidence in the Minister's speech this morning referring to profits which have been repatriated. He said that in many cases profits in Ireland are absolutely necessary to offset the developmental costs incurred abroad.  That is an interesting statement. Why should those developmental activities not be undertaken here?  The reality is that the added value is in this new era of techniculture, developmental programmes, technologies, pharmaceuticals and so on.  If we are to be satisfied simply with the assembly line we are in danger <Col N="384" /> of becoming the lego centre of Europe with regard to technology.  The work guarantee is elsewhere and we put the pieces together.  It is not surprising that we hear of cases like Fermoy.</P>
      <P>We must encourage marketing in all its forms through our taxation system by screaming for this.  This is an appropriate word to use as it is the approach I adopted when we were discussing the Finance Bill earlier in the year in terms of marketing personnel.  There is no incentive in our tax system for marketing personnel to penetrate the markets of Europe in the food or any other industry.  They do not reach out and exploit markets.  We can talk about CTT or any other body but until such time as those who are in the field will not be penalised as they are under our current tax system for their marketing promotion efforts, then we will fail.  The opportunity, through a package of incentives for those engaged in marketing for a certain portion of the year, is so obvious as to be crying out for recognition from the Government.</P>
      <P>Apart from the levels of tax, the tax allowances discriminate against employment. Every £100 under the current tax system invested in capital equipment will probably cost the promoter £50.  For every £100 invested in employment and labour it will cost the promoter £150. We have a penalty ratio of three to one against employment in favour of capital and we prate about priorities for employment. Our tax system, loaded with PRSI, levies and so on, is penalising employment as against capital or equipment and we had better decide soon which direction we want to travel because the purpose of any industrial development programme should be to increase employment rather than penalise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor which can and must be recognised is that local firms at present are only supplying 16 per cent of the value of goods, components and services of foreign based industry here.  I have to admit that the Minister has focused on that and is proposing at least to offer incentives to improve the position.  However, let us look at the state of indigenous industry.  Unfortunately, the level of <Col N="385" /> liquidations in indigenous industry are running at a rate even in excess of last year: in the first nine months up to 80 more than last year and, by the end of the year, we will top 750.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you and I know about this in our home town where the factory as it was always called, is gone.  Perhaps we will resurrect it but nothing can ever replace it.</P>
    <P>The ESRI and the CII have indicated recently in their surveys that their members feel that there will be a further fall in jobs in the manufacturing industry in the coming months.  It is the indigenous industry that is more labour intensive.  I am not saying we have to stay in the world of old Adam; we must move with the times and attract foreign investment but we must do it on a measured basis to make sure that we get added value here. We must promote the marketing personnel and we must guarantee that it cannot switch, as it has done, to wherever there may be a more attractive set of incentives from Puerto Rico to Singapore.  If the highest bidder gets it we are building on quicksands.</P>
    <P>Let us admit that there is a limit to what all these State agencies can achieve. They are growing like mushrooms and they are killing the very people they are meant to help.  Could we please bury decently the National Development Corporation which has been talked about for the last three years because we were told today by the Minister that we are not going to use the £7 million which was provided for them this year?  The total grants to the IDA amout to £280 million of taxpayers' money and we have factory bays lying idle all around the country.  Is it any wonder that the Minister says he is switching from building grants?  No one wants to come into the factory bays.  It is no wonder that the IDA says to swtich from factory building.  We have lots of factory bays but do not have any jobs.  It is not surprising that there was a switch of £90 million from building programmes. We should save that money as there will be no more building programmes unless and until there is a change of Government <Col N="386" /> policy.  We must create a climate to encourage investment either abroad or at home.  We must concentrate on the guarantee areas such as added value, marketing and the product developments. To achieve this we need a sense of identifiable, clear purpose which represents a complete reversal of all the existing confusing policies which penalise investment incentives and effort, especially at home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to a considerable extent with the expressions made by Deputy O'Kennedy.  However, I must express concern at his suggestion that because Ministers told the public the facts <Col N="387" /> about unemployment and our tax situation they were in some way undermining morale.  Surely we have not reached a stage where the Opposition would encourage the concealment of such facts? It would be a very sorry day if that was to be the mark of how you build up morale.  I hope he did not mean what he said.</P>
      <P>I should like to address my remarks to the continuing concern about the contribution of foreign based investments in this country.  We have to acknowledge the importance of foreign industry which employs 80,000 people.  We must also bear in mind the widespread public concern about the repatriation of their profits rather than reinvestment and the highly footloose nature of some of these enterprises. Today in Cork we had the collapse of one of the industries supposed to be on the leading edge of technology.  That must be a very worrying development because it is a very short period since this industry was first established here.</P>
      <P>We must also be concerned about the low value added and the tax contribution. The fact that there is a considerable amount of transfer pricing operated by these companies means that even the figures we have on value added may be overstating the position to some degree. I do not know the full details.</P>
      <P>There is concern also about the serious shortfall by these companies from the targets they set up for output and employment. In that context the Minister has introduced a number of measures to increase selectivity in the way grants are handed out to such companies.  It is important to realise that grants are not the sole form of aid.  A writer recently pointed out that only half the aids to industry are in the form of grants while the other half are in the form of tax relief, training and assistance from the ICC, Fóir Teoranta and other sources of State funding.  There is need for a much more serious examination of the true impact on the economy of foreign industry than we have had to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the greater selectivity the <Col N="388" /> Minister hopes to apply but I am somewhat concerned about the slight vagueness of the terms which describe this selectivity.  We need to know in greater detail what companies are saying they will achieve and to what degree they achieve their targets.  We should limit the aid we give them to the achievement of those targets.  That type of selectivity would have a cutting edge and the mere restatement of the desirable features of foreign companies is not enough.  We must go a step further if we want to make selectivity a reality in choosing foreign industry.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the importance of continuity in the form of grant aid.  I also acknowledge the greater effort now being made to develop linkages by these companies but we must investigate how they are affecting the economy and link the money we give them to actual performance.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other important points.  Deputy O'Kennedy touched on one of these points but regrettably he did not develop his thoughts.  The question is whether our tax regime has been unduly encouraging the wrong sort of investment. There is an excessive bias in our tax regime towards property-type investment to the detriment of employment-creating investment.  We have had concessions for many years towards development of flats and special concessions to pension funds, house building and mortgages generally but we have failed to step back at any stage and ask what this is achieving.  Are we not encouraging savers to channel their money into property, which does not create employment, rather than into employment-creating investment?  We must examine the tax regime in that area.  Reform would cause a lot of headaches because many people have entered into contracts built on those reliefs.  It is important that in developing industrial policy we should look at the wider issues and not confine ourselves only to the industrial agencies under the aegis of the Department of Industry.</P>
    <P>In the same way we have an unfortunate feature in our tax system whereby we encourage companies to take on <Col N="389" /> machinery rather than give employment. The PRSI issue is not primarily a matter for the Department of Industry but in an overall look at industrial policy we must be conscious that we are putting an improper bias on the way people in industry decide to use their investable resources as between employing labour and employing machinery.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat confused by Deputy O'Kennedy's reference to the need for greater marketing and greater franchising of new technology and research.  He did not refer to the important new initiatives in the White Paper on Industrial Policy in precisely those areas.  I welcome those initiatives but I would sound a warning.  It was stated recently that it would be very difficult to distinguish between the new technology grant and the old re-equipment grant.  In conception the two are entirely different.  One is designed to bring an entirely new type of technology into the country and to develop small companies to franchise it from abroad, whereas the other was an improper grant which was very often made available to companies to substitute for employment.  The terms under which that grant is administered must be carefully drawn up to ensure that the money made available is not used for re-equipment at the expense of employment but is actually bringing brand new technology into Irish industry.</P>
    <P>One of the very welcome features in the White Paper is the introduction of much closer performance tests on bodies such as the IDA.  This is crucially important, particularly as the White Paper envisages giving IDA executives much greater scope for personally deciding the sort of things that should or should not be assisted.  If we are giving such discretion to State companies there must be much greater scrutiny of their performance and I am a little concerned about the general considerations listed in the White Paper as to the tests of performance. These are such things as employment creation, output creation and the general features of industry.  We must go a good deal further and look for a comparison from the likes of the IDA of <Col N="390" /> the targets set by incoming companies and their performance.  If the IDA are grant-aiding foreign companies setting up here and they state that they will achieve a certain employment target or bring in certain research and development facilities or new skills, these should be quantified and made the basis on which the IDA executives are tested at to their performance. That is the sort of information the public need in order to say whether the IDA and other agencies are living up to what is asked of them.  We cannot allow a feeling among the public that the IDA are trying to get off the hook in regard to employment targets by their new approach.  That new approach is the correct one.  The IDA must look for net domestic value added rather than employment as the sole criterion.  However we must fix that target and force them when they grant aid to pin down what they are grant aiding.  Against those standards let them be judged.  In the same way it is important that other State agencies have very visible performance targets against which their performance would be judged.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister has included in the reports on the IDA actual employment rather than the somewhat fictitious employment figures we got in the past.  That is a step in the right direction but we must go a good deal further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and coming from the midlands I also welcome the opportunity to discuss how the IDA have been operating.  The IDA seem to have great difficulty attracting industry to the midland region.  We have a great deal of unoccupied factory space in many major towns.  In Birr we have had a 24,000 sq. ft. factory idle for some years; in Edenderry, 13,000 sq. ft. factory space is idle; in Tullamore town factories which have been built by the IDA have been idle for years, in Portlaoise there is a 40,000 sq. ft. factory which has been unoccupied since it was built, four years ago, and SFADCo built a number of small units in west Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How have the IDA been performing? <Col N="391" /> It seems to me and to many others that the IDA are leaning in favour of foreign industry rather than towards the Irish person who wishes to set up an industry. I have noticed in some cases where grant aid was approved for small industries that between 18 months and two years elapsed between the time of the approval and the actual payment of the grant.  The delays were caused by all kinds of legal difficulties, accountancy problems and red tape of every shape and size.  I want to warn firms that when this grant aid is approved, there will be a delay.  Some companies who got approval for grant aid borrowed almost the full sum from their banks, but when the money finally came through they had to pay all the money to the bank plus very high interest.  I think these companies should be warned.</P>
    <P>Our tax rating is very unattractive to employers because of the amount of paperwork they have to do.  If they are employing large numbers they may have three staff members looking after this paper work dealing with the Revenue Commissioners and others.  Companies I know are not recruiting extra personnel. They are letting their existing staff do overtime rather than get involved with more paperwork if they employ extra staff.  The different levies, different VAT rates and tax bands take up a lot of time and when the employee receives his pay cheque he notes all these deductions. This problem will have to be tackled and we must introduce a simpler form of taxation.</P>
    <P>When the IDA approve certain projects it is interesting to hear the number of new jobs involved, 100, 200 or whatever the case may be.  I have noticed that the jobs targeted in these plans have not materialised.  The other evening a company went into liquidation.  That company was supposed to employ more than 200 people but that target was not achieved. Other companies which had been grant-aided have fallen well short of their targets.  I would like to see actual jobs being created, not numbers out of a hat. As I read the situation in many cases these targets are not materialising.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> The foreign companies that have come to the midland region have served us well and I am happy with the employment they brought.  If these firms are in the export business it is attractive to set up here, but if they are producing for the home market it is not, because the tax base is different.  In the midland region unemployment was never as high as it is at present.  Recently the mineral waters plant belonging to Williams closed and there is nothing to take its place.  Other small companies in the region have got into difficulties also and this is having a major effect.</P>
    <P>The young people do not see much hope for them and emigration is hitting the midlands regions.  Some of our well-trained personnel are leaving for other countries because they do not see any hope for them here.  That is very sad. Some of the courses arranged by the National Enterprise Agency and the Youth Employment Agency are only what I would call &ldquo;standby&rdquo; employment. Real jobs are not being created.  Many people who do these courses have told me that on completion of the courses they are back to where they started.  I am referring now to the Youth Employment Agency and to AnCO.  I should like the Minister to note that in the midlands region we are the hardest hit and the unemployment figures will show that. New industries have not come to Laois-Offaly in recent times and factories that were built three years ago are still unoccupied.</P>
    <P>Something must be done to give hope to young people.  I hope the IDA will look again at the midlands region and see what can be done to improve the situation.  In my opinion they are biased against our region.  I hope I am wrong in that but that appears to be the position. My information is that there is nothing in the pipeline for the midlands region and inquiries are practically nil.  All the industrialists are encouraged to go elsewhere. I hope the Minister will bring to the attention of the IDA the serious situation of the midlands region and give some hope to the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this supplementary Estimate which deals with the area of industry and commerce but I am of the opinion that the whole area of foreign industries needs to be looked at.  I have been a trade union official for the past 15 years and there have been situations where those of us in the trade union movement suspected there was much room for improvement in the whole operation of giving huge grants to companies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connolly referred to the difference between job approvals and the number of jobs created.  We have always looked scathingly on the announcements that accompany such grants.  At the opening of a factory there is a temptation for any Government to put as good a gloss as possible on this and I have no doubt that the shrewd Americans who know the value of a buck better than any of us play up this side when they are looking for money.  I have a distinct recollection of one occasion where, as a trade union official, I was invited to the opening of a factory in the mid-west region.  The man who got the grant flew his own plane from America and he was like the Sheikh of Araby coming in with a white silk scarf around his neck.  It was all very impressive with big dinners and so on but he was nothing more or less than a glorified scrap merchant.  He went into the foundry business and employed the magnificent number of three people.</P>
      <P>The days of the outright cash grant are gone forever.  In the 1960s we had a policy of industrialisation when there was a move away from the land as the basis for employment and there were large labour-intensive industries.  There are some excellent industries like that still with us. One I can think of is the Krups electronics factory which employs in excess of 1,254 people.  I shudder to think what would happen to Limerick city if anything ever happened to Krups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must get value for our money.  We must put it to the foreign companies that they have to deliver on what they say, whether in terms of jobs promised, value added or in downstream sub-contracting work which would be of indirect benefit <Col N="394" /> to the economy.  I was very worried at the investigation by Pat Cox in the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme at what would appear to be a racket and which certainly confirms all the suspicions of the trade union movement as to what is going on by way of transfer pricing.  I am aware that some of the companies in the mid-west region run up huge expense accounts at some hotels.  While this is excellent for the hotels there is no doubt there is a vast amount of &ldquo;uisce faoi thalamh&rdquo; going on. There should be much greater scrutiny by the national job-creating authorities than has been the situation up to now.  In saying that I want to pay tribute to the IDA.  Other Governments have commented on the effectiveness of that body. However, we must remember that we are dealing with very shrewd people in the multinational companies.  Operating in this country there are cover industries where there is nothing more than one official of a company and one secretary. They are being used by the bigger companies as transfer agencies purely for tax evasion.</P>
    <P>I am speaking from memory but there was the case of a girl some years ago who, to her eternal credit, refused to falsify documents alleging that certain goods had been passed through.  She was dismissed and she appealed her case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and won. She had been wrongfully dismissed.  That is happening on a fairly significant scale. The IDA and SFADCo should look at it very closely and introduce stringent criteria in the case of a repayable loan where they do not develop the original proposal in terms of jobs, or value added, or downstream contracts.</P>
    <P>The days of the give away grants are gone forever.  There has to be greater accountability.  Home industries, especially those engaged in import substitution, should be given every support.  Even if they fail, at least the money is kept here. None of it finishes up in Puerto Rico or the Bahamas or the other tax havens. The money goes on a circular transfer basis and the Irish people get value for their money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> As Mayor of Limerick and coming from the mid-west region I am concerned about the references to other parts of the country.  I accept fully the need for a political development in Cork because of the traumatic suffering they have undergone by way of job losses over the past year or two.  While in relative terms the region of the mid-west is almost doing better than most other areas, in my own city of Limerick there is still an unemployment black spot.  I cannot understand the insinuations and derogatory references to SFADCo as being a cause of concern or danger to other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Outside of what they have actually delivered, SFADCo have performed a unique role as a second job creation agency apart from the IDA.  They have the kind of flexibility which they have demonstrated so admirably in the past to roll very quickly in a new situation.  They can adapt and try out new pilot schemes which can be put into effect on the national scene when they have been tried and proven.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have done this notably under the small industries programme, but there is much room for improvement.  I worked on several committees with the socialist groups in Europe over the past 12 months.  The small industries programme will be a huge factor in solving the unemployment problem.  I do not want to sound in any way dismissive of some of the comments made by the Opposition, but it is not true for them to say we are not doing enough about employment. They should remember that against the day when they may be sitting here.  It is very useful to fall back on some of the statements made.</P>
    <P>Technology is racing ahead at such a pace that some of our most fundamental political philosophies might seem to need to be updated against the real politik. Almost 20 million people are unemployed in Europe.  None of the Governments there, whatever their political complexion or hue, can solve that problem.</P>
    <P>I am talking about the role of <Col N="396" /> SFADCo.  One of the great philosophies of the Common Market was that it was based on the optimisation of the indigenous resources of the region.  When you go to Europe and listen to all the trite comments on doing something about the peripheral regions it is very upsetting when almost nothing worthwhile in terms of employment is done.  I know the commitment is there to do something through the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>In the mid-west we have one of the great natural resources of the continent of Europe.  I am talking about the Shannon estuary.  In order to qualify for the grants which are undoubtedly available from the Regional Fund and the Social Fund something has to be done.  We can only get those grants on an estuarial basis, not on a Limerick basis, or a Clare, or a County Limerick, or a Kerry basis.  When the Minister brings in that authority something can be done for the whole region.  We can introduce the kind of industries which can be locked into the economy there.  We have to concentrate on this.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the question of transfer pricing.  If you couple that with the black hole which was discovered earlier in the year, you realise that there has to be a tightening up in regard to what we are getting for our money.  There must be a strict cost benefit analysis. There is no doubt that somebody is playing very costly games with the Irish taxpayers' money.  People are fiddling the system.  The IDA, SFADCo and the Department of Finance, or whoever is responsible, should keep the closest possible eye on what is happening.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made for strengthening Fóir Teoranta.  We must be lenient when we are dealing with a case such as we have in Castlemahon, County Limerick. The whole economy of that region is tied into poultry breeding.  Fóir Teoranta may be looking askance at that because of a past poor performance record.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions are rightly critical of the national plan.  We need not look to private enterprise to solve our unemployment problem <Col N="397" /> because that will not happen.  With the deepest possible respect and consideration for our friends on the other side of the House I want to say that I recall distinctly when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, said in January 1981, following a national wage agreement, that he looked to the private sector to create jobs.  The FUE said job creation was not their function.  Job creation will be their function only in so far as it is ancillary to their objectives or they cannot avoid it in their whole objective of making profits.</P>
    <P>We must have high tech. industries.  We have to place on record our appreciation of what the National Micro Electronics Application Centre, The Plassey Technological Park and the NIHE have done to induce companies like Analog Devices, Verbatim and others to come in here. They should be encouraged to provide facilities.  We have now gone into a fifth generation of new technology.  They breed very quickly.  I would be worried that some of these companies might pull out at short notice and go back to the Silicon Valley in California.  The primary consideration of any Irish Government must be in terms of jobs for money spent. That has to be the bottom line.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that I shall not require ten minutes to refer to the matter, but it is appropriate for me to speak on this debate.  I am going to follow the Irish proverb which says that if you have something in small measure you are far better concentrating on one point.  The point on which I am going to concentrate refers to my constitutency.  I hope that the Minister when replying will be able &mdash; and I am sure he will &mdash; to give me a satisfactory answer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Prendergast spoke about the costly game being played with taxpayers' money.  In Finglas, as the Acting Chairman knows, there is an 11 acre site which was zoned as an industrial development site.  We had there a very prosperous factory giving employment to a thousand people &mdash; Janelle Wear.  Unfortunately, this firm met with the difficulties experienced by all industries a year or two ago and were obliged, notwithstanding the invaluable assistance which they got from Fóir Teoranta, to close.  The 11 acre site and the buildings thereon remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am putting to the House is that the IDA had invested taxpayers' money in those buildings and site and Fóir Teoranta had done likewise.  Nevertheless, the site and the buildings have been extinguished and removed from industry because of a decision of the members of Dublin Corporation to give permission to the building of a shopping centre on that site.  When there was such a proposal and if the IDA invested money in that industrial site, as they correctly did, and if the IDA are obliged to be concerned with every opportunity of providing employment and would know that in all that area of west and south Finglas there is at the moment an unemployment rate of something like 35 per cent and a great labour force, then why did they not indicate to Dublin Corporation the investment made by them of taxpayers' money in that site?  If they are interested, as they should be and are obliged by this House to be and to be concerned all the time with the provision and protection of <Col N="399" /> employment, how is it that they have allowed a situation where there is no other remaining site in that whole area? There is not any point in our coming here and voting moneys for any organisation that feel free to spend it at will.  They must be conscious of, and if not must be reminded of, the obligation that rests upon them to protect the investment.</P>
    <P>I have on one or two occasions visited the IDA and have always been made to feel welcome, but if we continue to vote moneys without expressing our concern and without reminding the IDA that they must show us that they are a responsible organisation in the matter of the protection of that investment, then we must put question marks behind them.</P>
    <P>I know that other matters have been raised here and I am not expecting that the Minister will devote any great time to this or might have the necessary information with him here, but I will be very disappointed if he cannot indicate to the House why the taxpayers' money, the investment in that industrial site, was allowed to disappear in that fashion. They were excellent buildings, and at the time the case was being made for the transformation of that site into a shopping centre.  One thing which that area of Finglas does not require is a shopping centre, because the people have no money to buy what they would want in the existing shops.  Any additional shopping centre there will inevitably react on the jobs of people already employed in the existing shopping centre.</P>
    <P>There are other questions of planning which allows for the exodus of so many hundreds of cars onto a dual carriageway. However, leaving all those other considerations aside, I am asking the IDA to indicate where they were when their investment was being set aside.  Where were they when something was going on which affected the spirit of their existence in the matter of safeguarding the existing employment potential?  Here I am in the happy position of knowing that when I speak for myself I speak for the Acting Chairman, as one who has the honour of representing that area.  I do not want <Col N="400" /> to labour the point beyond that.  I am mindful that I said initially that I was not going to take the ten minutes available to me.  I hope that the fact that I do not repeat it <i>ad nauseam</i> will not take away from its importance.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister, when replying, will indicate if, having made an investment, the IDA have no longer an interest in it.  Mindful of the fact that an 11 acre industrial site has been extinguished, do they not feel it incumbent upon them to protect the potential employment? When it was mentioned by the promoters of the shopping centre that the IDA no longer had any interest in it, why did that authority remain silent?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Estimate before the House this afternoon. In doing so, I should like to take the opportunity of complimenting the Minister, his Department and the IDA on some tremendous work done in recent times.</P>
      <P>At the risk of being branded parochial, I would first like to compliment them on the tremendous work that they have done in my constituency in Clare in seeing that the Chipboard factory in Scarriff will reopen next week.  There were many difficulties there and a very fine job has been done by the IDA and by the Departament of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and of Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Scarriff, a package was put forward by the previous Government. The IDA advised against that package and forecast that it was doomed to failure.  They proved to be correct.  The package which has now been put together and the project which is developing in Scarriff will be a very successful one.  We in Clare &mdash; and particularly in east Clare &mdash; are extremely grateful to the IDA for the tremendous work that they have done there.  Indeed, it could be said that the entire mid-west region has been very fortunate that it has not suffered to the same extent as other parts of the country have and the IDA, in conjunction with SFADCo, can take some of the credit for that.  Let me in the course of this debate mention that in the future the traditional <Col N="401" /> policy adopted by the IDA may not stand.  As many speakers have said, we are in the era of high technology and the degree of development taking place in high technology at the moment is astounding.  The policy adopted by the IDA, SFADCo or any other development corporation must take these factors into consideration.  It is upsetting to hear that in the high technology area the US are away to the forefront, followed by Japan, and in Europe we are very much behind.  That is unfortunate and we as a peripheral country on the European scene must view it in a very serious light. We cannot look to the future for the same type of full employment as we have seen in the past, largely due to the development of high technology, and our entire approach must change.</P>
    <P>SFADCo in the mid-west region have done tremendous work in the small industries section, and for success in the future we must put much more effort into developing small industries and industries that are home based and based on our indigenous produce.  From experience throughout the country we know that foreign companies have come in, been highly grant-aided and within a few years have left this country.  Somebody who is a native of the country will have far more commitment to the country and will be far more prepared to make a real success in this area.  Therefore, every effort should be made to support our native entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the future the IDA will take far more seriously requests particularly from younger people who have a great deal of talent but not much money. We have the ability within the country, we have the talent in our people, we have a very well educated young people who can be used fully in the development of this country, but we must be aware of our talent and also of the restrictions we have in this island of ours.  It would be useful if the Minister in his reply would give us some idea of the number of foreign industries that have come into this country over the past ten years, the number of jobs that they have promised on coming in and the number of jobs they <Col N="402" /> produced.  In my experience I have come across many industries which came in and started by employing 20 or 30 people with a promise of having perhaps 100 or 200 employed in a year or so.  In very many cases that has not happened.  We cannot afford the luxury of grant-aiding companies who come in on a promise of producing so many jobs in a number of years. That situation cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Some small industries have proved extremely successful, but other companies have come into the country and their after-sales service to the country to which they are marketing their produce is extremely poor.  The IDA would do well to research in detail the after-sales service of many companies set up here. Coming from Clare and driving through Newbridge I saw the Polaroid factory, a really wonderful establishment, being set up there and then folding up.  At the time that factory was being set up a number of people said to me that they could not understand why the IDA were doing this because the reality was that in America their business was on the downturn.  Why was that type of support given to that company at that time?  I thought that another company which was set up in my constituency was an excellent company with a great future, but somebody in business pointed out to me that the future of that company was very much in jeopardy because their after-sales service in Europe was extremely poor.  The IDA should do more research into the background and history of these companies. Against that, they made a very wise judgment in not allowing the De Lorean company in here.  We must balance failures against success stories.</P>
    <P>One natural asset that we have which has been mentioned by previous speakers is the Shannon estuary.  It is one of the finest waterways in Europe, not alone in Ireland.  For the future of this country the IDA, the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and SFADCo would do well to examine seriously the potential of the Shannon estuary because major industry, particularly heavy industry, can be attracted to <Col N="403" /> that region.  The Shannon estuary needs very coherent and close examination. SFADCo, who have done such a good job in promoting industry in the mid-west, should be given a heavy responsibility in monitoring, overseeing and attracting industry to the Shannon estuarial area which includes County Kerry, County Clare and County Limerick. There is great potential there but it needs some industrial body to monitor and oversee the future development of that fine waterway.</P>
    <P>We could talk about many areas here this evening, but I understand we are restricted by time.  Therefore, I will confine my contribution and take the opportunity again of complimenting the IDA on the tremendous work they have done.  I advise them to be aware of the future because of the high technology that is developing so rapidly, to take into consideration the fact that over 20 million people are unemployed in Europe, that Europe as a continent is not to the forefront in high technology and that we, a small country on the periphery of that continent, need to be cautious and aware of the limitations set upon us and so concentrate on smaller industries, on industries based on home produce and on export substitution.  I compliment the Minister and his Minister of State on the very progressive, logical, farseeing approach that they have adopted within their Department.  They are doing a tremendous job and I have no hesitation in supporting the Estimate before the House today.</P>

      <P>According to the Minister, on 9 June 333 small industrial units were vacant in the country.  In the Shannon region there were 111 and in the Cork region there were eight, excluding the Shandon Craft Centre which had only been opened.  Deputy Prendergast was somewhat critical in his remarks about Deputies on this side expressing concern about some regions getting more attention than others, and he can be quite justified in expressing such concern.  I add for his benefit that some of his colleagues <Col N="404" /> in the Coalition benches were equally critical and concerned about this situation. The debate this morning became very wide-ranging, particularly regarding the Cork region.  I would like to refer to a few of the points raised.</P>
      <P>The Mayfield area in Cork was referred to.  It is on the eastern side of the city and has a population of 20,000 or more.  It has no industrial development of any description and no factories employing any local people.  I understand that the plan originally formulated was that the development of an industrial estate in Little Island, County Cork, would cater for the needs of the Mayfield area.  Time has shown that that was not good planning. As a representative for the Cork area it appears to me that the IDA do not have any commitment to that part of the country.  In areas such as Knocknaheeny, Churchfield, Mahon, Togher where there is a mixture of corporation and private houses, industrial estates with small units are operating.  For some reason we have not been able to convince the IDA that Mayfield is entitled to similar development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members on the Government side referred to the fact that this matter is the subject of a motion for debate at a meeting of Cork Corporation.  I was the first Member from that area to highlight the problem in regard to Mayfield and I am critical of the IDA in regard to it. When we get in touch with the IDA we are informed that if people want to build a factory in Mayfield services will be provided for them.  The job of the IDA is to establish industries in an area and not be asking outsiders to do their work for them.  We have been told that the Kilbarry industrial estate which is about 2 miles from Mayfield should satisfy the needs of the area.  I reject that.  The Minister should use his influence with the IDA with regard to that area.  There is no doubt that the IDA have played a major part in the industrial development of other areas.  Last February the Government sent a high powered delegation to Cork when some major industries were closing down but we did not hear very much about that task force since. <Col N="405" /> Government Deputies from the region proclaimed loudly about what will happen following the presentation of the report of that task force.  While I accept that it takes time to deal with such matters it should not have taken so long to do something about the problem in Cork.</P>
    <P>We have been told that some areas will be given special assistance.  I am worried about some of those areas.  In the Hollyhill and Knocknaheeny area there is no more land available for industrial development and that is why I question the sincerity of the Government's commitment regarding the unemployment problem. The absence of a ferry service to and from Cork has created problems for those trying to attract industries to the area.  If it is not possible to get in or out of an area by sea there is little point in spending money on public relations trying to attract industrialists.  I understand that negotiations are taking place to try to encourage the Minister to provide a ferry service for next year when the city will celebrate its 800th anniversary.  Many tourists are expected in the city for those celebrations.  The Government should provide the money needed for a ferry service.  It is imperative that the IDA be able to tell prospective industrialists that they can get to Cork directly without having to travel through Dublin or Rosslare.</P>
    <P>The services provied by Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta for the Cork area are important.  The Minister of State is sighing at the thought of me dealing with those companies but had he been present in the House this morning he would have heard a statement from one of his colleagues on the national plan.  That should not have been allowed.  If his colleague was given latitude this morning there is no reason why Members on this side are not given the same latitude.  The IDA are not identifying the Cork areas that are in need and the Minister should ensure that the money being voted by the House today is spent in the best interests of the entire country taking into account the fact that the Cork region has suffered severely in recent years.  This morning we heard a litany from the Government side <Col N="406" /> of all the good things that will happen and how we can all look forward to a bright future.  The Minister has told us that by 1990 we can all expect jobs.  Jobs are needed now and the IDA must play their part in getting industries to the Cork area.  Listening to a Government Member this morning we learned that a factory in Fermoy is to close.  Sincerity on the part of the Government is needed. I had not intended being so wide-ranging in my contribution but I had to answer the hyprocisy from the Government side this morning.  The Minister should ensure that there is closer liaison between the IDA and Cork local authorities who are endeavouring to identify the problems.</P>

      <P>Our industrial policy is in need of urgent review.  I admit that in the course of the last 12 months the Government published a White Paper on industrial policy and, more recently, a national plan.  I was happy to see in those documents a change in direction.  The White Paper recognises the danger of over reliance on foreign-owned industry. We need a secure industrial future based on our own resources and the skills of our people.  I am not decrying investment from any place.  In fact, I would welcome investment from any nation as long as it was credible and the company concerned had the necessary commitment to Ireland. As was pointed out to me on one occasion there is only one thing worse than multinationals, not having any of them.  While there is an element of logic in that statement we should not rely entirely on multinationals to produce the sustainable employment that is needed to take us into the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sought permission to raise on the Adjournment the closure of the Beehive International company in Fermoy but my request was refused in by the Chair.  That factory created great hopes for the area. It was badly needed and we looked upon it as a source of confidence in the future. The factory went into production in March 1982 in Fermoy which has infrastructural advantages over other towns. It is also an excellent work force and Beehive were quick to recognise that. <Col N="407" /> There was great harmony in the factory, but, unfortunately, two and a half years later the parent company in Salt Lake City are in severe financial difficulty. What is their solution?  They are writing the plant in Fermoy off their books.  It is as simple as that.  Those in Fermoy and the surrounding area depended on Beehive International.  This is a crisis for Fermoy.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the Minister yesterday about the problem.  I sincerely and strongly urge that everything possible be done by all the agencies to ensure either a management buy-out or a take-over by another firm. Time is not on our side.  There are only 60 days left before the company closes. If there is to be a management buy-out it will have to be soon.  We must have something to replace this firm.  The town has suffered from severe industrial hardship.  What was once our biggest factory, Faber Castell, now employs 20 people.  The closure of Beehive International is a major shock.  I appeal to the Department and the Minister to do everything they can to ensure that the factory doors are open again as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to deal with the unemployment and industrial development problems which confront us.  This debate is taking place against the background of a steady upward spiral in the number of people unemployed.  Between 60,000 and 70,000 young people under the age of 25 do not actively participate in the economic life of this nation.  They are probably the best educated young people to come through the system.  One thing successive Governments cannot be blamed for is their lack of commitment to education. At different levels we have developed institutions which provide ample opportunity for young people to obtain education which allows them to carve out a niche for themselves in whatever sphere they choose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an unfortunate fact of life that Government commitment to employment creation and industrial development <Col N="408" /> and to the encouragement of investment in areas where employment could be created has not been what it might be.  We have hundreds of thousands of people who are unemployed.  At the age of 40 unemployment means that a person's working life is finished.  With the advancement of technology and changes in the work place, skills acquired have effectively become redundant.  The opportunity to embark on a different course and become involved in a different type of work regime is not easy once one reaches that age.  The Government have a duty to ensure that those who have reached the age of 40 plus will not be thrown on the economic scrap heap. Their commitment to the creation of jobs has not been what it should be.  The task of creating viable jobs which will absorb our ever-increasing work force has not been tackled.  The priorities are wrong.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that work experience programmes have limited benefit. What we need are viable long-term jobs which will give people security and allow them to participate fully in the economic activity of the nation.  People can then build for the future.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has a knock-on effect. If a person is unemployed and does not have a satisfactory income their long-term plans are unsure.  <i>Building on Reality</i> does not give the hope and confidence that the country sorely needs.  The process of examining areas with potential for development was disregarded in that document.  Agriculture is one of our primary producing areas.  The farm modernisation scheme was withdrawn and later reintroduced in a restricted form.  Unless we ensure that raw materials are produced economically we will have a knock-on effect of greater unemployment in the services, processing, distribution and sales areas.</P>
    <P>If we look at the across-the-board, non-selective application of the public service recruitment embargo we see that ACOT, the advisory service for agriculture, is severely restricted.  An Foras Talúntais which carries out research and development which is so essential is restricted because of cutbacks in staff <Col N="409" /> with natural wastage and the fact that those who are involved in this necessary role are advancing in age.  The food industry is one which has been long identified by economists and political commentators as the real area with potential for job creation.  Yet the commitment to provide finance and a carrot by way of grant aid to those who wish to invest in this area has been neglected.  The national plan completely disregards this area.  There was an ideal opportunity to provide money and grant aid to encourage the development of this industry but that did not happen.  Research for markets, whether in America, Germany or wherever, has been severely curtailed.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the slaughtering and processing facilities which are available?  Are they of sufficient quality to ensure that the products coming through them will mean we have a ready road to the German and American markets?  Will we get licences to export to these areas?  Would it not be advisable to provide grant aid to bring these facilities up to the required standard? New processes have not been developed nor has any encouragement or motivation to do so been given.  Unless the Government wake up to what is happening and change course very quickly we will have social upheaval on our hands.  I hope that commonsense will prevail and that many of the proposals in the national plan will be re-examined and will be identified as merely short term measures to tide us over a particular political difficulty.</P>
    <P>In the minute or so remaining to me I shall deal with aspects pertinent to my constituency of Louth.  I come from a county that has a long and very proud tradition of industrial activity but anyone who examines the unemployment figures for the past number of years for the towns of Dundalk, Drogheda or Ardee will realise the neglect of those towns in terms of lack of commitment to investment for industry.  In addition we suffer the effects of the very high rates of VAT and of the price differentials as between the two parts of the country.  Dundalk, which is <Col N="410" /> the biggest provincial town in the country, is now a for-sale town.  That is a sad reflection on the type of economic policies being pursued by a Government who claim the ability to do so much. Neglect has been the order of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend making some comments that relate to areas which have not been mentioned already.  First, though, I welcome the Minister's plan for a common board for the IDA and CTT. However, I would ask him to think again about the National Board for Science and Technology.  I understand there are moves afoot to incorporate this body with the IIRS.  The terms of reference of the NBST make it particularly suitable as a body to act in an advisory capacity to the various committees of Parliament.  We are very much in need of a back-up service for our committees and for Members generally.  Instead of re-assigning the board to the committees of the Houses we are talking about abolishing them while the committees have to look elsewhere for back-up and research facilities. There is an obvious pool of talent which could be applied in a very supportive manner to Parliament helping the various committees to hold responsible both individuals and public bodies.</P>
      <P>Regarding tourism, while I have no objection to the kind of seminar held recently by Aer Lingus, I hope that people who are interested in tourism from the consumer angle should be given access to Dáil committees.  I hope that other boards will follow the example of Aer Lingus in what they have done.</P>
      <P>Regarding air fares, I cannot understand why the London-Dublin route should be so expensive.  It is one of the most used routes in Europe.  Apart from its usage by tourists it is availed of on a large scale by industrialists.  The fare on the route is much higher than is the Belfast to London air fare, for example.  I hope that a consultative procedure for consumers can be devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Still on the question of tourism, I trust there will be consultation with the interests concerned about the proposal to extend opening hours in licensed <Col N="411" /> premises during the summer season. There is a need for a clear explanation of this proposal so that the public may understand that the Government are not creating a situation that will give rise to a greater abuse of alcohol and, consequently, to a greater number of accidents on the roads.  I question the proposal to extend until midnight or 1 a.m. the licensing hours.  I say this because of the human psychology which urges one, after having two or three drinks, to continue drinking for another hour or so on the basis that he will be thrown out then anyway.  The situation on the Continent, for example, is very different: one can have a drink whenever one requires it. The question I am asking is whether we should be setting a closing time at all. Are we not encouraging people to stay on for that extra hour or so?  Whatever the thinking behind the proposal is, I should like it to be explained before there is an outburst of concern and hysteria on the part of those who rightly are concerned about alcohol abuse and about traffic accidents late at night.</P>

      <P>The Minister tells us that the number of IDA site visits by industrialists from abroad is increasing. That is a very welcome development but I should like to refer to one area that we might consider in this context.  In a short number of years from now there is to be a change of structure in the government of Hong Kong and I understand that there are many well-established business men there who are anxious to re-invest outside Hong Kong.  I am surprised that the IDA or CTT or the Minister have not set a specific target in this respect.  Those people in Hong Kong have millions of pounds to invest.  They have access to <Col N="412" /> other foreign markets and are capable of giving a good deal of employment but apparently there is a problem about even allowing them to come here on a three-month visa to investigate the possibility of investing in Ireland.  That is shameful. If a foreigner goes to the UK and has in the region of about £250,000 he will be allowed move in on the basis that so much of that money will go to the purchase of a house while the rest will be channelled into a business.</P>
      <P>In the light of the difficulties we are experiencing we should be exploring the possibility of those Hong Kong business men investing here.  I had great difficulty in getting permission for one such person to come here although the person concerned is involved with a business whose chairman is used to entertaining foreign Prime Ministers with a view to attracting foreign investors to establish here.  These people from Hong Kong are anxious to re-invest in Europe and we should avail of whatever opportunity presents itself in that regard.  That type of investment here would improve the quality of life of many of our workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a good deal about leadership or the lack of leadership in the country and inevitably this whole question of leadership is laid at the feet of politicians. While politicians are responsible in many respects, they are not responsible for everything.  There are others in the community with responsibility for leadership, too.  Included among those are industrialists. It makes me angry to hear some of our leading industrialists whingeing whenever they are asked to take a small share of the burden in these difficult times.  Many of these people between 1973 and 1977 were also very vocal in that regard.  I am sick and tired of listening to people who want the Government to take stringent measures which they themselves would not take in industry because it would create strikes.  However, they want us to take these measures in the public service which would create further unemployment.  It is time they woke up and realised that they also have a role to <Col N="413" /> play.  They should not expect the Government to buttress them against a small diminution in their standard of living.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister raised the question of a saving of £3 million on bread subsidies.  When the elimination of food subsidies was announced we were told that the bread manufacturers were going to put another 4p on the loaf and that that would be examined by the Prices Commission to see if it was justified.  I would like to know the outcome of that examination.  It was outrageous for bread manufacturers to put another 4p on bread at the same time.  Presumably it has been investigated, but what is the outcome? Why has it taken so long to be reported on?  Is it justified?  Where is the report?  I hope the Minister will take cognisance of comments made here today, especially in relation to Hong Kong, because I believe there is a great potential for investment here by that country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my support to Deputy Mitchell's remarks about Hong Kong.  Perhaps there is not such a rush out of it now because the establishment there are pleased enough with the kind of deal they got and do not seem in any hurry to get out.  I agree that we should, if we think we have a chance, try to attract investment from there.  We should be beavering away out there as we have many people from this country working in Hong Kong in various official capacities and they should be utilised to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not intend to speak on this Estimate but, as I listened on the monitor, I thought that perhaps the House needed a lesson in geography and that they should be reminded that there are other provinces besides Munster.  I know SFADCo and the developing region is important and that Cork also needs plenty of attention because of the disastrous industrial situation there.  However, there is the province of Ulster as well and that is why I came in to speak here.  It may sound facetious but that province tends to be forgotten.  The Industrial Development Authority <Col N="414" /> should direct their attention in that direction. The North East Regional Development Organisation, which covers Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, commissioned a special study for the development of that area, so the Minister and the Industrial Development Authority are not without a ground plan and an indication of where development should take place.  There have been one or two very bad areas there since the recession. If you look at the statistics, the percentage of losses might not appear to be great although there are a couple of closures in the offing in my county.  We are at such a low stage of development and have had such little development that it is very difficult for us to lose jobs when they were never there.  We are not losing from a full sack, so to speak.</P>
    <P>As well as the NERDO study there has also been an indication from the EC Committee of how development could take place and this was debated in this House.  The IDA and the Minister are aware of this and I am making a plea for attention for those two reports as a basis for industrial development.  In his speech, the Minister referred to foreign investment and Deputy Barry in a light mood said that there was only one thing worse than multinationals and that was not to have them.  We have not a great deal of foreign investment in our area.  We have the Pauwels-Trafo factory in Cavan town, which makes transformers, and which is a great boon.  We also have a factory in Mullagh on the County Meath border which gives substantial employment to about 500 people.  We are very pleased to have that kind of investment. The county development team and NERDO are very conscious of the potential of small industry and they were preaching the small industry philosophy long before it gained favour at higher levels, especially in the Industrial Development Authority.  Because we are small territorially we find it more difficult to catch the attention of the media but that is no reason why there should be neglect of the area.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> I am looking to the future with optimism. The decline in manufacturing employment is being halted.  Site-visits throughout the country by industrialists from abroad are almost one-third higher in number so far this year....</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has to do his best to bolster his Department and it is no harm to inspire confidence.  However, conducting Cooks Tours around places where there are advance factories is no substitution for industries delivered on the ground.  I do not think there is a basis for the kind of optimism which the Minister is preaching.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to increased production.  Recently there have been increased production and increasing exports, especially in the electronic and chemical industries.  However, to have that while at the same time the numbers employed in the manufacturing industry are going down seems to be cockeyed. Wealth accumulates, men decay, is an old saying.  You could reach a stage where you had the best performance in the EC and still had fewer people working here. I do not know what the general experience of the House is but in my own area, legally or illegally &mdash; mostly illegally &mdash; the trail to the United States is being hit by young people straight out of school. New legislation has been passed in the United States and we may have them all trailing back to us in the very near future when the authorities there catch up with them.  Productivity and export performance are highly commendable but the emphasis should be on employment of our young people.  It is difficult to see how we can get commitment from our young people otherwise.  We have in our region very advanced co-operatives and these can be the vehicles for development. I see a concerted move to attack our semi-State companies and I regret that I have not time to go into this.  In food processing we should concentrate on co-operatives and examine the import figures for food, especially potatoes. Nature has been more than lavish this year in supplying potatoes, beet and fruit. <Col N="416" /> Because of lack of processing I can see much of nature's bounty going to loss and certainly not being translated into increased employment.</P>
    <P>I regret that neither the IDA nor the Government have taken seriously the most hopeful and fruitful study of the employment and unemployment situation during the past 12 months.  I refer to the study produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute which not merely diagnosed what was wrong but pointed out ways to try to remedy it.</P>
    <P>I have said to this House several times already that even if we did everything correctly we could still suffer when the dollar hardens because of the crazy situation regarding international exchange rates.  The total GNP of the ten EC states is greater than that of the United States and there is a weapon to hand which could be developed, namely the ECU, so that we could have a currency with which to pay for oil.  We would not then have this crazy system whereby OPEC say that oil should be sold at 29 dollars a barrel. The spot price as of now is $27.90, but the dollar hardens, the country is down and customers, whether industrialists or ordinary users of oil, suffer due to rising prices.</P>
    <P>I have too short a time to develop a number of other points but I will conclude by calling the attention of the House to the fact that there is a province of Ulster waiting for development.  It has suffered severely during the past few years both commercially and industrially and it has a special claim on the attention of the House and the attention of those whose duty it is to develop our country industrially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent a constituency where there is an unacceptably high level of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  While the IDA did good work in South Kerry in former years their activities recently have been very few.  I would offer a few suggestions as to how jobs could be created in a practical way in the south and south-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is tremendouns potential in both agriculture and tourism and we have not <Col N="417" /> tapped these resources to the full.  The IDA should move into the area of agriculture in consultation with other Government Departments.  About 10,000 jobs could be created within a few years in Cork and Kerry by the setting up of food processing plants and the encouragement of farmers to become involved in intensive forms of agriculture and horticulture. Farmers involved in these activities would supply their produce to food processing plants managed by a public company. I should not like to see these plants being managed by a semi-State body. There should be a public company in which farmers, management and all concerned would hold shares.  Such a developmemt would give much summer employment to young people and would create the type of jobs necessary to keep pace with the numbers coming on the job market.  I spoke about this in the budget debate in 1983 and again this year and I mentioned it to numerous State and semi-State organisations, yet nothing seems to be happening.</P>
    <P>The south-western region is being grossly neglected in regard to tourism. Many additional jobs could be created in this industry if the will was there on the part of the Government, Bord Fáilte and the various other agencies.  The lead must come from the top.  It is scandalous, disgraceful and insulting to those involved in promoting tourism in Kerry and Cork that there is no ferry service during the summer season between Britain and Cork.  Nobody working in tourism in that region can understand why the Government let the service lapse.  We are doing the best we can to have the Swansea-Cork service operating in the coming year.  Now is the time when those involved in tourism must engage in marketing, especially in Britain, and it is important that they should know now whether there will be a summer service in 1985.  I have tried on several occasions during the past 10 days to raise this matter in the House by way of question.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting in Cork some months ago where it was made crystal clear that the Swansea port authority were prepared to put money into the <Col N="418" /> operation of such a ferry.  The local council for the Swansea area were also prepared to help.  I understand that Cork Harbour Commissioners, Cork Corporation and Cork County Council as well as certain interests in Kerry are prepared to put money into this venture but the Government are very reluctant to encourage the development of the service. It would give a great impetus to the promotion of tourism in 1985 and would encourage hotel owners and other employers to take on more staff.  These are two areas which the Government and the IDA should reconsider.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling in the south-west, particularly in Kerry, that the Government, Bord Fáilte and other agencies are working more and more to encourage and develop tourism along the east coast rather than in the south-west.  The proof is the lack of interest by the Government in the ferry service to Cork and Kerry. There is a service into Rosslare for the south-east and a service into Dublin to cover the eastern region.  There is also a service to Larne and Belfast.  The whole tourism promotion is geared towards the east coast, at tremendous cost to those involved in tourism in the south-west.  I would ask the Minister and the IDA to take a hard look at this matter.</P>
    <P>There is also a high level of unemployment in Killarney, Kenmare and Caherciveen, the most south westerly area of the country.  Perhaps the Minister would try to have these vacant factories filled.  The situation is very serious in Kenmare and it is very bad in the Kilorglin area.  In Killarney we have empty factories in the industrial estate and there is rising unemployment in the town and the hinterland.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, the Government and all the agencies involved in the job creation programme to do something positive and to take into account the practical suggestions I made here this evening. We must get back to the basics &mdash; tourism, agriculture, the sea, fishing and the development of fish processing plants.  The sooner we do this the better for the future of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the IDA did <Col N="419" /> not adopt their present policies years ago. If they had done so they would have been assisting local industries and encouraging local people who have initiative to start their own businesses.  It is very difficult now to attract foreigners and that is why they adopted their present policies.  The IDA have totally neglected Irish industrialists with the result that a great deal of money was spent promoting advance factories which are lying empty.  There is no need to spend money on buildings or procuring further land to build advance factories.  The IDA should concentrate on getting people to take over existing empty factories and so generate employment.</P>
      <P>I endorse what my colleague, Deputy Wilson, said about the three counties of Ulster &mdash; Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan &mdash; and say that as far as the IDA are concerned, that area has been neglected and was never promoted properly.  How many of the industrialists mentioned by the Minister in his report were taken to Donegal region or the Cavan-Monaghan region to be shown the possibilities of setting up an industry there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A good question.  I think they faced them the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>No great effort was put into promoting that area despite the fact that the local offices have done everything they can to interest industrialists. The policy of the IDA seems to be to promote other regions.  There is an outcry about unemployment in Cork, Dublin and along the east coast, but in our area there was never any worthwhile industrial development.  That is not a credit to the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report by the Economic and Social Committee of the European Community was submitted recently.  In that report it was indicated that an industrial development zone was proposed for the Derry/Letterkenny/Strabane triangle which should be promoted by a new local agency jointly backed by the IDA and the IDB with financial support from the EC.  The agency could co-ordinate incentives, <Col N="420" /> launch technical and commercial promotion schemes, provide advice and backup facilities for small businesses and in general try to attract investment and create jobs in an area of particularly high unemployment.</P>
    <P>What have the IDA done about that report?  Has any research been carried out?  Has any approach been made within the region to establish the possibility of setting up what is proposed in this report? Have the Government given any commitment to the recommendations in that report?  We have argued consistently in this House that there is a strong case for the development of that region, and there is an argument for that region to be given special consideration, first because of our high unemployment and second because of the troubles in the North.</P>
    <P>I believe there is no commitment from the Government or the IDA to do anything about creating jobs in that area nor do they have the will to promote the area.  The local IDA offices representing Donegal face very great difficulties with which other regions do not have to contend. The area has a very bad transport service.  We do not have an air service nor do we have good roads to Dublin or other parts of the country.  The Government must create the climate to attract industry and their first priority must be to deal with the present chronic infrastructure; then the local offices could sell the area but they are not able to do that at present.  The IDA offices in Dublin and the Government must do something about this.</P>
    <P>In Buncrana at least three factories have closed over the last six months and there is no prospect that they will reopen. Another factory is on the verge of closure. This will mean that four home-based industries are going to the wall. The only industry we can depend on is the textile industry which has survived many handicaps over the last number of years, but if that industry goes that area will be denuded of any source of employment.</P>
    <P>So far as the industrial zone is concerned I consider that my area lends itself <Col N="421" /> to that type of development because it has a natural outlet to the European markets through the port of Larne.  We have natural waterways &mdash; Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle &mdash; which have never been developed.  We talk about harbours in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick but we have two of the greatest natural waterways in the country which are totally under-utilised and underdeveloped.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to impress on the IDA the necessity to give recognition to the recommendations in the report issued on 14 February 1984 by the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities.  The regional development authority and the cross-Border committees have given many hours of their time in promoting the reports and in setting out for the EC the facilities in the area and also the problems of the people.  It is incumbent on the Government and the IDA to recognise the problems of an area which is the most underprivileged in the entire Community, namely, the three counties of Ulster.</P>

The debate ranged widely.  It touched on matters that are not directly the responsibility of my Department and obviously I do not intend to deal with such matters.</P>
      <P>I share the optimism expressed today by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  It is an optimism we can rightly, but carefully, claim.  It cannot be an unbounded optimism or one that does not have attached to it certain conditions.  These conditions are quite simple and clear, namely, that we manage our economy properly, that we ensure that the rate of inflation comes down comparable with our main competitors and that we bring under control our current budget situation and make it managable in terms of macro-economics. We have severe constraints placed on us because of past borrowings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy I have a better grasp of the subject than Senator O'Donoghue had when he was in charge.  He nearly had this country in ruin in three years flat.  I am glad the Government took their time to produce two major documents, one on industrial policy which the Minister, Deputy Bruton, published earlier this year and the second the document <i>Building on Reality</i>.  Both documents will guide this country through the crisis and back on the road to recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this debate I shall try to reply to questions raised by Members although I will not be able to reply to some because they do not pertain to my Department. Deputy Lyons expressed concern about the reduction in the building activities of the IDA but he has no cause for such concern.  Expenditure under the subhead <Col N="423" /> in question will be increased by £3 million in 1984.  He also asked for more details of companies who receive grants from the IDA.  It would not be appropriate to list such information in the House on every occasion.  The information is available in detail in the annual report of the IDA.</P>
    <P>With regard to grant payments, every effort is made to pay grants to firms as quickly as possible but if the Deputy has specific complaints to make I will have them investigated.  He also suggested that job creation was no longer a priority in industrial policy.  That is a silly statement. It is simply not true.  Job creation is still a primary target of the IDA and this has been spelled out quite clearly in the White Paper and in the national plan.  It appears to me that Deputy Lyons has not read either document.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons queried the removal of £2 million from the allocation of the National Enterprise Agency and he suggested that it would adversely affect their activities.  That is not correct.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, specifically reactivated the National Enterprise Agency in advance of setting up a national development corporation.  They have only recently become operational and they are now assessing a number of project inquiries. Their chief executive does not expect an investment of more that £1 million to be made in 1984.  We are adopting a professional approach to project assessment and we will carefully analyse all applications only when the commercial prospects are supported and when we are satisfied they will stand up to strict examination on commercial grounds.</P>
    <P>Deputy E. O'Keeffe asked for more regionalisation of the services of the IDA.  They are at present regionalising their services to small industries by establishing regional boards with grant approval responsibilities.  It is hoped that three of the boards will be operational by 1 January 1985 and the remainder by the middle of 1985.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us where the three are located?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="424" />
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>One is already in existence in Cork, another will be in the southeast region and the other in Donegal, the place the Deputy was so concerned about.  It has the high priority it deserves from this Government and the Deputy can be assured Ulster will not be forgotten.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also referred to the National Micro-electronics Centre.  They are doing valuable work and have been given full financial support by the Government.  In 1984 the grant-in-aid was £189,000 and in 1985 the amount will be in excess of that figure.</P>
      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy O'Keeffe said regarding the number of agencies.  That is why the boards of CTT and the IDA are being amalgamated. They will have the same personnel and this will allow them to have a clear idea of what is going on in each board.  The same situation will arise with regard to the NBST and the IIRS.  This is to avoid duplication.  All this is spelled out in the White Paper which Deputies opposite should read sometime.  The national plan states quite clearly that it is the Government's intention to reduce the number of State agencies in this area.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also referred to the closure of Dunlops.  Every effort was made &mdash; and I was personally involved in some of them &mdash; to avert the closure.  My Department and the IDA were deeply involved in trying to save that company. It could not be done on economically viable terms.  It was as simple as that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton expressed concern about the bias in the tax code in favour of property rather than the production of traded goods.  This question is addressed in the White Paper and it is a valid question to raise.  Measures are being taken by the Government to maximise investment in the traded goods sector.  That is quite clearly spelled out. Restrictions on bond washing were introduced in this year's budget and tax based financing was restricted.  In addition special tax concessions were introduced to encourage personal investment in unquoted manufacturing companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has met <Col N="425" /> representatives of the pensions funds and insurance corporations with a view to encouraging them to invest directly their funds into the traded goods sector.  Hopefully something will come of this.  Deputy Carey emphasised the need to attract service industries to Ireland.  Proposals for the development of the international services sector in Ireland are set out in chapter 9 of the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  Among the initiatives recently taken are the extension of a 10 per cent manufacturing tax rate to computer services and the establishment of a national softwear centre in Dublin to speed up development of infrastructural supports for the area.</P>
    <P>Many other points were raised.  Deputy O'Kennedy's contribution was somewhat contradictory and mystifying.  All the points made have been noted and in particular the points made by Cork Deputies about the Beehive closure.  Primarily this was caused by the troubles experienced by the parent company and its bank.  The company here was viable.  The IDA and my Department are fully involved in trying to rescue the Irish end of the company. Pressure to close came not at the Irish end but at the American end.</P>
    <P>Other points raised by Deputies will be taken into account by my Department in formulating policy.  Deputies on all sides of the House can be assured that we are more than aware of the needs of Munster, Connacht, Ulster and Leinster.  This afternoon I felt I had a mini Cook's Tour of Ireland.  It brought home to me that our economic problems are national. Deputies can be assured that my Department will be fully involved in all aspects of developing industrial policy and ensuring the maintenance of industry in all parts of the country.</P>

      <P>1. In page 2, before section 1, the following section inserted&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.&mdash;Section 14 of the Copyright Act, 1963 is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (7) of the following subsection:</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Flynn.  To substitute the alternative <Col N="427" /> words proposed would narrow the scope of what we are trying to achieve in the Bill and would continue to give rise to legal uncertainties.  The arguments advanced for a change in the wording, I am advised, are not well founded.  We were very careful in framing the section. I ask the Deputy to understand that it was done in the best interests of the country and that we are in no way trying to damage the traditional rights of copyright owners.</P>
      <P>On the second amendment proposed by Deputy Flynn, in the short time available because the amendments were received officially today, the Attorney General's Office were not in a position to consider whether this amendment was necessary or if it is even proper and in a legal form.  Accordingly, it is necessary for the Minister to take some time to consider the amendment.  I ask the Deputy to allow the Bill to pass through the House in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I would like to accommodate the Minister, the best advice available to me is that if the amendment being promoted by the Minister is allowed to stand, it will create more problems than it will solve, and that it will do nothing to achieve the purpose for which it is intended.  The thrust of the amendment is quite acceptable to everyone, but it has been suggested to me that it is weak in certain areas.  For that reason I felt I had to put down these two amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They may have been late, but I find it difficult to understand the Minister's attitude.  He said he is not in a position to discuss the matter because he has not received sufficient legal advice from the Attorney General's Office.  There was a very easy way to deal with that matter. If the Minister felt he needed more time, I would have been more than happy to accommodate him.  He might have been advised that the amendments I submitted would help to strengthen the section.  I got advice from industry and other interested parties outside the House, who <Col N="428" /> sought in the recent past to get the message to the Minister that they supported <i>in toto</i> what he had in mind to achieve in the amendment, and that it was very necessary.  So do I, but they are concerned about the form of the amendment. For that reason they are disappointed that there was not a response from the Minister's office to their request.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter fully I felt the proper thing to do was to put down the two amendments not to create tardiness in having the proposal introduced into the legislation, but purely to try to strengthen and clarify the section for the entrepreneurs who will be operating under the legislation for a considerable length of time.</P>
    <P>I was also seeking a commitment from the Minister because of the fact that this amendment would be stripping certain types of operators in the economy of the protection afforded to them under the Copyright Act.</P>
    <P>It would be necessary, in everybody's opinion outside this House, that alterations would be made in the Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Act, of 1927, Part 3.  This concerns the question of design.  It was regarded as essential to afford the protection that would be necessary to individuals engaged in these matters and that the Minister might be in a position to give a guarantee this evening that in a specified period of time he would be prepared to bring in amending legislation of this Act of 1927.  I am sorry that the Minister feels it necessary to rush this legislation through.  It raises very serious questions, with which I would have to deal in fairness to the legislation and in fairness to Minister Bruton.  That Minister, when this Bill was introduced first, was most co-operative with this side of the House. He certainly got full co-operation in that it was regarded at the time as being essential legislation to control the widespread abuse of piracy in so far as videos were concerned.  The question is dealt with of fines which the Garda could impose in dealing with illegal videos being smuggled in by various methods and hawked <Col N="429" /> about the town on building sites and estates, having a very bad influence on many of the population in certain areas.  We agreed all that in the original Bill.  I asked the Minister to consider further aspects that would strengthen his hand in this regard and he very kindly, in a spirt of co-operation, accepted the bona fides of my submission and entered some amendments to support my point of view.</P>
    <P>The Bill went to the Seanad and other matters arose.  Because of these things, the Minister found it necessary to amend another section of the Principal Act &mdash; the Copyright Act of 1963.  That legislation appears back here without any discussion at all in the House on it.  That, I understood, was the reason for its appearance here this evening.  I am disappointed that the Minister says he is not in a position to take this amendment at all.  While I would have been more than happy to give it a nod and a wink, which is the easiest way out of anything, I am concerned about interests outside the House who do not feel that they were properly accommodated in the submissions being made in support of the strengthening of the amendment.  For that reason, I feel obliged to pursue the matter a little further.</P>
    <P>I know how important this is, when one considers that there are one or two very major projects hingeing on the passing of this legislation.  I certainly would not be the one to stand in the way of the attraction of major high technology industries into this country in such depressed times.  For that reason it must be clearly understood that all I have in mind is to help the Minister to strengthen these two lines of the amendment which would add enormously to the effectiveness of the legislation and dispel the confusion which I understand will ensue if it is left to stand in the format in which it is now framed.</P>
    <P>I can quite readily support copyright protection in drawings of functional objects so that it would be an infringement of copyright if someone else were to manufacture it in commercial quantities. Indeed, all the industrial agencies are in <Col N="430" /> favour of preserving copyright protection in such drawings where the object depicted is not produced in commercial quantities by the holder of the copyright or authorised agents.  Commercial quantities, I understand, would be not less than 50 units of the object.  The existing Copyright Act has been successfully used by quite a few indigenous companies here as a means of restraining other firms here from copying functional objects which they had developed for both home and overseas markets.  The proposed amendment to the Act could, therefore, be seen as a deterrent to investment in new product development.  The whole thrust of this amendment is to allow new manufacturing outlets to proceed without the danger of being challenged in the court in so far as the subsistence of copyright in various designs is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is important that the section be amended to ensure that the manufacturer marketing a functional object does not infringe the copyright in the drawing of the object, provided of course that the object is in commercial production. Herein lies the crux.  The passing of this legislation, even in the amended format that I suggest, would strip some of the protection available through copyright. It would be necessary to protect the interests by having other amending legislation guaranteed or at least promised here this evening.  This would cover firms who wish to retain the protection currently enjoyed under the Copyright Act of 1963.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Act of 1927, Part 3, be amended so that design covers the appearance of functional objects.  This is a highly technical area. The best advice that I have is that a guarantee must be afforded here that the Minister will give an undertaking to have this matter introduced in the House at an early stage.  If the Minister would nod his agreement to that it would be very acceptable and would deal with much of the confusion and perhaps, fears which exist outside the House.</P>
    <P>The original new shape as applied to any article produced in more than 50 copies can be protected as a registered <Col N="431" /> design under Part 3 of the Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Act of 1927 and the maximum period of protection afforded to a registered design is 15 years and to a patent 16 years.  Of course, the protection afforded under a copyright is the life of the individual and 50 years beyond, so it is easy to understand how people could monopolise markets for considerable periods of time if allowed to continue in this way.  This amendment is being introduced to strip away that protection so that entrepreneurs and industrialists here can become involved in producing goods which would otherwise have to be imported.  I would support the Minister in his attitude in this regard, in that having this amendment would help enormously in the import substitution drive.  My difficulty is not with that; it is with the question of the format and the words being used.  For that reason my amendments are being introduced.</P>
    <P>The protection afforded by the Copyright Act of 1963 does not apply to articles capable of being registered under the provisions of Part 3 of the Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Act. The Copyright Act protects original drawings and any three-dimensional representation of those drawings.  Consequently, purely functional articles which start their life on the drawing board are currently entitled to a far greater degree of protection than articles which qualify for protection as registered designs.  It is for that reason that I want the commitment concerning the 1927 Act to be entered into here.  The duration of the protection enjoyed by a copyright owner is the lifetime of the author plus 50 years thereafter.</P>
    <P>The High Court has upheld copyrights in original drawings in respect of such items as the simple fish box and has prevented manufacturers here from becoming involved in what would be very worthwhile industrial projects because of the difficulties encountered in the High Court.  Numerous local manufacturers have been stopped and some deterred from producing articles by a threat of <Col N="432" /> infringement proceedings by copyright owners.  Industrial development is being hindered by the application of the Copyright Act which also stunts initiatives such as the import substitution programme and I take it that this is the reason the Minister is entering this amendment at this time.  He has projects that he would like to see cleared that would be in danger of infringing on the Copyright Act.</P>

      <P>The situation faced by the economy has altered beyond recognition since food subsidies were first introduced in Ireland in 1975.  Since then the taxpayer has spent some £550 million or over half a billion pounds on food subsidies.  Given our high level of unemployment now one must ask if this was the best use of money, seeing that it was all borrowed.</P>
      <P>At the time food subsidies were first introduced the Irish national debt stood at £2,700 million and our foreign debt was less than £700 million.  In the nine years since then the debt has risen to around £17,500 million of which the external component is now nearly £8,000 million or almost three times the entire debt of 1975.  If we had not borrowed more than half a billion pounds to pay for food subsidies in the intervening period our foreign debt would now be less not only by that amount but in addition by the interest payments which have had to be made each year since then on the amount expended.  Indeed, the interest on £550 million this year will cost the taxpayer around £70 million.</P>
      <P>The job crisis that we are facing in the mid-eighties was entirely foreseeable during the seventies.  The children now leaving our schools and seeking work, and finding it so difficult to get it, were all in school at that time and they were on the records available to the Governments of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there was justification in the short term for counter-cyclical deficit <Col N="434" /> budgeting in the immediate aftermath of the 1973 oil shock, the sensible policy for Government to have pursued in Ireland during the bulk of the seventies would have been that of a balanced budget.  This would have enabled the setting aside of resources during that period to deal with then foreseeable problems that were going to arise in the eighties with the large influx to the workforce which is now and could then have been predicted as taking place.  Instead, the Governments of the day right through the seventies ran very substantial budget deficits which now have to be paid for by high levels of interest payments and debt repayments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the clearest and most damning indictments of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Were it not for interest that had to be paid on debts, Ireland would now have a much greater capacity to deal with the unemployment problem of the eighties.  Indeed, without interest on past debts we would have a budget surplus in this year.  Instead, as a result of our having spent money on various types of expenditure, including food subsidies, during the seventies which we were not paying for out of current taxation, we have put Governments in the eighties in a position that they are not able to cope adequately with the unemployment problem.  This is the reality of the situation against which this debate must be judged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have now decided to redress the situation by a planned and gradual reduction in borrowing.  One of the methods that they are forced to use to achieve this is a phasing out of food subsidies, but this is being done in such a way as to protect the position of less well-off families.  The final phase in this reduction of food subsidies will be accompanied by the introduction of child benefits at much increased levels.  This will bring a very large increase in the income available through children's allowances to mothers with children.  This is a better way to help families than through food subsidies which go to all <Col N="435" /> families, rich and poor, adults and children, alike.</P>
    <P>However, people should not think that this is some sort of drastic financial policy that is now being pursued.  In fact, the current budget deficit in proportion of GNP in 1987, after all the planned measures have been implemented, will still be higher as a percentage of GNP than the deficit in the United States is at the moment.  We are all aware of the public controversy in regard to a 4.5 per cent of GNP deficit in the US yet when all these measures, included in <i>Building on Reality</i> have been implemented, our deficit will, even then, in 1987, be 5 per cent of GNP for current spending.  Additional borrowing for capital purposes will bring the total Exchequer borrowing requirement to nearly 10 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The problem is, of course, that so much of our money will have to be used to pay interest on past debts that this makes it very difficult to move any more quickly than we are doing to eliminate our current budget deficit.  As the Economic and Social Research Institute pointed out, every additional year when one has a current budget deficit one passes on to the following year an additional interest problem.  This makes the closing of the gap in the following year more difficult than it would have been if there had been no deficit the previous year.</P>
    <P>This is the financial treadmill on which this generation has been placed by the financial policies throughout most of the seventies.  I have said that I except from that criticism the immediate aftermath of the oil shock of 1973 when for two years or so deficits were justifiable as a counter-cyclical measure.  However, it is in general a tragedy that resources, which should have been held over until the eighties to deal with a completely foreseeable jobs problem now occurring in the middle of this decade, were used up in current budget deficit in the seventies and the first year or two of the eighties.</P>
    <P>Food subsidies, while useful if we can afford them, are not the best way of overcoming inequality in our society.  The single greatest cause of inequality in this <Col N="436" /> country at the moment is unemployment. Unemployment not only gives rise to inequalities of income between families, it also undermines the dignity and spirit of people.  The plight of the long term unemployed calls for direct action over and above the provision of income maintenance or other types of benefit. Without new initiatives in this area many of the long term unemployed who retain the capacity to contribute usefully to economic activity might not have the opportunity of re-entering the workforce in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Policies are already in place which offer assistance to the long-term unemployed. The success of the enterprise allowance scheme shows that it is clearly filling a need.  By September of this year almost 3,500 unemployed persons had availed themselves of the opportunity to establish their own enterprises and this number is growing week by week.</P>
    <P>A new scheme for social employment is now to be introduced.  It will provide part-time jobs for 10,000 long-term unemployed within the next 12 months. A new training and placement scheme for the long-term unemployed will give a new chance to 2,500 people a year for a six-month period of each year.</P>
    <P>The Government have also recognised the need to boost the construction industry.  In addition to the expansion of industrial grants there will over the period of the plan be:</P>
    <P>&mdash;An increase of £53 million in the annual capital provision for major roads.  This will raise the level of activity in this sector by 10 per cent above that previously proposed in the national roads plan.</P>
    <P>&mdash;There will also be an increase of £32 million in capital investment in education.  Total educational investment over the plan period will be £320 million.</P>
    <P>These and other projects under consideration will between them provide several thousand additional jobs in the construction industry, reversing the decline in employment in this sector.</P>
    <P>These measures directly concerned <Col N="437" /> with the creation of employment are a better use of money than the payment of food subsidies.  Like all Members I would like to be in a position where we did not have to choose between food subsidies or spending money on employment creation, but the reality of our financial situation is that we have to choose.  Indeed, to govern is to choose.  The Government are right in believing that we must choose to put in place measures that would help in the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>In addition to policies on employment creation the Government have, in their social policy, given priority to assisting the less well-off.  This must necessarily involve some greater selectivity to ensure that the weakest members of the community will not be the ones to bear the greatest burden of the measures which must be taken to ensure the future welfare of the community.  Let me outline some of the ways this increased focussing of public expenditure on the less well-off is to operate in practice.  The living standards of those dependant on social welfare will be safeguarded by keeping long-term payments at least level with inflation and short-term disability and employment payments in line with take-home pay.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the family income supplement has been brought forward to address the particular difficulties of those who, heretofore, could have lost out financially by taking employment.  There will be significant changes in housing policy.  A new grant of £5,000 is being introduced to assist local authority tenants who buy private houses and thus make available a local authority dwelling to others who might be on the local authority housing list.</P>
    <P>The education system is being developed in accordance with the programme for action in education.  This will lead to a closer relationship between education and modern society and between education and the world of work.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it will also lead to the expenditure of significant sums of money on those disadvantaged areas in our community where education is more needed than anywhere else.  Expenditure of this kind <Col N="438" /> to directly help those in need, particularly to help those whose need is created by their inability to cope with society through lack of education, is the best way to deal with the problem of poverty in our society rather than giving across the board food subsidies which everybody, regardless of means, enjoys.  Indeed, in absolute terms the better off people are the more they benefit from food subsidies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A central theme of these developments has been support for the individual family.  In the context of the many different services and payments provided under the ambit of the social services we must never lose sight of the objective of a caring and supportive society, a society whose bedrock is the family.  The formation and cycle of a family leads to many different and varying demands on its members and resources. Many studies have shown how family size and age can be a major factor causing inequality and hardship.</P>
      <P>Many families whose gross incomes might suggest they are well off by comparison with some simplistic average find themselves experiencing real financial hardship in their attempts to provide the opportunities for their children to allow them to realise their potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too much of social policy here is governed by crude references to gross income levels without taking adequate account of family responsibility at a particular time in the family cycle.  Very often measures that are designed to redistribute income to the less well off do not always do so because they are given to people who have little or no financial responsibility when others with nominally higher incomes but with much greater responsibility <Col N="439" /> are in a worse situation relatively speaking in terms of disposable income.</P>
    <P>The importance of the family and the needs of its dependent members is reflected in the Government's proposals to give a high priority to education and, in particular, to support those who might otherwise prematurely leave the education system.  Thus primary education will be treated as a priority, together with special funding for disadvantaged areas. A new child benefit scheme is also being designed to ensure that policies are sensitive to the needs of large families.</P>
    <P>In essence I am saying that the Government's social policy is being designed to give more help to those who need it most rather than giving indiscriminate help across the board through blanket measures such as food subsidies.  That is not to say that food subsidies are not a good thing if we could afford them and when we can afford them.  It is simply saying that when one has to choose one must look, if one has scarce resources, at other more direct and immediate ways of helping those who need help either to find employment or to acquire the education or the income necessary to break out of poverty in which so many of our people find themselves at this time.</P>
    <P>The policy being pursued in this area is a responsible one.  It is not responsible &mdash; I appreciate fully that the Opposition have a role to perform in this area of opposition &mdash; to pick out one measure like the food subsidies and say that they do not like that without seeing the choices that have to be made within the overall framework of Government finance. While I can see that the Opposition have a role to play in opposing this I believe a lot of the problems of the country, in regard to industrial relations and elsewhere, have arisen because people are more concerned with playing a role and saying, &ldquo;That is not my job.  My job is to demand the most I can get for my members&rdquo; or &ldquo;My job is to maximise the profits for my shareholders&rdquo;.  If we could look a little more at the problems as the person on the other side of the table sees them we might be better off.  However, <Col N="440" /> that is very much <i>obiter dicta</i> in this instance.  The approach we are adopting, which is one of a selective policy, is a better one and is more likely to yield results than the other policies which, frankly, we cannot afford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not bore the House with the irrelevant pleadings of an even more irrelevant Labour Party on this issue but I cannot resist extracting one gem from Deputy Barry Desmond who has a responsibility in Government for Social Welfare and the care of those most in need.  I will refer to just one gem of the numerous statements that have emanated from the Labour Party.  In October 1979 he said that reductions in food subsidies are reflective of a philosophy which he just did not like and could not support.  I cannot give that statement the emphasis and solemnity that Deputy Barry Desmond gave it but in itself it dismisses the irrelevancies of the irrelevant Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I should like to focus on the reasons given by the spokesman for the Government, in the absence of the Government, in early August when the cuts were announced.  The first thing that emerges clearly from all the statements by the ubiquitous Government spokesman was that the decision was attributable to the rising level of interest rates and the appreciation of the dollar against our currency. It was stated in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 3 August:</P>
      <P>So far this year, the rising level of interest rates and the dollar has added approximately £140 million to the bill the Government will have to meet when it introduces its budget next January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the connection was established on the first day by the spokesman who made the announcement in the absence of Ministers, some of whom were said to be sunning themselves in foreign places.  Some of them, unfortunately for themselves, were still at home and were prepared to announce decisions taken by Deputy Bruton who, it must be said, is consistent.  These increases of 2p on the <Col N="441" /> pint of milk, 8p on the pound of butter, 8p on a loaf were, we were told, necessary as a compensatory factor because of the increased cost of servicing dollar interest rates and the appreciation of the dollar against our currency.</P>
    <P>Labour Party philosophy has always been opposed to cuts in food subsidies, yet we can read a little gem from the Minister for Labour in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> The heading was truly in line with what he said: The subsidy had to go to pay the public sector.  He is quoted as saying that it was essential to raise the necessary funds to pay teachers, gardaí, nurses and the like.  The people in those professions are, by definition, concerned with the needy, the young and the unemployed. The gardaí cope with the consequences of unemployment and nurses have to cater day by day in overcrowded wards with the consequences of an uneven society.  Such a statement is an offence to them.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 4 August the Tánaiste, in the absence of Fine Gael Ministers, said:</P>
    <P>The Government is facing an interest Bill of £830 million next year on foreign borrowings of £8 billion.</P>
    <P>The total foreign debt of the State is now £10 billion.  He further stated:</P>
    <P>This would have been £100 million less were it not for the fluctuation of the £5 billion borrowed in floating currencies and the £3 billion borrowed in dollars.</P>
    <P>In the last few days, the dollar borrowings have added an extra £25 million to the interest bill for next year as a result of the strengthening of the dollar.</P>
    <P>The connection is clearly established that what we have is a decision by the Government that the poor, unemployed and low income groups are to be forced to pay for the consequences of the increased cost of servicing the foreign debt.</P>
    <P>Since this Government took office the total foreign debt has increased by over £3 billion since December 1982 to a figure <Col N="442" /> in excess of £10 billion.  So much for what the Minister said: the Government are moving towards a phased and planned reduction of the debt.  If &ldquo;halting&rdquo; and &ldquo;reversing&rdquo; means &ldquo;increasing&rdquo; then the promise of reducing foreign debt, which has grown by £3 billion, is poor consolation for the economy and for those who are the worst off in our community.  They have to pay for the disastrous Government decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made the disastrous decision to switch the major portion of our new foreign borrowings from EMS currencies, against which our currency has remained reasonably stable and interest rates have remained reasonably stable at 5½ per cent, to the dollar against which our currency has depreciated by 33½ per cent and where interest rates have gone through the roof.  The consequences of that disastrous decision of this expert economist is that those in society who can least afford to do so will pay for it.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the consistency of the Minister who is present.  On his own admission yesterday, he said there was an increase of 135 per cent in unemployment in the past five years most of which has been in the last two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>He made the statement that manufacturing employment is still falling despite export growth.  At a time when unemployment was increasing the Government chose to reduce food subsidies.  That is a scandal.  There used to be an old song in my college days to the tune of &ldquo;The Red Flag&rdquo; and it tells the working class what they can do because &ldquo;I have got the foreman's job at last&rdquo;.  The Labour Party have taken that view &mdash; they may not have the foreman's job but they have a job and the working class can do as the song said in my student days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has taken a decision and the poor people have to pay for the consequences of it.  He has never shown much sense of human concern for the poor and underprivileged.  They do not find much place in his cold, jargonistic <Col N="443" /> analysis.  Instead of protecting those who might perhaps be the only justification for us to be in public life, we are making them the victims of something they had nothing to do with: switching to borrowing in dollars.  We should be protecting the poor from whatever economic problems occur.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance tried to justify his callous decision on the same basis as the Minister present did and that is that food subsidies discriminate in favour of the rich.  That is callous in the extreme.  Let me demonstrate why. When did anyone of us, the Minister, the Minister of State or myself, last sit down to a meal of bread, butter and tea?  Many of those who are affected by this decision sit down every night to just that kind of diet.  We know that is the reality when we visit working class areas.  We are expected to ignore that.  There are statistics to support the case, never mind the bleatings of the irrelevant Labour Party and all they have said over the years.  The CSO have taken a bashing in recent times but this statistic was accepted by all.  The household budget statistics indicate that the lower income group spent 20 per cent of their disposable income &mdash; we are not talking about much when we speak of their disposable income &mdash; on bread, butter and milk as against what for the rich for whom food subsidies are meant to discriminate in favour of?  Four per cent of their disposable income.  That is the reality which enabled Deputy Bermingham's party to come in here and bleat at the hint of a reduction in food subsidies.</P>
    <P>I find it objectionable that decisions which have never been referred to the House to increase the dollar borrowing against which our currency has depreciated and which have given rise to an extra £140 million on our budget for next year should be paid for by the poorest elements in the community.  I am not alone in making that connection.  It was made by every Government spokesman at the time in the absence of any Minister to face the press or the public.  If we are to have a review about borrowing strategy, <Col N="444" /> the currency in which we borrow and the increased cost of that, let such a review take place here.  The Minister for Finance has refused to account in any way to the House or to the Committee on Public Expenditure of which I am a member. Seven weeks ago we asked the Minister or his representatives to explain to us why they shifted to borrowing in dollars with increased interest rates for which the poor must now pay.  The Minister has ignored that request.  He did not come to the committee and has not come in here. That shows contempt for the House.  It could be said that it is contempt for the Labour Party who have bleated over the years.</P>
    <P>In a famous statement made by Deputy Quinn on 6 October he said he was very happy that the voice of Labour was being heard loud and clear at the Cabinet table. I wonder what would happen if their voice was not being heard.  People are being asked to ignore the reality.  Contempt is being expressed here for the loud and clear voice of the Labour Party. Whatever about contempt for the House, and that is there or contempt for the Labour Party, which may be deserved, contempt for the lower income groups should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism spoke this evening about the construction industry.  That is irrelevant to the question of food subsidies. However, I respect and admire the Minister but I find objectionable the contribution made by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, who implied that the removal of food subsidies was a matter of equity, that it was done in the interest of the poor as against the interest of the rich.  That implication is objectionable not only in terms of truth but of those whom the Minister would claim to have been thinking of when removing the food subsidies.  Maybe the Labour Party will back their voices with their actions this evening though I do not believe they will.  In any case, their constituents will be interested in hearing how they vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the motion tabled <Col N="445" /> by Deputy Ahern and I trust that it will receive sufficient support.  I wish to add my voice to the condemnation of the Government for their removal of the food subsidies and for the manner in which that change was announced.</P>
      <P>In June last, the Taoiseach speaking on the Estimate for his Department outlined what he regarded as the achievements of the Government but he was very careful to avoid any mention of the removal of food subsidies.  He gave no indication then of what the Government's intentions in this matter were.  It was left to the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party to announce the bad news and that was at a time when the Taoiseach and many other members of the Cabinet were out of the country.</P>
      <P>It is almost incredible that, having regard to the views expressed down through the years by the Labour Party in respect of food subsidies, the announcement of their removal should have been left to the leader of their party.  Many references have been made during the course of this debate to what the Minister for Health and Social Welfare had to say from time to time on the question of food subsidies.  He said, for instance, in November 1978 that those who benefitted from food subsidies were the large families, the poor and the elderly, that proportionately they spend more of their income on food than do any other group. He went on to say that food subsidies represent only a very small item in the national budget and that it would not upset any Minister's calculations to continue the subsidies for another 20 years, if necessary.  One waits anxiously to see how Deputy Desmond will vote on the motion this evening.  Will he honour the concern expressed while in Opposition for the less privileged or will he follow other members of the Labour Party who were critical of the national plan when it was produced but who will be prepared to troop into the lobbies to vote against our motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent the constituency of Dublin South-West and that includes Tallaght and part of Clondalkin.  I regret to have to put on record that many of those <Col N="446" /> people to whom the Minister for Health and Social Welfare was referring live in that constituency as the figures indicate. In the Tallaght area, for instance, there are between 4,000 and 5,000 people unemployed while the corresponding figure for Clondalkin is 2,000 people.  In Dublin as a whole there are between 60,000 and 70,000 registered as unemployed. I extend an invitation to the Ministers for Finance, Health and Social Welfare and Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to come out to my constituency and see for themselves the problems of the area.  Only then will they realise the need for food subsidies.  If there were sufficient time to allow them make that visit before the vote is called, they might change their minds and vote for our motion.  If one were to call to any group of ten houses in parts of Tallaght one would be likely to find seven of the ten families concerned in which no one was earning any money while in another group of ten houses one might find eight families in the same position.  These are the circumstances that those of us who represent the area must try to deal with.</P>
    <P>The Government have described themselves as a caring Government. Where is the evidence now of that care? Will we witness it tonight when the division bells ring?  The Government have done nothing either for the constituency of Dublin South-West or for any other constituency.  Even at this late stage I appeal to them to show some compassion and to change their course of direction. Do the Labour Party subscribe to the concept of the Government being a caring Government?  The constituency of Dublin South-West is represented also by the outspoken Deputy Taylor and by an ex-leader of the Labour Party, Deputy O'Leary.  When the removal of the food subsidies was announced those two Deputies remained silent.  I acknowledge that Deputy Taylor is a very active Deputy in the area and that is all the more reason why I was surprised at his silence on that occasion.  In Tallaght there are between 4,000 and 5,000 people out of work; there are between 2,000 and 3,000 people unemployed in Clondalkin <Col N="447" /> and last night, when the Minister, Deputy Bruton, was speaking here, he said that this side of the House had no solutions to the problems of the country.  I should like to remind the Minister that last November when we were debating a Private Member's motion about Clondalkin Paper Mills, before the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy E. Collins, had finished his speech, a note was passed to him and he announced that the Government had entered into an arrangement with a Canadian firm to have Clondalkin Paper Mills reopened to employ 20 or 30 people.  Is this how the Government are going to solve the unemployment problem?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, said in his speech tonight that the way to solve the problem was to provide more employment and that this was of prime importance as far as the Government are concerned.  The creation of 20 or 30 jobs in Clondalkin Paper Mills saved the Government, especially the Labour Party members.  Is this their policy now to create more jobs in the Tallaght and Clondalkin areas?  The manner in which the people of Clondalkin were treated on that occasion by the Government was an insult to them.  If Deputy Dukes or Deputy Desmond took the time to come to Clondalkin or Tallaght they would soon see for themselves how bad things are.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach spoke on the Estimate for his Department prior to the summer recess he made particular reference to the progress of the Government. He carefully avoided mentioning the removal of food subsidies.  The manner in which the announcement was made by the leader of the Labour Party was greeted with dismay and disgust.  I ask Deputy Desmond and Deputy Taylor to support the motion tabled by Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> There is nothing in the national plan to help the constituency of Dublin South-West or any other constituency.  We heard proposals which are expected to bear fruit in 1986 or 1987.  Today's problems require immediate attention and action and the policies pursued by the Government do not go any way towards solving the problems.  Indeed they will create more problems.  There is no incentive for industrialists to come in here.  If the present trend continues we will have far more people on the unemployment register than are employed.  Is this what the Government stand for and is this the part the Labour Party are playing in so far as policies are concerned?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the statement of the leader of the Labour Party that there was a greater implementation of Labour policy in Government.  The Labour Party have always supported food subsidies and how could they support their removal?  The main food for poor people consists of bread, butter and milk which is their staple diet.  What else have these people to live on?  The Labour Party have supported an increase in the cost of these foods.  Is this what they stand for? It is a shame for the Labour Party to be part of this policy.  Even at this late stage, I would ask the Labour Party to heed the people or to pack their bags.  If they do not, the people will tell them to do so when the time comes.</P>

I have stated my position quite clearly and there is no doubt in anyone's mind about where I stand in the matter of the removal of subsidies.  I was disappointed with the way they were announced by the Government. However, having said that, I want to expose the blatant hypocrisy of members of the Fianna Fáil Party in putting down this motion.  Their record on subsidies is very shabby.  Measures announced on 31 December 1978 confirmed that subsidies would be removed from the following January.  This resulted in the following price increases: 8p per lb. on butter, 2p per pint of milk and 2.5 pence per kg. of flour.  These measures were introduced by Fianna Fáil at a time when The Workers' Party were climbing over the barriers here to support them.</P>

The best way to use taxpayers' money is to improve social welfare.  It is a better way to improve the lot of the lower income groups.  The interests of the less well off are best served by such means.  Fianna Fáil put forward that argument for many years and they would be better advised to stick to that logic.  They have put down this motion because they want to embarrass me and other members of the Labour Party.  I am under no illusion as to why this motion was put down.

      <P>I sought time in this debate to support The Workers' Party amendment.  The Minister who has just spoken, Deputy McLoughlin, and other Labour Party Deputies should have no trouble in supporting this amendment. It simply demands that the Government take action to ensure that the living standards of lower income families are not further eroded, and urges that any revenue required to restore the food subsidies to their former level be raised by the imposition of wealth, resource and land taxes, a realistic level of capital taxation, and a comprehensive drive to end tax evasion and avoidance, particularly by the business, self-employed and farming sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil would not find themselves able to support that amendment nor would Fine Gael, but given the recorded policies of the Labour Party, there is no reason why they should not walk into the lobbies in support of that amendment tonight, just as we <Col N="457" /> walked into the lobbies in October 1982 to defeat the Fianna Fáil Government when they introduced a policy which was directly contrary to the interests of the working classes.

      <P>This Coalition is a disgrace.  It is both callous and cowardly because it picks on the section of the community which is least able to bear the cuts in their living standards.  The cuts in food subsidies had the effect of putting a tax of 20 per cent on a loaf of bread and 10 per cent on a pint of milk.  To recover that extra expenditure the working class would need at least £6 per week gross in their income, whether they be on social welfare or low wages.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party have accepted the family income supplement scheme backdated by one month as the alternative to retaining food subsidies at their present level.  They have gone even further.  They have accepted a plan which will completely wipe out food subsidies in 1986.  They have accepted a plan which brings 200,000 people on social welfare into the income tax net.  At the same time, they have accepted a plan which takes 100,000 farmers out of the income tax net&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no doubt the Labour Party will not have anyone voting for them.  They will have neither the working class nor the farming community voting for them at the next election. They have abandoned tax reform. In the Eastern Health Board area they have cut the grants for children's clothing for the poorest people in the city.  Under the guise of equalisation of social welfare for women, they will take up to £40 a week from families who are depending on social welfare.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind Deputy McLoughlin and the two other members of the Labour Party who are here of a quotation from a document produced by the Labour Party.  I am referring to a magazine dated September-October 1984 entitled <i>Labour Left</i>, It quotes the leader of the Labour Party as saying with regard to the 1984 budget:</P>
      <P>Several aspects of the budget were most satisfying from our point of view, notably the preservation of food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> He is also quoted as saying: &ldquo;The Government has agreed that we must protect food subsidies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was only in January 1984 yet during the August weekend the Government shoved out a civil servant to announce that food subsidies had been halved.  The Labour Party in a great fuss ran around trying to figure out what to do and they were told they could backdate the family income supplement.  Of course what they conveniently forget to tell everyone is that the family income supplement will only be applicable to 35,000 people even though there are at least one million people depending on social welfare.  Also, the family income supplement will apply only to those who have a job, not to people on social welfare. Before the debate ends will the Labour Party tell us what the other 965,000 people who are depending on social welfare are to do to recoup the subsidies on food that have been taken from them?</P>
    <P>I should like to stress once again that the Labour Party should have no trouble in supporting the amendment put down by The Workers' Party.  Up to now they have been a disgrace to the policies and to the founders of the Labour Party. Under no circumstances would they have supported the kind of policies promoted by this Government.  It is clear that this Government are simply implementing Fine Gael policies.  What we are getting are cosmetics and frills which the Labour Party are happy to accept and to go along with because they think if they vote against the Government tonight they will have to face a general election and they will be wiped out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to cut the food subsidies is regarded universally as the action above all other Government actions that warrants condemnation by every section of the community.  It was an unforgiveable stroke of harshness.  It <Col N="460" /> was sneaky in its promulgation against the old and the weak in our community and the memory of it will live on.  It will not die but it will linger on and haunt the Labour Party and Fine Gael until they finally succumb to the anger of the electorate at the next election.  It will go down in the annals of political folklore in this House as a watershed for the Irish Parliamentary Labour Party when that political party sold their identity for just a few extra months in office in the &ldquo;Mercs and Perks&rdquo; brigade.</P>
      <P>Let us call a spade a spade.  Let us cut out the verbiage about deficits, foreign borrowing, the national debt and so on. There is nothing more fundamental to the diet of the poor than the loaf of bread, the pound of butter and the pint of milk. To attack the staple diet of the poor shows a cavalier disregard for one-third of the population who are on the breadline. It is farcical to suggest, as the Government have done, that bread subsidies affect the poor and the rich alike. The rich do not use bread to the same extent as the poor.  Proportionately the poor spend much more of the incomes on bread and butter and not to appreciate this shows an alarming lack of understanding and concern for ordinary people.  Added to this was the insult by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, when he stated that the poor do not use butter and one gets some idea of how out of touch are the Government with reality.  The poor use butter and that is often their alternative to meat which they cannot afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night we heard from many speakers quotations attributed to the Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, in support of food subsidies.  Let us not forget that the same Deputy stated he wished to refute and denounce as wrong from the social, statistical and any other point of view the statement of the Minister that the rich benefit as much as the poor from food subsidies.  We note also a statement from the same gentleman that he could never support the removal of food subsidies. <Col N="461" /> We are asking him to live up to the written and spoken word on food subsidies.</P>
    <P>What did the former leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Cluskey, have to say?  He is on record as saying it was an incredible, unjust and insensitive decision and that possibly it was one of the most anti-children acts committed by any Government for many years.  He said tens of thousands of children would go to bed hungry because these subsidies are being withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Let us consider for a few minutes precisely what is meant by the reduction of the food subsidies.  The Eastern Health Board have gone so far as to remove the comfort money from the old and the other people in our institutions.  They will not get any increase this winter.  That little sum of money they used to get to purchase a few comforts will be reduced. There are no ophthalmic services available to them.  The word from the Eastern Health Board is that no forms will be available until after Christmas.  Yet, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Desmond, says he is proud of what he has done so far as the health services are concerned.  Does he realise what he is fathering?  He is throwing 3,000 people out of work.  He is closing hospital wards.  He is refusing to appoint the consultants that are necessary to maintain the health wards.  He is creating waiting lists as long as my arm in every single institution.</P>
    <P>This is the man who is quite prepared to go on a collision course with the doctors and consultants.  He is responsible for the creation of poverty in 1984.  Still they talk about the family income supplement which will be made avilable.</P>
    <P>Let me put this on record.  There are 460,000 families getting children's allowances and we hear that 35,000 families will benefit from the supplementary income scheme.  None of them has got it yet.  What will the Government do with the 430,000 other families?  Are they to be thrown on the heap and to suffer the <Col N="462" /> indignity of poverty during the coming winter?  The Government will do away with the rest of children's allowances and the rest of the food subsidies as well.  Let us see precisely what they are proposing to do.  I am taking an average family with two or three children.</P>
    <P>Based on the consumption of five pints of milk, one large loaf of bread per day and two and a half pounds of butter per week, the reduction incurred on those items alone in August was the fine sum of £6.33 per month directly out of the pockets of the individual families who have to bear this burden.</P>
    <P>The Government say they will give £30 per month per child in child benefit and that they will have levies on that as well. At present the family paying 45 per cent tax gets children's allowances of £12.5 per child per month.  There is a tax free allowance at 45 per cent.  That works out at £3.75 leaving a grand total of £15.80 per month.  Take the child benefit scheme the Government talk so loudly about at £30 per month and income tax at 47 per cent this gives a figure of £14.10, leaving a net figure of £15.90 per month.  In effect, they are saying there will be a gain of 10p per child per month as soon as they get rid of the subsidies, not to talk about the £6.33 lost per month after the removal of half the food subsidies.</P>

      <P>No Government in recent times have caused such resentment as this Government did by the removal of the food subsidies.  Poverty is widespread.  It is reckoned that one-third of the community are on the breadline.  It was a cold, insensitive decision against the most defenceless people, the old age pensioners and the unemployed.  These are <Col N="463" /> the least organised groups and they have the least effective lobby.  I suppose for that reason it was hoped that they might get away with it and leave them destitute. There is no way this party will stand idly by and let the Government bring back the relieving officer syndrome to the Irish way of life in 1984.</P>

      <P>The subsidies were never more necessary than they are today.  It must be borne in mind that as well as the removal of these subsidies price increases have gone out of control in the past 12 months.  There has been a price increase of an average of 14 per cent in the ordinary everyday commodities used by the housewife since this Government took office.  That is the kind of Scrooge mentality the Coalition Government have had since they took office.  Last night the Minister for Finance attempted to make another Second Stage speech on his discredited plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>.  There was one very interesting point.  Right throughout his speech he never once referred to it by its name, <i>Building on Reality</i>.</P>

He was afraid to use the word &ldquo;building&rdquo; or &ldquo;reality&rdquo; because the building industry is shattered, half the workforce in the building trade are unemployed, and the reality is that what he did was unscrupulous and he had not the courage to stand over his own words. Social justice how are you.  What kind of twisted gyration on social justice took 8p off the price of a half one and put up the price of a loaf of bread on the same day?  We have listened to mountains of verbiage from Government spokesmen. <Col N="464" /> The Minister had a cheek to put down his amendment because it stated that they had the approval of this House for the national plan.

      <P>Meanness was never a trait of the Irish people.  We were always labelled as a noble, hospitable people.  They were the hallmarks attached to all our efforts in the national interest.  Penny pinching has no place in Irish life with the history we have.  The tactics used by the Coalition are downright shoddy.  They will meet with a quick response from the Irish people.  Their social non-policy is destructive in its intent and its implementation.</P>

      <P>Because time is short I will move along.  It would be a very hard-hearted person who has not been moved by recent reports which have conveyed such a vivid picture of the appalling level of suffering now being endured as a result of famine in Ethiopia. We have seen the film of children in the final stages of starvation with their swollen stomachs and faces like those of old men, and men and women stunned and defeated, drifting listlessly, broken by the extent of their want.  It is hard for us to comprehend the extent of the problem now being faced in Ethiopia, particularly in the northern provinces of Tigre and Wollo.  According to the Ethiopian Government and international relief agencies, up to two million people have had to leave their homes as a result of the famine, thousands are dying each day and as many as five million people face the prospect of starvation.  That is more than the entire population on this island.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson speaking in a debate today said that nature had been very good to Ireland, and that is so.  It must be admitted that nature has been very bad to Ethiopia and has not been good to it in any recent year.  There was a dreadful famine there in 1972 and again in 1974. Even at the best of times the average Ethiopian has an annual income of less than £50 and a life expectancy of less than 39 years.  Poverty and hunger, I suppose, could be said accurately to be a way of death in Ethiopia, but the situation has deteriorated to such an extent that it demands immediate action by those countries, including Ireland, which, whatever their problems, are more fortunate than so many Third World countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of specific things I should like to ask the Government to do and the country to support.  The first request I should like to make is that the Government immediately, from our own resources under our own bilateral aid programme, make a substantial amount <Col N="471" /> of money available for relief.  Because of the internal political problems within Ethiopia it is preferable that this money should be allocated through Irish non-governmental organisations, such as Trocaire, who are working in those parts of Ethiopia where its own government cannot reach.  Secondly, I should like to ask the Government, in their capacity as President of the EC Council of Ministers, to ensure that the Community reacts immediately to this problem with a substantial donation of cash and food, particularly cereals.  The Government should attempt to have EC bureaucracy by-passed because, as I understand it, it can take four or five months between the receipt of a an appeal to the EC and the delivery of food.</P>
    <P>My third point is that the Government should ensure that there is an intensified effort under the European Development Fund to provide the backup services in terms of agricultural development, irrigation, health and so on so that the overall problems of hunger can be tackled.  It is a necessity to ensure that aid is not in any way withheld for political reasons.  The Government should urge all countries with major air fleets to respond to the appeal by the Ethopian Government for air transport.  I should like to ask the Minister to request Aer Lingus, who often have spare capacity in winter months, to make it available to the Ethiopian relief effort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonight's Question on the Adjournment relates to a motion I have tabled which has become urgent because of the situation in Ethiopia.  We should be aware that this famine, the worst in 20 years, does not effect Ethiopia alone.  In fact, it affects 24 countries in the sub-Saharan south Africa.  We should concern ourselves with this problem because we have a responsibility to do something about it.  I appeal to the Minister to take urgent action at national and European level to ensure that something is done.  The fact that there is some distance <Col N="472" /> between Ireland and southern Africa does not take from the fact that many children are starving.  Those of us with young children should consider what it would be like if our children's stomachs bulged with hunger.  It is an unbelievable problem in that country and the only thing that is putting it away from us is the question of distance.  However, it is only an air flight away and we must try to sort the problem out.</P>
      <P>We can help by transferring some surplus goods in the EC to Ethiopia but in itself that will not solve the problem. It will contribute to the immediate relief particularly if the surplus is in the form of cereals.  There is a problem of a fall in foreign aid, particularly from the United States.  There is also a problem in regard to foreign exchange rates and of drought. In our Programme for Government we gave commitments to pay £64 million per year but we are only paying £46 million per year.  Even the commitments in the recently published national plan do not bring us to the £64 million per year.  We cannot ignore our commitments to those people.  If we want to see a free world where people will respect the rights of others we have to ensure that the environment is right for those people to survive. It would take 650,000 tons of grain to assist the people for one year in Ethiopia alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Western world we are continuously reneging on our commitments to countries in southern Africa.  It should be said that by and large the Government's of some of those countries are military Governments and they are reneging on their responsibilities to their citizens.  In many cases funds supplied for food are used for military purposes.  We need to provide money for infrastructure so that people can trap water.  We need to give them money so that they can store grain, a simple thing.  It is our wealth that we need to send, not our surplus.  I appeal to the Minister to urgently arrange for bilateral action.  This requires action immediately.  We need to declare tonight that the Government will send relief <Col N="473" /> funds to the stricken regions.  As President of the EC we should call an urgent meeting of the Council of Ministers and ask other member states to take similar action individually and as a Community. I am pleading with the Minister to decide now to give extra bilateral aid by way of emergency disaster funds to assist those people.  How can we go away from here and eat or drink without meeting such a commitment?  I appeal to the Minister to meet my suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of State who are both away, I should like to state that all Members share the concern expressed by Deputies De Rossa and Mitchell in regard to the appalling tragedy that is taking place in Ethiopia.  Indeed, tragedies of a similar nature although, possibly, not on quite the same scale are taking place throughout the continent of Africa generally.  That continent has suffered from an unusual drought in recent years and there is a grave shortage of food.  I share the concern of the Deputies that we, blessed as we are by nature's bounty in comparison to those other countries, should be doing everything possible to contribute to the alleviation of this awful suffering, that we should be doing it out of our own resources and that we should be using our position as a member of the EC and as President of that group to encourage the maximum mobilisation of EC aid.</P>
      <P>I should like to assure the House that we are doing everything possible in both areas.  All EC countries individually are making substantial contributions to the problem in Ethiopia.  The Community, as a Community, is also heavily involved. Already 19,000 tonnes of grain have been sent to Ethiopia this year and a further 25,000 tonnes of grain are being prepared for shipment in coming weeks and up to and including the Christmas period.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>From the EC.  A total of 1,800 tonnes of milk powder, allied with that 640 tonnes of butter oil &mdash; apparently the two are used together in a process to provide food &mdash; and 500 tonnes of vegetable oil will be sent from the Community to Ethiopia over the next couple of weeks and up to and after Christmas.</P>
      <P>The EC do care and have a lot of knowledge and expertise on the accumulation of aid, transporting of it and, above all, in the distribution of aid.  The logistics of assembling, transporting and distributing aid in these countries is of itself an immense problem.  The logistics require a great deal of funding.  In fact, it is of critical importance that a lot of the funds available for famine relief would be spent not just on food but on streamlining the logistics for distributing that food.  A lot of the EC financial contribution goes in that direction.  There is no point in having thousands of tonnes of grain stored at ports in Europe or, as is happening, and has happened, stored at ports in the African continent and at depots within that continent but not being distributed.  That is the real tragedy, to have help so near and not get it out.  A lot of the EC effort is directed towards ensuring that the aid that is available gets to the people who need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assure the House that I take seriously the points made by the Deputies who spoke.  From our own resources we have made substantial contributions already this year.  We will be making further contributions in the latter part of the year.  Extra sums are being provided for our disaster aid fund.  To take the point that Deputy De Rossa made, we are taking advantage of the efficiency of our non-governmental organisations and we avail of them.  In particular, we avail of Christian Aid, Concern and an <i>ad hoc</i> group called the Third World Self Help Development Organisation, which has come together. We are funding them to assist them in their work in that area.  In addition the IFA are making available grain to the value of £50,000 and the Government <Col N="475" /> will be providing the logistics to get that grain sent to Ethiopia.  The Minister of State, who is in Strasbourg at present, is acutely aware of the need to mobilise the EC as a Community.  In fairness to the Community it must be said that he is pushing an open door as far as a response is concerned.  The House can be assured that on a national basis, and from our <Col N="476" /> position as President of the EC, we will do all we possibly can to alleviate this awful suffering we have seen so graphically portrayed on our television screens recently.</P>

      <P>As I indicated on 10 October last in reply to a question by Deputy Faulkner, the economics of projects to supply gas to the north-east region are now being reassessed in the light of the changed circumstances following the British Government's withdrawal from the Northern Ireland gas pipeline project.  As part of this reassessment, officials of my Department are exploring with the EC Commission the possibilities of securing special funding.  However, as these matters are still at an exploratory level it would be both premature and inappropriate for me to make any further comment at this stage.</P>

      <P>The objectives of the western package electrification scheme were included in a programme approved by the EC Commission in March 1981 and now governed by EC Regulation 1820/80.</P>
      <P>While the programme approved by the Commission allows for connection of farm dwellings to supply, it is clearly stated that assistance for this purpose applies only to farms which do not have an existing electricity supply.  Strict adherence to the programme in this regard must be enforced in accordance with the recommendations of the EC Court of Auditors.</P>
      <P>The persons referred to by the Deputy applied for the extension of electricity supply to a new dwelling.  However, he already had supply to his farm, as indicated in his application, and, consequently, he could not be offered grant assistance under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if in view of the fact that the main source of IRA funds continues to be the USA he will consider a new and stronger publicity campaign to counter the activities of fund-raising groups in that country and to explain more fully to the US public the true position in Northern Ireland and the aims and objectives of the constitutional nationalist parties on this island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have made great efforts, through all available means, to counter the activities of Noraid and other American groups which seek to raise funds in support of terrorism in Ireland.  These efforts are an integral part of our campaign to reach out to Irish Americans and explain to them the realities of the Northern Ireland problem and the efforts which are being made by constitutional nationalists towards achieving a solution.  The visit of the Taoiseach to the US for St. Patrick's Day and President Reagan's visit here in June focused tremendous interest in the US on these issues.  Both leaders availed of the visits to explicitly condemn those Americans who provide moral or financial support for violence in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month in New York I met Irish American leaders to tell them what our Government are doing to achieve a solution in Northern Ireland and to protect the interests and well-being of the nationalist community there.  I also told <Col N="330" /> them that the activities of Noraid have done nothing but promote the campaign of violence and open wounds in a horribly tense and fragile situation.  I expressed to them my wish that the adverse impression of Irish-Americans that has been created among some people in Ireland by small unrepresentative groups like Noraid should be actively countered by the vast majority of Irish Americans who I know are opposed to the IRA campaign of murder, destruction and hatred in our country.</P>
    <P>It is indeed important to remember that only a tiny minority of the 40 million Irish-Americans are in any way supportive of violence in Ireland or of IRA front organisations like Noraid.  This is a point I emphasised in an article condemning Noraid which I wrote in August for a US nationwide daily, <i>USA Today</i>.  I used that article to explain to a wide audience in the US why the Irish Government condemned the Noraid visit to Ireland earlier that month.  In addition in an interview I gave to the <i>Irish Echo</i>, a leading Irish-American newspaper, last month concerning Noraid and similar groups I stated that &ldquo;no single factor has more impeded the unity and reconciliation of the Irish people than the murderous sectarian campaign of the Provisional IRA&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and I have given interviews in recent weeks to major US television networks to press home the message that no American should contribute to subversive front organisations, such as Noraid.  These direct appeals to the Irish-American community and to the American public in general have a significant impact and help to isolate the small number who fund violence.</P>
    <P>Noraid and other US groups continue to be one of a number of important sources of funds for the Provisional IRA.  The Government is committed to ensuring that its views regarding a peaceful solution are fully understood by Irish-Americans who at the same time have been left in no doubt about our total condemnation of Noraid and any other groups which support terrorist violence in this country. The success of our efforts to date has <Col N="331" /> been clearly demonstrated in the overwhelming condemnation by the American media of the IRA and its support groups in the US following the seizure of the <i>Marita Ann</i> and the outrage at Brighton.  These most recent murderous activities by subversives serve to reinforce the determination of the Government to expose the true nature of those sympathiser groups in the US to which the Deputy has referred.</P>

      <P>The number of moorings in the West Bight, Dún Laoghaire harbour, in each of the years in question was: 1970-1975, 24; 1976-1977, 35; 1978-1981, 43; 1982, 42; 1983-1984, 44.</P>
      <P>The licence governing the laying down and maintenance of moorings in Dún Laoghaire harbour does not contain conditions relating to the non-use, transfer or subletting of the moorings.  As has already been indicated to a number of local Deputies, a new system of registration and control of moorings will be implemented by the Commissioners of Public Works as early as possible.  The charge in respect of each mooring for the nine-months period April to December 1984 is £45, the previous charge having been £5 p.a.; approximately 80 per cent of the licensees have, to date, paid the appropriate charges in respect of 1984.</P>
      <P>The amount expended in the year ended 31 December 1983 from the Vote for Public Works and Buildings in respect of the upkeep of the harbour was £1,225,000 approximately.</P>
      <P>The sewage pipe in question, which had been damaged, was temporarily redirected by the National Yacht Club to a point further from the shore than the original point of discharge.  The commissioners did not authorise the work; the obtaining of authorisation, in compliance with any relevant legislation or statutory requirements of the local authority, is a matter for the club.  Discussions are ongoing between the club and the commissioners in regard to the making of other arrangements for sewage disposal.</P>

      <P>The North-Western Health Board recently completed a comprehensive study of the mentally handicapped population and the services provided and available to that population in the region. The results of that study will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>The board's philosophy and policy in relation to the provision of residential care for the mentally handicapped, with the exception of short-term care/ temporary relief, is that it should only be offered and available as a last resort after all other alternatives such as family support and hostel accommodation have proved unsuitable.</P>
      <P>The present position is that there are 20 adults waitlisted for admission to residential centres in the board's area.  However, it is anticipated that only a small number will eventually require residential care and that the remainder will continue to live in their respective communities with all the necessary support services provided.  Only one child is waitlisted for residential care and a place will be offered to that child in due course. In the meantime, pending placement in residential care, periods of short-term relief are available to this child's family.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Western Health Board that if all cases awaiting orthodontic treatment are taken into account, including those where the defect is of a relatively minor nature, then the waiting list in County Galway is of the order of the figure quoted by the Deputy.  However, at the present rate of progress those at the end of the waiting list should receive treatment within four years at the outside.  The waiting time for orthodontic treatment in County Galway and throughout the Western Health Board generally is expected to be greatly reduced if the health board is successful in its present efforts to recruit a full-time consultant orthodontist to its staff.</P>

The unemployment benefit claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that she was not genuinely seeking work and accordingly she was not available for work.  She appealed against the disallowance of her claim and attended an oral hearing of her case on 10 August 1984. The appeals officer also decided that she was not available for work.  She continued to sign as unemployed at her local office and following inquiries in the case a deciding officer was satisfied that she fulfilled the condition of being available for work from 19 September 1984 and her claim was allowed at the maximum rate appropriate to her £32.75 weekly from that date.

      <P>There are no funds available to my Department at present whereby capital grant assistance can be made available to projects of this nature.  However, as indicated in <i>Building on Reality 1985-87,</i> the Government have decided that funds will be made available over the period to enable grant aid to be provided towards the cost of building recreational and community facilities.  The terms and conditions governing the allocation of grants under this scheme will be announced shortly and interested groups including the Firhouse Community Council will be invited to make application to my Department for grant aid.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the question, the only information available in relation to Drogheda would be in the censuses of population carried out by the Central Statistics Office.  I understand the relevant figures relating to the 1981 census are expected to be published in a few months.</P>
      <P>Information available on job creation is confined to manufacturing industry and is supplied by the IDA on the basis of their employment survey.  I hope that the information, which is as follows, will be helpful to the Deputy:</P>

    <P>Statistics of redundancies notified under the Redundancy Payments Acts compiled in my Department are not broken down into geographical areas.
