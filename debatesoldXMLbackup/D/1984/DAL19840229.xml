Private Members' Business will be No. 16 (resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise on the Order of Business the matter of a very important document dealing with wages, salaries and incomes generally which apparently has been circulated to some bodies and organisations in the country, an account of which appears in the public press this morning but which has not been given to Deputies.  I should be grateful, if the Minister involved could offer some explanation to the House or tell us what exactly is the position in regard to this document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not arise on the Order of Business, Deputy Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does it arise then?  It is such an extraordinary matter that some explanation should be offered to the House.  Apparently it is a document of pretty fundamental importance to the running of the economy and to the level of salaries, wages and incomes in the coming year.  A full account of it is given in most of the papers this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may intervene for a moment, Deputy.  If Deputy Haughey is asking why it has not been circulated to Deputies I will allow that question but I will not allow any discussion or debate on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The document relating to employment is one that has been circulated&mdash;arising from discussions last week with the social partners &mdash; to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to the employers' organisations as an indication of the Government's views and as a basis for discussion.  It was agreed that it would be sent to them, that it would, in the first instance, be sent to them privately rather than published to enable them to give consideration to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="929" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate whether the version of it that appears, particularly in the <i>Irish Press</i> this morning, is correct?  Secondly, now that it has appeared in the national press could we, as Deputies, perhaps have a look at it or be given some indication of what is in it?  We would have an interest in a matter like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are speculative stories in this morning's papers.  I have not examined or correlated them and I am not in a position to indicate to what extent the speculations have any basis. But the fact that such a document was to be sent emerged from one of the social partners &mdash; the press knew about that &mdash; and there is inevitably speculation as to its contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to press the Taoiseach a little on this.  In the interests of the dignity and status of the House &mdash; now that apparently the document has been leaked, and that a fairly substantial account of it has been given in the newspapers with fairly serious repercussions &mdash; does the Taoiseach not think that as a matter of simple courtesy at the very least Deputies of this House should now be given a copy of the document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the process of consultation with the social partners would necesarily be helped by breaching the arrangement made with them, that we would send them a document for their consideration in accordance with procedures that have been adopted in the past by Governments at different times.  I would think that, for the moment, the matter should be left there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach to reflect on this and then perhaps give us some information about it later on during the day because the situation at present is one that we can hardly be expected to tolerate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept you have been very reasonable.  I might just make this final point, that a version of the document is now given in the national press.  That has apparently excited a great deal of comment and agitation in various quarters. In those circumstances &mdash; even though the document was first of all given in confidence to the social partners &mdash; surely the Taoiseach should accept that the situation has now changed and, even if he has to seek the consent of the social partners for the process, I think he should now arrange to circulate the document to Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to examine the papers and see to what extent the speculation in them is anything other than speculation.  However, I will reflect on what the Deputy has said and recognise his legitimate concern with regard to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at the way the Government have thrown in the towel. They are afraid to come down to my midlands constituency to see how they would fare.  I have no doubt how they would fare but it must be pointed out that the constituency is now deprived of a public representative from my party at national level to look after the interests of the people of Laoighis-Offaly.  It is a very large constituency, going from Meath to Galway, right down to the Tipperary border and back up to Kildare. During the years the constituency has had five Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our constituency has been represented at Government level during the years. This happened during the period of office of the late Seán Lemass and when Jack Lynch, our present Leader, Deputy Haughey, and also Liam Cosgrave each held the office of Taoiseach.  However, the present Taoiseach did not think Laoighis-Offaly deserved any representation at Government level and he abandoned us.  There are many important matters in the midlands that need attention: <Col N="934" /> I refer to the ESB and Bord na Móna and the future of both organisations in the area and there is also the matter of the hospital.  I have no doubt that if the by-election takes place in the weeks ahead the Government will get their answer.</P>
    <P>This Government will not hold local elections because they are afraid of the consequences.  They used the pretext of bringing about reform in local government but so far nothing has happened in that area.  I doubt if it will happen.  It is my opinion that the local elections will not be held next year.  The Government are only holding the European elections because they have no choice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are afraid to face the electorate of Laoighis-Offaly. I have no doubt that that electorate will give the Government their answer in respect of the many important matters that affect their area.  They are allowing these matters to drag on.</P>
      <P>The Government have abdicated their responsibility in regard to this matter, but I want to assure everybody in the House that when the time comes for the by-election I have no doubt that there will be a resounding victory for Fianna Fáil. When the last by-election was held in Laoighis-Offaly it marked the early downfall of the Coalition at the time. When this by-election is held the Coalition parties will get their answer for how they are handling the economic and financial affairs of the country and, of course, of the midlands.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> We have no fear of meeting the people of Laoighis-Offaly.  It is only fair to say that <Col N="935" /> it is a pity we could not have had discussions about a possible date for the by-election. If the writ was moved now it would mean that the by-election would have to be held between 21 and 30 March. I ask the Dáil to consider that during that period we will be discussing very important business here.  We will be having the Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill, the Social Welfare Bill, the Building Control Bill that everybody has been seeking for so many years, and in addition the Cabinet will be having discussions on the Finance Bill.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> All of that important business will be coming into the Dáil in that period.  We were willing to have discussions with my opposite number about a possible date but he was not in a position to be consulted. Therefore, it is perfectly logical that the by-election would be held on the same day as the European election.  That will avoid breaking up the business of the Dáil.  The people of Laoighis-Offaly are fortunate that they have four excellent Deputies.  I do not think a period of two-and-a-half months will deprive the people of that constituency of proper representation.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> It is only logical to hold the by-election on the same day as the European election.  I would remind Deputies on the other side that no later than February 1981, when Deputy O'Kennedy went to Europe as a Commissioner, the writ was moved and was opposed by that side.

I am certain that the people of Laoighis-Offaly, and the people of Ireland, will understand the wisdom of postponing the by-election until the day of the European election. Not only will we not be interrupting the business of the Dáil but we will be showing the people that we are responsible. For that reason we will be opposing this motion.</P>

      <P>All Members regret the circumstances which have brought about the necessity to move the writ.  Deputies on this side still find it extremely difficult to come to grips with the fact that our late esteemed colleague, Ber Cowen, is no longer with us.  His many thousands of supporters in the constituency will never be able fully to come to grips with his absence from among them.  It is for that reason that I regret the Government's opposition to the moving of the writ. Regardless of the reasons being put forward by the Government parties, the real answer to their opposition is political expediency.  The Government are afraid to put their performance to the test in Laoighis-Offaly.</P>

      <P>Laoighis-Offaly is one of the largest constituencies, one of the most representative of industry, agriculture and employment generally.  In that constituency more than any other there is a cross-section of the people of Ireland <Col N="937" /> and what they are thinking in relation to the performance of the Government.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised that the Taoiseach and the Government parties have decided to put off the day of challenge. I do not suppose it will make much difference whether the election is in three weeks or two months because the answer the Government will get will be the same. Laoighis-Offaly will reflect the views of the people of Ireland when that contest occurs.  They will reject out of hand the performance of the Government in the last two years.  In the intervening period the Government will try to resolve some of the major problems we have in that constituency, again for political expediency, for the purpose of trying to restore their popularity.  Any such moves will be very welcome by Fianna Fáil Deputies in the constituency and by the electorate there, but they will be seen for what they are, delaying tactics, short-term Government action to try to restore the credibility of this Government.</P>
      <P>I advise the Taoiseach and the Government parties about the kind of reception they can expect from the electorate when they arrive in that area.  It will be hostile, not only from Fianna Fáil supporters in the constituency but from many middle-of-the-road people who are disgusted and disappointed at the performance of the Government.  The promises made before the last general election have not been fulfilled.  The electorate will be disgusted and disappointed that they were conned into voting for a Government that had promised to bring about political and social reforms.  Where is there any evidence of such reforms?  In my constituency small industries are going to the wall day after day.  The farmers of that large agricultural constituency are utterly disappointed with the performance of the Government, particularly at their handling of the milk super-levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment and the absence of job opportunities for young people in Laoighis-Offaly are steadily deteroriating day by day. Laoighis County Council, at their estimates meeting last Monday, were informed by the Minister for the <Col N="938" /> Environment that there was no money available for improvements to roads, water supply and sewerage in the constituency. They said if they wanted to raise money the council would have to increase rates on small business premises by 10 per cent.  These small shopkeepers, who are having to close their doors because they are unable to make ends meet, are now being told that unless Laoighis County Council add 10 per cent to their rates 50 road workers will have to be let go in the County of Laoighis in the next few months.</P>

      <P>There is reason for the reluctance on the part of this Government to contest their popularity, or lack of it, in Laoighis-Offaly.  Laoighis County Council have also been informed that they are to increase the service charges for water, domestic refuse collection and, believe it or not, we have been told that we must charge for the facility of sewerage in the towns and villages in this constituency. The penalty for non-application of those charges is that 50 of our roadworkers within a period of six weeks will have to seek redundancy because Laoighis County Council will not be in a position to keep them in employment.</P>
      <P>One question which the people of Laoighis-Offaly will want answered when the Taoiseach comes down in relation to the by-election is what he has decided to do with the application to include this area in the disadvantaged areas scheme. I refer to this particularly and sadly in the context of my late colleague, Deputy Ber Cowen.  As Minister of State for the Department of Agriculture, he received no less than six deputations from the constituency in this regard.  At the stage when we left office, the late Deputy Cowen, Deputy Connolly and I ensured that the file in relation to the designation of our county was as advanced as possible at that time.</P>

To conclude, I very much regret that a legitimate move made here this morning on behalf of the party which suffered bereavement at the death of our colleague, Ber Cowen, and for the very legitimate reasons put forward by my colleague, Deputy Connolly, and our chief Whip, Deputy Ahern, to have the by-election held has been baulked by the Taoiseach who is snapping his fingers and snubbing the people of that constituency. The only comment I can make is that the time of reckoning will come and that will be the night when the votes are finally counted in that by-election contest.  That is the day when the Government will pay the price for their decision today and for their performance in relation to the constituency and the country over the past two years.</P>

      <P>What have they been doing since the lamented death of Deputy Ber Cowen?  Their indignation, of course, is only skin deep.  It reminds me very much of the summers of 1974 and 1975, when it was my melancholy duty to do business with Deputy Lalor, who incidentally sat for the very same constituency &mdash; he was Opposition Whip, although he did not come from the same school as Deputy Ahern &mdash; I say this as an old friend, but Deputy Lalor regarded his duty as consisting in making life as hot and heavy for us as possible.  Deputy Ahern has more sense &mdash; and I say that meaning no offence to Paddy Lalor.  The result is a more civilised atmosphere in the House for everybody.</P>
      <P>In those days we were obliged, because of the non-stop obstructionism of the other side, to bring the session to a close in 1974 some time towards the end of July, and in 1975 some time in August.</P>

They are delighted beyond measure.  They will go home tonight and say to their families: &ldquo;It is all right, you can relax, we are let off until May and June&rdquo;.  They come in here, indignant about factories which are closing down, about things which are going wrong in the economy, about the defiance of democracy which the Government are now responsible for.</P>
      <P>I want to say this about the people of the country, on whose behalf Deputy Hyland spoke so eloquently &mdash; he geographically represents people different from the people I represent, but there are a very great number of country people living in my constituency.  To use an eloquent expression which I heard from a colleague and friend of mine, a Deputy on this side of the House recently, about half of the people living in my constituency are &ldquo;Cuid a Do's&rdquo;, people who, if they stayed where they were brought up, would be in Part 2 of the telephone directory.  The people I represent are a cross-section of the Irish people fully as real as those Deputy Hyland and Deputy Connolly represent, as I am very nearly myself, at one remove.  The people I meet do not take this point of view.  When they open their papers and see accounts and photographs of seven or eight Government cars pulling up outside a chapel on a Sunday, with Ministers shouting into bullhorns and a little crew of children laughing at them, they say: &ldquo;My God, is that what we are paying these óinseachs for?  They are going around the country wasting time with the Government and the country up to their necks in economic trouble.  This is the best they can think of.  They are bashing one another with empty words and speeches.&rdquo;</P>

I do not mind admitting that, and it is one of the finest constituency organisations in the country.  If you removed from it the people who do not come from Dublin, it would be a very thin little organisation.  The reaction I get from my constituents is very different from the one I hear in this House.

      <P>The reason I say that is that they are not prescribed by the Constitution. Mr. Eamon de Valera saw no need for by-elections.  If he had seen a need for them, and if he regarded them as integral to democracy, he would have written them into his Constitution; but he did not.  The only thing he said about the filling of casual vacancies &mdash; the people voted for this Constitution &mdash; was what is said in Article 16.7º:</P>
      <P>Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article, elections for membership of Dáil Éireann, including the filling of casual vacancies, shall be regulated in accordance with law. </P>
      <P>It is up to the Houses of the Oireachtas to decide how they want to fill casual vacancies, and we do not need to fill them by holding local general elections, with all the panoply of a general election, except that Ministers are spread thicker, like a cheap margarine, over the constituency than they would be at the time of a general election when they have their own seats to look after.</P>

That is not to belittle what appears to be a likely candidate, whom I believe is a former student of mine.  Far from it.  All I am saying is that, looked at soberly, Fianna Fáil seem to be the better bet for this by-election. I am not trying to dispute this and I am not going for any empty shouting about it.</P>

      <P>I am not going in for any empty shouting about how we will walk over the Opposition.  I believe the Government deserve to win it because of their courage and their cohesion, which has surprised even me, and most particularly because of the view which confronts me when I look at the only possible alternative Government in the shape of a Haughey-led Fianna Fáil taking over their place.  These are powerful reasons for supporting the Government; but I can see that, looking at it as a bookie would look at it, the Opposition are the better bet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not for that reason that I am opposing with sincerity the moving of this writ. I am opposing it on principle because I do not think by-elections should be held at all.  They are not necessary in modern European democracies.  Need I say it for the hundredth time since I had the honour of standing up for the first time in this House &mdash; the reason we have by-elections is because the jolly old British have by-elections. There is no other reason.  The small peoples of north-western Europe &mdash; we are one of them &mdash; apart from ourselves do not believe in by-elections. The Dutch do not have by-elections.  Are they fascists?  If Deputy Haughey had stayed in the House I am sure he would have been throwing that word around by now.  I hear he threw it around not very long ago.  The other day I hear he used <Col N="947" /> it, but not in my hearing, because I would not have let him away with it.  The other day he called our party fascist in the House.  Of all the vain bullies who strutted around Europe in the thirties the one that calls him to mind most irresistibly is Mussolini, in his relentless selfpromotion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The small north-western European democracies are not fascist states.  The Dutch are not fascists, but they can get through without by-elections in between general elections.  The Belgians are not fascists, and neither are the Danes, but they get through without by-elections. The Italians are not fascists; they are a couple of steps further to the left in general political balance than the other states I mentioned, but they do not have by-elections either.  The reason we have them &mdash; and why they exist in <Col N="948" /> Germany in deliberate imitation of the British, in that half of the Bundestag which is chosen directly from constituencies &mdash; is that the British have them.  That is not a good enough reason.  They are a damn waste of time and every Deputy knows that.  They distract a Government from doing their job and an Opposition Front Bench from doing their's.  They are a waste of time for every Deputy who is expected to take part in them.  They are a waste of money in every way.</P>
      <P>The cost of holding a national poll is well over £1 million.  If we divide that by 40 to get the approximate cost of holding a local poll in a constituency the size of Laoighis-Offaly I come up with a figure of £25,000 to £30,000.  Perhaps that is modest.  It does not take into account Garda overtime or the disruption of the school week which is necessitated by evacuating the children on a Wednesday and cleaning up on a Thursday.  It does not take into account the enormous &mdash; I do not wish to exaggerate &mdash; waste of national resources, even if it is only the wear and tear of the cars and waste of petrol, money, time and effort of people who should have other things to think about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this indignation is not because this constituency would have no representative but because, in addition to the four it now has, a fifth would not be added until the month of June rather than the month of April.  Perhaps now the cogency of the parallel I was drawing between the contract in Fianna Fáil's behaviour in the House and outside in 1974 and 1975 when they were delighted they were let off, but pretending indignation in here, will be seen.  That is one of the reasons why politicians are a hissing and a by-word, and why they have sunk through the floor of respect and are down in the dungeons of the people's contempt.  They are all going around complaining, whingeing and wringing their hands.  We ask what we did to deserve it, and try to justify giving ourselves rises.  This is one of the things we do to deserve it.  We will not do what we are paid to do.  We will not do our jobs, but go around playing politics and think that is sufficient justification in itself.  That is why we have this <Col N="949" /> ludicrous display of indignation because the people of Laoighis-Offaly will not be allowed to have a fifth Deputy in the Dáil until June.</P>
    <P>We have already had two by-elections in the short life of this Dáil, and all the people of Laoighis-Offaly are being asked to do by the Government's decision, which I heartily support, is wait for as much time as separates us in the future from the month of June, as separates us in the past from the Christmas shopping period which is hardly over.  If the Government did anything else but vote down this writ, they would be highly culpable, and I would be up on my hind legs denouncing them for throwing away the people's money, wasting the people's time, not doing their own jobs, and preventing others from doing theirs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I shall bring a little womanly commonsense and decorum to the House on this issue.  I speak as a Deputy from the neighbouring constituency of Longford-Westmeath and in particular from the end of the constituency representing Westmeath which borders on the area so ably represented by the late Deputy Cowen.  I join with Deputies Connolly and Hyland and others who expressed regret at the passing of Deputy Cowen and at the necessity for such a debate.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the moving of the writ.  I support my colleagues in putting forward the arguments they have in the debate today.  I put it to the Government that the reason this by-election is not being held is because they have heeded the lessons which were learned from the Dublin Central by-election.  There was no delay about that by-election but rather an unseemly rush to hold it because the Government were of the opinion that their policies found approval.  They rushed to the polls in Dublin Central and the result was a massive vote of disapproval of Government policy and handling of affairs.</P>
      <P>Deputies Kelly and Barrett made great play about the fact that there are four competent Deputies representing Laoighis-Offaly.  Nobody denies that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> They are highly capable Deputies, in particular Deputies Hyland and Connolly. Deputy Kelly made great play about the Constitution and quoted from it.  The Constitution states that there should be a certain number of Deputies per head of the population.  The constituency of Laoighis-Offaly is not being properly served at present in that some of the population are not represented in the national Parliament despite the efficiency and work of the aforementioned four Deputies.  The Government intend that this remain so for slightly less than the next 12 weeks.</P>
    <P>At the last meeting of Offaly County Council a person was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of the late Deputy Cowen.  The people of whom we speak today wished to replace their representative on the council immediately. They observed the decencies and at their next possible meeting they put forward their candidate for co-option to the county council.  If they saw fit to do that, why should the voters at large in Laoighis-Offaly not be given the right to put forward their nominee to represent them nationally?  I submit that the reason the Government do not wish this by-election to be called is that they know well that their policies, drift and direction and overall philosophy will not appeal to the people, particularly those in the midlands.</P>
    <P>There are many problems in the Laoighis-Offaly constituency.  My constituency touches on some of them.  There are matters concerning energy, employment, hospitals, designation of disadvantaged areas and particularly the position of the ESB and Bord na Móna are exciting tremendous interest and discussion. In a small but neighbourly way in an adjoining constituency I have been involved in public meetings relating to these issues.  I have been asked about these issues and I have sought clarification of the party's Front Bench on matters relating to energy as it affects the ESB and Bord na Móna.  I am not happy with the direction and the underlying thrust of what seems to be the Government's policy on these matters.  This is another cogent reason why the Government <Col N="951" /> should not withhold from the voters of Laoighis-Offaly the chance to express what they think of impending changes in this direction.  As well as the weeks which have elapsed since Deputy Cowen's death, it will be at least another ten weeks before voters can express their views of the Government's policies towards the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin Central by-election before Christmas the people had an opportunity in an urban area to express their views on the direction which the Government were taking.  The views were not clouded or blurred; they were very clear and strong.  The Government should now submit their policies to the electoral test in Laoighis-Offaly, which is a mainly rural constituency.  What have they to fear?  Deputy Barrett told us about their vast legislative programme so why not put that to the voters now so as they can pass judgment on the areas affecting them &mdash; health, family planning, energy and bog utilisation?  A comprehensive package should be prepared by the Government to put before the voters.  However, because of cowardice and reasons of an undemocratic nature, they will not allow their policies to be submitted to the electorate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett's example of February 1981 was not, as he well knows, valid because at that time it was known that there would be a general election in May or June of that year.  We are now talking about holding a Laoighis-Offaly by-election within the vaster European context. The Government want to hold the by-election in conjunction with the European elections because their defeat will be smothered in the overall European defeat.  The Government made great play in their Joint Programme for Government that democracy would always be at the core of their deliberations.  In the interests of democracy they should now operate a checks and balances operation. We saw how they were regarded in an urban constituency; now let us see how they are regarded in a rural constituency. There should not be so much reliance on marketing surveys; let us have the real thing.  The only thing that counts are the <Col N="952" /> votes that are cast in every constituency in the country.  The Government should take their courage in their hands and, if the result is not in their favour, perhaps it is time for a change of direction as outlined by various economic forecasters in the last few days.</P>
    <P>The constituency of Laoighis-Offaly has always been very ably represented, especially by Deputy Cowen.  I ask the Government to drop the hypocritical reasons they have advanced for not holding this by-election.  They only wish to postpone this election because they know what the result will be.  I do not look forward to a death but I look forward to an occasion when there is a by-election for a different reason, and I am sure that the Government will rush to the polling stations.  The people of Laoighis-Offaly want this by-election.  I cannot speak for the cuid a haons and the cuid a dós of Deputy Kelly's constituency as they are a mystery to me.  The people of Laoighis-Offaly have a constitutional right to have their representative elected to put forward their points of view.  I am looking forward to hearing Deputy Enright putting forward his point of view and to seeing it published in his local newspaper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is worth repeating that the righteous indignation expressed by Deputy Connolly and Deputy Hyland is really the sort of Pavlovian conditioned response which we are all supposed to develop over a period to actions by the Opposition.  The righteous indignation at the Government's suggestion that this by-election should be merely postponed for two months to coincide with the European election is not mirrored by what is said in the corridors.  I am going to take up the point in a sense not developed by Deputy Kelly when he was referring to 1974 and 1975 when Members of the Fianna Fáil Party were saying one <Col N="953" /> thing in this House and something different in the corridors outside the Chamber.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Connolly honestly told us what he thinks he would probably agree with me and tell us that the vast majority of Members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and Dáil Deputies are breathing a sigh of relief this morning. They are delighted by the fact that it is now unlikely that this by-election will take place during the course of the next three weeks.  They are delighted that they are going to be left in a position in which they can continue to work in their own constituencies, representing the people who elected them and given an opportunity to contribute in this House in a relevant and meaningful way in the legislative process instead of being shunted off for about three weeks to a different constituency in which their sole function would be to knock on doors.  The vast majority of Fianna Fáil backbenchers, those who are free to talk and who do not feel inhibited by pressures emanating from the leadership of the party, are delighted there will not be a by-election until June.  I am waiting for one of them to come into the House and to have the courage to say what they are saying in other parts of the House.  However, I suppose we will not see that.  The righteous indignation expressed by Deputy Connolly is expected of him.  He has performed his function as a member of the Front Bench of the Opposition party.  If he had said anything different everybody on this side of the House would have been flabbergasted.  Deputy Connolly should now admit that he is quite pleased there will not be a by-election until June.</P>

Deputy Connolly appeared to be confused and flabbergasted that this by-election was being opposed by the Government on the commonsense grounds that there is to be a Euro election in two months' time and it should coincide with that.  Yet Deputy Hyland from the Laoighis-Offaly constituency tells us he knew all about it in advance.  Does Deputy Hyland talk to Deputy Connolly or does Deputy Connolly talk to Deputy Hyland?  Did it occur to them to check what they intended to say before they came into the House in case they contradicted each other?

      <P>If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will allow me to make a passing reference without becoming so excited about it I shall then pass on to the other remarks I wish to make concerning this by-election and this particular writ. In regard to the remarks of Deputy Hyland and the imposition of charges, on page 96 of this document it is stated: &ldquo;In view of the increasing investment in sanitary services it will be necessary to consider imposing realistic charges both on individual users of sanitary services and developers so as to recoup part of the cost.  The matter will be examined in the context of legislation to empower local <Col N="963" /> authorities to charge for services generally.&rdquo; The people of Laoighis-Offaly will not be misled by the high jinks and political guffaws of Deputies opposite.  It is fair to say to Members opposite and to the people of Laoighis-Offaly that the party who first suggested and invented the imposition of charges by local authorities for water and sanitary services was the Fianna Fáil Party.  The genesis of these charges originated in the policy of that party and it is documented in this particular document.</P>

On the writ, when this writ is moved successfully and this by-election is held the people of Laoighis-Offaly will be able to judge the honesty and relevance of the approach of this Government as compared with the irrelevance and dishonesty of approach by the Opposition and the political camouflage Deputies opposite are engaged in.</P>
      <P>The other matter is that I was referring to the fact that Members opposite were presenting a performance of great enthusiasm for knocking on doors in Laoighis-Offaly and apparently pretending to both the media and Members on this side of the House that they were all straining at the leash before rushing out into the constituency for the by-election and their enthusiasm knew no bounds.  I find that somewhat difficult to understand in the context of remarks made by Deputies opposite outside this House who have indicated their delight and relief because there will not be a by-election.</P>

It is because in the great enthusiasm in moving the writ I understand that in or about 11.30 or 11.45 a.m. there was something in the region of 25 to 30 Members of the Fianna Fáil Party who had not yet come in to vote on the writ.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Kelly made a point, a point I made earlier, which is worthy of consideration.  I appreciate the atmosphere created by a pending by-election and were we in Opposition we might well adopt a similar attitude, should we be on that side of the House and Fianna Fáil on this side of the House, unlikely as that may be &mdash; it may happen at some future date.  An issue of direct relevance is worthy of consideration and Deputy Kelly referred to the phenomenon of by-elections, such as the one that will be held ultimately in Laoighis-Offaly, and it is my experience since June 1981 that there have been five or six by-elections and during that period it has been the experience of all, if they think about it reasonably and honestly, that when by-elections take place the business of Government slowly grinds to a halt.  In the last ten days prior to such an election Ministers and others concentrate much of their energies on the campaign.  A great deal of time is spent on this concentration. Not alone does Government suffer but the work of this House suffers. The work of this Oireachtas goes into a legislative limbo.  Business is agreed between the Whips.  That has been the practice with successive Governments.  I am not casting any aspersions on the Members opposite, but when an election is held Whips normally agree on business of a non-contentious nature.  By and large, much of the business is non-contentious and usually consists of items which do not require time for long and laborious debates.  TDs from all sides of the house can then electioneer in their constituencies without being confined to <Col N="967" /> the House for the purpose of voting.  In a sense for the three weeks they become electioneers and canvassers rather than legislators.  The time has come when we as a democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;should look at a different system.  The case is made by Deputy Kelly, which is also my case and has been made by some Members opposite &mdash; if not in this House, certainly elsewhere &mdash; for reconsidering our whole system to deal with the difficulties which arise when a Member leaves this House or passes away, as happened unfortunately in the case of the late Deputy Cowen.  That system requires a great deal of examination and questioning.  Of its nature it is undemocratic rather than democratic within the multi-seat proportional representation system.  Certainly, it gives voters in a particular constituency an opportunity at a particular time during a Government's lifespan to cast a vote in a particular direction.  So far, the seat has always been regained by the party which suffered the loss as a result of the death of the Member.  That has happened because by-elections so far have been held in constituencies in respect of which the deceased Deputy was a member of the party which held the largest number of first preference votes.  In each of the constituencies in which there have been by-elections since 1981, the proportional party-political representation which originated from the proceeding general election has been retained.  That may or may not happen in Laoighis-Offaly.  Deputy Kelly has expressed a view on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In real terms a by-election within a multi-seat proportional representation constituency electoral system is, of its nature, undemocratic.  For a Deputy representing a constituency in which his political party has only a small share of the vote, not having the majority share of first preference and not accumulating a majority from their own preferences and from transfer votes from other smaller parties, ultimately what happens <Col N="968" /> is a form of representation which does not reflect the political allegiances or views of the constituents.</P>
    <P>Take my own constituency, Dublin South.  I hope that it never happens, or certainly not for many years, but if, God forbid, one of the two Fianna Fáil Deputies in that constituency, Deputy Andrews or Deputy Brennan, were to die or to leave the political life, resulting in a by-election there, on the basis of the votes cast in that constituency, unless my own party had done something totally outrageous or one of us representing the constituency on behalf of the Fine Gael Party had gone completely mad, it would be inevitable that the Fine Gael party would get that seat, and Fine Gael would have four seats and Fianna Fáil one.  No doubt we, as a party, would laud that as a great step forward or victory, but the reality, which I accept, is that would not truly reflect the political allegiances or wishes of the entire electorate in Dublin South.  It is only good or ill-luck, whichever way one looks at it, which has resulted in by-elections held since 1981 not reflecting the political balance in the constituencies.  Of their nature by-elections within the proportional representation system are undemocratic and we have a duty to look into this.  We also should examine the system because of its effect on Government and on the activities of this House.  Some Members may be enthusiastic about by-elections but I have no doubt, from feedback received from Members of all political parties outside this House, not just in my constituency but in others, that because by-elections under the present system hold up the business of Government and because of their effect on individual constituencies, they are viewed as a political luxury which we cannot afford.  They are seen by politicians and political parties as self-indulgence and by the vast majority of the general public as an unnecessary and expensive diversion from the business of Government.</P>

      <P>The attitude the Government have adopted in relation to this particular writ is a responsible and sensible attitude and I have no doubt it is an attitude and an approach that will be applauded outside the House not merely by the general public, but particularly by the people of Laoighis-Offaly.  I believe they will see it clearly as sensible that a by-election be held to coincide with the European elections so that the additional expense that would arise for the Government in having a separate by-election will not be incurred and so that the Government and, indeed, the Opposition, will not be diverted from the very important business this House should deal with during the course of the next two months by having a by-election.  I have no doubt that it will be applauded by everybody outside the House and, as I said earlier, I have no doubt that it will be applauded in the corridors by many members of the party opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke made the point that people in Laoighis-Offaly are very anxious to have a fifth Deputy again representing the constituency.  One can understand that.  It was very distressing to see a Deputy of the young age of Deputy Ber Cowen, pass away in the way he did.  I believe all of us share that view.  There <Col N="973" /> are four able Deputies representing that constituency.  The population of Laoighis-Offaly is approximately 109,000 and there is an electorate of approximately 71,000.  Deputy Mary O'Rourke said there is a constitutional provision designating how many Deputies are required to represent a specific proportion of the population.  She suggested that by delaying the moving of this writ by a couple of months the Government were in some way depriving the electorate in Laoighis-Offaly of a constitutional right in relation to the representation to which they are entitled.  I have no doubt that the people of Laoighis-Offaly are entitled to be represented by five Deputies and I have no doubt that they will be represented by five Deputies after polling day on 17 June next.  It is worth making the point that this House and all Deputies have been somewhat indulgent in the number of Members of this House we regard as essential to properly represent the electorate but there is a great feeling outside the House that there are too many Deputies in it.</P>

      <P>The Constitution envisages one Deputy per 30,000 of the electorate as sufficient, not one Deputy for 20,000 which is the practice which has developed.  Within the constitutional democratic framework the people of Laoighis-Offaly are properly represented at the present time.  Of course, we all accept that they are entitled to their additional Deputy.  I will conclude by saying that the Government are correct in postponing the moving of the writ for a number of weeks and they are correct in having the by-election on the same day as the European elections.  Any suggestion that in some way they are behaving in an undemocratic fashion or depriving the constituency of essential representation is a <Col N="974" /> totally gross and inaccurate misrepresentation of fact.</P>
      <P>The only conclusion I can reach for the reason for the Members opposite wanting enthusiastically to pretend in the House that they want to move the writ is that shortly the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis will be held and they hope that if the writ is quickly moved there will be some electoral victory to point to for the faithful to support.  If I were them I would be a little bit more cautious.  Maybe they should temper their enthusiasm because if this side of the House called their bluff and permitted the by-election to be held the result might be very different from what they expect and the effect on the forthcoming Ard Fheis might be devastatingly different from the result they would like to see brought about.</P>

      <P>There is an important educative element in democracy.  Regular recourse to the people for their views improves our understanding of national and local problems.  It is important that we should not be confined to the Dáil. We should have contact with people between elections when casual vacancies occur.  The whole purpose of the excellent legislation we have providing for by-elections, which is in accordance with the relevant article of the Constitution, is to ensure that the people are consulted whenever a casual vacancy occurs.  Surely that is the proper process and is in accordance with the democratic tradition we all cherish.</P>
      <P>I defend by-elections as being a proper way in between general elections to test and assess public opinion.  As was said by Deputy Hyland earlier, Laoighis-Offaly is a microcosm of the country as a whole.  It is a series of small and medium sized towns.  It has excellent farming.  It also has resources such as peat and electricity generation.  There is a balance of economic and social activity in that constituency which makes it a particularly suitable one in which to test public opinion and assess public attitudes.  That surely is the essence of the democratic process. We will not be driven into making decisions by consulting artifically-taken gallup polls or market surveys where politics is given Daz treatment.</P>
      <P>The democratic process involves talking to the people about live political issues and personalities.  We do not need any market survey trickesters or gallup poll tricksters to teach us democracy when as politicians we are given the privilege, through the unfortunate demise of some Member, of testing public opinion in whatever constituency the casual vacancy occurs.  If Deputy Kelly was present I would say to him that it is intellectually dishonest &mdash; I am very fond of him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to suggest that there is any comparison between Ireland and the north western European democracies he mentioned such as Denmark, Holland, Norway and so on.  They operate a list system in these countries which is totally different from ours.  They do not need to hold by-elections because all they do is add on the next person on the list. Their system is an anti-personality system and is alien to our system and tradition. It is not in accordance with our law as it operates at present.  We must operate under the law that exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  At a general election a party list is approved and if a casual vacancy arises the next person on the list, who would be the first unsuccessful candidate at a general election, would fill the vacancy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comparison between that system and the one we operate under our legislation.  The proportional representation system and the multiple seat system, no matter how we complain about it, is a personality orientated system.  There is only one way in which a vacancy can be filled and that is by appealing to people by way of a by-election to make their decision.  It is ridiculous and ludicrous for Deputy Shatter to suggest that there is something undemocratic in that approach.  There is only one seat to be filled and it is filled by way of popular vote in the constituency. There is no other way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy made the point about some advantage lying with the party who lost the seat through the demise of a Member.  That is not the case.  The party who held the seat have often lost it. Deputy Connolly spoke earlier about a <Col N="978" /> by-election which occurred 20 years ago in Laoighis-Offaly in 1964 or 1965.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The party who lost the seat was the Labour Party.  It was the late Deputy Bill Davin who lost the seat and his son was put forward.  Fine Gael supported his son but we won the seat on that occasion and in the subsequent general election we had an overall majority. It is not true to suggest that there is any association between the demise of a Deputy and his party retaining the seat. The one reason why we win by-elections is because public opinion is on our side. It is because the Government fear to face public opinion that they are opposing the holding of this by-election.  They know that they will get the same answer in Laoighis-Offaly as they got in Dublin Central a few months ago.  A by-election is the best barometer of public opinion. It is our duty to ensure that when a vacancy occurs public opinion is tested as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>After the decency of a month's mind we put down this motion with a view to ensuring that the vacancy would be filled as quickly as possible.  That has been the democratic procedure in the House. There is no point in quoting precedents which are not relevant.  There were two recent occasions where vacancies occurred which were not filled.  One was in 1977 when the then Deputy Burke went to Europe as Commissioner.  The Government of the day opposed the holding of any by-election on the basis that there was an impending general election. The Taoiseach at the time, Deputy Cosgrave, and the Government opposed the holding of a by-election because a general election would be held in June and they could not see the point in having a by-election within six months of a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1981, when the Government were in opposition, Deputy O'Kennedy went to Europe and they challenged us to hold a by-election.  We refused because there was a general election in the offing.  They are the only two cases in which a by-election was not held and there were very <Col N="979" /> good reasons in each case.  This does not apply in this case.  The Government are supposed to be coasting along.  Why not test their budget and policies?  There is no imminent general election and therefore the by-election should be held.  The reason they are not holding the by-election is because they are afraid to face the music.  They have been well beaten in Dublin and Donegal which are two representative areas.  Laoighis-Offaly is a third representative area and would give a good indication of how people feel. That sample is far more important than that of a marketing survey organisation. The Government are running away from the by-election because they know we will win it.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are in total disarray in the constitutency of Laoighis-Offaly.  If they cannot agree on the nomination of a candidate that is no reason for not allowing a writ to be issued here and putting their policies to the people.  It is an internal problem and they should face up to it.</P>

      <P>When Fianna Fáil were in Government by-elections were held as quickly as possible.  I believe the Government are making a mistake in this regard. If they had any fire in their bellies, any belief in their policies or any spirit, they would hold the by-election and test public opinion.  They do not appear to have the guts, spirit or enterprise to do so.  If I were advising the Government in this matter I would urge them to go ahead. Democracy is about the competitive challenge of opposing points of view and personalities. They have failed miserably in this respect and it will not do them any good because the reaction of the public will be that the Government are windy.</P>

      <P>The Government cannot do U-turns in matters of this kind.  A short time ago the Taoiseach advocated <Col N="980" /> not holding local elections on the same day as European elections.  He said it would take from European elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What the Taoiseach said was reinforced in this House the other day on the occasion of Justin Keating's nomination for the casual vacancy in the European Parliament when Deputy Pattison said it would be inappropriate to have a by-election when it was suggested that the matter should be left over until the European elections.  He also said that the electorate should not be confused by two different elections.  There is a lot of sense in that argument but why then is it proposed to hold a by-election on the same day as the European elections?  It is for a petty, mean reason: the Government know they are going to be beaten and they feel that their by-election defeat would be buried in the general result of the European election.  It is just a mean, low, snide and petty approach to electioneering and democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a number of excellent candidates going forward who are all anxious to stand.  We will have the best candidate in the field and will win the by-election when we get the chance to do so.  The attitude of the Government is negative and seems to ignore the necessity for going to the people to fill casual vacancies as laid down in legislation.  The holding of a by-election is just as informative and educative as sitting here engaging in sterile debates over many months <Col N="981" /> and losing touch with the people.  I have fought by-elections over many years and emerged from each one more educated in my perspective of how the country functions and how communities work, what makes them improve and develop. It is important for Deputies of all political parties to go out during a by-election and see for themselves the problems that exist in particular constituencies.  Deputies like Deputy Shatter would have a limited perspective coming from a highly urbanised constituency and could benefit enormously from visiting a rural constituency and seeing the problems.  It would enable them to have a much broader view of the problems of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>There is a very important aspect which makes it imperative that the will of the people of Laoighis-Offaly be tested. Within those two counties are mirrored all the major social problems of our society. There is the problem of how to rationalise our energy supply and ensure the development of our natural resources, such as peat, to the maximum extent.  There is also the problem of how to utilise electricity and to maximise employment.  This is an area of importance to the country as a whole and it is a key issue in this constituency.  Very important problems must be faced and we in Fianna Fáil want to see these problems resolved because we claim to be the people who initiated the development of our national resources in those two counties. Successive Fianna Fáil Governments promoted the development of peat and its use in the generation of electricity and we do not want to see any Government reneging on these developments.  Progress must be maintained and expanded in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the employment aspect, reliance on our natural resources makes good economic sense and we will debate that issue fully in Laoighis-Offaly when we get the opportunity.  The people of that area should be contributing to that debate rather than discussions being held in some committee and submissions being taken from bureaucrats and technocrats. Every one of us should go there and assess the situation on the ground and then come back to the House or to <Col N="982" /> a relevant committee and make an appropriate contribution based on the knowledge gathered in these two counties. If off-farm employment were not available in this area there would be a total breakdown of the social fabric. Many jobs are now provided by the rational development of our natural resources and it is a key factor in our economic development that we husband those resources.</P>
    <P>It is also an appropriate time to consult the people of Laoighis-Offaly because the issue of local authority financing is relevant.  Every local authority is facing a massive shortfall.  A large number of people will have to be let go because the Exchequer grant is down substantially in every county and they are unable to meet their basic responsibilities.  This is the time of year when local authorities can usually give employment in roadworks and other construction works but that is not possible this year due to financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>These two counties are traditionally strong in relation to agricultural production of every kind but particularly tillage, beef and milk.  There are enterprising farmers who have made the fullest use of the CAP by increasing their herds and developing farm output.  They are very concerned about the progress of the CAP and would like to hear the views of the Minister for Agriculture on the question of the super-levy and its effect on milk production unless Ireland secures a reasonable outcome from the current negotiations.  There is also the matter of the disadvantaged areas scheme and its non-applicability to this constituency.  It could be expanded with a view to the inclusion of the whole of these two counties in the scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a range of current issues on which the people of Laoighis-Offaly would like to give a view and they are being deprived of the opportunity of doing so.  I would say to the Government: &ldquo;Take your courage in your hands.  Go ahead and have your by-election.  Win or lose we will all benefit from the experience of seeing these people and their problems.&rdquo;  Nothing is to be gained by postponing the matter.  It is anti-democratic <Col N="983" /> and is a cowardly approach on the part of any Government.  It is a wrong approach and is interfering with the European elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer briefly to one of the comments made by Deputy Lenihan.  He said that everyone of us should go down to the Laoighis-Offaly constituency, assess the situation on the ground and come back here.  One of the main reasons we should not have a by-election is that we should not all vacate Leinster House and go down to a constituency while the most important business of sorting out the economy is neglected.  That is what has usually happened when by-elections have been fought.  It is a waste of resources, time and energy when the Government or the two main parties go to a constituency to fight a by-election.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to speculate as to the form or contents of this report, which I would hope will be ready within the next six weeks approximately.</P>
      <P>The total cost to date incurred by the Exchequer arising from the establishment of the Forum is £300,000 approximately, of which £225,000 is charged to my Department's Vote and covers the expenditure incurred directly by the Forum.  The balance of the cost was incurred by other Government Departments or agencies on behalf of the Forum and covers items such as printing of reports and salaries of replacement staff.</P>
      <P>The total number of persons working in the Forum is 20.  Of these, 17 are paid by the Exchequer and three by their parent organisations.  Seventeen are on loan from Government Departments or agencies. Some of these continue to perform duties in these organisations.  None of the persons working in the Forum was appointed by the individual political parties but each of these four parties avails itself of the services of an aide paid for by the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in reply to me on 19 October last year he was fairly confident that the report would be issued by the end of the year?  He said that if there was any over-run it would be of short duration.  In view of the fact that he has now said it will be a further six weeks before the report is issued which will bring us into April, does he consider that that is not an over-run of short duration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I said I hoped it would be produced within six weeks.  It may very well be shorter than that.  There is a problem posed by the fact that I and another party Leader will be absent in the United States in the period around St. Patrick's Day.  This will obviously hold up the proceedings temporarily. The fact that the work has not been completed before the original target date is entirely due to the extent of the ground which had to be covered, the <Col N="985" /> subject matter dealt with and the wide degree of public interest and participation in the work.  We have received 278 submissions, some of which were elaborated on in the 12 public sessions held. We have held 21 private sessions as well as organising visits to Northern Ireland and Britain.  Obviously I would prefer if the work had been completed shortly after the end of the year, but the important thing is that it should be completed well.  All concerned are working hard to ensure that a report is completed before very long.</P>

      <P>There was some speculation recently that there was acrimony within the Forum which was the cause of the postponement and that the report was expected early in March but due to some controversy arising in the Forum it had to be postponed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a factor in deciding when the report will issue.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the delay in issuing the Forum's report indicates a lack of purpose or determination as well as a lack of urgency and, therefore, <Col N="986" /> it is vitally important that a date should be set for the issue of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no lack of purpose or determination by any of the parties involved.  My reference to St. Patrick's Day was to the fact that there will be a period of a week or ten days during which I will be absent and the Leader of another party will be absent in the United States, and in my case also at the European Council in Brussels.  That means there will be a temporary slowing down at that point.  I was explaining a practical reason why, even though work is well advanced, there will be difficulty in completing it quite as rapidly as one might otherwise have hoped to be the case simply because of this hiatus arising from these visits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic aim of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to provide an allowance for any person whose means are insufficient to meet his needs.  A basic weekly allowance is payable to a person whose means fall below a specified level and his means must be assessed for this purpose in accordance with the legislation.  There is also provision for additional weekly payments to meet special needs such as rent, heating, or diet, for single payments in cases of exceptional need and for payment of grants in cases of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any general dissatisfaction with the manner in which assessments are made for supplementary welfare allowances in the Western Health Board area.  If, however, the Deputy is aware of any cases where he considers that an incorrect assessment was made I will be glad to have the matter investiocrati <Col N="987" /> gated by the health board on hearing from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that, where people have been transferred from the Department of Social Welfare to the Western Health Board for payment of benefit, there are instances where the payments are much lower from the health board than from the Department?  That would suggest that, in the method of assessment by officers of the health board, the same guidelines are not being used in assessing the allowances payable to people who have to transfer from the Department to the Western Health Board for payment of benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy appreciates, it would depend on the reasons why they were transferred from social welfare to supplementary welfare allowance.  As I said in my reply, I am not aware of any general dissatisfaction.  My Department contacted the health board about this matter and no such cases have been brought to their attention.  If the Deputy supplies us with details of the cases he has in mind we will have them examined and let him have a reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quote a number of instances.  There is one in particular which comes to mind.  A person was in receipt of unemployment assistance and because he had to go into hospital and have an operation he was transferred to the Western Health Board for payment. The allowance he received from the health board was 50 per cent of what he had been receiving from the Department. That is one instance where what I have been talking about comes to mind.</P>
      <P>There would appear to be some difference in the method of assessment by the Western Health Board and one would assume that when a certain figure was already being paid by the Department a similar figure or almost similar would be paid by the Western Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the details to the Minister but I got a similar reply yesterday in relation to other matters I raised by way of question.  Will the Minister agree that we should not have to come in to the Minister or to his Department with matters of this kind?  There seems to be some discrepancies in regard to the method of assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is the Deputy put down a question and every effort was made to supply the information. The questions asked if I were aware of the dissatisfaction.  I was not aware of it until the Deputy put down his question.  My Department contacted the Western Health Board to see what complaints they had received and our information from the health board is there appears to be no case in which the Deputy was involved.  Every effort has been made to help the Deputy but I would require more specific information.  The question does not provide it and the health board does not appear to have it and so I have nothing on which to go.</P>

      <P>In the case of an unemployed person in receipt of unemployment assistance and the social welfare officer has evidence that the recipient is employed that is a separate scene altogether <Col N="989" /> to that mentioned by Deputy Gallagher. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme was introduced in July 1977 in place of the former home assistance scheme.  The scheme is operated by the health boards under the general direction and control of the Minister for Social Welfare.  Any person whose means are insufficient is entitled to a supplementary welfare allowance and there is a leaflet available explaining the various provisions of the scheme.  One applies to the relevant health board and the community welfare officer initially investigates the claim and then the superintendent may also have to examine it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that a person who is over 18 years of age and in receipt of £19.60 unemployment assistance can have his assistance reduced to £3 per week if his father moves to a better paid job; if he considers this to be a fair implementation of the unemployment assistance system; and if not, the proposals he has to ensure that unemployed young people will have access to adequate independent means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the legislation governing the scheme of unemployment assistance the value of the benefit which an applicant derives from board and lodgings in his parents home must be taken into account.  The amount assessed for this purpose depends on the income of the parents in each individual case and <Col N="990" /> any change in that income affects the value of board and lodgings.  This arrangement ensures that a degree of equity is achieved as between an applicant whose parents are in relatively better off circumstances and an applicant whose circumstances are poor.  Otherwise the situation would arise where the applicant from the better off family would receive the same amount of unemployment assistance as the applicant whose family circumstances are poor.</P>
      <P>The means test for unemployment assistance is designed to ensure that all applicants for unemployment assistance are treated in an equitable manner having regard to the resources available to them and as operated it is a fair and reasonable method of determining entitlement and allocating scarce resources to those in greatest need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot be serious when he claims that £3 to a young man of 19 is a fair and adequate allocation of resources.  Does he not realise that that £3, apart from having to buy shoes and clothing and so on, would get him approximately twice a week across this city by bus and no more?  How does he expect such a young person to look for a job on £3 a week from one end of the week to the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy I can be very serious about this because, as I stated in my reply, account must be taken of the value the applicant derives in board and lodgings and that in turn is related to the income of the parents.  The Deputy in his question did not quote the income of the parents and he does not give any particulars.  Therefore I do not know the details, but having regard to the fact that the rate has been reduced to £3 per week that would indicate that the parents' net income after deduction of PAYE and PRSI would be in the region of £10,000. With scarce resources it is not possible to apply unemployment assistance without having any regard to the income of the parents.  Even if additional resources became available I would do what I could to use such resources to help the unemployed young people whose parents are <Col N="991" /> unemployed or very poor, not people whose parents are relatively better off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The nub of this problem arises from the fact that in the social welfare code a young person between 16 and 25 years is regarded as a dependant of his or her parents once he or she is living in the house.  Would the Minister not consider that that is an unfair way of dealing with young people in this day and age?  Will he consider changing that system of dependency?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In one sense it might be unfair but it is far from unfair to make the point that a young person living with his parents who could be extremely wealthy would get the same rate of unemployment assistance as young people living in households where the parents were unemployed.  I could not implement such a scheme at the present time because any additional resources that might be made available to me would not be devoted to that purpose but to helping less well off applicants.</P>

Traditionally we have had a live export trade and we continue to have it.  Of course it would be preferable if all our cattle were slaughtered here but the trade does not necessarily meet those requirements.  I should like to point out that the trend of beef or cattle exports from here has changed dramatically in the last 12 or 13 years.  In the early seventies about two-thirds of our beef was exported live and about one-third processed here before export.  Now the ratio is the reverse, more that two-thirds is exported in slaughtered form and one-third live.  In 1983 413,000 cattle were exported live.  That was not to third countries only but to Northern Ireland and Britain.  In that year also 981,000 cattle were slaughtered for export.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>At present the pigmeat industry is experiencing difficulties not alone in Ireland but in practically all EEC countries. I raised the very serious position of pig producers at the January meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers and I am pleased to be able to say that action followed immediately.  A scheme of aids for private storage of pigmeat was introduced as a result and this should help the market situation.  There were some difficulties during December last about intake of pigs by factories following the closing-down of one bacon factory.  These difficulties have been overcome.  It is not possible under EEC rules to grant a national subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware of the serious hardship, in the Munster area in particular, in having pigs slaughtered from November up to this date.  When the fattening period is prolonged there is deterioration in the quality of the meat because the pigs become over-fat.  That, in these present recessionary times, has further crippled pig producers in the Cork area.  What rescue plans has the Minister to save what is left of the industry at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the pig trade has been seriously affected for the past year, particularly seriously prior to Christmas and immediately after it.  Matters have now improved somewhat, but not as much as we would like.  As regards what we can do for the pig industry, I might point out that under EEC rules we are prohibited from giving national aids.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  I accept that point.  However, there are ways and means of getting around EEC regulations &mdash; for example, transport subsidies to the Pigs and Bacon Commission to sell the products on foreign markets, or giving the commission a further injection of money to promote these products.  In our own Dáil restaurant, I have not seen pork on the menu on any sitting day since the Dáil reconvened.  For the record of the House, I would like the Minister to have a look at that matter, because pork is one of the best quality meats that we can have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I am not on the restaurant committee and there are other matters which I would like to raise also.  I am not in a position to do what the Deputy wishes in ensuring that pork and bacon appear on the menu.  I shall consider what Deputy O'Keeffe has asked concerning the possibility of introducing a transport subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the two-fold importance of our pig industry and the reference which the Minister made to the decline in recent time in employment in that industry, the decline among the bacon factories in my own city and county has been frightening, as has been the catastrophic loss to the producers. Is the Minister telling this House that he is merely surrendering to the situation and is not prepared in any way to help the pig industry and restore some of the buoyancy which previously existed, with consequent gains to the farming community and, above all, to employment in cities like Cork, where it was a traditional employer down through the years?  We are now reduced to one bacon factory.  Is the Minister surrendering because he cannot move against EEC rules?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite correct. That situation pertains in most of our agricultural sectors.  I might point out that our exports of pork and bacon in <Col N="1003" /> 1983 increased by 12 per cent on those of 1982 &mdash; from 52,000 to 58,000 tonnes. The cause of the depression in the market is lack of demand at home and on our main export market in Britain.  Luckily enough, we have found other major outlets, such as Japan, which have more than compensated for the loss of some of the British market.  There is an oversupply in Europe generally, which has given rise to this problem.  That is the main reason.</P>

      <P>I sense from what the Minister said, when he talked about the absence of national aids and that national Governments cannot introduce them, that he is now saying that the Commission have turned a blind eye to the existence of the variable premium in Britain while Britain pay 60 per cent of it and FEOGA pay 40 per cent.  Is it the Minister's intention in these negotiations to ensure to the ultimate that the variable premium will be abolished because of the competition it causes to Irish producers?</P>

      <P>The variable premium has been in existence for ten years.  We have repeatedly objected to its continuation over the years.  In its proposals last July, better known as COM 500, the Commission proposed that the variable premium, as applied in Britain, be abolished.  It is renewed annually by way of a proposal from the Commission in conjunction with the price package.  This year such a proposal is not included in the price package put before the Council of Ministers by <Col N="1008" /> the Commission.  We have repeatedly stated, and as late as yesterday, in the Council that we support the Commission's attitude fully on this matter.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister ask the Government to introduce the variable premium scheme here seeing that it is 40 per cent financed by FEOGA and the other 60 per cent is financed by the UK Government?  Would the Government consider financing it to the tune of 60 per cent because it would stop the distortion in trading and would create many more jobs in our meat factories?</P>

    <P>That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his Writ for the election of a member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the death of Deputy Bernard Cowen, a member of the Constituency of Laoighis-Offaly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I referred to Deputy Lenihan's contribution and particularly to his statement that the by-election should be held because it would give everyone an opportunity to assess the situation on the ground.  That is one of the main reasons why we should not have the by-election, because in the past three or four by-elections that is exactly what happened. <Col N="1037" /> Members of the Government, the Cabinet and both main parties went out of Leinster House and down to the constituencies where the by-elections were held.  Legislation and the activities of Parliament were affected to the detriment of the economy.  This is not the time to do that because the economy is unhealthy and we are trying to get it back on the right track.  That is one of the reasons I would not be in favour of holding the by-election now.</P>
      <P>I understand the frustration of any Opposition in this instance.  I do not agree with Deputy Lenihan that by-elections are a reliable pointer.  He cited the Donegal and the Dublin Central by-elections as recent examples of testing public opinion.  They are not good examples because in Donegal in the general election the poll was 56 per cent and in Dublin Central it was 47 per cent.  In a by-election where there is only one candidate the vote is concentrated and the chances are when there is a great margin over an opposing party that party will retain the seat.  It does not prove anything.</P>
      <P>Even in a constituency where a by-election is being held, it is very hard to muster up interest and because of changes in the way of life it is not easy to communicate with voters.  Very often there are teams of Deputies going around the constituency seeking out voters because people do not concentrate as much now as they did in the past on shopping centres or at church gates nor do they listen to what politicians have to say.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan made the point that in 1981 when Deputy O'Kennedy went to Europe as Commissioner the by-election was not held because there was a general election in the offing.  The period between January 1981 and June 1981 when the election was held was a longer time than between now and June. Nobody highlighted Laoighis-Offaly as being a particularly important constituency or that the seat was a vital one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were heated arguments this morning.  Some Deputies on the opposite side, including Deputies Lenihan and O'Keeffe, referred to the fact that there were only Dublin Deputies on this side of the House to discuss the by-election in <Col N="1038" /> a rural area.  Deputy Shatter and I were on this side of the House and Deputy Lenihan referred to the fact that people from a concrete jungle might learn something if they went into a rural area and saw what was happening there.  I take offence at those statements, particularly, that Dublin Deputies do not have any right to speak about rural areas.</P>

      <P>We have every right to speak about rural areas.  It is a very small country and we do not confine ourselves to the Pale.  Deputy Lenihan came from Roscommon-South Leitrim and was very glad to go into the concrete jungle and take his seat there.  He now represents a Dublin constituency.  That is a common occurrence.  Quite a large part of my constituency of Dublin West, in which there was a recent by-election, is rural.  We have a number of farmers in that constituency. Perhaps when Deputies were there they did not realise that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter is well able to answer for himself.  The terrible waste of the time and resources of this House in fighting by-elections has been mentioned. Of necessity Deputies' work is neglected when this is going on.  We now have an opportunity to fight a by-election properly because it will coincide with the European elections.  It will mean that not everybody will be concentrating on one constituency, and because European elections are being held it might result in a much more balanced position in <Col N="1039" /> Laoighis-Offaly.  I do not see why parties cannot muster local forces to fight elections without the help of 166 TDs as well as Senators.  Frankly, I do not think it makes much difference to the overall result particularly when, as happened in the past, the percentages are usually the same as in general elections.</P>

      <P>I know that.  We look forward to taking on Fianna Fáil in Laoighis-Offaly when the time comes. We will be as prepared as we were in Galway East, Dublin West, Donegal and Dublin Central.  It was very obvious that the Galway East by-election was very keenly contested.  We were in opposition at the time and I am not saying it would have been any different if we had been in Government, but there were fleets of Mercedes cars there for the whole three <Col N="1041" /> weeks and Ministers stayed there for the duration of the election.  That is not proper use of resources or efficient use of time.  The suggestions made by Deputy Shatter and Deputy Kelly should at least be examined.</P>

Deputy Lenihan mentioned the list system and Deputy Kelly also referred to the system on the Continent.  People are not happy with our system and we must realise that it is very far from perfect.  It is a murderous job for any Deputy to hold down and people have suggested single seat constituencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the problems which by-elections cause and the effect they have on the Government and on the programme.  The question should be sorted out once and for all.  In the last four by-elections we had keenly fought campaigns.  Other speakers have mentioned that there were promises made during by-elections in order to win votes and those in power would try to put programmes into effect in a particular constituency for this purpose.  Many people vote on local issues.  That is another reason for examining the system. We are legislators and our jobs is to legislate during the Dáil term and to concentrate on the problems facing the country. There is local representation on local authorities but we are elected to the Oireachtas to carry out a programme of Government for the people and to get the economy right.  I support the Minister and the Government in their decision not to hold this by-election and I agree that we should hold it at the same time as the European elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has probably <Col N="1042" /> been too long.  My understanding this morning was that this matter would not be opposed and when I was asked to move the motion I understood there was more than a 50:50 chance that it would be accepted.  I have been advised by my colleague who is sitting beside me that I was misled and this is obviously so.</P>
      <P>Many of the points made today have been relevant and I agree with Deputies Kelly, Shatter and Skelly that we waste too much time.  That time is not wasted in by-elections but we have certainly wasted much time today.  There was no need for long debate and it was not dragged out or filibustered by this side of the House.  There are usually two or three by-elections during the lifetime of any Dáil and if we are to do away with them we will have to employ the provisions which apply in the case of county council or European seats which are filled by some mysterious method.  That will not do much good for democracy.  During a debate several weeks ago Members said that the way we fill European seats in the event of a vacancy arising is a total nonsense. That argument seems to have been reversed today by those who say we are not to have a by-election.</P>
      <P>Political parties and their machines make a public mockery of by-elections when the Government and the Opposition move out of the Dáil and into a constituency.  This is totally unnecessary. In a recent by-election I was director of elections for my party and we decided that with the exception of half a dozen Deputies the remainder would stay in the House and would not commence activity until the last Thursday evening at 5 o'clock when the Dáil rose.  Deputies opposite will have to agree that the strategy was very successful.  The old story about State cars being driven around an area and bringing out the vote is a figment of the imagination which has been built up over generations.  A few gimmicky announcements during the course of a campaign have not won any by-elections in recent years.  It is a total waste of time for large numbers of Members of this House to move into a constituency for a period of weeks, leaving only a few Deputies filibustering here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> Much more is at stake here.  A Member has died and an area has been left without a representative to whom they are entitled. There is no reason why the by-election should not proceed.  It does not suit the Government to allow Fianna Fáil to have a by-election at this stage.  They have far more finances and resources than we have.  They have the State cars and the printing press.  The main reason the by-election is not taking place is that if it were called this week or next week it would take place before the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis.  Half the Cabinet will be out of the country on some kind of official business during the month of March and the Government will be left in the last week of the campaign without their &ldquo;heavies&rdquo; to go into the constituency of Deputies Hyland, Connolly and others. That is the reason the by-election has been cancelled.</P>
    <P>I know that the members of the Labour Party in Government do not agree with this decision and that was spelled out clearly on 8 February last at column 2135 of the Official Report by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Pattison, when he spoke about the European Parliament as follows:</P>
    <P>...we are talking here about the record of the members of the European Parliament representing this country in Europe.  That is what this June election is all about.  I know it disappoints the Fianna Fáil Party that there are not local elections being held in order to keep people's minds off the major issues in Europe that were debated, voted on and discussed in depth at the European level.  I am one of those people who fully support the contention that the European elections should be fought without any local or other kind of election taking place simultaneously.  It is time that people were able to judge the workings of the European Parliament and, above all, the performance of the various people in the Parliament, that the central issue in the European election would not be over-shadowed by any issues of a local authority or national nature. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> That is the official policy of the Labour Party as understood by me.  I gather that the Labour members of the Cabinet were quite happy to proceed and to allow the writ to be moved today, as were a number of other members of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately I missed the 1.30 news bulletin today but it appears that once again somebody on the Government side has given a report of what I thought was a confidential discussion between me and the Government Whip over the past few days when we spoke about the moving of this writ.  I am sure the Government Whip is well aware of what I am going to say.  On Friday he tried to contact me and I in turn tried to contact him but we did not talk about the issue until Monday.  I said that we might move it today but that the Fianna Fáil front bench were meeting on Tuesday, as were the Cabinet, and that we would make no decision until after those meetings.  I asked the Fianna Fáil front bench not to make a decision until I had checked with the Government Chief Whip.  When the meeting was over I spoke several times yesterday evening with the Government Chief Whip who led me to understand that the matter had not been discussed at the Cabinet meeting, that if I did not move it today a special Cabinet meeting would be called today to discuss the issue and that he would consult with the Taoiseach.  I said that if it was a matter of a week, a week would not make any difference and that I was quite prepared to facilitate the Taoiseach and others who will be out of the country on official business on St. Patrick's Day.  That has always been the practice when members of the Cabinet were away.</P>
    <P>What happened subsequently was that the Government Chief Whip said there was no discussion yesterday and no decision and that there might be a meeting today to clear up the matter.  At that stage I was informed around the House that the decision had already been taken that this by-election would not be held until 14 June.  The Government Chief Whip said he was not aware of any discussion on the matter.  I am not accusing him of acting in bad faith, but I can tell him <Col N="1045" /> across the House that the decision had been taken at Cabinet level and communicated to the local Fine Gael Deputies. This has been confirmed to me since, and confirmed to the local organisations.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I was had.  I realise I was had.  The Government Chief Whip can say that the decision was not taken, but a decision was taken that this by-election would not take place now.  It is absolute nonsense to say that there were behind the scene talks and that we did not want the by-election to be held.  It was left to me to negotiate the matter.  I found out that the decision had been taken and that I was wasting my time.  I realised that if it was moved this morning, or tomorrow, or next week it would be voted down. The decision was that it would be held on 14 June.  One Deputy from the constituency whom I do not have to name has since told me that was the decision.  It was communicated to the Fianna Gáel Deputies and to the local organisations. Yesterday when I said I was in negotiation with the Government Chief Whip, Deputies from the constituency laughed at me.  The Fianna Fáil organisation were being laughed at for having set up a convention for next Friday night.  They were told it would be voted down if it was moved today, tomorrow or next week. Those are the facts.  If people do not want to believe them they need not.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that a confidential discussion between the Government Chief Whip and myself should be leaked, when it suits, in an unreasonable and an unfair way.  The story given to members of the media &mdash; they took it in good faith and unfortunately they did not check it with me &mdash; is totally wrong.  I gather that Mr. Prendergast gave out that story.  It is not correct.  The Minister should acknowledge that it is a total misrepresentation of the discussions between himself and myself.  A senior political correspondent met us when we were discussing this yesterday and both of us confirmed to him what the decision was.</P>
    <P>I do not know how it can be made to appear that I turned down a suggestion that this should be delayed for a few weeks and that we were pushing it <Col N="1046" /> although we did not want the by-election held.  It is absolutely extraordinary.  I do not know how that could be given out by a Government source.  If the Minister did not give them that information, some other Minister must have done so, somebody the Minister spoke to after he left me yesterday and before I rang him this morning.  It saddens me that we cannot have a confidential discussion between two Whips without having it taken totally out of context.  The truth of the matter is that the decision was taken last week. This was communicated to Deputies and to the Fine Gael organisations and to me yesterday afternoon, although I was led to believe that there might be some change after a special Government meeting while nobody had any intention of holding a special Government meeting.</P>

      <P>I know I am concluding this debate, but we can do anything by agreement.  If there is one word or syllable I have uttered which is unfair to the Government Whip or not in line with the facts, it should be said in the House when I sit down.  The story now going about as to why we tried to push this writ through this morning is absolutely untrue.  The Minister knows that.  With other important business to be done, I do not think this issue should take up any more of the time of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a coincidence that the next business we will be discussing is the postponement of the local elections.  We hear talk about trying to raise the standards of the House.  The Committee on Procedures and Privileges are trying to stop the <Col N="1047" /> bickering and the arguments and to allow us to be seen as a good democratic Parliament. We talk about getting ourselves organised, having committees and being seen as the Parliament of the people instead of arguing and looking stupid. Yet today we are bickering over something which is unnecessary.  The next issue is unnecessary as well.</P>
    <P>Under our system of government when there are vacancies, the people are entitled to fill them.  I know it can be said that in the case of Deputy O'Kennedy's by-election there was a long delay, but a general election was pending at that time and we had a 20-seat majority.  I do not think it is a parallel case.  By-elections should be held.  It is five years since the last local elections and later today we will be debating that issue.  When we talk about schools, third-level institutions and parliamentary reform it is very hard to justify doing away with local elections and by-elections.  It will be very interesting to hear the justification put forward by the Government side.</P>

      <P>If some of the Government Deputies were allowed to speak there would not be agreement on item No. 8.  We are talking about what people <Col N="1048" /> are saying inside and outside the House. People on the Government side are saying outside the House that they are totally opposed to the decision made last week on this by-election.  This morning before I had even moved the motion, a Government Deputy said he disagreed with the decision and that the motion would be voted down.  That was the first time I knew it would be voted down.  If he were not such a senior Member of the House I would not have believed it.  I know him to be a man of honour and integrity who would not put a wrong slant on it.  He also told a number of other people in our party as far back as last Thursday that this item would be voted down.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that this item has taken up so much time.  We were fed a load of irrelevancies and <i>The Way Forward</i> discussions and other matters which had nothing to do with this debate.  We are talking about the right of the people of Laoighis-Offaly to fill a vacancy which they are entitled to do under the Constitution and under our form of government. I suppose the Government will now proceed with the formality of voting down our efforts to move this writ.</P>

I do not know who told him this matter was decided last week but I can say to the House that whoever told him that was telling lies.  The matter was not decided last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never been dishonourable with the Opposition Chief Whip.  I have never led him astray.  He may recall that last night after Private Members' Business was completed he was in my office and, because we could not come to an agreement, I suggested to him that perhaps he would postpone moving this writ this <Col N="1049" /> morning and that the Taoiseach had agreed that a special Cabinet meeting would be called this afternoon to discuss the possibility of arriving at an alternative date.  The Chief Whip left me saying he would phone me later.  He was going to a dinner and he could discuss the matter. Obviously he did not get an opportunity to do so.  I came into my office at 9.30 this morning and I accept he had difficulty in getting to the phone because the phone in his own office was out of order and he told me at, possibly, 10 o'clock that he was proceeding.  At that stage I notified that, if that were the case, we would be opposing the motion.  That is the true version.  I do not know what information was given to any Deputy here about this matter being voted down last week.  That is not true.  The Government were prepared to discuss alternative dates. Arrangements had been made for a Cabinet meeting this afternoon.  That can be checked with the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann confirms the following Order:</P>
      <P>Local Elections (Specification of Local Election Year) Order, 1984,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 13th day of January, 1984. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Order, which has been made under section 2 of the Local Elections Act, 1973, is designed to postpone for one year the local elections which would otherwise be held in June 1984.  Section 2 of the 1973 Act empowers the Minister by Order to specify the year in which elections should be held, once he is satisfied that they should be postponed.  Any such order shall not come into effect without confirmation by resolution of each <Col N="1055" /> House of the Oireachtas.  The Order has already been confirmed by the Seanad, by resolution of 15 February 1984.</P>
    <P>The reason for the postponement of local elections is to allow a thoroughgoing examination of the structure and financing of the local government system to be completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to contribute.  The House will be aware of the statement which I issued in December, indicating the need to reform the system in order to equip it to cope with current challenges and developments.  That statement referred to the commitment given in the Programme for Government 1981-1986 that local government would be reformed through a reduction in central control and a restructuring to take account of changes in population and the growth of community organisations.  It also referred to appropriate status being given to expanding towns and to the need for new local government units in Dublin city and county.  The examination of this whole question has been proceeding for some time and it is the Government's intention to bring it to a positive conclusion as early as possible.  The postponement of the local elections is designed to facilitate this purpose.  The reasons for the current need for local government reform are clear-cut.  Present structures were established during the last century and, while they have demonstrated great flexibility during the intervening period, they have been unable to cope adequately with the social and economic demands of recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, our level of population growth, increasing urbanisation and radical changes in the pattern of life have all placed strains on a system which was designed for a different age and different circumstances.  Recent years have seen a wide range of new functions being assigned to local authorities in addition to the rapid expansion of their traditional services.  The level of urban development which has taken place in Dublin and in <Col N="1056" /> other centres throughout the country has made many local authority boundaries irrelevant in so far as the planning of major services is concerned.  It has also led to serious distortions in the picture of democratic representation in developing urban centres.  The Dublin area presents special difficulties because of its size and the rate of development over the last decade.  There is an agreed need for more effective co-ordination of services throughout the entire metropolitan area. Regard must also be had to the special needs of the major new development areas in the west of the county.  These areas highlight a problem which is of general relevance throughout the country. The growth in community organisations demonstrates the need for a greater public involvement in local affairs and serves as a challenge to the local government system to respond to the needs of local communities as expressed through these organisations.</P>
    <P>The work which is now in progress in my Department in examining the local government system extends to the arrangements for financing the system. There can be no doubt but that since the abolition of domestic rates and, more recently, the successful constitutional challenge to the land valuation system, local authorities have been experiencing significant financial difficulties.  These difficulties have, in turn, been passed on to the Exchequer at a time when public expenditure generally is under tight restraint.  As a result of these developments, mainly, the proportion of local authority current spending which comes from the Exchequer has gone from 39 per cent in 1977 to 66 per cent currently. There will be general agreement that one of the principal conditions for any system of meaningful local democracy is a substantial degree of financial independence. This situation no longer obtains and I am anxious that measures should be considered as soon as possible to improve the financing base.  We should be perfectly clear, however, that there are no simple solutions to the problems of local finance any more than there are to those of the overall public finances. Local expenditure cannot be exempt <Col N="1057" /> from the constraints being experienced in relation to public spending generally. However, having said that, I am determined that the current review will produce realistic proposals for an increased level of financial autonomy throughout the local government system.</P>
    <P>The recent debate in the Seanad confirms that there is general agreement on the need for reform; also that there are different views as to the lines on which it should be approached.  I am anxious that there should be the fullest possible discussion before proposals are finalised. This debate provides an important opportunity for Deputies from all sides to make an input.  I hope we can have a full and constructive discussion.  I can assure the House that full account will be taken of the views expressed here as well as of those already recorded in the Seanad debate.  I have already invited the representative bodies, the General Council of County Councils and the Association of Municipal Authorities to discussions as a further element in the consultation process and will be glad to take account of any submissions which interested persons or bodies may wish to make</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the postponement of the local elections to allow the preparation of reorganisation proposals to be completed is a sensible measure and one which has already won general acceptance.  This is the first occasion on which the power to postpone local elections by order under the 1973 Act is being invoked.  It is not, of course, the first occasion on which local elections were postponed.  To put it in perspective, the holding of local elections was postponed on 13 different occasions since independence.  If the present order is now confirmed by the House the next local elections will fall due in June 1985.  In accordance with the provisions of the Local Elections Act, 1973, the present members of local authorities will continue to hold office until the new elections are held.  The 1973 Act also contains consequential arrangements in relation to the appointment of school attendance committees and the meetings of vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> As I have already mentioned, the reform of our local government structures is now a matter of pressing concern and I am confident that the order before the House is an important necessary step in allowing that reform to proceed.  I commend the Order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that our amendment is not being accepted by the Chair.  We on this side of the House are, therefore, opposing this motion.  The Government are abdicating their duties and functions twice in the one day.  It would appear to us and to many in the country that the Government, in not holding the local elections this year, are funking their responsibility, refusing to face the electorate.  The Minister of State has mentioned, quite rightly, that the local elections have been postponed on 13 different occasions since Independence. I still regard myself as one of the younger Members of the House and I can recall this happening twice in the last number of years.  I want to put on the record of the House that the local elections due to be held in 1965 were postponed because a general election was taking place.  They could not be held on the following year because of a presidential election.  They could not be held until 1967, in which year they were duly held. There should have been local elections in 1972 which were not held until 1974 &mdash; again for valid reasons.  The then Minister for Local Government had introduced in 1971 a White Paper which was under wide discussion, not alone in the House but among all local authorities.  That Minister, Deputy Molloy, who is unfortunately not present, had consultations with nine different regional authorities throughout the country in an attempt to arrive at a format for local government which would be of long-term benefit to the country. There was considerable discussion on those occasions between the Minister and the various authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned that the local elections are being postponed because of reforms being carried out at present in local government and other areas.  We have not seen any factual results in relation to these supposed reforms.  At least, we produced the White <Col N="1059" /> Paper in 1972 which was a very significant development for local authorities.  The by-election in North Central Dublin prior to Christmas and the opinion polls, some subsequent to that, frightened the day-lights out of the Government, so much so that they have shirked the battle.  In the words of one of the leading members of the Cabinet &ldquo;It is time for digging the trenches, not time for the battlefield&rdquo;. The battlefield would certainly be too rough and tough for the Government at this point in time.</P>
    <P>Further, when the local elections were postponed in 1965, the then Minister, Deputy Blaney, introduced the Bill into the House and my predecessor in County Meath, Mr. Tully, stated then: &ldquo;I have no objection to the postponement of the elections, as a spokesman for the Labour Party&rdquo;.  That quotation is from the Official Report, Volume 217, column 802.  On the subsequent postponement of the local elections of 1972, the present Ceann Comhairle appears then to have been spokesman for the Fine Gael Party.  He blamed the Government for not having the elections because they coincided with the referendum, in the belief that the public would not come out to vote, but had no real, definitive, constructive objections.  The reasons for the postponement were valid, positive, definite and fair.  There was no option.  That cannot be said of today.  There is absolutely no reason for postponing the local elections which were to be held next June.  It would have been ideal to have had the local and the European elections on the same day.  Paradoxically, it has been said this morning in the House that we are to have a by-election in Laoighis-Offaly coinciding with the European elections and yet it was not suitable to have the local elections for the entire country on the same day as the European elections.  That is difficult to understand.  It is against common sense, which should be the hallmark of any Government's decision.</P>
    <P>We stated in our amendment that we deplored the Government's proposal to postpone the holding of the local elections in 1984.  We did this because it was running away from the people who have <Col N="1060" /> become deflated because of the ineptitude and the indecision of the Government. They have also become deflated by the budget which was watered down recently and which was described by the media as a neutral budget, a milk and water budget, a budget which did not give any confidence to the nation, a budget which did not give any incentive to the industrial sector or the agricultural sector and no hope at all to the unemployed and the educated young force who are coming on the job market.  In every town and village throughout the country there are people looking to the politicians to give them a ray of hope, to give our industrialists and employers some incentive to create jobs.  There was only one page out of 86 pages in the Minister's budget speech devoted to agriculture. Our farmers as well as people in the industrial sphere have their backs to the wall.  Some farmers have even been evicted from their land.</P>
    <P>The local elections are not being held this year because of the matters I have just mentioned.  We have the deplorable situation of the feeble, inept effort of the Government in relation to the super-levy. The EEC announced this early last summer and it was far too late by the time the Government acted with any effectiveness.  If we were in office we would not have allowed that to happen. When Deputy Ray MacSharry and Deputy Brian Lenihan were Ministers for Agriculture they made sure the super-levy did not surface.  The dairying industry will suffer if the super-levy is introduced. There are many families involved in that industry.</P>
    <P>We have the ridiculous situation where local authorities are expected to provide various services for the community with a frugal increase of 0.8 per cent on last year's allocation to them.  They are faced with meeting the shortfall.  This does not take into account our inflation rate of around 10 per cent.  The Labour members of the Cabinet told the Taoiseach and the Fine Gael members of the Government that the local elections could not be held this year because they would be decimated if they were held.  Their vote would be eroded by The Workers' Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State not mind 1965?  I have given the reasons for 1965 and 1966.  We did not run away from the issue in 1979.  Even though there was a very difficult wind we went out and faced the battle to our cost but we gave the people the democratic right to judge the Government of the day and their local government of the day. That is the fundamental democratic right of the people.  We would give that opportunity today if we were the Government.</P>
      <P>Part of our amendment stated that we wanted discussions with the newly elected members of local authorities in order to get their views on how local authorities should be funded and operated. Those of us who are members of local authorities for some years are aware of the problems.  We wanted to invite those newly elected members to give us their views which would be innovative. There cannot be anything better than having people with fresh ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason why we wished to have the local elections held this year was that we would get new blood into the various local authorities, corporations, county <Col N="1062" /> councils and town commissioners throughout the country.  I do not wish any of my friends on this side of the House or the other side to lose their seats on local authorities but democracy and elections being what they are we know that there would be some changes among the members of local authorities.  Since I came into the House in 1967 there have been many changes in this House.  We intended to encourage the greatest possible participation in the European elections by having the local elections held on the same day.  I am speaking as a person who will be a candidate in the European elections.  One of the great difficulties for people going forward for the European elections is to stimulate interest, generate enthusiasm and get the message across that Europe is not in the outer hemisphere or on a different planet but that we are an integral part of Europe. Many fundamental decisions will have to be made by those fortunate enough to be elected to the European Parliament and as members of the various European groups.</P>
    <P>The problems we have at home are much the same as those of our European partners.  The biggest issue across Europe is the problem of massive unemployment. This problem must be arrested by the Government of Europe and constructive and positive policies must be put forward by the Parliament.  If we fail to sell the message to the people on 14 June that this is a very serious election which will affect their lives, and particularly the lives of the unemployed, then there is a great possibility that the whole European concept will be eroded.</P>
    <P>I submit that holding the local elections with the European elections, as we did five years ago, and having local people running for town commissioners, borough corporations and county councils is an ideal avenue through which the people would be encouraged to come out and vote for their local councillor and also look at the European ticket and say: &ldquo;There is the party and the man I will vote for.  He will do something for me and my family&rdquo;.  It is a mistake not to hold the two elections together.  The by-election will be held on that day in <Col N="1063" /> Laoighis-Offaly and it is difficult to understand why the local elections could not be held on the same day.</P>
    <P>On the tenth anniversary of our entry to the EEC in January 1983 the Taoiseach is on record as saying that the local and European elections should be held on the same day to ensure the maximum turnout and to further ensure that our European partners would perceive in us a deep commitment to the philosophies, goals and ambitions of Europe.  Strange how the Taoiseach seems to have changed his mind, but then he is a man who changes his mind quite often unfortunately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>His mind was changed for him on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not know whether the Cabinet, the Donnybrook set or the Labour Party run him.  He does not run the country and he certainly does not run himself.  He is propped up by PR right, left and centre.  Why did he change his mind?  The Taoiseach must answer that question.</P>
      <P>What will the cost be if the two elections are not held on the one day?  There are so many factors involved, from county registrars booking schools, people employed to man the booths, schools being left unoccupied and so on that it is difficult to know where to start in trying to estimate the cost.  In my constituency the cost of a general election is of the order of £12,000 to £14,000 to my party.  It is a five-seat constituency.  If that was spread across all the parties and county registrars throughout the country the estimate would be of the order of £2 million or more.  Any sound economist would say that it is only plain ordinary goddamn common sense to hold the two elections on the same day and save everyone, party wise and county wise the double expense.</P>

      <P>One must accept that. Over 98 per cent of the Catholic population have Mass on Saturday nights so that does away with the argument that we should not hold elections on Sundays. That is also the case on the Continent, at least as far as the Catholic Church is concerned.  I hope the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State will look at that suggestion in a positive way.  I spoke about this matter before and many people thought there was wisdom in my suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone should we seriously consider having national elections on Sunday but we should also have our local and European <Col N="1065" /> elections on the same day.  It would have been sensible to do that and I fail to see why the Government could not have done so.  It would have reminded the people that the Government are not asleep all the time and that sometimes they think of something new.  If confidence emanated from the Cabinet it might spread to the rest of the country and there might be an incentive for the whole community.  I am sorry the Cabinet could not agree to do this.  If we were in Government we would seriously consider having the European and local elections on the same day.  I know there are arguments for and against it and I would be prepared to listen to those against it.  The Government must not be seen to be stodgy and stuffy in sticking to old rules and regulations which were handed down by the British.</P>
    <P>When the last local elections were held here, Fianna Fáil took very difficult decisions. There were demands for massive increases in public sector pay which were resisted as far as possible by the Government in the interests of fairness to every section of the community.  We also had the famous P &amp; T strike which caused so much distress.  That would have been a good enough reason for Fianna Fáil not to face the people but we held the local elections in 1979 when our popularity was certainly not at an all time high.  There was also a refuse strike and our canvassers were asked how they would get rid of the black sacks.  The Fine Gael canvassers were able to blame Fianna Fáil for the strike&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the side issues of losing the local elections was that we lost control of most local authorities. That helped the Government to gain control of local elections and, more significantly, control of Seanad Éireann because it is the elected county councillors, borough councillors and Members of this House and Seanad Éireann who elect the Upper House.  This affected us very badly in the last three Seanad elections.  However, we faced the issues at the time and said that the people had a right to decide. The Government are not giving the people the same opportunity which we gave them in 1979.  They are abdicating their responsibilities, funking the issues and digging the trenches instead of stepping out on to the battlefield.  The people will not forget.  In local democracy there are fundamental issues which also apply to our EEC partners.  We could have fought those issues on the ground but we will still fight them when we get the chance.  If the by-election in Laoighis-Offaly is held on the same day as the European elections the wrath of the people will vindicate what I am saying today.  The Government should have the courage to face the people by holding the local elections when they should have been held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>The resistance to this motion by the Fianna Fáil Party, taking into account Deputy Fitzsimons' speech, indicates the real ineptness of the extent of Fianna Fáil opposition in this Dáil. They themselves more than once on previous occasions have done precisely the same thing for poor enough reasons. They send in Deputy Fitzsimons, a <Col N="1067" /> respected and honoured Member of this House who is, perhaps, on his way to the European Assembly and who will also be a candidate in the local elections, thereby achieving triple representation, although Fianna Fáil have waxed lyrical about double representation.  Deputy Fitzsimons was sent in to make noises with no great confidence and no great enthusiasm about a matter which Fianna Fáil have accomplished on previous occasions, the postponement of the local elections.  No doubt on some future occasion when they are again in government they will have no hesitation in doing the same thing if the circumstances seem to them to be appropriate.</P>
      <P>Having local elections, having regard to developments which have taken place on the local scene, is utterly unthinkable. As the Minister points out, the problem of the expanding towns and exploding populations, particularly in the area of County Dublin, must be taken into account and there is no way in which a local election could be held today which would be meaningful for local democracy. The Dublin area is the only one I can speak for and in the five years since the last local election there has been a massive population explosion and many new towns have been built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with my respected colleague, Deputy Seán Walsh, with whom I work in co-operation, I represent the new town of Tallaght which has a population approaching 100,000 people.  The local authority which covers the area is Dublin County Council, an institution set up in 1898 which has operated in virtually unchanging fashion since then.  It has been proved to the people of Tallaght time and again that the organisation of Dublin County Council is so geared that, having regard to its geographical spread, it is not in a position to deal with the local affairs of Tallaght.  A town of such size requires its own urban council and this is what the people of Tallaght have indicated they want.  They have submitted a requisition to the Minister for the Environment to set up town commissioners and they are seeking the grant of urban <Col N="1068" /> status.  This will have to be done if we are to have anything approaching reasonable democracy in the area.</P>
    <P>The same considerations and criteria apply in other parts of County Dublin. Local elections worthy of the name cannot be held within the existing parameters. Dublin County Council was geared up as a rural county council and as recently as 20 years ago Tallaght was a small country village whereas now it is a burgeoning town.  The Minister had little choice but to postpone these local elections for the purpose of giving reasonable local representation to the people where these demographic changes have taken place.</P>
    <P>It is a reflection on successive Governments over the past ten years that plans were not drawn up and implemented to revamp and propose new structures for the entire greater Dublin area, including Dublin city, Dublin county and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  There has been plenty of talk about it and there have been many reports but all too few of them have reached the level of legislation.  I expect that the necessary alterations for the Dublin area will be forthcoming in sufficient time to have them well examined by the three local authorities concerned, by this House and by the Seanad so that we can have effective local structures in good time for the local elections in 1985.</P>
    <P>We have had many unacceptable situations developing in Dublin as a result of the failure to tackle this problem.  In County Dublin the major developer in relation to house construction at private and local authority level is Dublin Corporation.  They have constructed possibly even more local authority houses than the local authority which has the functional responsibility for the area, namely Dublin County Council.  The franchise of people living in corporation houses is taken away from them as a result of this.  They may have matters to raise with the local authority which housed them, Dublin Corporation, but they do not elect any Dublin Corporation councillors.  They live in the functional area of the county council and can only go to a county councillor who is not a <Col N="1069" /> member of the corporation.  To a large extent many thousands of people in County Dublin are thus disfranchised.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the wide range of new functions which have been assigned to local authorities, in addition to the rapid expansion of their traditional services.  I do not know exactly what functions he is referring to.  It comes as some surprise to me.  Many of the functions of local authorities are being taken away from them.  Local authorities in the United Kingdom certainly exercise a far wider range of functions and powers than they do here.  Health used to be a local authority function but it has been taken away.  In the UK the local authorities deal with education as well as health.  Here education is the function of the vocational educational committees.  Also in the UK local authorities in many cases act as the police and transport authorities. All these functions have been taken away from local authorities here and the trend has been to whittle away their powers and functions.  This is an undesirable development and I would hope and expect that serious consideration would be given by the Minister to that fact in the new plan which he requires this year and which will be forthcoming for debate.</P>
    <P>The question of the financing of local authorities is dealt with by the Minister, together with the arrangements that will have to be made for the financing of the system.  That will be a major problem but the nettle will have to be grasped.  Local authorities are being denuded of the finances necessary to enable them to provide basic services which hitherto they were enabled to provide through the rates system.  Various Governments gave an undertaking and conveyed to the electorate that when the rates were abolished central Government would make good to the local authorities the amount of rating finance they needed.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil started the trend of not providing sufficient finance and subsequently Coalition Governments followed the same unfortunate pattern.  In a nefarious, unseen manner they cut back on the rate substitution figures they were supposed to have provided for the local authorities.  Year after year the services <Col N="1070" /> the county councils have been able to provide for the people living in the areas have been reduced, whittled away and cut back.  This is beginning to show in all sorts of ways, in the maintenance of local authority houses, in refuse collections and in the provision and maintenance of parks and open spaces.</P>
    <P>There was a time when a local councillor could go to the manager and complain that such-and-such a service was not receiving the degree of attention to which the people living in the area had been accustomed.  Even in my early days &mdash; and I have been a member of a local authority for ten years only &mdash; the manager would say he would see about it and try to ensure that the service was improved.  Now the reply is highly significant and quite different.  The reply is that the manager will ensure that the maximum service will be provided within the resources available to him.  That response speaks for itself.  It is an indication that the availability of finance and workers has been reduced.  That trend will have to be arrested.  People are entitled to, require and pay for a reasonable degree of cleanliness in their estates, a reasonable refuse collection and to have parks and outdoor spaces provided.  They are entitled to grants for community centres. These are all basics.  They are not luxuries. They are necessities.</P>
    <P>As well as producing his plans for the reorganisation of the areas which I have pointed out is so necessary, especially in new areas like Tallaght I am asking the Minister to ensure that the new authorities which are to be set up will be geared and provided with an adequate degree of finance which will enable them to carry out basic local authority functions in a proper manner and provide the basic necessities and facilities for the people of those areas which they so richly deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that we are not to have local elections has been announced at last, but we knew it for quite a long time.  We were aware that, in an attempt to put a bit of a burnish on his tarnished image, the Taoiseach was quite prepared to face the electorate, but Deputy Taylor's party are the very people who did <Col N="1071" /> not want an election.  They are the people who said no.  So much for leadership.  The decision was not made by the Leader of the Government but by the Tánaiste.  He was moved sideways because of Deputy Cluskey's departure, and he was not left with the odius task of making the announcement.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste had gone to a new post and, during the holiday period when the Dáil would not have an opportunity to discuss it immediately, the announcement was made.  That is an example of government by stealth.  It was not announced in the Dáil.  It was not announced when the decision was made earlier.  It was announced around Christmas when it might escape unnoticed.</P>
      <P>That is another example of the craven cowardice of this Government.  We are to have no by-election.  We have no investigation into a bugging scandal.  Now we are to have no local elections.  The reason for all that is that there is no backbone in the Government.  This is a reluctance by a cowardly Coalition to face the electorate and give an account of their stewardship. They looked around for some plausible excuse which would go down well. The obvious one &mdash; and little references were made to it when the kite was flown at the start to see how people might react &mdash; was that they intended to reform the system.  I agree it needs reform.  We all know it has needed reform for a long time.  It needed reform in 1973 when the then Minister, Mr. Tully, did not give us any extra representation in Kildare but jockeyed around some of the areas and moved Kilcullen into Kildare.  We told him what we wanted.  That is still on the records of the Department, the Department of Local Government at the time and now with the more grandiose title of the Department of the Environment.  I believe that even today very little has been done to bring about that reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Kildare we have a five-seat constituency with a population of about 120,000 people.  We have 21 members on the council.  Other counties with half our population have as many.  We have huge towns in the north of the county and, by the nature of things, it is not possible to <Col N="1072" /> divide up the representations among them all.  Many of them feel they have no direct representatives from their own towns on the council.  One of those towns is Leixlip.  Despite the fact that there was a lack of sanitary facilities to cater for that town, one of the last things the then Deputy Tully did as Minister was to grant permission for a huge scheme in Dublin. We had no Bord Pleanála at that time and the Minister used his discretion, or indiscretion as the case may be.  He granted permission for a huge complex in Dublin and hoped that Kildare sanitary services would be able to cater for it. That is still a bone of contention.  It is an example to us in Kildare of the old saying that a dying wasp will sting you, and he did sting before he left.</P>
    <P>Town commissioners feel they are not representative of their areas in cases where the boundaries have grown.  Other places in north Kildare have looked for urban status and town commission status which should not be denied to them. There was a movement to extend the town boundary in Naas.  In Droichead Nua there are hundreds of houses outside the town boundary and the people there find themselves disenfranchised.  This should all have been done long ago, and it is not good enough to say it should be done now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor talked about towns expanding.  That did not happen overnight or in the past few years.  Tallaght has been there for years.  I do not know whether it can be dealt with in the course of a year as mentioned, but something should have been done about it before now.  Deputy Taylor said he was sure that, having postponed local elections before, Fianna Fáil will postpone them again in the future.  At least he is resigned to the fact that we will return to office, as we know we will when we get an opportunity. I doubt that the Labour Party will be able to produce a Minister for the Environment in the future.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned local authority financing.  I hope that will be one of the reforms.  Local authority housing is chaotic.  We have disgraceful roads.  When representations are made to an engineer the reply is that he cannot do much <Col N="1073" /> because of lack of finance.  We have 20 applicants for every house.  There is no capital expenditure in the budget to cater for them.  Sanitary facilities are needed everywhere.  There is no expenditure on roads.  We had a good team of people who completed the work on the Naas by-pass.  There is much more work to be done in North Kildare, or on an extension of the by-pass to cater for Newbridge and Kilcullen and to give southern bound traffic greater scope.  That was not done.</P>
    <P>Local authority financing is in such a state that it will break down completely. Government Departments have been granted an 8 per cent or 9 per cent increase in their financial allocation just to keep them ticking over.  How can you expect a local authority granted only a .8 per cent increase, one tenth of what other Departments get&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>10.3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>.8 per cent.  No matter what the Minister says I am sticking to the .8 per cent increase and I know I am right.  They will not take over.  It will be something like the budget.  The Minister says there are degrees of public involvement in local affairs.  This is not the way to get a greater public involvement.  To my mind greater powers have been given to the present managers.  They have authority now to impose service charges and I agree with Deputy Taylor that it is his experience, as it has been my experience, that the powers of local authorities have been consistently eroded.  They have less powers now than they had.  We have a situation now where the manager at the instigation of the Tánaiste can impose charges for water and sewerage and refuse collection.  He can even impose a charge of £5 to join the library service.  Carnegie was a Scotsman and they are reputed to be mean but here now we have a charge of £5 to join the library service.  It is ridiculous.  We have had an example of how people kick against such a charge.  This sort of thing is not really democratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about wide-ranging powers being given to members of local authorities.  When he was thinking up his <Col N="1074" /> excuse he said to himself this was a nice phrase and he would put it into his speech.  It is quite meaningless.  Wide-ranging powers are being curtailed every day.  If the Minister is using the excuse of reforming local authorities then I would ask him to do a good job and get down to work immediately.  We have a request in from Kildare County Council that we want 29 seats.  We are entitled to that number.  It is also high time the Minister examined the situation with regard to subsidiary bodies and the very outdated regulations that exist with regard to them.  There is a great distortion in the Seanad voting and eligibility for Seanad voting because of the failure of successive Governments and the Department of the Environment in particular in updating the representation the populations in the various counties demand.</P>
    <P>With regard to subsidiary bodies, I want to deal with a matter that came up some years ago in the county committee of agriculture.  We in our wisdom decided we would leave one place vacant for a representative of the farming community. We took that decision voluntarily. On the day the county council met these representatives were to be nominated on the county committee of agriculture and we indicated we would leave one position vacant.  At the time Deputy Clinton was Minister for Agriculture.  Eventually when we got a consensus of the farming community and named the persons, a well-known member of the IFA, a milk producer and a worthy representative &mdash; we were not aware and neither am I aware yet of his political allegiance &mdash; because he did not mention the Minister on that particular day he was not allowed to take his seat on the committee.  That was in Minister Clinton's time.  That should not have happened, but it did happen.</P>
    <P>We have VEC representation in Kildare now which is, I believe, far too political.  At one time it was not so political. We did not allow politics to enter into education.  We prided ourselves on that.  But I am afraid politics have entered in now.  The representatives of bodies under the aegis of the VEC, the TUI, have sought representation by statutory <Col N="1075" /> right on these bodies.  They have explored the position where in other semi-state bodies, such as Bord na Móna, a statutory right has been given to TUI members to act on those bodies.  They would hope that by worker participation a teacher, or any other employee, someone employed in the VEC system, could be their representative.  That should be granted.</P>
    <P>We have pension committees and I believe the areas in which these pension committees work are probably the same areas that were first drawn up when the poor law guardians operated.  The same areas exist today.  The committees are toothless and powerless.  The Minister and the Department make the decisions and no matter what recommendations are made they are overruled.  It is high time we looked into that.</P>
    <P>Having said all that I can quite see that the Government of the day and it could just be the luck of the country that they would be there again next year &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

      <P>That could be just the hard luck the country may suffer, but we want a promise that the elections will take place next year.  I cannot see any light at the end of the tunnel.  Minister of State, Deputy Collins, saw it when he looked out from the &ldquo;Metalman&rdquo; some years ago.  I wonder if this Coalition will not be in hot water, or maybe hotter water, next year with a budget and an unemployment figure getting nearer to 250,000, with all the problems still that they were going to solve.  Indeed, I wonder would they like to postpone the elections for another year.  What excuse will they have then? Possibly they might say the very wide-ranging reforms had not been completed. I hope the officials in the Department will get busy now and ensure these reforms are dealt with without delay.  Perhaps that would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Years ago people accepted that local elections were always held in a year ending in five or nought and one could plan one's diary in advance.  We are back now to 1985 and I hope it will be 1985 and that <Col N="1076" /> the Government will settle on the five-year period.  It is a pity they did not use the opportunity we used to have the local elections and the Euro-elections on the same day.  That would stimulate interest and get the voters out.  This decision to my mind can only be considered as a insult to county councillors, urban district councillors and town commissioners.  The people occupying those positions at present might be happy enough to stay there, particularly those representatives of Fine Gael and Labour who might feel somewhat shaky, but it is not right to let the term run into six or possibly seven years. I have the greatest admiration for these people.  They do wonderful work.  They are unpaid.  They are very close to the public.  They are very unselfish people.  If they were not they would not occupy these positions.</P>
    <P>It is vital for local democracy that these elections should be held.  It is no wonder the people have become cynical about this Government.  The greatest nudge this Government got with regard to elections was when they lost the Dublin by-election. It was brought home to them then not alone in rural Donegal but in the urban inner city of Dublin, where they had some hope of gaining support, that their star was no longer in the ascendant. They failed miserably.  The Labour Party in particular were given a clear indication of where they stood.</P>
    <P>That is the reason these elections are being postponed.  One often notices that boxers when they are getting a bit long in the tooth are very reluctant to defend their titles.  They postpone possible fights.  They like to pick an easy touch. As far as this Government are concerned there are no easy touches left in Laoighis-Offaly just as there are no easy touches left in Donegal or Dublin.  They are safe nowhere in Ireland now.  They will not take us on in the county championships. They will not even take us on in the club matches with the local elections.  Unfortunately for them they have to play in the European cup and I know they will get their answer there.</P>
    <P>This extraordinary Coalition, the fourth and final one, I venture to remark, have been only about 15 months in <Col N="1077" /> power.  My Fine Gael colleague from Kildare said on an earlier occasion that he would not like to portray them as a galaxy of geniuses or something like that.  They were reputed to be the cleanest Cabinet ever and that was exemplified by the Minister for Justice, who said he would clean up the Department of Justice from the word go.  He was the favourite of the media.  I felt at an early stage in his Ministry that his cause for canonisation was very far advanced.  I cannot understand why he is so silent now.  Maybe he has taken a vow of silence to further his cause for canonisation, but since his own favourite subject of bugging has been raised &mdash; he majored in that subject &mdash; he has been very silent.</P>

The 18 year olds who cannot get jobs but who have the vote are ready to give this Government their comeuppance.  A report of the Commission on Taxation commissioned by Fianna Fáil is at the Government's disposal but they will not implement the proposals of that commission.  They are piling more on the PAYE sector every day and the taxation situation is not getting any better.  This Government are a disgrace.  They are the most unpopular Government ever.  I would forgive them if they were prepared to come out of their corner and face the people, but they have thrown in the towel before the fight and that is the first time that happened.</P>
      <P>We demand that an election be held in June on the same day as the European elections.</P>

      <P>Some boxers are notorious when they come out of their corners, and one should be always be very wary that they do not deliver a knockout punch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of the allegations of Government cowardice made in this House today.  It has been alleged that they do not have the courage to meet the people and the result of the <Col N="1078" /> Dublin by-election is supposed to be the reason for this alleged cowardice.  I ask Fianna Fáil to cast their minds back to other Dublin by-elections and remember that the vacancies were not necessarily caused by anybody on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>A number of people have suggested that on the one hand it is necessary to have local government reform and to redraw the boundaries and the structures that have governed local government for a number of years and on the other hand that we should immediately proceed with the local elections.  We have to make up our minds what exactly we want.  There is no sense telling the public that the Opposition are at one and want elections urgently to be able to flush out this so-called cowardly Government and to teach them a few tricks and at the same time tell the public there is a need for reform.</P>
    <P>My colleague opposite said that around 1974 the then Minister for Local Government received a submission from the Fianna Fáil Party which involved very wide-ranging reforms which would resolve all our problems in relation to local government.  What did they do when they got into power in 1977?  Did they implement their own proposals?  Not likely.  If elections were held at some vague date in the future and should the people be unfortunate enough to have another Fianna Fáil Government, there would still be no reform.  Their proposals would remain untouched and local government would remain as it was &mdash; archaic, outdated and unworkable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzsimons said it was time for digging the trenches.  There is no need to dig trenches.  They are already there, a mute testimony to the failure of local government over the last four or five years.  If anybody wants to see that all he has to do is drive around any of the roads and see where the local government structure has broken down.  The financial structures are non-existent.  Every local authority is crying out for new ways and means to raise finance in its own area. What have Fianna Fáil to offer?  Nothing except the pious platitudes we have been listening to all day.  I am disappointed <Col N="1079" /> they were not more constructive and were not prepared to make submissions to reform local government.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to an uni-maginative budget &mdash; how that came into this debate I do not know but I presume it was another way of saying that the Government parties were afraid to meet the public.  I can remember a budget the only major ingredient of which was the doubling of VAT from 2½ per cent to 5 per cent, and that was not 100 years ago. Fianna Fáil will remember that because we all remember it.</P>
    <P>The whole structure of local government needs very careful appraisal, first from the point of view of the local authority area of jurisdiction.  There have been numerous requests from various authorities &mdash; urban town commissions or local authorities &mdash; where there may be need for changes to allow for current development, such as large scale housing developments which were never envisaged when the structures were originally introduced and for which a number of amendments need to be made to allow the people living in those areas to feel they have direct representation locally.</P>
    <P>People may say that the introduction of new tiers of administration, extra administrators or bureaucrats would be the answer, but that to my mind is not the answer.  What we need is a proper financial structure and to be able to create a situation where the people living in a local authority area will recognise that there is some way they can pay into a system which in turn gives them the services they want.  They have not seen that for a number of years now.  If we consult with people in the urban or rural areas we get the same reply again and again.  They are paying taxes but they cannot see where their money is being spent.  If we do nothing else in the next 12 months but create a system where those people will recognise that they are doing a useful job paying into the system and that they will see a return for their money, then we will have done a good day's work.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the strain in the <Col N="1080" /> local government system is the fact that over the years local authorities have been given fewer powers but more responsibilities, a rather peculiar system.  Local authorities are responsible for the implementation of the Litter Act and the prevention of water pollution.  They are also responsible for water quality control, fire and refuse collection services and a host of areas where local involvement has become imperative by virtue of legislation passed by this House and upon which there has been no follow-through by way of provision of extra financial accommodation. It is ridiculous to expect the local government system to work under those circumstances.  We would be failing in our duty as local and national representatives if we were not prepared to consider the matter and bring forward suggestions to resolve this serious problem.</P>
    <P>I can think of many reasons, in addition to the condition of our roads, why we should have such reform.  For example, such matters as the provision of sanitary services and refuse collection should be taken into consideration.  I do not believe that the charges introduced in recent years &mdash; some of which were opposed &mdash; are the ideal way to finance local authorities but it is the only system that could be devised in a short time to collect sufficient finance to enable local authorities to carry on.  The reform that is taking place should give serious consideration to replacing those charges with a more equitable financial structure.  The rating system which operated up to a few years ago was unfair because it did not take account of the ability of a person to pay. We should grasp the nettle now and introduce an equitable system of local charges. That should be done within the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>The public perception of public representatives and representation by them is not what we would like it to be because people feel that public representatives cannot do very much for them.  As Deputy Power stated if one writes to the engineering section of any local authority one gets a reply to the effect that they are unable to meet the request because of lack of finance.  It is no wonder that the public should conclude that there is little <Col N="1081" /> point in voting for public representatives. We must change the structures and make the system more relevant from the point of view of the general public.  I have no doubt that the public will respect us if we do that.  I do not think the public will deliver the body blows the Opposition have suggested but they will recognise that we had the courage to undertake the important reforms required, even if that meant having the courage to postpone the local elections for a valid reason.</P>

Local representatives do not get the returns for the effort they put into their work.  The system should be changed.  I hope in the coming months that the Opposition will put forward submissions in regard to local authority reform.  In 1974 they made such submissions to the Minister for Local Government but when in power they did not implement any of them.  We forgive them for that lapse but we will not be so forgiving if they do not put forward constructive submissions now.  At the end of the day our people will be the winners if we can show them that the money collected in taxation is spent in their areas and if we can show them that local representatives <Col N="1082" /> have a say in the method of collection and spending.</P>

      <P>We have heard a lot of talk today from the Government side about local government reform.  As a member of Dublin County Council I appreciate that there has been rapid development in the area covered by that body such as Clondalkin, Blanchardstown and Tallaght.  It is no harm to remind the Minister that Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have been controlled by the Coalition parties for a number of years.  The last speaker dealt at great length with the financing of local authorities and urged us to grasp this nettle but I should like to put it on record that when we were discussing the estimates for Dublin County Council very few Fine Gael or Labour members were present.  At the conclusion of the debate some of them started to argue between themselves to get an excuse to leave the Chamber.  One of the people I am referring to was a Member of this House and is now a Member of the other <Col N="1083" /> House.  When Deputy Durkan suggests that we should grasp nettles he should also stress the importance of Members living up to their responsibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate relates to the postponement of the local elections and the financing of local authorities and in such a debate it is no harm to highlight the attitude of some of the Coalition members on Dublin County Council. Some Fine Gael members at the meeting I referred to did everything possible to get an excuse to leave the Chamber so that they would not have to make a decision. That may be one of the reasons for postponing the elections.  I regret that Deputy Taylor left the Chamber after his contribution because I would have liked him to hear that point.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Molloy's amendment. I regret that the elections will be postponed.  In 1979 Fianna Fáil could have postponed the local elections.  At that time the Government were not popular but they proceeded with the local elections after increasing the membership of Dublin County Council from 25 to 36.  The Coalition parties did well in that election but I am satisfied that if the local elections were held this year that position would be reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the extra responsibilities given to local authorities in recent years.  Deputy Molloy, listening to the then Tánaiste, Minister for the Environment, speaking about water charges, was told that the responsibility for these charges still lay with the members of the local authorities.  We realised at the time, but could never get him to admit, that the powers had been passed on by the Tánaiste to the county managers to make these charges themselves. As a member of a local authority &mdash; Dublin County Council &mdash; I want to make the position very clear.  Responsibilities previously held by local authorities have been very much removed from them down through the years and it appears that that will continue.  The present Minister <Col N="1084" /> will continue to pass on the functions regarding new charges to the Acting County Manager or County and City Manager, as is the case in Dublin city and county.  I am satisfied that this will apply throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The present Minister is I believe, still a member of Dublin Corporation.  If I am wrong, I stand corrected.  I want to refer in his presence to the rapid development by Dublin Corporation in west Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown and particularly in Tallaght, where many thousands of local authority houses have been built without any recreational facilities. I have told the housing co-ordinator Mr. Morrissey, that some facilities should be provided by Dublin Corporation to help these people.  We are told that discussions are taking place at present with the Department of the Environment.  I make a special appeal to the Minister to see that something is done.  It is all very fine to say that grants are available and so on.  How can people, moved out from the centre of the city and arriving in these areas without any organisation whatsoever, be expected to form a community council or residents association to look after the provision of these facilities?  The time has come for reform, in the interests of these people.</P>
    <P>Because of the massive development by Dublin Corporation in the Tallaght area, the itinerant problem has been intensified.  Very few facilities are provided by Dublin Corporation for itinerant families, the whole responsibility being hived off on to Dublin County Council.  These are the reforms that we would like to see, reforms which mean something.</P>
    <P>On the question of postponement of the local elections, there is no doubt that these elections were postponed in the past.  As Deputy Taylor said, which I was very pleased to hear, Fianna Fáil will probably postpone them again.  The local elections were held in 1979 and they should be held on this occasion.  The excuses given are reform and new financial structures, but we all know that the real reason is that of the two parties making up the Government, one party did <Col N="1085" /> not want the local elections to take place and the Taoiseach had to give way in order to have the budget passed.</P>
    <P>There is mention of postponing the local elections until June 1985.  Possibly the speakers on the opposite side of the House will try to tell us otherwise, but it is well known that the decision has been taken that these elections will be postponed until June 1986.  That is the view around this House and among the various local authorities so why are we not given this information here today?  If a document has been produced with this information, why can it not be clearly brought into the open, giving the reason for the postponement of the local elections and when they are going to take place?  I fully realise the need for reform, but I hope the reform will be carried out in a proper manner and will mean something, especially to people in these newly developed areas.  There has been much mention of reform on paper but it is the people, particularly those in local authority housing who can do little or nothing for themselves, who need the benefit of reform.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor mentioned the question of urban status for Tallaght.  Every member of Dublin County Council would fully support that call and it would be welcome. However, what powers will members of an urban council have in an area such as Tallaght?  Practically nil.  Those powers are being removed over the years.</P>
    <P>I favour the holding of local elections. I have been for many years a member of a local authority and for quite a few years a Member of this House and never could it be levelled at me that I opposed the holding of any election when the time came, particularly local elections.  I do not see why they should not be held now. Of the members of the various parties who control Dublin County Council, when it comes to facing their responsibilities quite a number fail to turn up and when it comes to making a decision they are afraid to meet their responsibilities. If any additional charges are to be incurred, the responsibility for these will be handed over to the County Manager or the Assistant County Manager of the day.  If we are going to call that reform, <Col N="1086" /> heaven help the people of Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan referred to financing and said that when one writes to an engineer, a county manager, an assistant manager or some official one gets the reply back that they have not any money. Is it any wonder we have not money in County Dublin when the members concerned are afraid to face their responsibilities. As I said on many occasions, if a member decides to go forward for local election and he is elected to a local authority he should face his responsibilities. I want to put on the record of the House the itinerant problem, which is such a major one in the Tallaght area. We have members of the local authority who shout loudest about the itinerant problem and say that something should be done, but they would like some decision taken at council level when they are not present so that they can go and tell the people that they were not part and parcel of that decision.  This is the type of local government we are having at the moment.  I hope if we are to have reform that something will be done about this as well.  I hope that reform will mean something and will be of some benefit to the people concerned.  I support the amendment tabled by Deputy Molloy to proceed with holding the local elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This decision by the Government is a double blow to the Opposition today.  They have had their chance on the by-election in Laoighis-Offaly and that has been voted down.  Presumably from the intimations in their speeches they have now assumed that, their amendment not being accepted, the motion will be carried in favour of the Government.  Deputy Walsh seems to have something on the councillors in Dublin County Council in regard to their inability to contend with their democratic responsibilities.  I am sure those councillors will answer that charge in their own way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a member of that <Col N="1087" /> local authority and I am not in a position to answer his specific charges but I assume the record will show that up. Local elections have been postponed 13 times already since the foundation of the State.  When the Opposition were in Government, it is fair to say, they always did what had to be done so far as retention of power was concerned until the people threw them out at various times in the history of the State.  In 1979 the Fine Gael Party did not allow their European candidate members stand for local authority elections on the basis that it was impossible to do both jobs effectively. That decision has been carried forward again this year into the European elections. The dual mandate has not been allowed except in the case of serving members who will have to decide on the course of their careers inside a specific time limit.  That decision was taken by the party so far as their members are concerned.  They stand for one area of responsibility only.</P>
      <P>In 1979 when there were members standing for European elections and local elections on the same day, and possibly for both elections at the one time, this stimulated local interest, but I believe the time has come when European elections should stand on their own merits.  It is time the people, as members of the European Communities, were able to live up to their responsibilities; and whether the vote be 20 per cent, 50 per cent or 75 per cent those elections should stand on their own merits in that regard.  The increase in apathy, frustration and cynicism among young people in one sense stems from the lack of access and credibility they have in their representatives. That stems in turn from the fact that they do not see effective results and effective decisions emanating from local authorities at the present time and at national level too in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the larger urban areas, where local representatives now represent more people than many Dáil representatives, that those people who have no real authority or no real power vested in them have to contend with community councils and communities of people who are frustrated <Col N="1088" /> because they have not got the facilities they require.  This leads to a sense of apathy and to the ill repute of politicians and public representatives in general.  The urban councils all over the country have grown far beyond the lines laid down in the original terms of the legislation setting up urban councils.  Any rural town that has expanded in the last 20 years has expanded far beyond those limits, so there is a need for reform there.</P>
    <P>The necessary importance has never really been given to the desire for change right across Europe in terms of increased powers and increased effectiveness of the local authority system.  The national media in any European country naturally tends to give priority to international events and the newspapers of Europe and the media in general are always littered with sensational headlines with regard to enlargement of the Community, nuclear problems, agricultural problems, political scandals or major financial implications and decisions.  The effectiveness of local authority reform and local government reform in any country is never given due prominence in the media so that the people living in those countries can be informed that their political masters at least have their interests at heart in trying to reform local government effectively. There is a great strength of commitment and will among local authority members to see the system changed effectively. That commitment has never been matched by national Governments over the years.  We had the 1972 report, a White Paper on this matter, and we had a discussion paper in 1973.  Nothing happened about that since except for various submissions from different organisations who tried to raise the matter at various times.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of local government is not simply a matter of managing the affairs in a better way.  It calls into question the fundamental principle of local autonomy, the relationship that exists between local government and national government and the whole political philosophy of government, so far as that relationship exists, and how local government should be financed to provide facilities for the people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> The legislation governing local authorities was drafted in 1894.  We are now 16 years from the end of this century and we are really trying to cater for a twentieth century country with nineteenth century legislation.  Many of the statutes, functions and matters referred to local authorities are no longer relevant to them and have not been so for many a long day.  The Minister of State with responsibility for this has an opportunity to create an everlasting name for himself by being the Minister to bring about effective local government reform.  County council meetings all over the country are turning into local rows and do not achieve anything except heighten the fun so far as the local newspapers can present it to their people.  No real or effective financial decisions can be taken because the executive powers are vested in the county manager and, irrespective of the wishes of the council, the manager has effective executive control over any decisions that have to be taken.  Since the legislation was first drafted in 1894 there have been many changes.  There were major changes in demographic trends.  We now have 50 per cent of the population under 25 years of age.  There have been great infrastructural changes and much of rural Ireland is now supplied with basic sanitary and water facilities which urban Ireland took for granted for many generations.</P>
    <P>With the abolition of rates a few years ago the interest charges on loans secured to provide these facilities are crippling local authorities.  At meeting after meeting councillors state their vehement opposition to the ineffectiveness of local government.  They desire effective change and it is time for that.  Between now and the holding of the local elections, the Minister should implement local government reform.  I was disappointed at his speech.  It did not spell out the reasons for change.  There should have been further detail about the need for change in the new satellite towns of Dublin and the functions which are no longer relevant to local authorities.</P>

      <P>The Minister should set about proving to the Opposition that his speech was not just bland words but that he intends to implement reform.  His predecessor had many good ideas about how it should be reformed.  He visited many local authorities and took their views into consideration.  The Minister of State should accumulate that information and co-ordinate it into an effective plan or else give councillors an opportunity to re-state their views.  He should call in the 29 Government agencies which exist to help business people and ask for their views on how there might be less duplication of resources and how energy could be channelled into local government reform so that councillors would be able to do an effective job.  The county managers, assistant managers and county secretaries should be called in and asked for their views on local government reform. Planners, architects and the various regional bodies and organisations should be called in.  There is a lot of very hard work to be done if effective reform is to be introduced in the next 12 months before the extension date expires.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's party had their opportunity and did nothing about it.  Deputy Power referred to many minor committees of local authorities &mdash; national monuments, sheep-dipping, library and itinerant committees.  Many of these are ineffective and obsolete in some cases.  The Minister should bring in a plan so that the Opposition will see that he is serious about reform and that their charges of fleeing before the public and being fearful of the electorate are not valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards members of a political party who are democratically elected not being met by Ministers of my party or the Labour Party when they are members of various delegations, I do not think any Fine Gael Ministers refused to meet any one yet.  I do not know what the position would be if Fianna Fáil were in office.  If <Col N="1091" /> a local radio Bill goes through, presumably councillors will be asked to speak on their local radio about local issues.  That question must be looked at.</P>
    <P>Many people do not have pride in their country.  They have no pride in their environment and the priceless heritage we have by comparison with our European counterparts.  It is obvious from the filth and rubbish on the roads, beaches and scenic areas that people are not proud of their country.  That does not apply across the board but it is true of a certain percentage of the population. Effective local government representation would see to it that people knew where their representatives were and the powers they had.  They would see to it that they played their part in the proper upkeep of their part of the country.</P>
    <P>County councils are only rubber stamps for executive decisions taken by someone else.  Councillors can have a bash at each other in a political sense but the decisions taken are ineffective in terms of the powers vested in them.  It is fair to say, due praise has been paid to them already today, that they are the unpaid slaves of the public.  They attend many meetings and deal with various organisations.  They do not have the authority to do what they know should be done.  There may be political reasons for that but that is how it is.</P>
    <P>The financing of local government is of paramount importance to the Minister of State.  In view of the present production of the Estimates, in each local authority area the people are beginning to realise that the financing structure at present is not working.  While there is restraint on local authority income there is no restraint on statutory demands made on them.  A local authority might now get .8 per cent of an increase in its revenue from central funds but it could be challenged with up to 23 per cent of an increase in a statutory demand from a body such as the Office of Public Works or a health board.  This places a crippling burden on many ratepayers and taxpayers in the local authority areas.  In my county many small shopkeepers are faced with the proposal of paying £31 in the pound rateable <Col N="1092" /> valuation.  They are in competition with multinationals and have to pay tax, VAT and so on.  This is a crippling burden on them.  The Minister and the Government must look at it.</P>
    <P>If the trend of having a payment for this, that and the other with the right of appeal continues, the system will be clogged up from an administrative point of view.  It would be far better to have one decent charge which would equal all the small charges with appropriate rights of appeal and waiver facilities.  The system is not working effectively.</P>
    <P>The ratio of representation between councillors and the people they represent has to be taken into account.  In rural areas councillors represent a certain number of people.  In the larger urban areas, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Dublin, councillors represent more people than are represented by Dáil Deputies.  Without effective powers and legislation, confusion, apathy and cynicism grow among the people who see that kind of ineffectiveness in their elected representatives.  I accept the decision of the Government to postpone local elections until 1985.  We would not mind if they did take place sooner; we have no fear in that regard.  However, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment must prove to the House and the country that his speech here today will be backed up by effective action in the next 12 months and that when local elections take place in 1985 there will be a properly represented and effective system of local government in operation.  As a member of a local authority, I would welcome that.</P>

      <P>I also deplore the proposal of the Government to postpone the local elections which were due to be held in June.  We have been told they will be held in June 1985 and I accept that because the Minister for the Environment, in answer to a question from me, said that elections would be held.  However, the Government are noted for changing their minds very often so I fear that the elections due to be held in June 1984 will not be held until June 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there are 13 precedents <Col N="1093" /> for this but I do not intend to go back as far as 1894 or even to decades after that Local elections should have been held in 1972 but, at that time, we were preparing a White Paper in regard to local elections and there was a valid reason for not holding them then.  The Government have not produced a White Paper and I doubt that any reform in relation to local government has commenced.  The Government must give ample opportunity to public representatives, county councillors and the public at large to make submissions. If they do this, there would not be enough time between now and June 1985 to hold these elections.  Councillors elected in 1984 should be able to study any revision which the Minister may introduce and I believe it would also give the Minister and Department of the Environment officials a better opportunity to study the position also.  The Government and the Minister have been set the task of restructuring local government.  However, I firmly believe that that is only an excuse to postpone this election.</P>
    <P>If this election had been held it would have saved something in the region of £1 million.  During the Dublin Central by-election, local gossip said that the outcome of that election would decide whether local elections would be held this year.  It is scandalous that the Government and the Minister for the Environment should decide to hold a by-election on the basis of the result of the Dublin Central by-election.  Members of the Government party were relieved that there would not be any local government elections.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for the Gaeltacht told us that elections for Údarás na Gaeltachta would be held in October of this year.  If the Government are seriously interested in saving money, Údarás na Gaeltachta elections should be held on the same day as the European elections thus saving at least some of the £1 million which will be lost as a result of not holding the by-election on the same day as the European elections.  If the legislation introduced in the last session by the Minister for the Environment is a forerunner of further legislation I believe we will be left with a dictatorship.  They introduced <Col N="1094" /> legislation reducing the reserve functions of local authorities and increasing executive functions.  I believe new legislation will provide for executive functions and that there will be no functions for the councillors who are elected to represent the people at local government level.  If the Minister for the Environment is serious about looking after local government finances he should get his accounts in order and pay the councils what he owes them.  Agricultural grants and domestic rate relief should be paid.  At present the Department of the Environment owe something in the region of £800,000 to Donegal County Council.  Before we start on any restructuring of local authority all bills should be paid and we should have a clean sheet.  We should be given an opportunity to carry out some of the functions for which we were elected at local authority level.  We have been given a miserly increase of 0.8 per cent to try to carry out our functions.  The Minister must realise the conditions of the roads and the problems which all local authorities have.</P>
    <P>Members of Údarás na Gaeltachta were elected by the people of the Gaeltacht and when the Minister did not have his way there he decided he would call in the three board members who did not agree with the Minister at the time.  How right they were.  He decided he would have a little dictatorship in the Gaeltacht. We will not allow the Government to introduce restructuring of local government and deprive county councils of power.  I believe that is what they want to do and we had another indication of that today &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of further moneys due to the council as a result of <Col N="1095" /> the undertaking by the former Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party who informed us that moneys would be made available to pay for clearing frost and snow.  Those moneys are still owed to Donegal County Council.  It cost £207,000 this winter to clear the roads and I believe we will have serious difficulty in obtaining that money from the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The newly-elected members could discuss any reforms which the Minister might introduce.  The electorate are hoping that the Minister will not have an opportunity to introduce the type of legislation he wishes.  The Minister has been saddled with this job and told to take on the mantle of restructuring local government while the Government have no serious interest other than postponing these elections.</P>

      <P>Is oth liom a rá go bhfuil mé i gcoinne an ordaithe seo.  Being against the order being made by the Government I fully support the amendment put forward by Deputy Robert Molloy <Col N="1096" /> which was not accepted.  The exact terms of the amendment are as follows:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;deplores the Government's proposal to postpone the local elections due to be held in 1984,</P>
      <P>recognises the need for the strengthening of local democracy following full discussions with newly elected members prior to the introduction of amending legislaton, encourages the greatest possible participation in the European Parliament elections by holding them on the same day as local elections, deplores the additional cost if local elections and European Parliament elections are not held on the same day,</P>
      <P>opposes the confirmation of Local Elections (Specification of Local Election Year) Order, 1984, and calls on the Government to fix Sunday, 17th June, 1984 as polling day for local elections and European Parliament elections.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efforts being made by the Government and Government speakers to camouflage the real reason these elections are not being held and the diversions and irrelevances which are being used will not distort the real fact which is established in the minds of everybody.  The underlying reason the elections are not being held is that the Government are afraid to face the electorate.  It is an example of the cowardice which has been shown by them on numerous occasions.  This is the pinnacle of their success in establishing cowardice.  Irrespective of what Members might say in support of this order, we know that our colleagues in the Government parties do not wish to have these elections.  They are afraid of an annihilation at local level.  I say again that their decision is based on cowardice.  I could say that cowardice or shirking responsibility is a phenomenon very often manifested, particularly by the major party in this Government.  It is born out of their history, even when they had a different name.  They showed this cowardice then <Col N="1097" /> and it is not strange to me or to anybody else that it should be manifesting itself again.</P>

This is the challenge I am putting to the Government on behalf of the people: &ldquo;Come out and face the electorate and take your medicine, whether it be good or bad.&rdquo;  We know it will be good for us and bad for the Government.  The most recent local elections were held in 1979 when the winds were against us. There were a number of decisions which had to be taken and I can elucidate them if necessary.</P>

      <P>If we had been as cowardly in 1979 as this Government are now, we would not have held the local elections on the same day as the European elections. A number of problems and unpopular decisions had to be made.  We went to the country at a time when we accepted that we were to a certain degree unpopular due to the decisions we were taking. Nevertheless we faced the electorate and if this Government had the same guts they would do the same thing now and stop this foolishness of trying to persuade us that we will have an enormous reform of local government.  It would take ten years to do all that was outlined.  They expect the electorate to believe that it will be done in 12 months when in actual fact they need only to look at the record of the Government and their history over the past 12 months to know from their abject failure that there is no way they <Col N="1098" /> will be ready for local government reform in 12 months' time.  It must be said again and again that the result of the Dublin Central by-election had a most telling effect on the decisions taken by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was making a point with regard to the tardiness, vindictiveness and carelessness of the Government.  Since then I had the opportunity to read the Minister's speech to the House and to read a transcript of his interview on the RTE 9 o'clock news.  I <Col N="1099" /> am even more convinced of the need for a tribunal to be set up such as we call for in our motion.  The Minister has raised many questions which need to be answered.  I made a point last night which the Minister did not attempt to answer with regard to the delay by the Minister in acting on the instructions given to him by the Taoiseach to have the complaint made by Séamus Mallon on behalf of the Moyna family investigated by the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to be totally unaware of the urgency and national importance of having this matter clarified. It is very serious if the home of any citizen is bugged or if an attempt is made to bug it.  It is much more serious from a national point of view to have a home used by the Deputy Leader of the constitutional Nationalist party of Northern Ireland bugged.  Approximately this time last year the Minister was assuring the Irish people that the political performance of the Department of Justice was in his safe hands, that people could sleep in their beds at night and be assured that he would attend to every detail, that he would look after their welfare and they could rest easy.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister was asked by Seán Duignan on the 9 o'clock news whether he thought it had any implications for his continuation as Minister.  He said: &ldquo;No, I do not, but I am always aware, and I have said it publicly, that in the Department of Justice things happen over which you have no control and because they happen while you are Minister you are always politically at risk in such a Department&rdquo;.  How different that is from his attitude 12 months ago, and since then, when he assured the Irish people of his total control over all the <i>minutiae</i> in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot hurl abuse at his predecessor and at the citizens of this land and, at the same time, hide behind this type of reply. He talked about misunderstandings with regard to the manner of the investigation. Why is it that the Garda will not investigate a matter unless the Minister specifically instructs them on the manner of the investigation?  The Minister has to tell <Col N="1100" /> them to interview this person and that person.  What sort of a ludicrous situation has arisen?  The Garda are entitled to better treatment from the Department of Justice and the political head of the Department.</P>
    <P>Those are the type of questions which need to be cleared up by a tribunal.  Last night the Minister failed to clear up the question about the technical capacity of the bugging equipment.  This is still confused and it needs to be clarified.  It can be clarified only by setting up this type of tribunal we are calling for.  I should also like the Minister to clarify whether a warrant was signed before or after 16 November. That has not been clarified.</P>
    <P>In his contribution here last night the Minister was spiteful enough to throw out a suggestion about Provo involvement. He attacked us on the basis that we were supposed to take the word of the Provos rather than of the Garda.  That approach should be beneath the Minister.  On the 9 o'clock news last night the Minister was asked who exactly was responsible.  He said that until we find the actual people who placed the bug in the house no possibility can be ruled out.  Yet he is prepared to say definitely it was the Provos. He is not prepared to consider the suggestion made by Deputy Woods that quite possibly it could have been some maverick outfit within his own responsibility. He is not prepared to have that investigated.  He said that is not the type of thing a tribunal could investigate.</P>
    <P>Of course a tribunal could investigate it.  A tribunal investigated Stardust.  A tribunal investigated Whiddy.  Many tribunals have investigated very serious matters.  Very serious questions have been raised and the most important one concerns the Minister's responsibility. He is guilty at least of carelessness and tardiness and the Taoiseach is guilty of vindictiveness in his comments on Séamus Mallon.  It is unworthy of this House that a former Member of the Oireachtas and Deputy Leader of the constitutional Nationalist party of Northern Ireland, a member of the Forum, should be under a cloud of innuendoes which the GIS have been spewing out over the past ten days and <Col N="1101" /> innuendoes from the Minister and the Taoiseach.  A tribunal of inquiry is required to remove the cloud from Séamus Mallon and the Moyna family.</P>
    <P>The Moyna family were spoken about here last night.  They are entitled to protection by the State from the type of political charges and slurs which were thrown at them to protect the political necks of the Taoiseach and his Minister for Justice.  This tribunal of inquiry is justified.  Having flushed the Minister out after ten days into the Dáil and into his patty cake interview on the 9 o'clock news last night, more questions have been raised and deserve to be answered, and can only be answered before a tribunal of inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you a Cheann Comhairle.  This gives me an opportunity to continue to speak on a subject I was discussing last night, that is, the contents of the amendment proposed by The Workers' Party.  I said last night that I saw considerable merit in the amendment which refers to &ldquo;...other such incidences of telephone tapping or electronic eaves-dropping which may be drawn to its attention; ...&rdquo; and, in particular, &ldquo;to examine whether existing legislation offers sufficient protection to citizens against unwarranted intrusions into their privacy&rdquo;.  Existing legislation with regard to telephone tapping was introduced at a time of fairly primitive technical advances.  Since then we have seen a technological revolution and we have today no adequate protection for the citizen. We have no protection against microbugging of homes or cars or places of business. We have no protection against bugging of places of business and business procedures.  We need protection to ensure confidentiality in regard to financial <Col N="1102" /> affairs.  We have no such protection. This is something that a tribunal of inquiry could investigate with benefit to the State and to the individual.</P>
      <P>It is very important that the law should protect confidentiality in regard to individual political associations.  As the law stands there is no such protection.  That is something at which a tribunal of inquiry could with advantage have a look.  It would be something that would benefit the State.  As things stand there is no confidentiality in the case of political associations.  It would be right and proper that a tribunal of inquiry should have a look at that situation.  We need controls with regard to the type of information being stored on computers.  We need to know that in this year of 1984 Big Brother is not looking at us quite as much as we sometimes feel he is.  Considering the matters we are discussing here this evening maybe he is.  It would be appropriate for the inquiry to have a look at the whole question of what is happening in other countries in regard to legislation designed to protect the privacy of the citizen and what international treaty may exist which we could with benefit ratify.</P>
      <P>One area I would be particularly concerned about is the question of the financial affairs of an individual.  What black lists are held, for example, by credit card companies?  What black lists are held by business companies?  The citizen who appears on such a black list has no knowledge that his name is on it.  A citizen who is the holder of a credit card and has a disagreement with a company finds himself with his card cancelled.  His name is put on a black list and he will no longer receive credit from credit card companies. These are things the tribunal could look at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has merit in it.  To come back to the nub of the matter this Government owe an explanation to the Deputy Leader of the SDLP, to the family he stayed with and to the nation as a whole as to what happened, who was involved, who attempted the bugging. This can only be clarified in my view by the type of tribunal we recommend.  The Minister has proved himself totally deficient as far as the performance of his <Col N="1103" /> duties are concerned in not following up for a period of two months this complaint by the Taoiseach and I suggest that the only course open is for the tribunal of inquiry we suggest to be set up forthwith.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Checks show that there is a record that the telephone subscriber's telephone was first reported out of order on Saturday, 29 October at 10.36 a.m.  The report was stated to have been made from another telephone in the Sutton area, the number of which was quoted.  Only faults on high priority subscribers' lines get attention at week-ends and this subscriber's phone did not qualify for such treatment. Another fault is recorded as having been reported at 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 1 November, the first working day after the bank holiday.  The name or telephone number of the person reporting the fault on the morning of 1 November is not recorded but according to statements in the news media the report was made by the subscriber himself.  The relevant docket prepared by the staff in the fault <Col N="1104" /> report centre is noted to the effect &ldquo;old person in house&rdquo;, &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;.  Both of these faults were reported to the telephone operating staff at the fault report centre.  The two fault reports were passed by the telephone operating staff to the technician staff at the Belcamp fault repair centre on the morning of 1 November; the precise time is not recorded but it is believed to have been between 9.30 a.m. and 10.20 a.m.</P>
    <P>The line is recorded as having been diagnostically tested at the repair centre on 1 November by the staff, and the circuit was found to be normal, giving a ringing tone but no reply from the subscriber. There was nothing unusual about this as many lines reported faulty are found to be working when tested by the repair centre staff.  No further action was regarded as called for by the repair staff. There is no record of the subscriber's house having been visited by any repair staff that day and there would have been no need for them to do so in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps explain at this point that it has been reported in the news media that one of the Department's staff who had been interviewed by the Garda had said that he had been told by the subscriber's wife that the phone went out of order on Friday, 28 October and was out of order on Saturday, 29 October, but &ldquo;came back&rdquo; on Monday, the bank holiday.  It was claimed in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday that this could not have been so because it had not been reported out of order until Tuesday, 1 November.  In fact, as I have already stated, the telephone was reported as being out of order on Saturday, 29 October, but no action was taken on the report until Tuesday, 1 November, the next working day.  It is not abnormal for service to come back of its own accord and, indeed, no repairs were carried out on 1 November on foot of the fault reports made on 29 October and 1 November, the circuit having been found to be working normally when tested.</P>
    <P>The next contact by the subscriber that I am aware of was made on Monday, 7 November, when he phoned the Department's depot at Distillery Road which <Col N="1105" /> does not cover his own area but where an official with whom he is acquainted works.  This official was not there at the time and he spoke to another staff member. The latter understood the complaint to have been about loose wires and this was reported by the staff member concerned to the repair staff at Belcamp.  In the belief that it was the external wiring leading from the pole serving the subscriber to the house that was involved, departmental staff visited the area on 7 November and inspected the external wiring serving the subscriber in question as well as some others in the area, but found no wires down.  The examination carried out was a visual one and the repair staff did not regard it as necessary to call to the subscriber's premises and would not ordinarily do so in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The subscriber called to Distillery Road depot on the same or the next day and met the official with whom he was acquainted.  That official, however, had no direct involvement in the type of work in question and did not become involved in the further treatment of the case.  This is significant for reasons which I will explain later.</P>
    <P>The subscriber called to the Department's depot at Russell Street, the headquarters for that area, on 8 or 9 November and spoke to an engineering superintendent there.  The subscriber explained that some time previously three men purporting to be Post Office staff arrived at his house and installed a wire at the back of the house which they said was for use in connection with the telephone.  He also said that they appeared to have a post office van.  He indicated that he himself was not there when they called but his wife who was in the house on her own when the men called noted that one of the men stood in front of the door of the van.  He added that his wife was suspicious of what the men were doing and that the work was of a very shoddy nature, not like Post Office work.  In reply to a question he said that his wife had not sought any identification from them.  The subscriber made no reference to finding a microphone or transmitter or to Mr. Mallon being involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> So far as this engineering superintendent could ascertain none of the installation staff under his control was involved and he therefore contacted the repair centre at Belcamp to inquire if any staff from there had been to the house.  He was told there was no record of any staff there having done so.  He then spoke to the line technician at Belcamp and asked him to call to the house and to check the installation of the wire with a view to establishing if it was official or otherwise. This having been arranged, the subscriber left.  The engineering superintendent concluded something irregular had occurred as the subscriber had told him that the line to his telephone was directed in through the front of the house whereas the three men had placed a wire at the rear of the house without apparently making any effort to remove the wire at the front.  He also formed the view that the subscriber was very concerned about the standing of the three men.</P>
    <P>The line technician, as arranged, called to the subscriber's house on, so far as he can recall, the evening of 9 November but it may have been on 8 November &mdash; the precise date is not, in any event, of any particular importance.  When he entered the house he picked up the telephone which is situated in the hall and found it working.  The telephone is connected from a distribution point at the front of the house and was not near the loose wiring.  The line technician inspected the wiring in the kitchen at the rere of the house.  The subscriber's wife pointed out the wire which was coming down the external wall from a hole which had been drilled through the wall about six inches from the window and about six feet above floor level &mdash; these are approximate, being the technician's recollection of the facts.  The wire was run straight down the wall and led under the carpet. When he pulled at the wire to see where it was going, the end came up in his hand as it was leading nowhere.  There was nothing attached to the end of the wire. He inspected the wire from the outside but beyond seeing it extending through a tree to an ESB pole, he could not say where it ended &mdash; he had no ladder and this would have been needed to examine <Col N="1107" /> it further.  The clips holding the wire to the eaves of the house were of a kind which he believed could be bought in any store.</P>
    <P>From his examination the technician suspected that the work was not done by Post Office staff but deferred forming a firm opinion until he had traced the other end of the wire over the builder's yard. He told the subscriber's wife he would call back the following day to carry out a further examination.  She said she would not be there that day and he indicated that he would ring her later in the week.</P>
    <P>He asked the subscriber's wife about who had done the wiring and when.  She said the men arrived on the morning of 1 November in what appeared to be a Post Office van.  In reply to questions, she said she did not see the fleet number of the van or the Posts and Telegraphs sign as one of the men had stood in front of the door of the vehicle, that she did not ask them for nor did they produce identity cards, that they gave as their reason for the work that they were rewiring for a new exchange which was opening in the area, and that they could not finish the work as there was a strike on in Athlone.  She did not supply any description of the men.  She added that the men wanted to bring the wire in through the open window but that she objected and told them they would have to drill a hole in the wall.  She had been minding her grandson on the day the work was done and when her son called to collect the child, he remained on until they had left. No mention was made to the technician of a microphone, a transmitter or of any association with Mr. Mallon.</P>
    <P>The technician formed the opinion that the van used was a Renault, of the type used by the Department.  He told the subscriber's wife that he thought the men might have been planning a robbery at the time.  He formed the impression that the subscriber's wife suspected that the work was not done by Post Office staff. On the following day the technician, with the local lineman, went to a lane at the back of the subscriber's house and traced the wire from an ESB pole, along the top of the wall surrounding the builder's <Col N="1108" /> yard, to a point about 30 metres away where it came down and was lying on waste ground.  It was not connected to anything.  They left the wire where they found it.  The two men did not enter the house as they had been told the subscriber's wife would not be there.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter, the technician concluded that the work was not done by Post Office staff.  He reached this conclusion on the basis of the position of the hole in the wall of the house and of its size &mdash; it was bigger than it normally should be &mdash; the facts that there was no bracket on the eave of the house, that the wire was lying limp going through the branches of the tree contrary to Post Office practice as this would have resulted in an earthing fault quickly, and because of the way in which the wire was bound in on the bracket on the ESB pole and of the manner in which the wire was slung along the wall.  The technician telephoned the subscriber's wife on 11 November and told her of the opinion he had formed that the work was not done by Post Office staff and told her she would be well advised to ring the Garda in Howth in case her house was going to be robbed.  She thanked him but did not comment otherwise.</P>
    <P>Recent newspaper reports indicate that the hole in the wall through which the wire came when the premises were inspected by the Department's technician was drilled by the subscriber and not by the three men.  It follows that the wire coming through the hole and down along the wall was also placed there by the subscriber.  I quote from the article by Vincent Browne in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> which said:</P>
    <P>When Michael Moyna saw this later on in the evening of 1 November, he bored a hole through the 18&rdquo; outside wall and was about to thread the wire through it when he discovered the microphone.  After he had discovered the microphone he threaded the wire through the hole anyway, so that the wire would be visible for the P and T officials and anybody else who was to examine it later.  Mrs. Moyna forgot to inform Séamus Moran of the Department <Col N="1109" /> of Posts and Telegraphs that it was her husband &mdash; not the installation team &mdash; who had bored the hole. </P>
    <P>If these reports are correct, these facts were not brought to the notice of the technician who visited the house.  That these were not brought to his notice is confirmed in the report in last Sunday's issue of the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i>  The result was that the work inspected by the Post Office technician was not that done by the three men but at least in significant part by the subscriber himself and the technician can testify only to the standard of the work he saw.  The Department's conclusions in this matter were based on the assumption that the work they saw was that done by the three men; the technician concerned was not, of course, aware of a microphone and transmitter having been found.  The result was that the Post Office inspection was, in effect, of quite an unreal situation and bore very little relationship to the actual position.</P>
    <P>The technician discussed the matter with his engineering superintendent &mdash; this engineering superintendent was not one of those on whom the subscriber called earlier.  The technician said he did not think the wiring was carried out by Post Office staff and expressed the view that it might have been placed there as part of a plan to carry out a robbery in the house.  So far as the engineering superintendent was aware there were no plans to improve the telephone service at that address and therefore the wiring at the rear of the house had nothing to do with the working of the telephone.  He was reinforced in his suspicions when he received a report about the same time that men in the Portmarnock area had been inquiring about Northern Telecom telephones.  It was most unusual to have as many as three men in groups engaged on light repair work and, particularly, working from a Renault van, as a larger vehicle is needed for three men.  Having examined the diaries of staff under his control and having established that none of them was due to be in that area on 1 November, the engineering superintendent reported the incident at Howth Garda Station on 14 November and furnished a <Col N="1110" /> report to his district headquarters.  He also telephoned the subscriber's wife on that day and told her that so far as he could establish the three men who called on 1 November were not Post Office staff under his control and he advised her to notify the Garda as the only conclusion he could come to was that the house was being inspected for a robbery.</P>
    <P>I might add that the engineering superintendent whom the subscriber had contacted at Russell Street depot telephoned the subscriber's wife about 11 November &mdash; he cannot be certain of the exact date &mdash; to confirm that engineering staff had called.  She confirmed that she had a visit from a Post Office official who had found an additional wire coming from the rear of the house but she made no reference to any other items having been found. The engineering superintendent told her that he felt she should get in touch with the Garda, but she replied that her husband was looking after the matter and thanked the engineering superintendent for his help.</P>
    <P>I should say that in some instances, as I have indicated, it is not possible to be certain of the precise dates for certain events, but where there was any doubt I have indicated that.  In any event, I do not regard precise dates after 1 November as having any particular significance or of having any special importance insofar as the events concerned my Department.</P>
    <P>I have had further inquiries made by my Department's investigation staff recently.  These have not thrown any new light of substance on the matter except in one instance.  In that case an officer at the Department's Distillery Road depot who was an acquaintance of the subscriber, and to whom I have referred earlier, indicated that he had been told by the subscriber about the microphone and transmitter and of the association with Mr. Mallon.  That officer is responsible for major overhead maintenance works and, as I mentioned earlier, was not involved in the treatment of the case.  He took it that the subscriber was looking for advice from him in a personal capacity and, on the basis that the problem had already been reported and was having <Col N="1111" /> attention, he did not pass on the information he obtained.  If he had done so, the matter would have been treated differently by the Department.  In fairness to him, it would appear that the subscriber did not expect him to pass on the information because, according to reports in the news media, he did not want Post Office personnel to be aware of the details.  The fact that this officer was so aware came to light only last week when he was interviewed in some further inquiries being made by my Department.</P>
    <P>That is a full account of the position insofar as my Department's direct involvement in the matter is concerned and I would hope that it may be helpful in shedding light on the events surrounding this case.  The thought that anyone might seek to invade the privacy of another as in this case is something to be deplored in the strongest possible terms.</P>
    <P>This action, it would appear, had nothing to do with the telephone service and there was, apparently, no attempt to connect the wire in question to the telephone line in any way.  As the Dáil will be aware, action was taken last year in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill to introduce heavy penalties for those intercepting or attempting to intercept telephone calls, except in duly authorised circumstances, but it is clear that interception of telephone calls was not the target in this instance.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal now with the alleged tapping of the telephone of the subscriber concerned which was given some prominence over the last few days, following a report in the <i>Sunday News.</i>  It is clear that what is alleged here is the existence of an unauthorised tap.  What was claimed in that newspaper was that the subscriber's telephone was tapped at a roadside junction box called a &ldquo;cabinet&rdquo; about 500 yards from the subscriber's home.  Some details were given of how this was alleged to have been done and the report went on to claim that the method of tapping involved was often used in Northern Ireland by both the IRA and by Army and police intelligence for operations which cannot be officially authorised or acknowledged.  The report quoted Post <Col N="1112" /> Office officials in the Republic as the sources of this information in regard to the tapping of the phone.</P>
    <P>It is the position that for many housing estates and built-up areas in Dublin telephone service is provided from what are called distribution cabinets.  These are locked steel-clad cabinets, usually placed on footpaths, as stated in the report.  Normally big cables are led out from exchanges to a convenient central location and distributed from there along various roads to provide service to individual subscribers.  Indeed, some of the Sutton area is served from a cable distribution cabinet.  In describing the general position the report is correct and what was said may sound quite plausible.</P>
    <P>But &mdash; and this is the critical and only factor of relevance &mdash; Bord Telecom Éireann who have checked the matter at my request have informed me that telephone service for the subscriber concerned is not provided from a distribution cabinet as claimed in the report &mdash; I repeat &ldquo;not&rdquo;.  In fact, the cable is led directly from the local exchange via an underground cable to a distribution pole within 50 metres of the subscriber's house, and service from there is provided via an overhead drop wire to the house. The cable is not led from a distribution cabinet about 500 yards from the house, as was stated in the report; it is led from a distribution pole not more than 50 metres away.  I might say that this house was served from a distribution cabinet up to June 1983, when, in a re-arrangement of cables in the area to meet more applications, this subscriber as well as some others had their cables changed from the distribution cabinet.  I will leave it to the House to judge the reliability of that report in the light of those facts and of the motives of those who invented this story.</P>
    <P>I should say, nevertheless, that following the report, the distribution pole was checked on Monday, 27 February.  There was no tap on it when inspected and there was no evidence that one had ever been placed on it.  The condition of the wire was such that it is believed that if it had been interfered with in this way it would be possible to detect this now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>One matter that has been proved in the debate, and in particular by the contributions of the two Ministers, is that there is a vital need for the adoption of our motion which calls for the establishment of a tribunal to inquire into this whole question as a matter of urgent public importance.  It is apparent from the contributions by the Minister for Justice last night, and the Minister for Communications today, that they are not prepared to make any real contribution towards ascertaining the facts of this matter. The Ministers, and everybody else concerned, can only make a real contribution towards ascertaining the truth when they are put on oath giving evidence before a tribunal with trained lawyers to examine and cross-examine them and all people concerned.  That tribunal would investigate what I regard as a test case as far as our society is concerned. We have here fundamental issues concerning the security of the State and the management of the nation's security affairs.  Those matters are germane to the sort of investigation that can only be conducted in a legal and judicial manner with full examination and cross-examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is apparent that all we have done is made a <i>prima facie</i> case.  A number of questions need to be answered.  We have raised those questions but they have not been answered.  The fact is that they cannot be answered under the procedures which operate here or obtain in any Parliament. In raising this we have shown the complete inadequacy of the Government's position in this matter.  By reason of the inadequacy of the Ministers for <Col N="1114" /> Justice and Communications it is apparent that the questions that need to be answered can only be answered before a judicial tribunal where sworn testimony can be tested by legally trained personnel through examination and cross-examination. There has not been any attempt to answer some basic key questions which I should like to reiterate.  The most important aspect that arises in regard to this matter is the delay from 16 November when the statement by Mr. Moyna was given to an aide of the Taoiseach for transmission.  It is common case that that was transmitted by the Taoiseach to the Minister for Justice within two days of 16 November.  Why was that statement not investigated fully, or partially, by Garda and security personnel between then and 11 January?  This raises serious questions. The communication came from the Deputy Leader of the SDLP, a much respected person.  He made a complaint to the Taoiseach and the nature of the complaint was fully set out by him as published in last Sunday's issue of the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i>  Apparently, all that happened between then and 11 January was that Garda personnel asked for Post Office engineering reports and these two reports predated the production of the statement by Mr. Mallon to the Taoiseach. The only investigation carried out by Garda personnel over a period of two months resulted in the receiving of copies of statements from Post Office officials, statements which had already been made prior to that furnished by Mr. Mallon. These Post Office statements were handed to the Taoiseach via the Minister for Justice and produced to Mr. Mallon on 11 January.</P>
    <P>That delay must be explained.  Where does Mr. Moyna's statement lie during that period?  Was it in the Minister for Justice's office, with the Garda, or in the Taoiseach's office?  Why was not an investigation made into the house itself, or a statement taken from its occupiers?  Why was Mr. Mallon not interviewed by the Garda during that period?  A whole range of questions require to be answered.  In my view, it is not likely that our Garda would tarry in a matter of this sort.  In my three-and-a-half-years' experience as <Col N="1115" /> Minister for Justice, I found that when the Taoiseach of the day gave an order that something was to be done, it was done very quickly.  I do not believe that in this case the Garda are to be blamed in any respect.</P>
    <P>The reports of the Post Office officials were handed to Mr. Mallon on 11 January and it is remarkable that, there not having been any action up to that, on 12 January a member of the Garda Síochána came to the Moyna household and was handed the transmitter and the microphone.  These matters, if nothing else, would justify the holding of a judicial inquiry to establish the facts.  It must be asked why these matters were dealt with in such a cavalier manner.  There is a cover up, a silence, or a withdrawal syndrome and nothing happens between January 12 and February 19, when the story emerges in the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i> That story we now know was based fully on fact and in accordance with the truth. At that stage, the Garda had the transmitter and the microphone.</P>
    <P>On February 19, we have the most serious and bizarre aspect of the whole matter emerging into the open when, apparently, the Press Secretary of the Government, Mr. Prendergast, or some of his assistants, were made aware of the story appearing in the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i> The Taoiseach is then taken out, at 12 o'clock midnight, to work into the early hours of the morning on a statement in Government Buildings.  The result is a statement which is completely inaccurate, one which does not refer at all to the major, central theme of the Moyna statement handed to him, which would be apparent on any casual examination of that statement, namely the finding of the microphone and the transmitter, a very sophisticated transmitter, to quote the wording.  The essence of the Moyna statement furnished to the Taoiseach on 11 November and investigated by the Garda personnel eventually on 12 January is not even referred to in the statement coming from Government buildings.  There has been a series of incomprehensible delays from 16 November until 11 January, made much more serious because the <Col N="1116" /> matter concerns the Deputy Leader of the SDLP, the main constitutional national party of Northern Ireland and particularly so when the Forum deliberations are involved in the matter.  That such matters would be dealt with in such a cavalier and, may I say, even sinister manner must be investigated.</P>
    <P>We have this midnight ride of the Government Press Officer and the Taoiseach into Government Buildings to prepare a statement for the edification of the public.  Nobody knows the reason why this was done.  That statement opens up with a deliberate smear against the occupiers of that house and the family involved, a respected family in regard to Mr. Michael Moyna living in that house and his brother, Mr. Thomas Moyna living in Scotstown, County Monaghan, a highly respected family in our society with strong trends of the SDLP and of the constitutional nationalism.  These particular people are smeared in the opening paragraphs of the Taoiseach's statement following this midnight ride into Government Buildings.  Furthermore, there was not a single reference to the basic nub of the whole complaint made by Mr. Michael Moyna which related to the transmitter and the microphone.</P>
    <P>These are facts which, straight away, require the assertive, thorough investigation which can be given to them by a judicial tribunal like we suggest, where there can be careful sifting of the facts and careful cross-examination of the various witnesses concerned can ascertain the truth.  We are basically here about the truth.  There has been an attempt by the Government at all stages since they went into office to plagiarise the truth, twist the truth and give a cosmetic account of their activities.  The Government Information Service, a service which is basically a service of the nation and to the nation is to disseminate legitimate news about Government activities, but in this situation has been perverted and thwarted to the extent that these people paid out of the public funds, are now in the course of laundering the truth.</P>
    <P>I have met many journalists in this House and outside it in the last few days <Col N="1117" /> who are very perturbed by this as many police officers throughout the country are very perturbed by the manner in which security and police affairs have been politicised. We are reaping the whirlwind of an attitude of mind which started when the Government came into office 14 months ago and, in particular, early last year, when for the first time, the Government proceeded on a campaign of politicisation of the police force and of security. We have a situation in which decent men in the police force have suffered because of this politicisation and in which confidential files have been revealed in a most opportunistic and unscrupulous manner, a situation which never arose before in the history of the State.  I speak advisedly as a former Minister for Justice and I know of security matters that I will never breathe a word of to anybody.  In 1932, when Fianna Fáil achieved power, there were more security secrets available that could have been used and were never used because of the honour Eamon de Valera paid to William T. Cosgrave, the honour of one Irish Government leader to a previous Irish Government leader.</P>
    <P>Over the past 14 months we have had the most dishonourable and unscrupulous attempt to bring the whole area of security and the police force within the ambit of politics.  This is the price we are paying for it now when nobody knows where they stand within the force and nobody knows where they stand with regard to security.  The security and the police force of the State 14 months ago were used by opportunistic politicians, including the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, to abuse power and to use the power they had for nefarious political purposes.</P>
    <P>I want to give one guarantee here.  If we ever get back into power we will never do that, because we care about the nation and its national future.  The Government in this respect have done the most disgraceful thing that has ever been done since the State was established.  There is no pretence about saying anything else about it.  They are reaping the whirlwind in this particular case.  Let them come clean if they can, be honest about it, have <Col N="1118" /> the type of investigation which we say should take place, not an investigation behind closed doors but the full investigation of a judicial inquiry in full open, legal and judicial manner.</P>
    <P>The other aspects which arise in the course of this particular matter relate to a certain aspect which I would like to query the Minister for Justice about.  It arose in the course of his contribution last night and in the course of his television interview later last night.  It is very interesting that the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner have made it quite clear that there was no involvement by the Minister or the Garda Commissioner in this particular matter.  That has been a consistent, clever, defensive attitude adopted.  I am ignoring the nonsense which arose originally that this House was being cased for a robbery or that the Provisional IRA were involved.  If the Provisional IRA were involved or if a robbery was being planned that would have been discovered long ago.  I am concerned about people who, for their own maverick reasons, may seek to organise themselves to get information of this kind.</P>

All of this is in the interests of the Garda force.  The insulting jibe of the Minister for Justice last night did him no credit. This sort of politics from a Minister for Justice is totally out of place.  This is not an issue of whether, as he sneeringly said last night, we either believe the Garda Síochána or the Provisional IRA.  The Provisional IRA have nothing to do with this.  Let us get that out of the way.</P>

      <P>I want to see established here in particular out of this debate and out of the inquiry we want to secure, the good name of a great police force, that were marvellous in their impartiality and non-involvement in politics until they were dragged into politics by the Government 15 months ago.  In this respect, I want to refer to what the Minister for Justice said last night on television.  I will quote directly what he said and I will answer the challenge he made on television last night.  He said:</P>
      <P>They will be dealt with, and be they a maverick group from any walk of life they will be dealt with, and I know that is the view of the Garda Commissioner as well. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> Taking up his challenge I give him a list of names.  I will not divulge them but ask that they are passed to the Minister so that he can investigate them.  We in this party have carried out an investigative job which might have been done by the Minister and the Government if they were serious about it.  These may be of help to him in finalising the investigations.</P>
    <P>I emphasise one important aspect: We want to have this matter out in the open by way of judicial inquiry to protect the Garda and the institutions of State.  We do not want it to drift as happened in the case of Watergate in the US.  Make no mistake about it, the similarities are quite frightening between what happened here and in Watergate.  Watergate started off as a bungled bugging attempt of the democratic national headquarters.  The first allegation made was that the equipment was not sophisticated.  It subsequently proved to be sophisticated even though the operation was bungled.  All the official agencies at the time ignored it.  President Nixon and John Mitchell pooh-poohed it as it has been pooh-poohed here by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice.  If it was not for the persistence of one newspaper in the US and a vigilant opposition the matter might never have been pursued.</P>
    <P>The matter, which led to the ultimate downfall of President Nixon, was compounded by public misstatements and untruths made by him and his Attorney General, John Mitchell.  In an effort to cloak up and cover up things, they stumbled from one disaster to another.  Before it is too late and the Government stumble into that situation, I appeal to them to set up the judicial inquiry.  Let us have it all out in the open.  If mistakes were made we will not be found lacking in generosity. Mistakes will always be made in security matters but what the country cannot afford is systematic lying to cover up something that need not be covered up. If a blunder was made let it be admitted that it was.  They should either do that or proceed to have a judicial inquiry which would ascertain the facts and establish whether there was a blunder.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> One thing is clear from the facts which we have before us: there is no doubt but that it is a catalogue of ineptitude, stupidity, delay, tardiness and vindictiveness. Right across the board there is an attitude towards this matter that bespeaks not corruption but rank bad government, a Government unable to face up to the facts and adopts all kinds of techniques through their Press Office, Minister for Justice and Taoiseach, that establishes a cloud of cover up around a matter which at the end of the day may prove to be a blunder.  If it is a blunder, why not admit it and be straight?  I can forgive a blunder but if it is anything more sinister and a deliberate attempt to corrode the privacy and the rights of our people, then it is serious and we will indict the Government and hound them out of office.  For the time being, I am giving them the benefit of the doubt but I appeal to them to please establish the tribunal in order that society can be secure in the knowledge that it knows what is going on and knows there is no cover up.  Irish society is intelligent enough to make a sensible and rational judgment on the basis of such a tribunal's findings.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Government of the day set up a judicial inquiry into the death of a man in police custody in Cork after Deputy Lenihan, as Minister for Justice, had stone-walled for two months and until everyone in the country, every newspaper, newspaper editorial and <Col N="1122" /> every nameless hack was shouting at him to do so.  He stood on this.  I thought it was a fit case for an inquiry but I could see some glimmer of honour in the attitude he adopted.  His attitude was that he would not have the police dragged through this.  It had been satisfactorily explained by the inquest which lasted for three days.  The man died as a result of an accident and that was the end of it. That was a defensible point of view.  It was not good enough and an inquiry was set up which exonerated the police.  It was to his credit that he gave in on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I mentioned that incident is that in 1967 it was a good point to say: &ldquo;I believe in the Garda and will not have them dragged through an inquiry.  I believe in them and believe they are telling the truth and the inquest showed that and there is no more to be discovered about it&rdquo;.  That was a powerful point.  The Government of which he and Deputy Haughey were members stood by that point.  It was the best point they had in those days.  A point like that counts for nothing now.  Why is that?  Why is that the Garda are suddenly in the doghouse and people are willing to give credence to the IRA but not to the Garda any longer?  Why is it now the position, as we saw three days ago, that the principal Opposition party is able to say virtually in so many words that the Garda are telling lies and committed a crime or at the very least a civil offence by going into somebody's house and setting up a bug? How is that possible?  How much water has roared under the bridges that that could be possible?  Who opened the sluices to make that cataract flow down the river?  I will give the answer to Deputy Lenihan.  The sluices were opened in 1982 when, for the first time a Minister did not wait for instructions from the Garda when a surveillance operation was mounted but gave them instructions which they were too terrified to withstand. They had good reason to be terrified because the same Minister treated his own constituency as his personal fief as though he was a baron out of the 13th century.  He treated the Garda as his personal SS.  That is why they were terrified. <Col N="1123" /> That is why they did not withstand the pressure but gave in and that is why two years later, they are still in the doghouse in spite of Deputy Noonan's efforts to get them out of it.  It will take more than Deputy Noonan and the work of the Government to do that.  It will take a decade to rescue them from the shadow which Deputy Doherty and the Government of which he was a part threw across them.</P>

      <P>The reason why nobody believes the Garda now and why we on this side have to take on trust what we hear from them is that it never happened until 1982 that we saw behaviour of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to Deputy Lenihan and acknowledge the generosity with which he evoked the year 1932. What he said about that year is true.  Mr. de Valera and his party in those days, although I think their opinions were wrong, were people of some standing. They were men.  They could have made life literally unliveable for many people if they had not behaved in the way which Deputy Lenihan described.  They behaved honourably and I do not think any side ever alleged in the whole 60 years that elapsed between the foundation of the Irish Free State and the events of a couple of years ago, that the Garda were an object of suspicion.  There was the occasional bad apple and we are seeing bad apples now in greater numbers than was once the case but no person or reputable body and most certainly no reputable opposition ever said that they did not trust the Garda.  That did not happen until three days ago.  The reason it has happened is that the Garda delivered surveillance equipment to a politician so that he might bug his colleagues. When did that ever happen under Eamon de Valera or Seán Lemass?  I am not speaking about Willie Cosgrave, Costello or the younger Cosgrave.  When did it <Col N="1124" /> happen under Jack Lynch?  It was reserved for the men of destiny opposite me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was not Deputy Doherty who gave them that training &mdash; he is only a cog in a wheel; it is the leadership of the party which stood over that conduct which has left the Garda force in the doghouse today and made it possible for a debate of this kind to take place.</P>

      <P>This situation will not be mended until the Garda Síochána, from the Commissioner down to the rawest recruit, has a couple of simple precepts engraved on his mind.  It will take more than the efforts of one Government to do this, it will take a series of Governments to get that message home, that no member of the Force has anything to fear from the law or from the course of his own future career if he does his duty fearlessly, enforces the law fearlessly and resists illegal interventions fearlessly. That lesson must be brought home to the Garda and it will take not one Minister who can be trusted but a series of Ministers of the calibre not just of Kevin O'Higgins but of the Ministers for Justice who served under Eamon de Valera, people like Gerry Boland.</P>
      <P>The other precept which must be engraved on their minds is that they must fear breaking the law and, above all, breaking it at the behest of some two-penny politician who will be here today and gone tomorrow, so that he can do down a constituency colleague or a colleague in a squalid leadership row in his own rotten party.  The day that message is engraved on the heart of every guard we will be back to the days of Eamon de Valera and I will assent to the boast which Deputy Lenihan justifiably made.  I will then have an easy mind and not, as on this occasion, a very unquiet one.</P>

      <P>The Government certainly need a distraction and perhaps Deputy Kelly will read my speech since he is not interested enough to stay.  Where is the inquiry which was promised by the Government prior to the last election? The initial steps had been taken by us at that time and why did the Government not continue with that inquiry?  Does Deputy Kelly support the one-sided trial and execution of a Member of this House by the Minister for Justice?  Deputy Noonan's lynching mob executed a Member of this House publicly on television in total contradiction of administrative and natural justice.  Deputy Kelly should think about that in his professional role in University College, Dublin, because that was one of the most scandalous occasions ever recorded and the Minister will regret it for the rest of his life.  He has had his blood sport but he has done irreparable damage to this House and to the security of the State.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Communications had very little to say.  He made many errors in his speech and has not got all the facts. He said that the technician called to the subscriber's house the evening of 9 November &mdash; as far as he can recall.  He then said it might have been the night of 7 or 8 November.  On another occasion he questions dates which were given by the Moyna family and which were given to the best of their recollection.  Of course these dates are irrelevant, they are merely a distraction to send the media off on another wild goose chase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was the initial fault which was reported not recorded?  Is this unusual? The Minister also said it is not abnormal for the telephone to work itself.  We were told the technicians did not have to do anything, but the phone came back itself. That is part of the folklore surrounding this event.  In the belief that it was external wiring leading from the pole serving <Col N="1126" /> the subscriber to the house that was involved, departmental staff visited the area on 7 November and inspected the external wiring serving the subscriber in question as well as others in the area but found no wires down and all the wires acceptable.</P>
    <P>The interesting point is that the wire in question went on to a pole on which there were lines from other subscribers.  Why did the technician not notice them?  It must have been obvious that it was an unprofessional job.  In any event, there is very little in the document which is of any real value in the debate here.  One of the main points which the Minister for Justice made is that the equipment was crude and unsophisticated.  We have been treated to a great debate about what &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo; means.  I join with Deputy Lenihan in pointing out that the first White House statement in the <i>Washington Post</i> claimed that the Watergate affair was similarly crude and unsophisticated. The White House claimed that the workmanship was not up to the standard of the Government's special agencies. That is similar to what the press secretary here put out when this event was discovered.  Is there a parallel with the Mallon affair?  The Minister knows that this kind of equipment is used.  The installation was workmanlike and could have been effective for the purpose for which it was intended.  That is the key element.</P>
    <P>We discovered eventually that it was possible to use this instrument in a number of ways: first, with earphones and a tape; secondly, as a cordless telephone is used; thirdly, from a surveillance van. Since then we did a simple experiment using a similar microphone placed under a thick, foam-backed carpet.  A conversation in the room carried satisfactorily 15 miles on the P and T lines.  A great deal has been done to run down this ordinary microphone which is not so sophisticated.  It has been functioning since about 1910 or 1912 and they have not replaced it yet.  It has been very effective. During this trial we found it was quite possible to stand in a room and talk while the microphone was placed underneath <Col N="1127" /> a thicker carpet than the other one and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has had his opportunity and I will explain it to him later.  We got an electronic engineer to do the study.  Everything we have said is fact.  We are only looking for the truth. We have had to dig and dig to get any information.  We had to probe around to find there was a monitor on the side of the box.  This was never indicated to us. I thought it was only where these things were plugged in but the electronic engineer pointed out that there were two separate prongs for the use of earphones. It was not until we probed around that we found there was a seven-foot aerial. Nobody said anything about that because the question was never asked during the investigation.  A seven-foot aerial made a big difference to the ability of this equipment and its capacity.</P>
      <P>The listening device was placed in the Moyna's dining-room and the Minister has made much of the question of the breakfast table.  I wish he would look at some of the photographs.  The breakfast table was up against the wall and Séamus Mallon usually sits with his back to the wall and the window.  The Minister may talk of the differences of inches and some members of the press may be delighted to follow that lead.  The microphone was in the fold against the wall behind the chair.  A lot of nonsense has been talked about that.  I wish somebody would just go and look at it.  It is very easy to see especially during a simple investigation. I hope at some stage an investigation will be completed.  We found that conversations could carry up to 15 miles and it had to carry only 50 yards to the surveillance set up.  It had the assistance of a pre-amp microchip amplifier.  There is no question about that.  The next time the Minister goes to RTE I suggest he should look at the microphone in front of him.  There is a big wad of foam on top of it and it seems to be very effective in getting voices across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many questions have been left <Col N="1128" /> unanswered by the Minister.  He has admitted that there was substantial &mdash; I would call it unforgiveable &mdash; delay and I will leave it to the Members of this House to judge why the delay occurred and what that insult meant to the man in question, the Deputy Leader of the SDLP, as well as what action should be taken.  It is a matter for the House, the Taoiseach and the Minister.</P>
    <P>During his speech last night the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The written complaint received by the Taoiseach was handed by an officer of my Department to a Garda officer. There was discussion about the need to carry out these inquiries in a discreet way and specifically of the need to keep the information in a very small circle so as to avoid the danger of leaks. </P>
    <P>We would agree entirely with the Minister on this point, as would Séamus Mallon. Surely this small circle should have included the Moyna family who gave the Minister the report in the first instance? How can the Minister expect us to accept that the small circle should not have included these people?  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>But the thrust of the discussion was interpreted on the Garda side as meaning also that inquiries would be confined to P and T officials unless the Gardaí then got confirmation that interviewing the Moynas would not involve any breach of confidence or any understanding that might have been reached between the Taoiseach and Mr. Mallon. </P>
    <P>Could the Minister not have included the Moyna family in this confidential, secret circle?  They looked to have it done that way, as did Séamus Mallon, and that is the way it should have been done in the first instance with a great sense of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach claimed that he was unaware of Mr. Mallon's representations made on 1 February and 7 February.  We heard nothing about that.  We made that perfectly clear last night.  I am very concerned about the answer.  The Taoiseach later emphasised that he did know until <Col N="1129" /> the 19th or 20th about these representations. I find it very hard to believe that the special Civil Service Foreign Affairs contact was not passing on to the Taoiseach the words that were given to him. It demands an answer which we were not given.  We put it very clearly but the Minister and those who spoke on his behalf avoided it, leaving a major question mark.</P>
    <P>There were various other questions such as that concerning the private and confidential request from Mr. Mallon. Why was there not an immediate investigation? Why has the house not been swept even yet?  None of these questions was answered.  The Minister has left us without the answers which are necessary if we are not to have an inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Minister has passed a great deal of blame to the Garda and the Civil Service. I would remind him that the buck stops with the Minister and it is his job in the first instance to direct the work which has to be done.  There has been delay and confusion &mdash; that much is admitted.  The Garda and officials in the Department have been blamed.  It is quite unfair because the direction should have come from the top.</P>
    <P>The report was given on 19 November and such a serious security matter should have been dealt with comprehensively. One of the things which most worries me is the way in which the people concerned have been affected by the vindictiveness of the Taoiseach.  There was every opportunity to deal with it effectively and comprehensively from the start.  It has at least been bungled.  It is admitted that major blunders have been made.  Why did the <Col N="1130" /> Minister and the Taoiseach not set about repairing that situation as soon as they found it to be bungled, whatever the outcome? That would have had the support of this side of the House.  The Taoiseach used the means of smearing somebody else.  How often have we seen that before in this House?  As soon as anybody gets in the way he is smeared.  That is the nature of this Government.  They have become trapped because they have become so accustomed to doing this and the Taoiseach knows no other way to perform.  When something is not going right, when somebody is going against him, he has to use smears and traps, double suggestions and innuendoes.  That is what we have seen here.  It has finally caught up with the Government on this issue and it will not go away.</P>
    <P>The Government would be well advised to have an inquiry and close the matter.  We believe in the security of the State.  We support the Garda Síochána. We want to see these matters dealt with effectively by a judicial tribunal.  We want to see an end to the snide remarks, smears and innuendoes from the Taoiseach. Let us get back to constructive politics which will deal with the real problems of the country.</P>

      <P>Exploration for oil and gas is continuing in west Cavan under an exclusive exploration licence, which covers a large part of the north west carboniferous basin, including 252 sq. miles in County Cavan. Under the terms of this licence two exploratory wells will be drilled this year at approved locations in Counties Cavan and Leitrim.  The first of these two wells is due to be started before 30 April next but the operator has not yet decided which well will be commenced first.  The well in County Cavan will be located at McNean, close to where an exploratory well in 1963 resulted in a small gas flow. I expect that the results from the well drilled will be made known to me before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Proposals for housing schemes at Three Mile House (Phase 2), Tyholland (Phase 2) and York Street, Castleblayney, are at present under examination by my Department's inspectorate. Proposals for two further schemes at Newbliss (Phase 3) and Rooskey are the subject of correspondence between my Department and the respective local authorities i.e. Monaghan County Council and Monaghan UDC.</P>
      <P>There are no public water or sewerage schemes planned for County Monaghan awaiting sanction in my Department. Contract documents for the Ballybay sewerage scheme were approved on the 6 May 1983 and contract documents for the Castleblayney sewerage improvement scheme were approved on 9 May 1983.  It is now a matter for Monaghan County Council and Castleblayney UDC to submit to my Department their proposals in regard to the acceptance of tenders in respect of these schemes.</P>
