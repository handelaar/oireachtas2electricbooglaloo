        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): We were requested by the Opposition to provide this day for foreign affairs.  It is very unfair of the Leader of the Opposition to make a remark like that.  We also facilitated Members of his party by taking a motion out of Private Members Business and putting it into Government time.  That was done to suit members of Fianna Fáil.  We have also been requested on numerous occasions by Deputy Gerry Collins to have a day devoted to foreign affairs in the Dáil.

    <Title>EC Council Meeting: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to make a statement on the European Council held in Dublin Castle on 3 and 4 December.</P>
      <P>I chaired the meeting, as Presidency representative, and was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry.  In accordance with established practice, I have already had the Presidency conclusions of the meeting laid before both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wide range of subjects was discussed. They included the economic and social situation; the enlargement of the Community; integrated Mediterranean programmes; the work of the two <i>ad hoc</i> committees established at the Fontainebleau Council last June; European union, famine in Africa; and a number of topics in the field of political co-operation, including the Middle East, East-West <Col N="1831" /> relations, Central America, terrorism and the abuse of diplomatic immunity.</P>
    <P>I need not spend time here putting forward the case for enlargement of the Community to include Spain and Portugal. Politically and economically, it is incumbent on the Community, pursuant to the call in the Treaty of Rome to other like-minded countries in Europe, to have Spain and Portugal join in our common endeavours.</P>
    <P>On another level, it is important, if the Community is to develop, that it has at its disposal resources additional to those available to it now from the 1 per cent VAT levy and other revenues.  As Deputies know, the bringing into operation of increased Own Resources for the Community by raising the VAT contribution level to 1.4 per cent has been made conditional by certain member states on the date of Spanish and Portuguese accession to the Community.</P>
    <P>The accession negotiations have been impeded by a number of difficulties and obstacles on which discussions both within the Community and with Spain and Portugal have been in progress for a long time now.  The main outstanding issues before the Dublin Council were the regulation of the wine market, fisheries, questions affecting Spanish agriculture, and budgetary discipline.</P>
    <P>The major achievement of the meeting was to unblock the negotiations on enlargement, in particular by overcoming the grave, at times even apparently insuperable difficulties, which had prevented agreement being reached, in either the Agriculture or Foreign Affairs Councils, on reform of the market organisation on wine.  This was an essential preliminary to settling a Community position on wine for the negotiations with Spain and Portugal. Wine is a sector of major national importance to France and Italy, while Greece, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Luxembourg also had major interests at stake.  Over the past few months, the Irish Presidency, working patiently and constructively in the different Councils, had succeeded, through <Col N="1832" /> successive compromise packages, in narrowing the differences between the views of these countries.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, following the Foreign Affairs Council on 26-28 November, we were faced with a deadlock which could have brought the enlargement negotiations to a halt.  Once it was clear that the issues would have to be taken up at the European Council, I immediately initiated a round of contacts on the following days, 29 and 30 November, designed to establish the basis for a further Presidency initiative to break the deadlock. I visited Paris and Rome where I met President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Craxi, with other senior Ministers concerned, as well as meeting, briefly, Prime Minister Papandreou.  In Dublin, before the Council, I met the President of the Commission and the German Chancellor.</P>
    <P>As a result of these meetings and of telephone contacts over the weekend with Paris and Rome, we were able to table, at the commencement of the Council, a new Presidency compromise which was warmly welcomed as a suitable basis for discussion.  The ensuing discussions were at times difficult but led eventually to an understanding which is embodied in a text on table wine that was agreed on Tuesday last by the Heads of State or Government.  This text, which has been circulated, forms an integral part of the Presidency's conclusions of the meeting.</P>
    <P>This agreement enabled the relevant Heads of State or Government to lift the reserves which had hitherto prevented the finalisation of Community positions on Spanish agriculture, fisheries and budgetary discipline.  This they formally agreed to do at the Council.  The agreement on enlargement and wine is, however, subject to a reserve by Greece. Following a procedure agreed by me as President of the Council with the Greek Prime Minister, I first read to the meeting a statement by him recording that Greece did not agree with enlargement unless a satisfactory position of the Community was taken on Integrated Mediterranean Programmes, and that this was also the <Col N="1833" /> Greek position concerning wine, followed by a text stating the agreed Community position to be that &ldquo;Negotiations on enlargement will, therefore, have to proceed on an <i>ad referendum</i> basis in view of the above declaration, placing a Greek reserve on this issue&rdquo;.  The texts of these two statements, as agreed with the Greek Prime Minister, have now been circulated as an integral part of the Conclusions of the Council.</P>
    <P>This means that negotiations on enlargement, on the basis agreed by the Community, can now go ahead on the individual items but that the whole matter remains <i>ad referendum</i> in the light of the Greek reserve.  In the meantime, the question of the Integrated Mediterranean Programmes, on which the discussion at the Council was long, and, at times difficult, has to be advanced so that a positive decision may be reached on it at the March European Council, thus opening the way for ratification of enlargement on the basis of the outcome of the final stages of the negotiations with Spain and Portugal, which can now proceed.</P>
    <P>The Community has for some years now been concerned with the longer term question of how it is to develop as an even more effective economic and political entity in the world today.  At the Council in Fontainebleau, the Council agreed that <i>ad hoc</i> Committee consisting of personal representatives of the Heads of State and of Government should be set up on the lines of the &ldquo;Spaak Committee&rdquo;.  This committee's function is to make suggestions for the improvement of the operation of European co-operation in both the Community field and that of political, or any other, co-operation.  At the Dublin Council we had an interim report from the committee, containing a number of reservations, as well as incorporating disagreement by Senator Dooge himself on the inclusion of defence within the scope of the proposals.  The Council recognised the high quality of the work of the committee and the need for it to continue with a view to reaching maximum agreement. The Council also agreed that the <Col N="1834" /> interim report should be published.  For its next meeting in March 1985, the Council has asked the Committee to complete its work and submit a report which, after preliminary consideration at the meeting, will be the main subject of the European Council in June 1985.</P>
    <P>The Council also noted the interim report of the <i>ad hoc</i> Committee on a People's Europe &mdash; which is concerned with measures to strengthen and promote the identity and image of Europe for the citizens of the Community and for the rest of the world &mdash; and asked the committee to make a further report to the European Council next March.</P>
    <P>On the Economic and Social Situation, I had suggested to the Heads of State or Government in a letter which I sent to them before the Council, that, given the dominance and persistence of the problem of unemployment, we should discuss a collective effort to turn trends in a far more positive direction &mdash; as suggested by the Commission's excellent and balanced Annual Economic Report &mdash; a report which was, indeed, very warmly received at the Council.</P>
    <P>We need to tackle this problem because growth in the Community is expected to be no more than 2.25 per cent in the current year &mdash; well below the Community's capacity.  On present policies no increase is foreseen next year in this low rate of growth, which is markedly below the expected performance of the United States and Japan.  At the same time, the growth in world trade is expected to fall next year from 9 per cent in 1984 to 5 per cent and, most critically, unemployment in the Community, at 11 per cent this year, is expected to rise even further to 11.5 per cent next year &mdash; or 13 million people.  If growth in world trade were to fall below the expected figure the unemployment situation could be much worse.</P>
    <P>If we consider the Community's performance in a longer perspective there are two central and disturbing facts.</P>
    <P>First, the rate of potential growth shows no sign of recovering to the kind of level that is within the capacity of the Community and is needed to reverse the <Col N="1835" /> still surging tide of unemployment; and second, we have not been getting enough jobs even out of the inadequate growth we have had, as compared, say with the performance of the United States.</P>
    <P>We should now be able to do better because inflation is falling, the Community's external payments are expected to be in surplus &mdash; although slight &mdash; in 1985, profits have been improving, and investment has turned up.  In presenting this analysis of the situation to the Dublin Council I said that in facing these issues, we should have regard to the Commission's guidelines as set out in its Annual Economic Report &mdash; taking these guidelines as an overall package of proposals. Among the guidelines in the report that were referred to in the Commission's Communication to the Council were the placing of appropriate emphasis on the need, for example, to assure monetary policies that will steer clear of any acceleration in inflation; the need to remove obstacles to increasing the readiness to take on labour and the need to strengthen competitiveness.  But I pointed out that other guidelines in the report, omitted from this communication, should, in addition, be taken into account notably the general objectives of a progressive increase in the actual and potential growth rate, combined with low and declining inflation; the recommendation for a pause in the reduction of deficits, where these have been brought soundly under control, in order to reduce tax burdens; and the need to develop co-operative action with the United States and Japan to sustain an adequate overall growth in world trade in the period ahead when the United States contribution will be less.</P>
    <P>I also said that we welcomed the initatives which have been taken to develop the EMS and look forward to the completion of the work as quickly as possible. The development of the EMS is, of course, bound up closely with our ability to strengthen our economies and to promote increased convergence which is the aim of the policy guidelines in the Commission's Annual Report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> The Council's conclusions are in the documents, copies of which have been presented to this House.  I am very happy to report that our initiative on unemployment, which we have pursued consistently since assuming the EEC Presidency, is now at least producing some results, with the European Council's acceptance of the priority now to be given to unemployment and their acceptance of the balanced package of proposals contained in the Commission's report.  Moreover, the Council has agreed to the speedy implementation of these proposals.  In addition, Deputies will note the precise and positive nature of the conclusions arising from the discussion between Heads of State and Government which ask the appropriate Ministerial Councils of the Community &mdash; first to initiate a review of manpower policies to re-orient training towards sectors where labour will be needed, take steps to encourage job mobility and foster enterprise, especially amongst the young; second, to take steps to complete the internal market, including implementation of European standards.  As a comment, I should say that a great deal of work still remains to be done, now, more than a quarter of century after the Community was established, in order to complete this basic objective of the entire enterprise; third, to pursue and accelerate consideration of measures to achieve a greater role for the ECU and develop and strengthen the European monetary system; fourth, to implement without delay the firm political commitments agreed by the European Council at its meetings of Brussels and Fontainebleau in the field of transport policy.  If transport, like other elements of our productive infrastructure, is not efficient, the Community suffers from the consequent lack of competitiveness and its people suffer in higher unemployment and lower living standards; and fifth, to adopt further measures to strengthen the technological base of the Community and restore competitiveness.  To this end, the Council asked the Commission to submit an appropriate draft action programme for the next Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> The Council also asked that the Community and member states should take measures, including concertation of economic policies, designed to reduce the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions.</P>
    <P>There is also at my insistence a specific request to the ECO/FIN Council and the Commission to keep external developments under continuous review and to report back to the next meeting in March on what measures might be appropriate for the Community or may already have been initiated to assure the objective of a progressive increase in the actual and potential growth rate for the Community to the benefit of employment.</P>
    <P>The third major subject dealt with at the Dublin meeting was the appalling famine which is ravaging the people of so many countries in Africa, like Ethiopia and the Sahel countries.  These people are suffering the effects of an unprecedented drought and widespread malnutrition and famine.  At least two million tonnes of grain are required for these particular countries until next year's harvest, in order to meet the priority needs of the countries hardest hit.</P>
    <P>I took the initiative to put this item on the agenda with a view to getting a clear political commitment from the European Council on further contributions on a scale commensurate with the urgent needs of the situation.</P>
    <P>At the Council, I stressed the urgency of concerted international action to relieve the manifest disaster in these areas, and proposed to the Heads of State and Government a specific commitment: that the Community and its member states would provide between now and the next harvest 1.2 million tonnes of cereals &mdash; that is approximately 60 per cent of the estimated priority needs of these areas.  I also proposed that the Dublin Council should appeal to other donor countries to match this effort in order that the total need of the famine-stricken countries will be met, especially in the months immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that this Irish initiative was adopted by the European Council, <Col N="1838" /> which instructed the Commission, after consultation with the member states, to establish the amount of grain that will be provided by member states bilaterally and, following this, to make a proposal to the Council with respect to the additional Community effort needed to attain the figure of 1.2 million tonnes.  The European Council invited the Council of Ministers to take any necessary decisions on the basis of such a Commission proposal in order to secure the achievement of the 1.2 million total.  It also appealed to other donor countries to match this effort in such a way as to ensure that the total estimated need of 2 million tonnes by these states be met.  The Council also stressed the need for urgency to avoid the threatened shortfall in the months immediately ahead and emphasised the need to undertake urgent action to speed up and support the recovery and rehabilitation process in African countries.  This will involve active support by the Community for their efforts to achieve self-sufficiency and security in food and to implement long-term operations to combat drought and desertification.</P>
    <P>The political items we discussed were: the situation in the Middle East, East-West relations and Central America, and also the problem of terrorism and the abuse of diplomatic immunities.</P>
    <P>The importance which the Ten attach to the continuation of the dialogue, begun in Costa Rica last September, and in particular our firm view that a solution to the Central American crisis can be found only through peaceful means, is reflected in the conclusions of the European Council on the issue.</P>
    <P>The Middle East is an area in which the Ten have played an important role in recent years, and they remain convinced that a just, lasting and comprehensive peace can be secured only on the basis of a reconciliation of the rights of Israel and of the Palestinian people.  It is important not to exaggerate the scope for Ten activity at this stage but I think it is important that the Ten remain prepared to play an active role, should circumstances warrant. It was with this end in view that the European Council have restated publicly <Col N="1839" /> the Ten's position and their readiness to assist in the search for a solution.</P>
    <P>We reaffirmed the Ten's support for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon and the view that all foreign forces must be withdrawn from the country except those whose presence is requested by the Lebanese Government.  The concern of the European Council was expressed at the apparently intractable Iran-Iraq conflict and at the slaughter and destruction which this conflict has brought.</P>
    <P>East-West relations, while still troubled, have over the last six months shown clear signs of improvement.  The European Council expressed the Ten's intention to continue to encourage a constructive, comprehensive and realistic dialogue between East and West and an early return to stable and predictable relations between the two superpowers. Of key importance is the resumption of crucial arms control negotiations, and the urgent need for the opening of talks aimed at avoiding an arms race in space. The European Council, therefore, welcomed the recently announced US-Soviet agreement to enter into new negotiations on arms questions.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that at the negotiations in which the Ten themselves are taking part, the Stockholm Conference on Disarmament in Europe, there has been a recent important agreement on the problems of a working structure for the conference &mdash; problems which had reflected deep-seated differences between East and West.  We hope that this will permit negotiations there to get under way on concrete measures aimed at increasing confidence and security on our continent.  We underlined the continuing central role which the CSCE process, as set out in the Helsinki Final Act, plays in East-West relations.</P>
    <P>Our discussions also touched on the question of terrorism and the abuse of diplomatic immunities.  The Foreign Ministers, at their meeting on 11 September, approved a general approach by the Ten to this problem, central to which was the principle that no concessions under <Col N="1840" /> duress should be made to those who practise terrorism.  The European Council endorsed, at the level of Heads of State or Government, the approach already approved by the Foreign Ministers.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the meeting, convening separately as representatives of the Governments of the member states and, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the 1967 Treaty Establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission, we appointed, by common accord, the members of the new Commission which is to take office from 6 January 1985.  Those appointed are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Jacques Delors from France, President; Frans Andriessen from the Netherlands; Claude Cheysson from France; Henning Christopherson from Denmark; Willy de Clercq from Belgium; Lord Cockfield from the United Kingdom; Stanley Clinton Davis, also from that country; Nicolas Mosar from Luxembourg; Karl-Heinz Narjes from the Federal Republic of Germany; Lorenzo Natali from Italy; Alois Pfeiffer from the Federal Republic of Germany; Carlo Ripa di Meana from Italy; Peter Sutherland from Ireland; Grigoris Varfis from Greece.</P>
    <P>As President-in-Office of the European Council, I thanked President Thorn for his work and the work of his Commission during the past four years and wished him and the outgoing members well for the future.  Equally, I should like now to express the hope that the new Commission under the Presidency of M. Jacques Delors &mdash; whom I invited to attend the dinner for Heads of State and Government on Monday night &mdash; will find that their period in office is productive and will see decisive progress in widening and deepening European integration.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should record that on 3 December, during an interval in the proceedings, I had a meeting lasting approximately a quarter of an hour with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, on some of the matters arising in the Council and on Northern Ireland.  It is not the custom for either of the participants <Col N="1841" /> at these brief and informal meetings to indicate the content of the discussions. However, on this occasion, we were in agreement about reaffirming publicly our intention to proceed with the dialogue on the matters we discussed at Chequers, with a view to finding a political framework that would bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the nature of the Dublin Council, I feel that we achieved important progress in relation to negotiations for enlargement, the provision of aid to relieve famine in Africa until the next harvest, and a serious review of the social and economic situation and the unemployment problem, which had not been discussed at recent European Council meetings, as well as preparing the way for the discussion of the final report of the Dooge Committee.  The issues before us were numerous and difficult &mdash; obviously involving deep feelings in many countries.  However, apart from one or two passages, the general tone of the meeting was good and the meeting itself constructive &mdash; both in its substance and outcome.  The way is, I hope, gradually being cleared for progress towards the achievement of the ideals for which the Community was established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome the modest achievement of the European Council in resolving the wine issue which, however, is apparently subject to the Greek reservation.  We are also glad for the country's sake that this progress has done something to get back some credibility to what was becoming a very discredited Irish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusions issued after the summit do not contain any reference to enlargement, to wine or to fisheries. Indeed, in a formal sense there were no decisions on these matters.  Due to the Greek reservation &mdash; and latest press reports seem to indicate that the whole position in that regard is still very dubious &mdash; there is inevitably a question mark over whether the 1986 target date for accession by Spain and Portugal can still be achieved.  If, however, the measure of <Col N="1842" /> agreement reached in the Dublin European Council helps to facilitate the conslusion of the enlargement negotiations that is, of course, welcome.  At the same time there is no cause for any particular elation.  A European summit only happens in Dublin once every five years.  This meeting was almost wholly taken up with the problem of wine and the special difficulties of Greece, neither of which is of any particular interest to Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have every right to be disappointed that a Dublin European Summit did not focus its attention on the problems that are real and urgent and which arise from the critical and disastrous state of the Irish economy.  Wine lakes have very little meaning for the unemployed in Ballyfermot, nor could the Irish farmer find reassurance in all the carefully manicured reports put out by the unfailing, unflagging press relations Government machine.</P>
    <P>Nothing is simpler for us than to win easy laurels as good Europeans at our own expense.  I think now after 12 years of Community membership we should have been alert to the great opportunity the summit in Dublin could offer.  Clearly we were not.  Another summit has come and gone without any major improvement in our situation.</P>
    <P>Before the European Council meeting there were many opinions expressed that the wine problem could have been solved beforehand with a bit more care and attention.  <i>The Sunday Times</i>, for example, on 2 December stated that &ldquo;the Ten came within an ace of a solution&rdquo; ten days ago when the Italian Foreign Minister Andreotti made an offer that shifted the Italian position.  &ldquo;Barry&rdquo; the paper says &ldquo;failed to understand that he had a breakthrough&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The main focus of this Council should have been on the appalling level of unemployment in Ireland and throughout the Community.  In the European Parliament on 25 July 1984 the Taoiseach admitted that unemployment is the principal preoccupation of people in all the countries of the EC.</P>
    <P>He said: &ldquo;It is a truism, but one which <Col N="1843" /> to a remarkable degree our Governments have hitherto succeeded in ignoring that joint concerted action, taken together... could provide a stimulus for growth far greater than anything that is within the capacity of any single member state, even one of the larger member states, acting on its own.&rdquo;  I quote that with full approval.</P>
    <P>I have always advanced the case for concerted Community action.  I always pressed this case as Taoiseach at European summits.  It seems to me axiomatic that the Community, acting together with a combined policy and programme, could achieve a solution that would certainly escape their efforts as individual member states.  The peoples of Europe might reasonably have expected some urgent programme of action to be initiated by this summit, some emergency pooling of resources to defeat the major social evil confronting Europe today, but nothing of the kind emerged.</P>
    <P>Once again, unfortunately, it was the British Prime Minister, just as in the Brussels summit last March and the Chequers summit of two weeks ago, who brusquely rejected the Irish view.  Let me quote from Tuesday's London <i>Times:</i>&ldquo;She [the British Prime Minister] was unimpressed by an appeal from Dr. FitzGerald for a common reflation.  `National economies had to be put right nationally' she said: `and the Community could help by opening national borders, harmonising standards and integrating new technology.' &ldquo;It was a clear rejection of any Community approval to the massive problem of mass unemployment.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of unemployment, the Taoiseach and the European Council had in front of them copies of the Annual Economic Report and Review by the EEC Commission.  These documents deserved careful study.  The report suggests that &ldquo;priority be given to public expenditure programmes that contribute efficiently to restoring the productive potential of the economy&rdquo;.  This is exactly what we have been saying.  It points out that &ldquo;in the search for budgetary economies, cuts in public investment have in <Col N="1844" /> many countries been severely depressing the construction industry&rdquo;.  This is absolutely apropos in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government's industrial policy is also criticised in the document for excessive capital deepening at the expense of labour.  The EC Commission are not greatly impressed by the Government's progress towards balancing the current budget, and implicitly critical of the document <i>Building on Reality</i> and its assumptions.  They warn that &ldquo;developments in government consumption and other payments over the period may be less favourable than now anticipated.&rdquo; While the criticisms in the report are diplomatically worded, the clear message is that the Commission does not endorse the Irish Government's economic policy.</P>
    <P>This Irish Presidency has not, unfortunately, been a particularly good time for Irish interests in the Community.  Our position has been adversely affected in a number of ways.  There has been a second major capitulation this year to British and German pressure on the Common Agricultural Policy.  The first was the introduction of the superlevy whose effects have yet to be fully felt and understood. The second capitulation is now the agreement that agricultural spending will grow less fast than the growth in own resources.  This will have far-reaching and longterm damaging effects on our economy agreement and will permanently condemn Irish farmers to declining real incomes.  The Minister for Finance played a leading role in this, along with the British and German Ministers, at a meeting in Dromoland Castle in September. It is no excuse to say that British and German pressure was too great to resist.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has attempted to shift the blame for this situation on to Irish farmers in a scandalous speech recently. We in Fianna Fáil reject the criticism he levelled at farmers on that occasion.  It was intemperate, inaccurate and unfair. It is, of course, much easier to attack Irish farmers at home than to protect them in Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not have any documentation on the subject of fisheries but one must be very suspicious of the wall of silence that <Col N="1845" /> surrounds this issue.  It would appear from reports from the summit that the Community leaders agreed on a common position for the negotiations on enlagements in relation to fisheries to proceed somewhat along the following lines. There will be a &ldquo;ten&rdquo; -year &mdash; I put that in inverted commas &mdash; transition period after Spanish entry on 1 January 1986 during which Spanish trawlers will be obliged to observe the present arrangements, that is Spanish vessels would fish outside the Irish 50 miles box.  But, of course, as the Minister for Fisheries admitted in the Dáil on Tuesday the stance now adopted will very likely change through further negotiations.  It is obvious that this inadequate ten year transitional period is the Community's opening stance in the negotiations and will be most likely watered down with disastrous consequences for Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>The original demand for transition was 20 years.  This has now been reduced to 10 years and may end up in further talks being reduced to something totally useless. Spanish Government sources have already rejected even the ten-year transition period and are demanding a phased transitional period, an increased share of fish stocks and added access to the west of Ireland fisheries including rights inside the six to 12 mile zone.</P>
    <P>Spain has a fishing fleet larger than the rest of the Community put together and will obtain free access to Irish waters, subject in theory only to the Common Fisheries Policy and certain restrictions in coastal waters up to 12 miles offshore. I believe that it is necessary for someone to sound the alarm.  We are on the verge of having a major blow inflicted to our national position.  It is all too easy to settle for a transition period.  It puts off the evil day and those responsible are probably hoping not to be there to accept the blame when the day of reckoning comes.  Let it be fully understood throughout the Irish community that when that day comes a vast fleet of Spanish boats will have almost unlimited access to our fishing grounds.  It will come quickly and the effective policing of our <Col N="1846" /> waters under the Common Fisheries Policy will be virtually impossible.</P>
    <P>Still speaking of enlargement, we cannot ignore the Greek demand for a £3½ billion scheme of support for the Mediterranean as the price of Spanish and Portuguese entry.  While Greek claims may have been dismissed by various heads of Government, it is not clear how they intend to resolve this matter.  Did the Irish Government even consider some similar claim by us for greater regional aid in the context of enlargement.  Have we once again been cowed, subservient and afraid to seek what is fair and reasonable?  It always used to be the position of the Irish Government that we would not allow the less developed countries of the Community to become separated by a prosperity divide.  The Government should not accept the granting of any further one-sided Mediterranean proposals unless they are distributed equitably among all the least developed regions of the Community. The Irish Government must adopt a tough negotiation position on this point.  This is vital because it would be intolerable if our undue proportion of the permitted increase in own resources were to be pre-empted by the Mediterranean countries.</P>
    <P>Here let me ask the House for a moment to consider this whole question of the increase in own resources.  It is stipulated to be 1.4 per cent.  We are going to go through all the trauma of putting that proposal through the parliaments of the Ten &mdash; a major political undertaking.  Already it is becoming clear that 1.4 per cent is going to become very quickly inadequate.  It is certainly going to become inadequate very quickly after enlargement.  I am told that calculations indicate that already the existing Ten will be up to 1.2 per cent to meet their current obligations.  That apparently leaves 0.2 per cent of own resources to cope with all the new demands which enlargement will bring.  I seriously suggest that that whole situation should be reviewed and reconsidered and that the Community and the ten parliaments should not be put through this whole laborious process of <Col N="1847" /> increasing own resources to 1.4 per cent which it appears is going to be inadequate before it ever comes into operation.  That is something that this summit should have looked at and faced up to.</P>
    <P>Certainly, in so far as we are concerned, we have this vital interest in the agricultural funds, the Regional Fund and the Social Fund.  So far as we are concerned, this 1.4 per cent is already looming up as a very threatening limiting restriction on any advance in those areas. If some Governments are stipulating that Spanish and Portuguese admission is their price for an increase of own resources, then at least we should make sure that the increase in own resources is adequate to cope with what they are demanding as their price for such increase.</P>
    <P>I naturally welcome the decision of the Council in respect of aid to Ethiopia and other famine-struck countries.  I think we can all be proud of role Ireland has played in prodding the conscience of the Community on this point.  If we look back over the record of this House, the Fianna Fáil Party will be seen to have played their part in persuading the Government both to act nationally and to bring this matter forcibly to the attention of our partners.  There is no sense in which we can claim to live in a civilised world, when millions are permanently undernourished and hundreds of thousands starve and die of hunger.</P>
    <P>The European Council effectively deferred consideration of what is known as the Dooge or Spaak 11 interim report on the institutional future of Europe until the summit in Rome next June.  In view of the serious implications involved in this report, I want to suggest that, there must be a full debate here in this Dáil on this report prior to that meeting.</P>
    <P>We face a situation today where certain political forces in Europe, with the Taoiseach's Christian Democratic friends in the vanguard, are seeking to force the pace of European union, especially political union.  On the face of it, this is seeking to counteract the threatened loss of cohesion in the Community that will result <Col N="1848" /> from further enlargement from Ten to Twelve, a final attempt, as it were, before 1986 to push towards the goals of the founders of the Community.</P>
    <P>Ireland's principal reservation to date must be a scepticism as to how a political union can exist without a full economic union to underpin it.  There are plenty of examples around the world in the last 30 years which demonstrate that political unions between different sovereign states are of no significance without an economic basis.  Unfortunately, I detect no political will at present to increase the resources of the Community beyond the bare, minimum necessity reflecting &mdash; and I have to say again &mdash; the narrow, rigid British view that national economic problems must be solved nationally.  If that is to be the position I have doubts as to whether it is wise to embark on a process that will raise hopes in some quarters and fears in others, but which in my view is bound to end in collapse.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland have always been in favour of genuine economic and social integration.  When I say genuine, I mean a concept of integration that will involve a fair redistribution of resources throughout the Community whereby people in Ireland can aspire to similar living standards as enjoyed elsewhere in Europe. If on the other hand integration simply means a further concentration of economic activity in the centre of the Community stretching from south-east England through Northern France, Benelux and the Ruhr, while the periphery becomes steadily more impoverished, then that is not acceptable to us.  Unless the redistributive element, which if anything is being cut back at the present time, is to be greatly strengthened, then it may not be in keeping with the real spirit of the Community's political and economic decision-making centre.</P>
    <P>Community solidarity, in the economic and social sense, is fairly limited at the present time.  While I would not wish to deny the useful role that the Community plays in helping us to cope with youth <Col N="1849" /> unemployment, infrastructural development and, to some extent, farm income maintenance, there is no disguising the fact that in dealing with the full impact of the economic crisis at the present time we are largely on our own.</P>
    <P>The decision-making procedures of the Community are clearly cumbersome and frustrating.  But at the same time, if the tendency is going to be to ignore and ride roughshod over the interests of a small country such as ourselves, then the unanimity requirement on vitally important issues is an ultimate fall-back protection which we should not lightly abandon, however rarely we might in practice wish to avail of it.</P>
    <P>These essentially economic questions are vital and important to us and should not be obscured by the more emotive questions of defence and security, which, of course, inevitably capture public attention.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago, partly under the influence of Charles de Gaulle, there was a vision of a Community, separate both from the United States and from the Soviet Union, which would be a totally independent force and a force for good in the world.</P>
    <P>In reality the Community has developed in a very different way.  Progress towards economic and monetary union has faltered and come to a halt.  There is no real sense of social solidarity between the peoples of the different member states.  There has been an attempt to push political union out in front, not with the objective of an independent Europe at all but a Europe that would be defence oriented.  If Europe is not to be an independent entity in world affairs then we Irish would be better to retain our own independent voice as the most constructive contribution we can make to world peace and stability.  It is not enough to say that we would have reservations about the military aspects of European union.  I think we should argue positively in Community terms that the Community's strength and respect in the world derives to a considerable extent from the fact that it is not viewed as a military entity or bloc.  We must argue that there <Col N="1850" /> are other fora in which those European countries who wish to talk about defence can concert their positions.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge's reservations extend only, as far as one can see, to strictly military proposals.  But there is also the position in regard to the concept of a common foreign policy.  We fully support the principle of European political co-operation which, while it seeks maximum consensus and consultation, is not a legally binding process under any formal treaty.  We inevitably approach some world questions from a different point of view to most of our partners, for whom strategic considerations are often paramount.</P>
    <P>There will have to be a debate on the important choices we could be facing by the second half of 1985.  That debate will have to concentrate equally on both the economic aspects and the political aspects of the European union proposals.</P>
    <P>I now come to Anglo-Irish relations. The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister met for one-quarter of an hour, probably less.  We all know what that means.  It means they could not possibly have gone into any matter seriously or in depth.  It is pathetic, indeed insulting, to our intelligence to see the crude attempts being made to build this into something significant.  There is the specious claim that Anglo-Irish relations are back on the rails and that all is once more sweetness and light.  Let me give a quotation from the Minister for Justice, Deputy Michael Noonan, he of Béal na Bláth fame:</P>
    <P>I am also sustained by the progress which the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister recently made and which was reconfirmed yesterday, progress which I believe will be seen to be of far greater importance than the difficulties created by insensitive remarks by British leaders and foolish triumphalism of Unionist politicians.</P>
    <P>It is nothing short of fraud for the Taoiseach, his Ministers and his advisers to attempt to claim that Anglo-Irish relations are back on the rails and that all is once more sweetness and light.  Of course <Col N="1851" /> according to the Taoiseach and his Ministers, Deputies Barry and Noonan they never went off the rails anyway, there was just the unfortunate PR aspect of the Taoiseach being humiliated in public by the British Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>Nothing proves more convincingly the superficiality of this Government's policies that they so substitute the shadow for the substance.  All that was wrong with the abolition of food subsidies was the presentation.  All that was wrong with the Chequers summit was its unfortunate presentation afterwards.</P>
    <P>Let everyone be clear on the simple basic fact that the British Prime Minister retracted nothing yesterday.  Indeed, according to the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 5 December 1984, she said: &ldquo;I cannot say that I would have reacted any differently now&rdquo;.  If we were in any doubt about any possible softening of the British position, we have only to look at the British Secretary of State for the North's remarks to the Assembly the day before yesterday, when he made it clear that his policy was to pursue the 1982 internal initiative of his predecessor.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and Government Ministers in every statement they have made, both in the communiqué following the Chequers summit, and in defence of it at the press conference and subsequently, have subverted the whole ethos of the Forum report and the basic principle of that report that no solution can be found within a Northern Ireland context.</P>
    <P>The Forum report was about creating lasting peace and stability in a new Ireland. The present Anglo-Irish concentration is on how to present Northern Ireland to the world in a more palatable and acceptable light if that is possible. The SDLP, in their statement last weekend, have again spelt out clearly their rejection of any internal settlement.</P>
    <P>Their statement reaffirms the party's commitment to political means and to dialogue and states that the Forum report remains the basis of the SDLP's position. They call on the Irish Government and I quote: &ldquo;to reflect the depth of anger and <Col N="1852" /> concern created by the British Prime Minister&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There has been no evidence of any serious attempt by the Irish Government to convey any anger to anyone.  On the contrary every possible effort has been made to pretend that nothing has happened, that everything is as before, that unprecedented progress has been made.  It is a thoroughly dishonest exercise because exactly the opposite is the case.  In going for an internal settlement, in going for joint security which was not accepted by the Forum the Taoiseach and the Government are denying the Forum report.</P>
      <P>To underline the real nature of what has taken place, let me quote from the British <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of 3 December, 1984, a leader entitled &ldquo;Mrs. Thatcher's Other Island&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>Unionists must be ready to accept arrangements designed to guarantee the nationalist minority a proper place in any system of local government that may be set up.  In their moment of triumph, a generous gesture would not be out of place.</P>
      <P>That trenchant organ of British establishment opinion is in no doubt about the outcome of the summit.</P>

    <P>The Chequers summit communiqué requires that any political gesture <Col N="1853" /> towards Nationalists must first of all be acceptable to Unionists.</P>

      <P>I have a few more sentences and will leave you to the House then.  By accepting that and hailing it as progress the Taoiseach has deserted not just the Forum and its work but nationalist Ireland as well.  He has forfeited any authority to negotiate on their behalf. The 15 minute meeting in Dublin Castle has made not the slightest difference. British policy is unaltered and no amount of sycophantic journalism can disguise that depressing reality.</P>

      <P>Following our attacks on the Taoiseach after the Chequers debacle, when as a nation we were humiliated, it is only right that some congratulations should go to the Taoiseach on recovering some national honour at the Dublin summit.  I speak purely in terms of the organisational aspects and preparations which had been made beforehand and also in terms of the negotiations that resulted in some success on the main objective which was the enlargement of the Community Some progress was made.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Taoiseach did not give us much information about what took place at the summit but rather gave us a long list of items which were either mentioned or discussed.  We do not really know what was decided.  I am sure that if something positive had emerged from the discussion in the economic area or if there was some hope of jobs being created the Taoiseach would have mentioned that.  The only definite statistic given was that unemployment will increase in 1985 to over 13 million.  That does not indicate that there was any great success in the discussion on job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most glaring absence in the Taoiseach's speech was any reference to fishing. <Col N="1854" /> We know the negotiations are only now going ahead in this area.  I expected the Taoiseach to affirm the Government's determination to ensure that our fisheries would be protected and would not be endangered in the negotiations.  We have not got any such assurance from this speech this morning.  There was no reference to that aspect of vital concern not just to fishermen but to people on shore and throughout the country.  We need some indication in the coming months from the Government about the recognition of what is a complete change in the EC when it is enlarged and what effect it will have on Ireland.  Already the CAP's good days are over for our farmers.  The entry of Spain and Portugal will mean further competition and less will be available for the farmers, so radical changes must take place in our agriculture.  We have not heard anything over the past six or eight months from the Department of Agriculture or the Taoiseach to the effect that there is any change in our strategy. What is the Minister for Agriculture doing?  What advice is being given to farmers? What are ACOT doing?  Are they changing methods of production or crops or doing anything of that nature?  We have no indication that they are.  What is being done in the food processing area? Deputy Haughey in his trip to Libya succeeded in ending the restrictions on the export of live cattle, but will that do much for jobs?  It will not do anything great for the food processing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is meat as well it will do good for the jobs area because in the processing of meat jobs can be created but we do not hear anything from the Government of any change in policy to get out of dairy products and into other areas of production in agriculture, be it vegetables or whatever else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Spain and Portugal will be joining the <Col N="1855" /> EC in 1986, just over a year's time, and it is vital that we and the farmers and workers be told what the policy is for our agricultural industry, which is the main job creation area.  The entry of Spain and Portugal will have a drastic effect on the Regional and Social Funds when just in the past two or three years we have begun to make gains and get benefits from those funds.  In this area we will have job losses. I would like to hear from the Government what plans they have for 1986 and onwards when the amount we pay into the EC is rapidly closing on the amount we take out of it, and that will be even more rapidly when Spain and Portugal join.  It will have a radical and drastic effect on Ireland and the Irish economy. By all means we should open up the EC and welcome new members.  Nobody is arguing that there should be any restriction, but we would like to know how Ireland's interests are being protected in the negotiations, not just in the farming area but in the whole regional development area, unemployment and the Social Fund also.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Haughey speaking at length on the importance of the Dooge report.  There is a statement in the Taoiseach's speech that Professor Dooge has opposed one three-line section. One thing that upsets and annoys people is that in various EC documents Ireland is referred to as a non-member of NATO rather than a neutral country. This indicates the lack of positive approach by the Government in the EC. We do not get recognition for Ireland's positive role for world peace as a neutral country and we do not join with MEPs of the other countries of Europe in the campaign for a nuclear-free zone in Europe.  We do not seem to have any positive neutrality policy in Europe; therefore at present we are seen just as not members of NATO for internal reasons which are not of great importance to the other members of the EC. The Dooge report says that the whole question of political unity seems to be an attempt to militarise the EC under the <Col N="1856" /> guise of security co-operation and political union.  This would be highly dangerous for Ireland and for our neutrality. We would like to hear the Government emphasise our neutrality, as a policy, if they agree with our neutrality as a policy, and how we can be of assistance in Europe as a neutral nation in promoting peace and developing positive policies against nuclear war and nuclear weapons. Nothing has come out in the past number of years indicating that we are proud of our neutrality.  We seem to be ashamed of it and keeping it quiet and in the background.</P>
    <P>Finally, I congratulate the Taoiseach on the tremendous improvement in the amount of aid going to Ethiopia and other African countries suffering from drought and famine.  Everybody in Ireland is glad of this and we recognise that it was Ireland's Presidency that forced this through. I doubt if it would have happened with some other country having the Presidency of the EC or that it would have got the priority which the Irish Presidency gave to this issue at the summit meeting, and I think that is what led to the success. The Taoiseach should take on board the fact that what is happening in Africa proves the Lomé Convention a completely inadequate instrument for rectifying the imbalances in world trade and economic order which are making Europe richer at the expense of Asia and Africa. The EC will find a worthy place in the world only when it becomes an instrument for mutual co-operation instead of ruthless oppression.</P>

    <Title>Soviet Union Jewish Community: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann &mdash; recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Recalling the final act of the Helsinki conference on security and co-operation in which the participating States undertake to recognise and respect religious freedom and to deal in a positive and humanitarian way with applications to emigrate of persons who wish to reunite with members of their families and recalling that the concluding document of the Madrid meeting reaffirms and strengthens these undertakings.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Seriously disturbed by reports of continuing harassment, arrests and imprisonment of Soviet Jews and viewing with grave concern the drastic reduction in the numbers who have been allowed to leave the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Noting that the Jewish community in the Soviet Union is an oppressed cultural minority subject to severe and systematic discriminatory action by the authorities and considering their position to be a cause for international concern:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Calls on the Soviet Government to permit all Soviet Jews applying to leave the Soviet Union for reunification with their families to do so without impediment and to ensure that the presentation of such applications does not prejudice or modify the rights of the applicants or of members of their families in the areas of employment, housing, resident status, access to <Col N="1858" /> social, economic or educational benefits or any other rights.</P>
    <P>(2)  Calls on the Soviet Government to permit Soviet Jews full freedom to pursue Jewish religious and cultural activities.</P>
    <P>(3)  Calls for the release of those Soviet Jews who have been imprisoned or exiled because of their desire to leave the Soviet Union or to exercise their right to freedom of religion and cultural expression.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is only the second occasion since I became a Member of this House that there has been an all-party motion concerned with international affairs and human rights.  The first such motion was concerned with EI Salvador and I had the privilege of proposing it in this House in December 1981.  Now I have the privilege of proposing a motion which expresses this House's concern at the treatment of Soviet Jews and the failure of the Soviet Union to abide by and implement the human rights provisions contained in the final act of the Helsinki conference on security and co-operation and reiterated in the concluding document of the Madrid conference held in September 1983.</P>
    <P>It is particularly appropriate that a motion of this nature comes before the House today, the last day this House will be sitting prior to International Human Rights day on 10 December 1984, as the problems of Russian Jewry are concerned uniquely with human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Though the Soviet Government officially recognises Soviet jews as a nationality, it systematically denies them the cultural and religious rights guaranteed to all ethnic minorities, not only under international law and conventions to which the Soviet Union is a party, but also under the Soviet Union's own constitution and laws.</P>
    <P>In the religious sphere, Judaism is the only recognised religious denomination within the Soviet Union unable to maintain organised links with co-religionists outside the state.  There is no Jewish school in the Soviet Union.  Religious <Col N="1859" /> literature is practically non-existent and such literature brought into the Soviet Union by visiting foreign nationals is frequently confiscated.</P>
    <P>The Hebrew language is practically banned.  The authorities have forbidden it to be taught.  As a result, during the seventies an increasing number of Jews studied and taught Hebrew privately. Until the last two to three years the Soviet authorities were prepared to turn a blind eye to that but this has now changed.  In a number of cases teachers' homes have been raided.  Teaching materials and religious books have been confiscated and Hebrew teachers have been denounced in the Soviet press for anti-Soviet activities. The most disturbing part of this aspect of Soviet policy in the past 18 months is a virulent anti-semitic campaign in the Soviet press and other media and the arrest and detention of a number of Hebrew teachers.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are about three million Jews in the Soviet Union. In the USSR, being Jewish does not place one in the position simply of being a member of a religious minority.  One is regarded as possessing a distinct and identifiable separate nationality.  Conscious of this Jewish identity, many Soviet Jews applied during the late sixties and seventies to leave the Soviet Union so that they might rejoin members of their families in Israel and elsewhere. Initially the Soviet Government permitted only a small number to leave.  For example, in 1968, 229 were allowed emigrate. The numbers gradually increased and between 1970 and 1980 a total number of 245,000 Jews left the Soviet Union and rejoined family and relations outside.  In 1979 alone, 51,000, the largest number in any single year, were allowed to leave.  This emigration resulted not simply from Soviet goodwill but as a result of a number of factors including détente with the US and also, and principally, the unprecedented pressure of the social and political movements in the West generally, not only in the US but in <Col N="1860" /> Europe and elsewhere.  Those movements publicised regularly the plight in which Soviet Jews found themselves.</P>
    <P>However, in the past three years the position of Soviet Jews in this regard has tragically and drastically changed. Though it is estimated currently that there are in the region of 400,000 Jewish applicants for permission to leave the Soviet Union, few under present Soviet policy are allowed to leave.  The number permitted to leave in 1982 was 2,692.  In 1983 the figure reduced to 1,314 and I understand that up to the end of November this year only 750 approximately have been allowed to leave.  In other words, by the end of 1984 fewer than 1,000 Jews will have been allowed to leave the Soviet Union as against 400,000 applications and compared with the 51,000 who were allowed to leave in 1979.</P>
    <P>Many of those who have sought to leave have been subject to systematic state-sponsored and approved persecution. The mere expression of the desire to emigrate is regarded as an anti-Soviet activity or as defamatory of the Soviet state and can result in immediate expulsion from employment rendering those left unemployed liable to criminal prosecution as &ldquo;parasites&rdquo;.  Children of applicants are expelled from university and those Jews who manage to retain their employment following application to leave are subjected constantly to discrimination and humilation such as sharp reductions in salary and job status and professional isolation.  Even more disturbing is the fact that during the past two years 19 Jews active in seeking emigration and in Jewish cultural activities have been arrested, tried and sentenced to various periods of imprisonment and exile.  For example, Boris Kanyevsky was sentenced in Moscow in mid-January 1983 to five years' internal exile for, and I quote, &ldquo;slander of the Soviet state and social system&rdquo;.  He had merely compiled a report on alleged academic discrimination against Jews.  Yosif Begun, an unsuccessful applicant for permission to emigrate and a private teacher of Hebrew, was sentenced on October 15 last to seven years hard labour and five <Col N="1861" /> years internal exile for producing and distributing anti-Soviet literature.  He has been in prison for two years to date without having any access during that time to members of his family.</P>
    <P>Currently a large number of people are awaiting trial.  It would not be possible during this short debate to list all of them but they include Alexander Kholmiansky, whose sole crime was that he was a teacher of Hebrew and the Jewish religion and that he wished to leave the Soviet Union.  He is now in danger of facing a show trial within the Soviet state. In the same position also is Yuly Edelshtein who, it is rumoured, is to participate in some sort of show trial with Kholmiansky. The crimes of both these individuals was their wish to express their Jewish identity and to teach and practice the Jewish religion.  They had hoped to be allowed to leave the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>The plight of Jews in Soviet Russia today is a major human tragedy.  They find themselves tied to a country which despite its own constitutional guarantees will not allow free religious and cultural expression.  At the same time these Jews are being prevented from emigrating to countries that will afford them this opportunity. The plight of Soviet Jews is of deep concern not only to Jewish communities throughout the world but to a large number of other people.  In a domestic context, I am aware from the response I received to this motion that it is a matter of deep concern to all Members of this House.  It goes without saying that it is a matter of deep concern to all members of the small Jewish community in this country.</P>
    <P>No one is asking for special treatment for Soviet Jews.  We are merely asking that those rights which theoretically they are guaranteed be afforded to them and that those who wish to leave be permitted to do so in accordance with the international obligation of the Soviet Government as stated in the Helsinki Final Act and in the Madrid Concluding Document. That document is very explicit as to the Soviet Government's obligations in this area.  It states under the heading of &ldquo;Human Contacts&rdquo; on page 18 that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1862" /> The participating States will favourably deal with applications relating to contacts and regular meetings on the basis of family ties, reunification of families and marriage between citizens of different States and will decide upon them in the same spirit.</P>
    <P>Under the same heading, the document goes on to confirm that:</P>
    <P>...the presentation or renewal of applications in these cases will not modify the rights and obligations of the applicants or of members of their families concerning <i>inter alia</i> employment, housing, residence status, family support, access to social, economic or educational benefits, as well as any other rights and obligations flowing from the laws and regulations of the respective participating State.</P>
    <P>It is clear that despite being a signatory to the Helsinki Final Act and the Madrid Final Document, the Soviet Union is in flagrant breach of both those documents. It is the concern of this Dáil that the persecution and victimisation of Soviet Jews cease.  The next occasion on which the Helsinki Final Act will be reviewed on an international basis is at the meeting which is to take place in Ottawa in May or June, 1985.  There is a need for those representing Ireland at that meeting to emphasise that it is essential that all Governments who are parties to both of the documents concerned adhere to them and implement the human rights provisions contained in them.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that this motion is debated at this time, at a time when we are acting in the role of Presidency of the EC.  Our Foreign Minister in replying to this debate will do so not merely as our Foreign Minister but as President of the Council of Foreign Ministers and can reply to this motion knowing that similar motions have come before other parliaments in other western democracies and indeed that a similar motion, similarly phrased, received widespread support in the European Parliament in the spring of this year.  It is essential that in our dealings with the Soviet Union and at an <Col N="1863" /> EC level our Foreign Minister and the Foreign Ministers of the member states make representations regularly to the Government of the USSR to ensure that the fundamental rights of all Jews and other minorities in the USSR are fully respected.  We should regard ourselves as having an obligation to ensure that all appropriate action is taken not only as an individual state but in the EC context to ensure that the provisions of the Helsinki Agreement are properly implemented.  I hope that this debate, which has been on an all-party basis, will facilitate the Minister in the final weeks of the Irish Presidency of the EC to make clear not merely our views but the views of all member states of the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my gratitude to the Government for allowing time for this motion.  It is important that we as a small neutral country allow time for such a motion.  I also pay tribute to the Department of Foreign Affairs who under successive Ministers have taken a keen interest in this problem and in the work at the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation.  Those who have held that office have been praised by a number of European countries for their dedication and work towards the resolution of the problem and towards the achievement of the signing of the final declaration in Madrid last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there are other deprived minorities in the Soviet Union and I have been associated with many protests about the infringements of their rights.  I would be best remembered for my protest against the imprisonment and refusal to allow out of the country a Baptist Minister, Mr. Georgie Vins.  I was the first elected Member of this House ever to be refused a visa to visit the Soviet Union to present a petition.  I do not want it to go abroad that I am only concerned about my own co-religionists.  I am deeply concerned about them but also about other minorities.  There are tragic circumstances in many of these cases, some of which Deputy Shatter outlined, where husbands are not allowed to join wives <Col N="1864" /> and where people who have been lecturers in universities have been punished and are lucky to hold jobs as janitors simply because they have asked for an exit visa.</P>
    <P>When we discuss this topic it should not be confused with Middle East conflicts.  It is important to stress that it is apart from Middle East conflicts.  We are talking about basic human rights.  We are not attacking the Soviet Union; we are appealing to them to live up to a document which they signed.</P>
    <P>Last year I visited Madrid in the company of Mr. Peter Archer, a member of the Labour Party who is now their spokesman for Northern Ireland, and Mr. Ivan Laurence, a member of the Conservative Party, to visit the embassies to ask them to use their influence to get the Soviet Union to sign certain parts of the document which were being completed at that stage.  They were reluctant to sign parts dealing with human rights elements and the right of people to move. We visited the Austrian Ambassador, the British Ambassador, the Irish Ambassador and the Swedish and Norwegian Ambassadors.</P>
    <P>People cannot understand why the Soviet Union do not allow people to emigrate, but the Soviet Union consider it disloyal to the state and an insult if somebody wishes to emigrate.  The figures which were given show a sharp decline in the numbers who have been allowed to emigrate under the late chairman of the Soviet Union, Mr. Andropov. The former head of the KGB reduced the numbers allowed to leave to a few hundred and no progress was made under his leadership.  Tragically, no progress has been made under the present leadership of Chairman Chernenko.  If we who are Jews do not speak out for our co-religionists who will?  We know that grave injustices are being committed against them.  All we are asking is that this House, by supporting this motion, emphasises to the Soviet Union that they must allow people to live with basic human rights.  There is an old saying that he who saves the life of one person saves the world.  I read that in a book which I <Col N="1865" /> have just completed reading called <i>Shindlers Ark</i>.  It is very difficult to speak about this book without emotion.  In case people who are not co-religionists do not understand what we feel for our brethren in other parts of the world, I would just ask them to read this book and they will understand why we might appear to get somewhat overemotional.  We are not overemotional.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I have found myself asking myself &ldquo;If I protest too often, will I be regarded as a crank?&rdquo; I remember a friend, a very distinguished ambassador, said that when one is protesting against infringements of human rights one can never protest too many times.  The Russians are people who do not like protests being made but they figure that if one waits long enough they will go away, and very often they do.</P>
    <P>We, as a people who have endured much throughout the ages, know that we must continue to press for human rights in the Soviet Union, not just for Jews but for Baptists, Muslims, for all the other minorities, for the other Christian Churches in the Soviet Union.  I always feel, when I speak here on anything like this &mdash; and I have had occasion to do so before &mdash; that probably the Irish people, next to the Jewish people, know more about what it means to be discriminated against because of one's religion.  For 700 years this country withstood persecution, the people of this country were not allowed to practise their faith.  They had their hedge priests.  Whenever I address Jewish groups in America and talk about the similarities between the Jewish and Irish peoples, I stress these points: You cannot teach your children religion without it being an offence, without being locked up in prison, without having your religious institutions closed.</P>
    <P>I hope we shall continue to monitor these accords or agreements.  When Ireland signs its name to an accord, or a human rights document, it also carries the responsibility not alone to see that it lives up to those responsibilities but that the other signatories do also.  We must remember that we are a moral voice in <Col N="1866" /> the world, we do have a moral conscience, that we can shake the moral consciences of other countries.  The Super Powers do not have to listen to anyone but, as long as that little voice is heard crying out, saying a wrong is being committed, there will always be somebody to hear it.</P>
    <P>I should like to express to the Minister and the Government my gratitude for having been allowed to discuss this motion.  I should like to say to the Department of Foreign Affairs: thanks for the fine, great, humanitarian work they have done in this field.  I should like to say to them also: thanks for the fullest co-operation we have always received any time any of us have wanted to attend any conferences where ambassadors bade us welcome, when every facility was placed at our disposal, and for the genuine concern of officials working in that division of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I should like them to know it is appreciated and to place that on record.</P>
    <P>Finally I should say we will not give up and that this malpractice should not be allowed continue without our voices being raised every so often.  There are gross infringements of this Helsinki agreement going on.  I hope we will keep reminding the Russians that they are in breach of it and that any system that does not allow one's people to leave, and takes that as an insult to that system, has very much wrong with it.  We would ask them to have another look at themselves and their policies in refusing exit visas to those Jews who want to join their families, co-religionists in other parts of the world as well as in Israel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I must declare my interest by stating that I have the honour to be the vice-chairman of the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland, a body formed almost 100 years ago to represent the interests of the Jews of Ireland.  Our work on that council has presented few serious problems because of the excellent relations that have always existed between the Jews of Ireland and successive Irish Governments.  Over the years Irish Governments have bent over <Col N="1867" /> backwards to ensure that every possible need of our community, educational, social and religious, has been met, beyond the bounds of duty, having regard to the very small proportion of the population for which we account.</P>
      <P>There is one thing I want to make absolutely clear in the context of this motion, that is that I am not in any way anti-Soviet.  I do not believe that the Soviet Union is the worst country in the world.  I do not, as do some people, consider that nothing that the Soviet Union does can possibly be right in any circumstances.</P>
      <P>This motion is about human rights and there are two simple and very basic rights involved here.  The first is the natural right that every person should have to leave any country, including his own, and indeed to return to that country, if he so wishes.  The second is the right to practise one's own religion, to enjoy one's own culture and to use one's own language.</P>
      <P>The Soviet Union signed Article 12 (2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which declares that everyone has the right to leave any country including his own and to return to his country.  By refusing to honour that signed commitment, the Soviet Union shows contempt for international institutions.  It is not that the Soviets at no time ever allowed emigration. For example, in 1972, 31,000 Jews were permitted to emigrate and, in 1979, 51,000 was the figure.  However, by 1983, that figure was down to 1,300 and I believe that, for 1984, it will be considerably less than that.  The reason for these differentials is that the Soviet Union made this basic human right a bargaining point in discussions with the West to obtain favoured trading status for themselves.  In that process they have used their Jewish citizens as hostages. That is a role not new to the Jewish people and extends back over 1,000 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that the improvement or worsening of the position of Soviet Jews, from time to time, has been a barometer of relations between the Super Powers. During those years that the doors opened <Col N="1868" /> just a little, as they did, about 250,000 Jews in all were allowed to leave the Soviet Union over a period of between ten and 15 years.  However, they left behind in the Soviet Union some 500,000 relatives who wished to join them. Approximately 380,000 of those have made a formal request to join their relatives who are in Israel and in other countries. The remainder have not applied because, just to make the application, means the immediate loss of one's employment, the loss of one's standing in the community, the loss of places at schools for one's children and being prosecuted as a parasite for being out of work.</P>
    <P>The situation has been bad for the past year or so and continues to deteriorate. I would appeal to the Soviet rulers to lift the burden of this unjust policy so that families may be reunited.  Many of those who have applied have already been waiting for very many years.  During all of that time they have lived under tremendous psychological and economic pressure.</P>
    <P>In recent months there have been reports of ever-increasing reliance by the Soviet authorities on coercion, repression and intimidation which reflects a return, in certain respects, to the norms of the Stalin period.  The Head of the KGB has been given recently a newly enhanced status having been elevated to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union, a title once held by the notorious Beria, until his removal and execution in the aftermath of Stalin's death by the new leadership led by Krushchev.</P>
    <P>This policy of the Soviet Government is designed to discourage Jews from applying for exit visas and maintaining contact with their families, a policy that has been pursued ruthlessly.  One can only marvel at the reports of the fortitude of so many people who, despite all threats and harassment, insist on their rights. Such policies simply cannot be reconciled with the Soviet Union's obligations under the Helsinki Agreement.</P>
    <P>A typical example of this harassment is the case of Yosef Begun.  He is 51 years old and was 39 years old when, in April 1971, he first applied to emigrate to <Col N="1869" /> Israel.  He was then an acting senior lecturer in higher mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Agricultural Production.  He was immediately dismissed.  He was allowed to do only menial work and was usually dismissed whenever he was arrested which happened from time to time, because he was said to be truanting from work.</P>
    <P>Yosef Begun asked the authorities for permission to teach Hebrew and was refused permission to do so.  He gave Hebrew lessons without permission privately and taught Jewish culture.  To stop this the Soviet authorities arrested him, charged him with being a parasite, imprisoned him for three months and sentenced him to two years' exile in Siberia. When he was released he was refused permission to live in Moscow.  Ten weeks later he was re-arrested and sentenced to three years in exile for violating residence regulations.  He has been arrested, harassed by the KGB, has had his property stolen, has been vilified in public, and yet his courage has not been broken.</P>
    <P>He has continued to appeal, to protest, to issue statements for the cause of all persecuted Soviet Jews.  From November 1983 he was held incommunicado in Vladimir prison and then charged under the notorious article 70 of the Soviet criminal code, which accuses him of anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.  A penalty of 12 years in prison has recently been imposed on him.  In justice was done once more under the Soviet system.  He has been harassed and imprisoned on and off for the past 13 years and yet he is not granted his long awaited exit visa to join his family in Israel.</P>
    <P>This is all reminiscent of a different time and age.  Prisoners of conscience linger in Soviet prisons.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the problem of anti-semitism in the Soviet Union has become a real and terrifying prospect. Racist propaganda is circulated with printed material of a type reminiscent of the Third Reich in Germany.  I have seen specimens of some of this material which equates Zionism with Nazism and attacks <Col N="1870" /> people seeking exit visas to Israel as anti-Soviet subversives, conspirators and spies.</P>
    <P>Yet the Soviet constitution &mdash; apart from firm signed international commitments like the Helsinki final act &mdash; is supposed to uphold national minorities, and since the Jewish minority is a national minority it should be recognised as such. An article in <i>Pravda</i> on 22 February 1972 announcing the preparations by the Central Committee of the Communist Party for the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union stated:</P>
    <P>The USSR is the most viable and perfect form of organisation of a multinational state.  The closest unity, all round blossoming and steadfast rapprochement, of all nations and nationalities, are determined by the nature of our system, and are an objective law of the development of socialism.</P>
    <P>Tragically the facts at the present time indicate otherwise.  It is estimated that there are upwards of 2 million in the Soviet Union and that even if the gates were open wide the proportion that would want to leave would be about 20 or 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is a basic human right that those remaining should have the right to teach and learn their language, to enjoy their culture and practise their religion.  In fact virtually all Jewish institutional life has been stopped.  There are no Jewish schools, no Hebrew publications.  Jewish books and prayerbooks are not available.</P>
    <P>Other religious and ethnic minorities are also persecuted &mdash; notably the Pentecostalists and the Baptists.</P>
    <P>In the Soviet Union the Hebrew language has no official status and those who teach it are categorised as unemployed parasites and are sent to prison as such. Religious services are often prevented, even in private homes.  The Soviet Jews are the victims of the traditional religious and ethnic hatred, as well as Marxist antagonism to religion in every form. The enormous Soviet state machinery is involved in a cynical and continuous <Col N="1871" /> effort to harass the Jewish community, collectively and individually.</P>
    <P>Yet principle No. 7 of the Helsinki Final Act &mdash; signed by the Soviet Union states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In those states in which ethnic religious or linguistic minorities exist persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion or to use their own language.</P>
    <P>Article 18 states that each individual has the right:</P>
    <P>To adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others, and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the strengths of our democracy in Ireland is its commitment to the safeguarding of human rights and freedom of religion for all citizens, not only here in Ireland which it does, but espousing those same human rights wherever they are suppressed or endangered.  To champion those basic human rights or freedoms everywhere will encourage thousands of oppressed peoples in all parts of the world to keep the flame of hope burning, even in their darkest hours, and for this reason I welcome most warmly the decision to provide time here in Dáil Éireann to debate this motion.  Motions of similar intent have been adopted by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg and in many of the democratic parliaments throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the fact that this motion has been moved on an all-party basis and if the motion is adopted, as I believe it will be, I would ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to call in the Soviet Ambassador and to communicate to him the feelings of the House on this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity of supporting this motion.  I am pleased to participate because I wish to show my concern at the <Col N="1872" /> plight of the people in question and their difficulties.  To borrow a phrase used by my colleague, Deputy Briscoe, we should not allow these people to be a forgotten people.  We get used to so many problems that after a while we become insensitive to them.  That should not happen, particularly in this country, because in our own way we have so much in common with the people about whom we are concerned here.  For many centuries people here were penalised because they practised their religion.  They were denied human rights.  They were a forgotten people for about seven centuries.  They suffered to practise their religion and because they spoke their own language. Many of them left Ireland because they could not take the harassment they were being subject to.  However, there was one difference in that there was no embargo on their families if they wished to follow them and could afford the cost of the passage.</P>
      <P>Irish people should be giving a lead in this area because of our history.  Those who sponsored the motion before us &mdash; I am on the list &mdash; should do everything possible to ensure that these people are not forgotten.  At every opportunity in the past different Minister for Foreign Affairs have spoken out, as they should, about the fact that there are more than three million people, a figure equal to the entire population of Ireland, in the Soviet Union who would like to leave.  Many of them want to join their families in other countries.  We are all aware of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference.  All participating states undertook to recognise and respect religious freedom and deal in a positive and humanitarian way with applications to emigrate from persons who wished to reunite with members of their families.  If we are serious about putting our name to such acts then when the time is opportune we should allow those who apply to leave to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputies Shatter and Taylor for the figures they gave this morning because they help us to understand the problem.  It appears that up to 1970 just over 200 people were allowed out of the Soviet Union.  There was some <Col N="1873" /> degree of relaxation between 1970 and 1980 because during that time almost 250,000 people were allowed to emigrate. Undoubtedly, many of those allowed to emigrate during that period had to leave some of their family behind and they are anxious to emigrate and be reunited with their families.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that since early 1983 there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of people allowed to leave.  The figure for 1983 was less than half of that for 1982 and for the first nine months of 1984 it was half of the 1983 figure.  That is something we all deeply regret.  I learned from Deputy Taylor that there are now approximately 400,000 applicants waiting to take their place in the queue for permission to be reunited with their families. I understand from Deputy Briscoe that the figure would be a lot higher but for the treatment meted out to those who apply.  If such people are being harassed because they apply &mdash; it is accepted that they are &mdash; and have to suffer indignities, it is easy to understand why only 400,000 have applied to leave the country.</P>
    <P>I expect the Minister for Foreign Affairs will take encouragement from today's debate.  As President of the EC Foreign Ministers Council I know he will avail of the opportunity to express our concern about this matter.  I hope he will highlight the plight of the people in question at the UN when he gets an opportunity. I would welcome a debate on this topic in other European parliaments, similar to the debate which took place in the European Parliament.  If such debates take place the hand of the Foreign Ministers Council will be strengthened.</P>
    <P>In many parts of the world problems arise that we should not allow slip into the darkness or haze.  At every opportunity we should highlight these matters. One matter that always comes to mind is the invasion of Afghanistan.  That took place at a time when we were enjoying Christmas festivities.  That small nation was overrun but now we do not hear much about it.  That is a shame.  That matter can be raised again today in the debate on EC.  At every opportunity when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs <Col N="1874" />&mdash; the present Minister has also followed this line &mdash; I highlighted such incidents so that they would not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to sit back in regard to such matters, especially in Ireland because of our history and our affinity with those who practise the Jewish faith. I mean that sincerely.  We should understand their problems more than anybody else.  They have understood us and there have always been close ties between us. In a short time we will be playing host to the President of Israel.  He will be a welcome visitor to Ireland and I look forward to the occasion not just because he is President of Israel but because he is an Irishman, a Dubliner.  He lived here until he was 19 years of age and we are proud of that fact.</P>
    <P>I was glad to have had an opportunity to participate in this debate and I hope it will awaken a greater interest in the plight of the many people who do not want anything other than to live a normal life with their families.  The debate should encourage the Soviet Union to relax in their policy towards such people and be more lenient to those who want to join their families.  Those people do not wish to change the system in the Soviet Union. They would not be able if they did and would be foolish to try.  They want to live a normal life like ordinary human beings and no more.  Anything we can do to enlighten the Soviet Government would be welcomed by those people.  We should play our small part in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to put my name to the motion which is an all-party motion.  Most of the 400,000 Jewish people anxious to leave the Soviet Union to rejoin their family but prevented from doing so are relatives of the 260,000 who have already left that country.  The plea by those people is very heart-rending. We are talking about people who are separated from their loved ones, people who put the family and the love of children at the highest level.  As a former emigrant I can say that had I been refused permission to leave Canada and return to Ireland I would have been very unhappy and my family would have been.  Jews in <Col N="1875" /> the Soviet Union should be accorded total freedom, but from my reading of the matter that does not obtain.  They do not have freedom to practise their culture or religion, to participate in the arts, education or benefit economically.  They are not permitted to play their full part in the life of the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a law-abiding supportive humane people who contributed a great deal to the history of the world and to the advance of civilisation, a people who suffered so much and were victimised so often and so wrongly, culminating in the holocaust, a sacred word not to be written about or discussed but always to be meditated upon and never to be forgotten.  We are talking about a people who value life, live it to the full and derive the maximum from opportunities offered.  It must be to the advantage of the nation in which they reside that they contribute to the full.  The contribution of our small Jewish congregation to the life of this nation is out of proportion to their size.</P>
      <P>In the Soviet Union families have been broken up and forced to live in different countries because of this unfair system. This has caused grief to families who wish to stay together.  It is destructive of the happiness of life and at times it is almost too much to bear.  But in my view it is a bigger sin when people are prevented from exercising their freedom of choice, freedom of career, freedom to choose where to live and when they are refused access to the social, economic and educational benefits of a country. Life outside work is vital to any religious people.  To prevent people using their abilities to the full by restricting their educational opportunities is a form of imprisonment.  A man should be allowed to find his own level of achievement and every man should have the same opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I find very worrying is the story behind the statistics published in the bulletins from the Soviet Union.  These people have no freedom to choose, they are not allowed to accept invitations to emigrate and, on top of that, they suffer <Col N="1876" /> harassment and, lately, arrests.  This is a change in the method of persecution of Jews who wish to leave the Soviet Union. I am tempted to remind Members who showed sympathy with and solidarity for our fellow men in the Soviet Union of the attitude they adopted here last night when we were discussing the supergrass system, recently in the Criminal Justice Bill, and now in the criminal code of the Soviet Union.  Nobody is attacking the Soviet Union but in my view they need not fear that very large numbers will leave their country.  As we experienced in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, enough people will stay because they love their country.</P>
    <P>We have read of drugs and firearms being planted in the homes of Soviet Jews.  This is seriously affecting the liberty of these people.  I am not sure if Irish hypocrisy will help the Soviet Jews, the Northern Nationalists or Loyalists, or whether our double standards will encourage the Soviets to relent in this instance but I hope the extensive lists of cases involving Soviet Jews which I have been reading in our magazines and newspapers in the last few months is not an indication that the situation is worsening for these people.</P>
    <P>We should voice our protests through the Minister on the veiled attack on the purity of the Jewish religion by the suggestion that drugs are an inherent part of the Jewish culture.  This has been suggested at some of the cases tried recently in the Soviet Union.  This is an alarming trend when one remembers how these people were persecuted in the past.  These people show great courage by going on hunger strike in such an atmosphere knowing that such a move will not gain the sympathy of the authorities and as there are such a small number of people involved, the impact of their protests will be very small indeed.</P>
    <P>People outside the Soviet Union who live in comparative freedom should protest and make their views known in the strongest possible way to help the minorities in that state.  These people are discriminated against when they are looking for jobs.  They are downgraded all the <Col N="1877" /> time and the majority of them are unemployed. This is cruel, it is a form of imprisonment because even in Ireland, where people find it very difficult to get jobs, one has the choice of looking for work, and has a 50-50 chance of being successful.  It is easy to see how one could feel despair if one's job is taken away and one is accused of being a parasite and living off the state.  If one adds to this trumped up charges, it is easy to see that it could become impossible to live in peace in such an atmosphere.</P>
    <P>I support this motion and the unselfish plea made by Deputy Shatter.  He did not ask for special status for the Jewish population in the Soviet Union.  He was merely looking for the entitlements and the rights of Soviet Jewry.  The USSR Government would be admired if they made a decision to grant permission for Soviet Jewry to leave the country if they decided to do so even though it is regarded as an insult to leave.  I suspect, however, that the Soviet Jewry are being used as a pawn in a game between East and West and that is probably why pressure is put on them.  They are the scapegoats in this unhappy story.</P>
    <P>When permission is refused and compounded by a further refusal of freedom to advance in education, economic or social status, employment and housing, that amounts to a form of persecution, and that is why I believe that Soviet Jewry are being used as a pawn in the game between East and West.  I plead with the Soviet Union not to use a small number of people who are disadvantaged by the fact that so many of them have been allowed out while the rest are left behind. Those who were left behind must have hoped that they would be united in a place of their choice, and it was particularly cruel that the barriers were pulled down after some of them had left.  I ask the Minister to make representations to have the situation eased.</P>

      <P>I admit that I entered this debate with some trepidation in view of the virtual agreement that exists among the Members who have already spoken.  Before dealing with the <Col N="1878" /> motion, however, I should like to make a few preliminary points regarding the Helsinki Final Act.  During the week I attempted to get copies of this agreement but the Government have not published copies despite the fact that the agreement specifically urges parties to the agreement to promote the Helsinki Final Act among their own people.  That is a dereliction of duty on the part of the Government who are a signatory to the Helsinki Final Act.</P>
      <P>The initiation of this debate is a breakthrough in regard to the terms in which business in the Dáil is dealt with. Motions of this nature should be discussed in the House and foreign affairs should be debated much more often.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla and I have a motion on the Order Paper for some weeks concerning the situation in South Africa and the protests being pursued in Dunnes Stores, Dublin.  I would welcome the support of any Deputies who would care to pen their names to that motion and perhaps there would then be some hope of debating it.  In South Africa 21 million black people are discriminated against by law by a minority of whites who run the country.  That also deserves our attention and I hope it will soon reach the floor of this House for debate.  I welcome the initiative taken in having this motion put down and debated here today because it is a breakthrough and I hope it will be the first of many debates in the area of foreign affairs.</P>

      <P>It was mentioned that this was an all-party motion.  I was listening to the contributions on the monitor. Unfortunately, the proposers of the motion did not approach Deputy Mac Giolla or myself to see if we would be prepared to support this motion.  We <Col N="1879" /> would have welcomed discussions on the form which this motion would take because we recognise that there is a problem of alienation of Jews in the Soviet Union.  However, we do not go along with the terms of the motion as put forward because it is an over-statement and the case made to support it has not been proved.  There are obviously two sides to every story and no case has been made for the defence.  For that reason the motion is clearly not an all-party motion and we were not invited to participate in its formulation.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the history and tragedy of the Jewish people throughout the world.  They have been victims of pogrom and oppression on the basis of their religious faith for as long as their faith has been in existence.  I am also very conscious of the fact that they have been the victims of genocide and that six million Jews were slaughtered during World War II by Fascist regimes.  It is, therefore, bewildering to see the Jewish state of Israel involved in the oppression of minorities, the Israeli Arabs and the Palestinians.  The Jewish people suffered so much oppression that it is puzzling that they should now be involved &mdash; not all of them &mdash; in a policy of discrimination against minorities in Israel.  That is unacceptable, and on a number of occasions in this House I have spoken about my concern in that regard.  Unfortunately because of remarks that were made in this House on a previous occasion I have to make a distinction between my concern about the policy of the Israeli Government, my opposition to that policy and my detestation of anti-Semitism and of any form of discrimination on the basis of a person's race or religion.  It goes against everything I believe in, and I wish to make that clear here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe and accept that there is a problem of alienation.  That word is in common use in our own society and culture these days in relation to people in Northern Ireland and also in the South who find themselves at odds with the Government of their state.  However, I think that the case that has been made <Col N="1880" /> here this morning and the case that is made concerning the USSR is in many instances tinged with a high level of anti-Sovietism. I heard Deputy Taylor deny that he is in any way anti-Soviet, and I accept and welcome that.</P>
    <P>The case has been made that Jews in the Soviet Union are completely oppressed, are denied any rights and denied the facilities to practise their religion or to learn the Hebrew language.  I have here some figures from an official Soviet source which to some extent at least refutes the assertion that all Jews in the Soviet Union are oppressed.  I will go through those figures very quickly.</P>
    <P>Out of a population of more than 270 million people in the Soviet Union there are, I understand, 1.8 million people who have declared themselves Jews, that is, approximately 0.7 per cent of the population. I understand that 5.2 per cent are engaged in cultural activities, 6.5 per cent in literature and the press, 3.4 per cent in medicine and 6.7 per cent in the legal profession.  Clearly that is a representation way above the size of the population of Jews in the Soviet Union when compared to the population as a whole.  That would not indicate to me there is deliberate or complete oppression of Jews in the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>There is a further figure of 300 Jewish students in higher education for every 10,000 Jews in the Soviet Union while the corresponding figure in respect of students of all nationalities in higher education is 187.  That shows that there is almost double the number of Jews in higher education than the ordinary population as a whole.  Again, that disabuses the claim that there is total and outright discrimination against Jews.</P>
    <P>Religion in the Soviet Union is a private matter, and the State has no involvement in it, as I understand their Constitution.  At the same time, there are 200 synagogues in the Soviet Union as well as many prayer houses.  These statistics undermine to my mind at least the claim that there is total opposition to and oppression of Jews in the Soviet Union.</P>

      <P>Of course I do. However, we have to accept there are two sides to every story.  I am simply putting forward my views on this matter and I am indicating that I do not believe there is total oppression of Jews in the Soviet Union.  I should like to quote a letter which appeared in the English language <i>Soviet Weekly</i> on 12 May 1984. It was written by a person named Abe Wolffe from Birmingham.  He was reporting on a visit he made to the Soviet Union.  He said he was a Jew and he was interested in the way Jews were being treated in that country.  I will not read the whole letter but it is available if anyone wishes to look at it.  Some of his comments were as follows:</P>
      <P>I visited the Moscow Synagogue on the Saturday prior to the Festival of Passover.  At the service there, I found some 200-250 men and women worshippers.</P>
      <P>I had a few words with the Rabbi who invited me to meet him next day, Sunday.</P>
      <P>He knew all about the charges made against the Soviet Government and was very angry, at what, he said were false accusations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are treated as equals in every respect, no more and no less, and we do not expect any other treatment.  No obstacles are placed in our way as far as carrying out our religious observations. We print our Prayer Book, calendars and our publications in Yiddish and Hebrew.  We have our own abattoir for the ritual killing of poultry etc. which is done twice weekly.  We baked and sold 130 tons of Matzos for Passover. Please, tell your friends we are no way in need of their sympathy.  We have the maximum assistance from the City Council, for example, during the High Holidays, when several thousand Jews wish to participate in the Service and we have some 1,100 seating in the Synagogue, and to help us the street in front of the Synagogue is closed to all traffic and the service is broadcast by <Col N="1882" /> loudspeakers, only pedestrians can enter.  If this is discrimination then I'm all for it.</P>
    <P>I simply offer that quotation from a letter from a person who visited the Soviet Union, who himself is a Jew and who went to the trouble of looking into the way Jews are treated in the Soviet Union.</P>

It always amazes me that all these people are very well educated.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be here to support his motion this morning.  Like the other Deputies, I welcome the fact that time has been given in this House to a debate on foreign affairs and on the part that we should be playing in world politics.  I have spoken out strongly against the policies of the United States when I felt that it was appropriate to do so.  I shall certainly also speak out volubly against the policies of the Soviet Union when I feel that it is right and appropriate to do so.  That is why I welcome this opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The denial of civil rights by any power to any group of people must be condemned totally.  We must have eternal vigilance with regard to attempts to remove the right of movement, of speech, of practising one's religion as a policy of any government.  It is a particularly emotional experience to speak regarding the history of the Jewish people who suffered centuries of oppression and denial of their rights and not only that but genocide practised against them, not <Col N="1884" /> just in recent years but going back over the centuries.  It leads one to wonder sometimes what this human race is all about, that there are structured, in-built, totally single-minded attacks on these people's living conditions and even on their lives by so many groups in so many parts of this world.  That is why it is important to speak out on behalf of Soviet Jewry today.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that there are denials of rights to the Jewish people in the Soviet Union.  Very openly and visibly there is a denial of access to emigration, of permission to leave the Soviet Union to join their families.  As Deputy Skelly has said, it is particularly cruel that when it was politically advantageous or was Government policy, in certain cases the Jewish people were allowed to emigrate and then, when it suited the political game not to do so, the barricades came down again. There was cruelty, particularly in the Jewish tradition where family is fundamental and total in the religious and cultural sense and, indeed, as a means of arming themselves against the vicissitudes of fortune which have visited them down through the years, in not allowing members of the family to leave to join the other members.  Their expectations may have been raised over the years and they could have been used as chess pieces to be given promises, punished or imprisoned, according to the thinking or the policies of the time.  We are talking about human beings and particularly about human rights.  It is good that we talk about the denial of human rights regardless of the ideologies of the groups attempting to deny them.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy De Rossa's point that in a debate there should be balance and both sides should be shown.  However, there are some points I would make before going on to a general discussion of the motion.  I would agree with Deputy De Rossa that we should all have a copy of the Helsinki Agreement and use it as part and parcel of our debates here on foreign affairs.  That agreement defined the right to emigrate for family re-unification. The Soviet Union at the moment are denying that right and contravening <Col N="1885" /> the Helsinki Agreement.  In this motion we should ask that that agreement be recognised and implemented.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa said that there is not an overall repression of Jews in the Soviet Union or an outright discrimination against them.  There are subtleties here. We have not the same freedom of communication with the Soviet Union as we have, for instance, with the United States, warts and all, which is something I particularly approve of with regard to the United States.  There is a freedom of access which allows one to freely criticise them and I welcome that.  Any government which denies that right are cutting off so much of the development of their people and of world opinion.  It also shows an insecurity and feeling of inferiority which is very worrying.  We do not have the same access to information or freedom of communication regarding the Soviet Union, and that is something we all accept.  But we would wish otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that, of course, one can quote statistics and there are successful Jews carrying on professions at a high level in the Soviet Union.  The problem starts when they wish to practise openly, to organise their religion within the Soviet Union, or to emigrate.  That is where the denial of rights may be found. If one stays within the system and does not wish in any way to depart from it, evidently one is accepted.  What civil rights are all about is the right to dissent, or to practise one's religion and the right to leave a country, particularly to join one's family.  They are two very basic rights and nobody in the civil liberties context could deny that.</P>
    <P>Imperfect as the democratic system is, democratic countries want that system. In the same way I would grant the right to Communist states to run their affairs as they want to do, as they see fit.  For human beings to survive, develop and have freedom, they must be allowed their civil rights.  Many &ldquo;isms&rdquo; which have been created in the name of freedom, to the detriment, death and devastation of people, are still lauded.  However, the only freedom we should be discussing is <Col N="1886" /> the freedom of the individual in a nonviolent and developed way to be allowed to exercise his or her choice.  If we are striving for world freedom, regardless of ideology, that must be a fundamental part of it and that is really what we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>We are not quoting political platitudes on political platforms.  We are asking that the individual be allowed to exercise his or her choice and to maintain his or her own culture.  Ireland should know all about that.  We must remember the huge psychological problems, apart from the practical ones, that our race suffered when we were denied our civil rights.  As a woman particularly &mdash; another section discriminated against &mdash; I can appreciate the feelings of total alienation and isolation when discrimination and segregation, are practised and particularly when freedom of choice is denied.  It is important that we should discuss this motion this morning and ask our Minister to use all his influence while we still have the Presidency of the EC in the European forum.</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach referred to progress hopefully being made with regard to East-West relations.  My first thought was about arms because that is what can wipe us all out.  Listening to the debate now I thought what we should be striving for as well, apart from arms reduction, is dialogue and agreement on a level of civilised behaviour and freedom for people regardless of where or under what political regime they live.  To ask for less means we are not taking responsibility for what we cherish.  We know what a denial of freedom did to the nation.  No one denies that there are large numbers of Jewish people in the Soviet Union who believe they do not have freedom of choice and are discriminated against. They ask for the basic right to leave the country and join their families who have already left.</P>
    <P>Without getting involved in ideological struggles, what we are asking for is on the most human, responsible and political of levels.  Deputy Collins suggested that we should take this to other Governments in Europe.  Deputy De Rossa mentioned <Col N="1887" /> the Council of Europe.  I am aware that quite recently the Council of Europe had a motion before them much along the lines of the motion being debated here. They deplored what was happening to the Jewish people in the Soviet Union. There is a big effort being made with regard to détente and East-West relations. Without wishing to exacerbate any feelings of division &mdash; we are one world and one Europe &mdash; I hope Europe will continue to express its grave concern, first of all on a human level at what is happening to the Jewish people in the Soviet Union and, secondly, on a political level.  Hopefully we will be able to move forward and use our collective influence to ensure that the Jewish people in the Soviet Union have what we consider is the right of everyone: freedom of choice, movement, expression and culture.  No more, no less and, my God, they deserve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birminghan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene to say that I found the contribution made by Deputy De Rossa quite extraordinary. It is peculiar that in a debate which was supposed to centre on the plight of the minority in the Soviet Union, a contribution requires a Deputy to express his opinion on the policies pursued by the Israeli Government and State.  I find that peculiar and in some sense unhealthy. Deputy De Rossa expressed the hope that there would be other opportunities in this House to debate other matters of foreign policy.  That is a good idea.  He said he hoped there would be a debate in the future in which members would be given an opportunity to express their views on apartheid.  That is also a good idea.  He said he thought his contribution was important to present a balance and that there were two sides to everything. I do not accept that.  I hope that if an opportunity is given to the House to express its views on apartheid Members will be united in their opposition to it and will accept that there are not two sides to it.  The interests of a balanced debate do not require any Member to come into the <Col N="1888" /> House and justify the way in which the South African Government treat their black citizens.</P>
      <P>This debate is not enhanced by an attempt to justify the way in which the Soviet Union treats its minorities.  I do not believe such a pretence does any credit to the party of which the Deputy is a member.  It is in stark contrast with the claim made by that party that they are concerned with issues of humanitarianism and oppression in other parts of the world.  It is strange that there are people in this country who believe justice and injustice are divisible, that one can turn a blind eye to injustice in certain parts of the world and that somehow oppression where it takes place under a regime of a particular ideological hue can be ignored and that all our concerns can be centred on other regimes which are acceptable targets because we do not like their ideology.</P>
      <P>If our concern for humanitarianism means anything, we speak out clearly and unequivocally wherever we see injustice, without pretence and sham.  We speak out against the regime in South Africa and speak out, with equal clarity, against what is happening in the Soviet Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  This motion before the Dáil appropriately takes as its reference points the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Helsinki Final Act.  The Declaration, which is a United Nations instrument, is a very comprehensive statement of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  It is important to remember, in the context of the debate, that the 35 States participating in the CSCE process &mdash; all the states of Europe, except Albania, together with the United States and Canada &mdash; have signed the Helsinki Final Act.  They are not only committed to implementing the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and the Madrid Concluding Document but they are also committed to acting in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> The Helsinki Final Act and the Concluding Document of the Madrid Review meeting of the CSCE are not treaties. They are not legally binding.  Nonetheless, they represent a political commitment by the participating States to give effect to their provisions and the political credibility of the participating states is measured by the extent to which they implement these provisions.  There are no arrangements to enforce CSCE provisions.  The CSCE process relies instead on a review of implementation to which every participating State has the right to contribute.</P>
    <P>In the area of human rights, the Final Act provides that the participating states will respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.  It also explicitly mentions freedom of religion, the rights of national minorities and the right of the individual to know and act upon his rights and duties in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, very important words.</P>
    <P>The Final Act also devotes a great deal of attention to the question of human contacts, particularly the reunification of families and marriages between citizens of different states.  The participating states have committed themselves to dealing in a positive and humanitarian spirit with applications from people who wish to be reunited with members of their family.  At Madrid it was agreed, specifically, to decide on such applications &ldquo;in normal practice, within six months&rdquo;. That is very important in the context of the debate we are having here today.</P>
    <P>The deterioration in the Soviet Union's record in the area of human contacts would appear to have coincided with the general downturn in East-West relations in recent years.  It may be the case, although this is necessarily speculative, that changes for the better are more likely to come about when East-West relations, and in particular US-Soviet relations, are functioning well and are characterised by an absence of confrontation.  This consideration cannot, however, excuse the Soviet record of recent years.  Between 1976 and 1980 thousands of Soviet Jews <Col N="1890" /> obtained emigration visas each month. According to the information available to me, not more than 60 to 100 authorisations per month have been granted since 1980.  The information available suggests that large numbers of applications for emigation to join family members abroad have been refused, and that a great many more are awaiting consideration.  The restrictive attitude of the Soviet authorities has also borne heavily on other minority groups.  For example, there has been a marked decline in recent years in the number of authorisations to leave the Soviet Union granted to ethnic Germans. It is quite clear that the attitude of the Soviet authorities is not compatible with the politically binding commitments which the Soviet Union entered into at Helsinki in 1975 and Madrid in 1983.</P>
    <P>There has been no recent improvement in the Soviet Union's regrettable performance in the area of human rights in general.  Repression of religious believers continues to be a feature of the Soviet system, and repression of Catholic clergy in Lithuania has been stepped up since the beginning of 1983.  The Soviet authorities have systematically suppressed groups set up to monitor the implementation of the Helsinki and Madrid provisions. The text of the Helsinki Final Act is reported to have become almost unobtainable in the Soviet Union.  In that regard I understand that Deputy De Rossa said that it was not available here. Admittedly some years ago 5,000 copies of it were printed and if any Deputy in the House has problems in getting a copy, let him contact my Department and I will be happy to see that he gets it.  In the meantime I will investigate the possibility of having more of them printed.</P>
    <P>While Jewish citizens of the Soviet Union are circumscribed in their efforts to emigrate, they are offered no improvement in their possibilities of giving expression to their particular culture.  The campaign against the study of Hebrew seems to be continuing.  Freedom of expression is as limited as before.  The conclusion one is forced to draw is that the situation of Dr. Andrei Sakharov and his wife Yelena Bonner is only the most <Col N="1891" /> visible part of an overall picture characterised by systematic denial of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The case of the Sakharovs is one which symbolises the repression of many others, whose names may never be known to us, who may be Jewish or Christian, who may come from Latvia, from the Ukraine or from Russia.  Recent deaths of imprisoned dissidents due, apparenlty, to inadequate health care, underscore the continuing deterioration in Soviet performance in the area of human rights in general.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already, the fact that the Soviet Union in signing the Helsinki Final Act has committed itself to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and that Ireland is also a signatory of the Final Act, gives us, like other CSCE participating states, a legitimate interest in the Soviet record in this matter.  This country has availed of the opportunities offered by CSCE meetings, where implementation of the Final Act comes under review, to express concern at the shortcomings which are apparent in that record.  The Irish delegation did this on several occasions, for example, in the course of the CSCE Madrid Meeting which met from 1980 to 1983.  Any Irish contributors to that drew attention to these facts, as I did when I addressed the final meeting in September of last year, and in my statement there I referred to the treatment suffered by members of the Jewish community and other religious minorities in the Soviet Union in recent years.  That meeting had, of course, other purposes than a simple review of implementation. It also offered the opportunity to build usefully on certain provisions of the Final Act.  Ireland, with the other member states of the European Community, worked actively for the adoption of more specific provisions on human rights.  The provision in the Concluding Document of the Madrid meeting that participating states will &ldquo;take the action necessary&rdquo; to ensure religious freedom can be considered a useful advance, in so far as it extends the area of international consensus on this subject and provides a <Col N="1892" /> yardstick by which the practice of participating states in this area can be judged. In the same way, the provision for the consideration of applications for family reunification &ldquo;in normal practice, within six months&rdquo; must be seen as a step forward.</P>
    <P>The areas of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and human contacts, are ones where concerted action by the ten member states of the European Community, through the process of European political co-operation, is of considerable importance.  Through concerted action by the Ten the views of individual states are amplified and given greater weight.</P>
    <P>The Ten, including Ireland, will continue, as necessary, to draw attention to failure by CSCE participating states to implement commitments entered into at Helsinki and Madrid.  For example, a CSCE meeting of experts will take place in Ottawa next May, on the specific question of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in all their aspects, as embodied in the Final Act.  A further meeting of experts will be held in Berne in 1986, this time to discuss &ldquo;the development of contacts among persons, institutions and organisations&rdquo; which will, of course, include family reunification.  The Ottawa meeting offers the opportunity to highlight the importance the Ten attach to the question of human rights within the CSCE framework.  At that meeting the Ten will seek a meaningful dialogue with all participating states with a view to arriving, if possible, at elements of understanding which could help to advance the cause of human rights.  They will also contribute to the discussions on the degree to which participating states have observed and implemented the human rights provisions of the Final Act. The Berne meeting in 1986 may be expected to offer similar opportunities in regard to the question of human contacts.</P>
    <P>In concluding my remarks on this motion I want to make clear that we and our partners in the Ten do not criticise the Soviet Union's record in the areas I have mentioned for reasons of emotional gratification, or merely to score points. We do so because we believe that the <Col N="1893" /> credibility of the CSCE process itself is put at risk in the eyes of the peoples of the participating states, when some participating states are seen to disregard or ignore the commitments they have entered into.  This country desires friendly and co-operative relations with the Soviet Union, a country whose history, culture, and very considerable achievements we respect.  The CSCE process was designed to bring about more secure, more co-operative and more humane relations between the participating states and their peoples.  We and our partners in the Ten are determined to pursue these goals through the CSCE process, and to go on seeking constructive, comprehensive and realistic dialogue with the Soviet Union.  I hope that all other signatories to the Helsinki Final Act will continue to pursue those goals.</P>

      <P>In speaking to these motions, I consider that, while it might be strictly outside their terms of reference, it would be appropriate for me to welcome and endorse the Taoiseach's earlier statement to the House on the outcome of the Dublin European Council, as a major break through on a number of issues of great importance to the development of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> I was saddened when I heard the Leader of the Opposition reading into the record this morning an obvious piece of misinformation which was published in a British newspaper on Sunday last. That piece of misinformation was designed for purposes which should have been evident to the Deputy, having regard to the record of the relations between the paper concerned and this country for the past month.  It is regrettable that the Leader of the Opposition had to stoop to making such a disloyal contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was matter of opinion they quoted but one which was not shared by other members of the Community.</P>
      <P>That said, I should like to conclude the debate on the Twenty-First Report on Developments in the European Communities on the note that while major problems had not been resolved the Greek Presidency and the Irish delegations were assiduously pursuing possible solutions.  In our own case this of course principally concerned the Commission proposal for a special levy on milk production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period of the Twenty-Second and Twenty-Third Reports on Developments in the European Communities embraces the whole of 1983.  In June of that year, the European Council in Fontainebleau confirmed a decision which, given the background of the Community's serious financial difficulties, the surplus situation <Col N="1895" /> in the milk market and the considerable production cut-backs other member states had to accept, was remarkably favourable for the Irish dairying industry.</P>
    <P>I should say also that I welcome the report on the super-levy which the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation prepared and which set out clearly and comprehensively the vital national interest involved for Ireland on this issue.</P>
    <P>Another problem which dominated the Community scene in 1983 was that of the British and German contributions to the Community budget.  While temporary solutions had, in the past, been arranged for this problem, it continued to resurface and overshadow the other issues facing the Community.  Under the agreed arrangement arrived at in Fontainebleau in June 1984 the UK is to be paid a lump sum of 1,000 MECUs for 1984; and, for 1985 and some years thereafter so long as the Community's VAT limit is maintained at 1.4 per cent, the UK will be paid 66 per cent of the gap between its share of VAT payments and its share of Community expenditure.  This arrangement does not strike at fundamental Community principles but represents a pragmatic arrangement to resolve a longstanding Community problem.</P>
    <P>The European Council in Fontainebleau agreed also that the VAT contributions by member states to the Community budget should be raised from 1.0 per cent to 1.4 per cent by 1 January 1986 at the latest.  Moreover it was agreed that this rate may be increased further to 1.6 per cent on 1 January 1988, by unanimous decision of the Council and after agreement has been given in accordance with national procedures.  One should not underestimate the importance of this agreement; it will enable the Community to fund its ongoing policies, meet the costs of enlargement and develop the new common policies which are urgently required to tackle the pressing social and economic problems which now confront the peoples of Europe.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, I could, for a moment, put this agreement in a broader context.  This <Col N="1896" /> deadline of January 1986 for the accession of Spain and Portugal is of vital importance for the Community in that two member states, the Federal Republic of Germany and, to a lesser degree, the Netherlands, have directly linked their agreement on increasing the Community's own resources as from 1 January 1986 to the enlargement of the Community, as from that date also.  The basic political and economic reality is, therefore, that the availability of increased own resources to the Community is directly linked to enlargement.  Hence the vital importance of this issue for the future development of the Community and its range of existing and planned new policies.  It is therefore extremely encouraging to note the progress achieved at the European Council in Dublin and reported in detail by the Taoiseach earlier today.</P>
    <P>The basic strategy of the Irish Presidency has been, as an immediate priority, to try to secure internal Community positions on all the major negotiating issues.</P>
    <P>Having achieved a common Community position, wine and fisheries nevertheless remain difficult and sensitive issues in the negotiations with Spain and Portugal. In this regard, I have stated already on a number of occasions that this Government will, as in the past, continue to defend and advance the best interests of Irish fishermen and the Irish fishing industry.  This is, and will remain, the national priority in the negotiations for us.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the comprehensive report of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation is timely and I welcome its publication.</P>
    <P>With maximum political goodwill and co-operation from all our partners, the final decisive stage of the negotiations, on which we have now entered, can be brought to an early and successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>Important developments took place also in our relations with the group of African, Caribbean and Pacific countries with whom we are contractually linked under the Lomè Convention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1897" /> Negotiations for a third Lomè Convention from 1985 onwards got under way and very recently reached a successful conclusion.  The signature of the new Convention will take place in Lomè on 8 December and will preserve a tradition inaugurated in 1975 by the present Taoiseach, of signature of the Lomè Convention by Irish Presidents of the Council.</P>
    <P>The new convention will consolidate what has been achieved in its two predecessors but it will also contain some innovations. Most notably it will place a new emphasis on the ACP area achieving self-reliance through integrated rural and agricultural development.  The new convention will also contain a new chapter on the long-term fight against drought and desertification which is presently ravaging many parts of Africa.  It is my fervent hope that, if we continue these kinds of strategies in our aid programme, terrible tragedies such as that which we are witnessing in Ethiopia today will become a thing of the past.  This was noted by the European Council.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a special word about the situation in Ethiopia.  As you are aware, the Irish Presidency was instrumental in getting the Community to reassess its position on aid to that country. That effort culminated in the recent conclusion by the European Council that 1.2 million tonnes of food aid should be provided to Ethiopia by the Community and its member states between now and the next harvest.</P>
    <P>Turning to internal Community affairs, the European Parliament adopted, on 14 September 1983, a resolution on the substance of a preliminary draft treaty establishing the European Union.  This was a further step in a process which began in July 1981 when the Parliament resolved to take the initiative in giving a new impetus to the creation of European Union.  This process culminated on 14 February 1984 when the European Parliament adopted the draft treaty establishing the European Union, together with a resolution entrusting its President to submit it to the Parliaments and Governments of the member states.</P>
    <P>The draft treaty is a document which <Col N="1898" /> in its intent and inspiration merits our full attention.  While there will inevitably be hesitations on the part of Governments with regard to certain aspects of the draft treaty it serves as a useful model for the Community's long-term goal of European Union and places on Governments the onus of seeking a real consensus for action to achieve that common goal.</P>
    <P>The decisions on institutional issues reached at the European Council at Fontainebleau in June 1984 enabled us to begin to give concrete substance to the launching of the Community to which the Heads of State or Government had committed themselves with the signature of the Solemn Declaration on European Union on 19 June 1983.  The success of the Council enabled its members to address their attention once more to the further strengthening and development of the Community and the wellbeing of its citizens.  It decided to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> Committee on Institutional Affairs, representative of the Heads of State or Government, the function of which is to make suggestions for the improvement of the work of the Community in all areas. The Irish Presidency was asked to take the necessary steps to implement that decision and the committee met under the chairmanship of Senator Dooge and submitted an interim report to the European Council in Dublin.  That meeting mandated the committee and the <i>ad hoc</i> Committee on a People's Europe to continue their important work.</P>
    <P>Employment has been an Irish priority, and as Presidency we have asked the Council and the Commission to examine ways of alleviating the appalling situation of the unemployed in Europe.  The Taoiseach has reported on the progress achieved at the European Council in Dublin and we hope that Community-wide action will be taken as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Within the framework of European political co-operation the Ten continued to co-ordinate their positions on important international issues.  In the field of political co-operation the Solemn Declaration on European Union, adopted by the Heads of State or Government in June 1983, brought together in a single <Col N="1899" /> document various measures which had been introduced over recent years, in order to reinforce the effectiveness of the process.</P>
    <P>The Arab-Israel conflict, the Iran-Iraq war and, in particular, the situation in the Lebanon were considered frequently by the Ten during 1983.  On 21-22 March 1983 the European Council underlined the urgent need for withdrawal from Lebanon of Israeli, Syrian and PLO troops.  The time had come for Israel to show that it was ready for negotiations, on the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338 of the UN Security Council, by refraining from expanding existing settlements in the occupied territories or creating new settlements.</P>
    <P>In September 1983, inter-communal fighting broke out in the Lebanon following the withdrawal by Israeli troops to the Awali River.  On 12 September the Ten called for a ceasefire and emphasised the necessity of putting an end to sectarian violence and starting a process of national reconciliation.  On 9 November, following violence arising from inter-Palestinian rivalries in Northern Lebanon, the Ten expressed their concern at the loss of life and suffering of Palestinian and Lebanese civilians.</P>
    <P>Speaking on behalf of the Ten to the UN General Assembly on 27 September 1983, the Greek Foreign Minister, Mr. Haralambopoulos, appealed to Iran and Iraq to spare civilian populations and to observe the international humanitarian conventions which applied in time of war. At their meeting on 27 February 1984, the Foreign Ministers reiterated this plea and called for compliance by the belligerents with the Security Council's resolutions. They also appealed to those involved in a further outbreak of violence in the Lebanon to cease fire.</P>
    <P>At their meeting on 27 March 1984 Foreign Ministers of the Ten adopted declarations on the Middle East, which had been prepared but not issued at the European Council on 19-20 March.  They hoped that the Lebanese Government and all political forces would continue their efforts to bring about national unity and <Col N="1900" /> establish a lasting peace throughout the country.  In the Ten's view, a process of negotiating a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict presupposed mutual recognition of the existence and the rights of the parties concerned.  On the Iran-Iraq war, the Ten recorded their distress at the allegations of the use of chemical weapons. They condemned any use of such weapons without qualification.</P>
    <P>As President-in-Office, I spoke on behalf of the Ten to the UN General Assembly on 27 September 1984.  In relation to the Middle East, the Ten expressed the belief that a start towards a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict could be made with the renunication by all parties of the threat or use of force and with the abandonment by Israel of its settlements policy, which was contrary to international law.  The Ten expressed their appreciation for the work of UNIFIL in Lebanon and its efforts to maintain stable conditions and protect the population in its areas of operations. In the Iran-Iraq war, the Ten urged the extending of the process begun by the undertaking by Iran and Iraq not to attack purely civilian targets.</P>
    <P>The general return to democratic government throughout most of South America, particularly in Argentina, has been welcomed by the Ten.  Unfortunately, the Chilean situation has not developed along these lines.  The government of that country have consistently refused to make serious moves in the direction of the restoration of civil liberties and democracy.  The recent wave of repressive measures under the state of siege in Chile and the continued violence there is a source of concern to the Ten. In the view of the Ten, it is necessary for the Chilean authorities to resume the dialogue with opposition groups in order to create the conditions which would allow for an early return to democracy in that country.</P>
    <P>As regards Central America, the Ten have consistently supported the Contadora process as the best way of achieving peace and stability in Central America. In the view of the Ten, the problems of the region cannot be solved by armed <Col N="1901" /> force but only by a political solution springing from the region itself and respecting the principles of non-interference and inviolability of frontiers.</P>
    <P>The Conference in San Jose, Costa Rica on 28-29 September of the Foreign Ministers of the European Community, the two applicant countries, Spain and Portugal, the countries of Central America and the Contadora Group marked a significant step forward in relations between the two regions and demonstrated the importance of the support &mdash; both political and economic &mdash; which the Community and its member states can offer to the region.  A process of political dialogue has been initiated and talks will soon get under way with a view to concluding a framework co-operation agreement with Central America.  The participants at the San Jose Conference confirmed their support for the Contadora process.  Tension in the region, however, has remained close to the surface.  The Foreign Ministers of the Ten, meeting in Brussels on 20 November, expressed their deep concern at the increasing tension in and around Nicaragua and called on all parties to act with the utmost restraint in this matter.</P>
    <P>East-West relations were tense and difficult during 1983.  The shooting down by the Soviet Union of the Korean Airlines jet in September 1983, and the suspension in November, following the initial deployment of Cruise and Pershing II missiles, of the negotiations of intercontinental strategic nuclear weapons (START) and intermediate nuclear forces (INF), severely affected the international climate.  In particular, the political relationship between the two superpowers remained strained.</P>
    <P>The Ten have been concerned to bring about more predictable and more secure relations between the countries of East and West.  They have sought throughout the recent difficult period to keep open the channels of dialogue with the Soviet Union and the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  They welcomed the recently announced US-Soviet agreement to enter into new negotiations with the objective of reaching mutually <Col N="1902" /> acceptable agreements on the whole range of questions covering nuclear and outer space arms.  The Ten have undertaken to do everything possible to ensure progress in the negotiations in which they themselves are taking part, notably the Conference in Stockholm on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe.</P>
    <P>The lifting of martial law in Poland on 22 July 1983 was the major development in 1983.  On 21 July of this year the Polish authorities announced an amnesty for the great majority of political prisoners.  The Foreign Minister of the Ten issued a statement on 23 July welcoming the amnesty. The Ten expressed the hope that the Polish Government's decision reflected a desire to meet the expectations of the Polish people for dialogue and reform and that the amnesty would be followed by further measures of a kind which would help to promote national reconciliation. The Ten recalled their willingness to return to a more normal relationship with Poland as developments in that country warranted.  Individual members of the Ten, over the past number of months, have gradually resumed political contacts with representatives of the Polish Government.  They are concerned, however, about recent events in Poland, including the deplorable murder of Fr. Popieluszko, and threats affecting human rights in that country.</P>
    <P>Under the CSCE process the main development in the period of the 22nd and 23rd reports was the signing on 6 September 1983 of the Concluding Document of the Madrid follow-up meeting of the CSCE.  The work of the meeting proved difficult due largely to the climate of East-West relations at the time.  Nonetheless, the Ten believe the Concluding Document to be a balanced and substantial text containing worth-while progress on the provisions of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.  The Ten will continue to seek through the CSCE process more secure and more co-operative relations between the 35 participating states and greater contact between their peoples.  The Ten have emphasised and will continue to emphasise the importance which they <Col N="1903" /> attach to the full implementation of all the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and the Madrid Concluding Document, including those relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms as I said when I contributed to the debate on the earlier motion.</P>
    <P>On disarmament the Madrid Concluding Document contained the mandate for the Stockholm conference on disarmament in Europe which opened in January of this year.  The Ten, in conformity with the mandate agreed at Madrid are seeking negotiated agreement in a first stage on a set of militarily significant and verifiable confidence and security building measures.  These measures would be designed to diminish the risk of military confrontation in Europe through making military behaviour more open and military intentions more calculable and thereby pave the way to a second stage of the Conference where the participating states would continue their efforts for security and disarmament in Europe, in particular by controlled reductions of armaments.</P>
    <P>Progress at the conference in Stockholm has so far been slow.  However, the Ten are encouraged by the fact that the conference has in recent days agreed a working structure.  They hope that this agreement will enable substantive negotiations to get under way.</P>
    <P>Developments in South Africa have been followed closely by the Ten in recent months.  On 27 February 1984, the Foreign Ministers of the Ten issued a statement noting with satisfaction the Lusaka Agreement of 16 February between South Africa and Angola.  This agreement provided for the withdrawal of South African forces from Southern Angola, and the Ten have closely followed its implementation, which unfortunately has not taken place as quickly as envisaged.  They also noted the understanding between South Africa and Mozambique, which later led to the signing of the Nkomati Accord on 16 March. The Ten have commended the efforts of all parties concerned to bring about <Col N="1904" /> increased security and stability in the region.  In addition, they have expressed the hope that the Southern African agreements would contribute to a climate of mutual confidence which would facilitate the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 on independence for Namibia.  The Ten have noted the continuing diplomatic contacts between Mozambique and South Africa aimed at increasing security and economic prosperity in Mozambique.</P>
    <P>As regards South Africa, Ireland and the Ten have continued to express their abhorrence of the South African Government's policy of apartheid.  They have kept under close review the events surrounding the implementation of South Africa's new constitution this autumn.  At their meeting in Dublin on 11 September, the Foreign Ministers issued a declaration on South Africa in which they took the view that the violence and rioting which had surrounded the elections to the Coloured and Indian Assemblies, reflected, <i>inter alia</i>, the frustration of black South Africans at their deliberate exclusion from South Africa's political life and at the denial to them of adequate political means through which to express their grievances.  The Foreign Ministers expressed their concern at the arrest and detention of those involved in the boycott, and sought the immediate release of those detained without charge.</P>
    <P>I have not reported in detail on all the activities in the Communities in the period covered by the reports.  I have instead confined myself to the major issues addressed in recent years, and I have tried to link these with the most recent developments reported upon earlier today by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, no doubt, wish to express their views on the wide range of issues which these motions open up, and I will be extremely interested to hear them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for giving me an opportunity to have this discussion today.  I regret that there are so few people here to participate in it. That could be due to lunch time or to the <Col N="1905" /> fact that we have had major statements about Europe earlier this morning by the Taoiseach, the leader of my party and the leader of The Workers' Party.  From the ordinary person's point of view there is a very great and growing cynicism and scepticism about the EC and where it is going.</P>
      <P>I was out of the country at the weekend. As the Minister knows, I was helping my leader do the business of the Government in Libya.  I am glad to see that this is recognised by the Minister for Agriculture, as reported in one of this morning's papers.  I will assume that that report is correct unless it is changed.</P>
      <P>To many of the 220,000 people out of work this weekend's conference in Dublin Castle has not been a success. They would regard it as a failure in that again nothing positive has emerged from the summit with regard to providing employment for them.  They are more concerned about trying to live an ordinary life than people in this House might appreciate having regard to the fact that they were seeing the leaders of Europe haggling for a long weekend over wine problems, wine lakes, olive oil problems and fishery problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing emerged from that meeting of the leaders of Europe that would in any way resolve the problems facing these people.  I am not blaming the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; we all stand accused in this area &mdash; but young people, in particular, have now become so demoralised because nothing positive is emerging for them despite all the summits and reports thereon we have had in this House in recent years in which the public at large were told that unemployment constituted our principal problem.  If it was, it still is and the people on the dole queues are still there.  There is nothing but growing concern being felt by those people in those dole queues, by their families, a feeling that nothing worthwhile is being done for them.  That is the real picture as seen by the ordinary person.  We would be very foolish and unwise in this Parliament this afternoon to believe that anything other than that constitutes the real picture.  Unemployment is a very big <Col N="1906" /> problem.  One might contend that there are very few farmers who would appreciate the enthusiasm of the Government that this latest summit was a success or that 1984 or the latter part of 1983 were as successful as the Minister and Government would have us believe.</P>
    <P>The super-levy is now beginning to bite heavily.  There is nothing but confusion being felt amongst our dairy farmers as to where they are going or what they will do.  It is cold comfort to them to read in the Press yesterday that this latest summit was a success.  Many of them, particularly those who have not yet reached full development stage, are now placed in the position in which they will be penalised because they are endeavouring to reach that development stage which they must if they are to survive economically in their dairying activities.  It is regrettable that that is so.  Farmers are equally disturbed and upset that when their case was being made by the Government in the course of the year the wrong information was given by the Minister for Agriculture with regard to the gallonage of milk on which the super-levy terms were to be negotiated and implemented.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand that in 1984 we have not a reasonably &mdash; and I say specifically &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;&mdash; modern system of counting the gallonage of milk received at the different intake points throughout the length and breadth of the country.  Now, as a result of this unbelievable cock up in the compilation of these important statistics required &mdash; so that we might know what would be the effects on us of the super-levy &mdash; we could not even get that sum right.  We are now in the position in which, seemingly, we still use the pencil, adding columns and lines of figures that any 14 year old commencing in any of our secondary schools could do with accuracy with the aid of the facilities now available to us by way of calculators, computers etc.  It appears we are now likely to lose out on that levy because of the mistake made earlier.  It is poor consolation to those involved in the dairying industry, to those people at present unemployed, to read of major breakthroughs being effected, as was <Col N="1907" /> reported in some of yesterday's papers, at this latest summit.  Of course we all wanted the summit to be a success.  We all want to see Europe go from strength to strength.  It is highly important to every member state that the European concept be extremely successful.  But beyond that it is vital for us that Europe succeeds and that it would be seen to succeed.</P>
    <P>There must also be great concern felt among our fishermen.  Nobody seems to know what is happening in regard to the efforts required for the protection of our fisheries interests as a result of negotiations in train with Spain at present.  I say Spain deliberately because I understand the problem is primarily one with that country.  We are all aware of the strength of the Spanish fishing armada and the damage it can do to our fisheries &mdash; that it could wipe them out &mdash; if we are not adequately protected along the way.  In the course of parliamentary questions at the commencement of this session on this subject, in questions put by me to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I sought a categoric assurance from the Minister that the fisheries question be resolved completely before Spain's entry, and that we would have a chance of discussing the final position in this House.  That is what I and many other Members of this House would like to see happen rather than have the type of situation which developed in the Greek case.  The Greeks were able to renegotiate a whole new package from within.  We would not wish anything like that to occur in relation to the fisheries question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be discussed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it must be finalised so that no door is left ajar to enable the Spanish to negotiate on an ongoing basis having joined the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had extremely useful discussions at meetings of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and I know much <Col N="1908" /> effort is being put into this matter.  There is very great concern about the lack of definite information as to what is happening. We do not want a situation whereby the Spanish can continue to reject out of hand the proposals put forward by the Commission and continuously gain ground at the expense of our fishermen. I would dread the day when the Spanish fishing fleet would fish up to our shores, because it would wipe out our fishing stock in a short while.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed that the own resources limit of 1 per cent will be increased to 1.4 per cent, but only when Spain and Portugal are admitted.  This has been made a condition by the West German and Dutch Governments.  That is blackmail. It can only be interpreted as putting the gun to the head of other member states, particularly Ireland.  We are being told that if trouble between Ireland and Spain on the fishing question delays accession the resources will not be increased.  This is an effort at blackmail.</P>
    <P>The Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Papandreou, is reported as having walked out of the Summit meeting in Dublin Castle because he wants billions made available for the Mediterranean scheme.  That action was also wrong.  All this causes serious problems.  Regarding the financing problems, 1 per cent is certainly not enough.  Recently the Minister for Finance came into this House seeking approval for the making available of moneys to run the EC.  We hear daily about the shortage of money and we recognise the seriousness of the problem.  With the increase to 1.4 per cent, have we any guarantee that the schemes being financed by the EC will continue to be financed at the same level as at present? I should like to hear the Minister's view on this extremely important matter.  It is hoped in some years' time to increase the level to 1.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>It appears that almost all the negotiations with Portugal have been concluded and the few remaining items could be concluded within a matter of hours if there was the political will to do so. Would the Minister not agree that it would be fair to the Portuguese people <Col N="1909" /> to finalise their business?  They applied about seven months before Spain.  I say this following an all-party meeting with a deputation from the Portuguese parliament last week.  They very much want to be told that their package is concluded and that the way is open for them to become a member at the same time as Spain.  They should be taken out of the misery of not knowing what problems might arise.  I say this not just because it would be the nice thing to do but because the Portuguese parliamentarians assured us that it is important to democracy and stability within their country that this should be done.  I would ask the Minister to inquire into the matter and to use his good offices if he feels they should be helped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am serious in what I say.  Deputy Manning and Deputy Durkan from Fine Gael, the Minister's colleague in Government, Deputy Quinn, and others also heard what was said.  There is some failure of communication along the lines.</P>
      <P>I note the comments made by the Minister on the important developments which took place with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and I welcome the fact that the new Convention will be signed shortly, preserving a tradition inaugurated by the present Taoiseach in 1975.  I also welcome the innovations in this Convention.  The Minister states that it will contain a new chapter on the long-term fight against drought and desertification which is ravaging many parts of Africa.  The Minister said that this was noted by the European Council.  I hope I am wrong in interpreting this to mean &ldquo;we agree in principle, something should be done about it but we will long-finger it&rdquo;.  If I am wrong perhaps the Minister would correct me.</P>
      <P>With regard to Ethiopia, the all-party discussion on this matter in late October was helpful to the Minister in strengthening his resolve &mdash; although I do not believe it would have needed strengthening on a personal basis &mdash; to do something about the terrible problem which was presented to the world on the television screen of the many hundreds of thousands of people who were on the verge of death through starvation.  I welcomed the Minister's move here to make more funds available and at the time I went on record as saying that if he got agreement from the Government to seek the permission of the House for more funds we would support such a move.  I repeat that offer today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the way, as President of the Council of Foreign <Col N="1911" /> Ministers, he tackled the problem and on the progress he made in shaking the conscience of our European partners.  As Irishmen and women we can all feel proud of the fact that per head of the population we have contributed more to the unfortunate starving people of Ethiopia than any other country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all pleased at the response.  I pay tribute to those responsible for making the film that was shown on television, to the press who highlighted the plight of those people and to the Members for their mature approach to this situation which shocked us all.  I hope we do not leave it at that and that as a nation we continue to maintain our generosity because the problem has just about been tackled and no more. I compliment the voluntary organisations for their great work.  It appears that they have succeeded in areas where official agencies did not.  I am not trying to take from the efforts of the official agencies but the voluntary bodies have done tremendous work.  We will willingly give the Minister any support he needs to do more to help those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can recall discussing hunger and famine in Africa at a meeting some years ago and suggesting to a colleague that we should not deal with the problem by a reaction from having seen people dying from hunger.  I suggested that it might be better to teach the poor people to fish, give them a fishing rod and show them how to use it rather than giving them fish which we had caught for them.  That representative from another country had not heard that expression and we had a long discussion about the matter.  We are all deeply concerned about the problem in Ethiopia but had the Minister for Foreign Affairs not put on the pressure in Europe &mdash; I mean this and I give credit where it is due &mdash; we might not have had such a good response from Europe.  I thank the Minister for that work.  I hope that for the remainder of his term as President of the Council he will continue <Col N="1912" /> that pressure.  I urge the Minister to pass on that message to his successor, Italian Foreign Minister Andriotti.  He should impress on the Italian Foreign Minister that he will have the support of the Irish Government and people to do everything possible to help those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>What the European Council decided to do on Monday is very significant.  The 1.2 million tonnes of grain, while it may not cure the problem, will hold it back until the next harvest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that that is a step in the right direction.  I do not know enough about the problem to say how far that contribution will go to deal with it but the effort should be maintained or strengthened.</P>
      <P>In referring to Ethiopia I am expressing concern about all places in Africa where there is hunger and famine.  The problem is not confined to one country.  I am sure the Minister and other Members were disturbed, as I was, when viewing the TV programme recently which indicated that in spite of the tragedy in Ethiopia some of the supplies gathered in America and Europe are being mishandled or mismanaged. The ghouls of the black market who do not have any regard for human misery and suffering are stealing the supplies destined for the very hungry.  I do not know how that problem can be dealt with and I accept that it is not a matter for the Minister but he is in a better position that I to see to it that the supplies get through to the starving people.  I fear that the television programme may do some harm to those seeking voluntary contributions.  People may ask why there is not proper management of the supplies and may decide not to contribute further to such collections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It might weaken our personal resolve to continue with our great generosity and to do something worthwhile to help those people who are not as fortunate or as lucky as we.  They <Col N="1913" /> do not have food, water, shelter or clothes. In paying tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs I must include his Minister of State who deserves great thanks.  I had great sympathy for him when on his return home from a visit to those countries he had difficulty at a press conference in trying to describe what he saw.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister about the Dooge Committee who presented an interim report to the summit.  Has that report been published?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not deal with this important document until I have had an opportunity of analysing its contents.  I recognise from what the Taoiseach said this morning that the comminiqué after the Summit indicated that people are worried about unemployment, but the unemployed are with us although communiqués issued after the last five or six Summits referred to their plight.  Unfortunately, nothing has materialised.  I urge that priority be given to this problem and something definite be embarked upon to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister's comments on the Middle East.  We all followed developments there very carefully not just because we have troops of the Irish Army involved in the Lebanon, of whom we are all very proud, and not just because we have an Irishman in charge of the UNIFIL force there, Major Bill Callaghan, who is doing an excellent job, but because we recognise the potential for a full scale war if common sense does not prevail and if peace is not restored there.  We all support the moves of the European Council in their demands for the withdrawal from Lebanon of Israeli, <Col N="1914" /> Syrian and PLO troops.  We recognise the difficulties that are there but we assure the Minister of our support in this area in the interests of peace.</P>
    <P>We are severely disturbed about the situation in Iran and Iraq.  We support the call of the Council with regard to the sparing of the civilian population and hope that the international humanitarian conventions will be observed.  We see on television the consequences of that dreadful war.  We wish the Foreign Ministers of the Council every success in their efforts to help improve the situation.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Minister mentioned Afghanistan.  I mention this because we are approaching Christmas and four years ago, either on Christmas Day or on St. Stephen's Day when normal people of goodwill are enjoying life with their families, the unfortunate people of Afghanistan were invaded, and are still occupied by the troops of the Soviet Government. If this is not in the Minister's speech I am sure this omission is not intentional but at every opportunity we should keep the pressure on the mighty Soviets and prick their conscience because we do not condone or approve of their actions.  I would like the people of that small, poor country to know that they are not forgotten.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's view with regard to the improvements that have taken place in Argentina and their return to democratic government.  I welcome that move but I regret that the Chilian Government have consistently refused to move in this direction or to restore civil liberty or democracy.  The repressive regime in that country must be condemned out of hand at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>As regards Central America, only two days ago I spoke to a member of the government of Nicaragua, whom I met in Libya, on the situation in his country. We had an enlightened discussion with him.  I have also spoken to members on all sides of the House who had the privilege of visiting Nicaragua recently &mdash; I deliberately used the word &ldquo;privilege&rdquo;&mdash; to observe the system of elections which we were told 12 or 18 months ago would not be democratic, fair or above board, and I say this in the presence of Deputy <Col N="1915" /> Allen who was there.  I have been told that their system was very fair, that everything was conducted as it should be at election time.  The people in the northern part of this island might learn something about democratic elections if they had had the privilege of visiting that country.</P>
    <P>I regret the tension in Nicaragua and the feeling they have that they are about to be crushed by the American forces. This is a tragedy, because this feeling is genuinely held.  I very much regret that the young people of that small country, with whom we have a lot in common because we have the same type of history, background and economic circumstances, are not in a position to harvest their coffee crop which is so important for their economic survival.  Instead, they have to down their agricultural weapons and take up weapons of war because they believe they are about to be invaded.  I regret that these tensions exist.  I think I understand the difficulties, but the more I reflect on them the more doubt comes to mind that I fully understand the difficulties of both sides.  The Minister will know from his officials that when I was Foreign Minister I had discussions with the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua.  I understand he is coming to the city of Cork in February on private business and I have asked to see him so that I will know what the situation is in his country. I wish the Minister and his colleagues in Europe every success in their efforts to try to bring about peace and stability in that region.</P>
    <P>With regard to Poland I am happy that in 1983 we saw martial law lifted and there was an amnesty for the majority of political prisoners.  I am glad that is so, but I hope these improvements will be followed by further measures which will help promote national reconciliation.  We were all concerned about the murder of Fr. Popieluszko and regret that such a thing could happen.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's comments on the Conference on Disarmament in Europe and the developments in South Africa.  We will support him in the views being expressed with regard to our <Col N="1916" /> abhorrence of the South African government's policies of apartheid.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious problem in this country so far as the ordinary people we try to represent are concerned.  This was evident in the European elections when only half the people voted.  Scepticism and cynicism are growing because of the failure of Europe, through the Government, to deal with the problems facing many sections of the community.  The problem did not start when the Minister took office, I would not like him to think I am implying that.  Everybody in this House will support my view that we want to see a stronger, healthier and more constructive community attitude towards what is happening in Europe.  Up to recently the farming community were the strongest supporters of Europe.  There are Deputies here representing rural communities, as I do, and it is only fair to say that the confidence the farming community had in Europe is not as strong today as it was.  Admittedly, we had it good for a while but things are tightening up now.  Many good schemes which were partly financed by Europe no longer exist.  This has helped undermine the confidence of the farming community in the institutions of Europe.  I would like to see a strong healthy attitude to Europe, critical of course, each section vying with the other for a greater input into the discussions and each hoping to make their case as strongly as they could to ensure that they get whatever help is available.</P>

However, that does not mean that Ballyhack will get the contract as other boatyards are also contracting for that vessel.  They have the same right to tender for that contract and I understand it has not been finalised yet.</P>

One of the first fisheries which the State bought in recent years was the salmon weir in Galway and I understand that the Department are making a substantial profit there.  That was purchased under Fianna Fáil policy as was the Erriff fishery in County Mayo.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three cases awiting a hearing in the courts and a similar case against an Irish registered ex-Spanish vessel is also pending.  That seems to be the total outstanding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Spanish fishery vessels owners-cum-skippers have paid all the fines by way of hard cash to the Department or the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that there is no problem as regards the fines. Once the fine is imposed there is no problem in getting it.  My information from the files is that all fines are paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the fines paid by the way of hard cash, or gear which is confiscated and held?  Would the Minister accept that the book value of the gear is vastly different from its actual value?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I have not got that information but I will passs it on to the Deputy.  My understanding is that the fines are paid with hard cash and gear.  The file does not state whether all <Col N="1931" /> fines have been paid in cash.  However, I shall pass on that information to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just told us what I believe to be the case &mdash; that gear is used as part payment.  The book value of this gear is well below the actual value.  We are not obtaining the total fines which are imposed by our courts.  In future the Minister must ensure that all these fines are paid in hard cash. If not, no doubt the Minister well notify me.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any crisis in the finances of the regional fisheries boards.</P>

      <P>The overall development scheme for Howth harbour, which incidentally does not provide for a phase 3 as such, envisages the erection of a fish auction hall and its provision will be considered in the context of the formulation of the 1985 national harbour development programme.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that the Irish quota is in the region of 20 per cent of the UK quota?  That is not sufficient.  Does he admit that the increase we got last year would have been obtained even if he and the Minister never went to Brussels?</P>

The average catch for 1973 to 1978 in relation to mackerel was UK 54.74 per cent and Ireland 9.14 per cent.  The percentage agreed under the Common Fisheries Policy in relation to mackerel for 1984 is, Ireland 21.3 per cent and the UK 58.7 per cent.  These figures are based on historical performance. These are the arguments which are put forward when the fish quotas are being allocated.  We have done rather well by increasing our percentage by two and a half times while the UK got a small increase from 54.74 per cent to 58.7 per cent.</P>

The mackerel percentages were not isolated in the Community from the overall arrangements. The Minister of State will be aware that because of the concentration on mackerel in recent times there is now a greater dependence on it than in the past.  As a result of our special position we need a more substantial increase in the quota.  Has any effort been made to increase substantially the mackerel quota for the coming years?

      <P>Can the Minister indicate the position of the mackerel stock?  Is it not a fact that because of the changed <Col N="1941" /> stock position there is a much stronger case for an increase in the mackerel quota?  We should be getting in the region of 110,000 tonnes now.  Is it not a fact that the stock situation has changed?</P>

      <P>Our scientific information does not indicate that.  I must point out that it is all right catching mackerel but selling it is a different thing.  In County Donegal there were 20,000 tonnes of mackerel in cold storage for six months. We had to do a lot of work to get Nigeria and Egypt to take that mackerel.  As Minister of State responsible for fisheries I am stating that it is just as important to have the markets before we have a big increase in catches.</P>

      <P>The dredging of Burtonport Harbour together with other harbour works will be considered in the context of drawing up the 1985 harbour improvement programme.  In deciding on that programme account will have to be taken of the provision in the Fisheries Vote for harbour works and the cost of completing works already in hands.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that this is a very devious method being used by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, who is also Minister for the Gaeltacht to extract 25 per cent of the cost of this from Donegal County Council who have no funds to fill potholes at the moment?  It is a very devious way of doing it.  If we have not the money, then if Donegal County Council's answer is that they have not got the money, that they cannot put up the £3 to every £1.  I ask the Minister respectfully to go back to the Department of the Gaeltacht and ask them to provide 50 per cent and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry to provide 50 per cent.  Will the Minister accept that the outgoing Government in November 1982 had £1 million in the Estimates for the development and when £1 million had to be reduced from the Estimate of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, Burtonport, because it is in west Donegal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be misinformed.  Despite the fact that this <Col N="1945" /> Department made provision in their Estimates for 1981 and 1982 for their share of 50 per cent of the cost, the dredging of Burtonport harbour did not succeed because Roinn na Gaeltachta did not provide the funds for their share of the cost. That was for two years running.  Now in the interests of fishing in that area the only thing we can do is to fund 75 per cent of the cost from my Department and 25 per cent from the county council because the other people will not put up the funds.</P>

      <P>In that case, I shall put the question on a general basis. <Col N="1950" /> Would the Minister consider it correct that the attitude of BIM towards insurance should be such that the fishermen do not know where they stand in so far as the value of their boats is concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

      <P>The establishment of fish processing facilities anywhere in the State is a matter for private enterprise in the first instance.  Grants are available from the Industrial Development Authority and from the EEC Commission &mdash; FEOGA &mdash; for suitable projects as well as from Údarás na Gaeltachta for projects located in Gaeltacht areas.</P>

Has the Minister anything on his file in regard to that application?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the efforts being made to ensure that dogfish are processed within the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department and development agencies such as An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Industrial Development Authority, and Údarás na Gaeltachta to encourage fish processing generally as an industry which adds value to a natural resource and provides employment.  Grants are available for suitable projects but the development of fish processing is of course primarily a matter for private enterprise.</P>
      <P>There is a growing market in the United Kingdom and on the Continent for fresh, whole, and primary processed, skinned and frozen, dogfish.  A number of Irish firms are taking advantage of this and include dogfish among the more traditional species processed by them.  A County Donegal project recently approved for grant aid will specialise in the processing of dogfish for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that while the UK market is good for dogfish in its fresh state, there was a period when the local merchants and coops had to impose a quota on the amount being landed because of the British market not being in a position to absorb this type of fish?  Will the Minister agree with the necessity to ensure that greater <Col N="1955" /> efforts are made by BIM and the Department in respect of the processing of this species?  This is a new development on the west coast and one which could assist those fishermen with the smaller type boats who up to now have depended largley on other species of fish which are no longer available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Donegal case the capital grants come from the IDA. Grants are available for the processing of dogfish just as they are available for the processing of any other fish so there is no problem in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the quantity being landed is <Col N="1957" /> well in excess of that and that consequently a factory with a capacity to process much more than 1,500 tonnes per annum would be required in order to ensure that the dogfish is at a premium price at all times instead of having to put a quota on catches?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins in his speech tried to create the impression that the recent summit did not look at the major problem in Europe, the problem of unemployment The Deputy said that there was a growing scepticism and cynicism in relation to the Community that had manifested itself in the percentage of people who voted in the most recent European election.  A lot of the cynicism may be coming about because of statements like those made by Deputy Collins that the Council of Ministers did not attempt to look at the unemployment problem.  The communique that was issued after the summit dealt specifically with unemployment and made five main recommendations in relation to unemployment. It agreed to initiate a review of manpower policy in the Community; it decided that the Council should pursue and accelerate its consideration of measures to achieve a greater role for the ECU and develop and strengthen the EMS; it also agreed that they should implement without delay the firm political commitments in the field of transport policy, and it decided to adopt further measures to strengthen the technological base of the Community and restore competitiveness. These were major decisions which should get at least some attention.  To say that the meeting did not attend at all to the problems of unemployment is inaccurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister in his speech referred to the difficult situation in Nicaragua. I am participating in this debate today because I feel I should give my impressions of the democratic system in <Col N="1971" /> Nicaragua.  We have seen too many inaccurate and misinformed statements emanating from international press agencies giving a totally wrong perception of the situation in Central America.  When I had the honour to represent my party as a member of the delegation that went to Nicaragua in October I set about collecting information about all aspects of the election campaign there.  Before going out to assess whether or not the elections were free elections I briefed myself well and had come to the conclusion that I could not use the European form of parliamentary democracy as the only criterion for assessing the position in Nicaragua.  The political tradition there is different and for many decades political culture there has been influenced by the dictatorship that existed there and also by the fact that a state of emergency existed during the election because of the guerrilla war.  The situation is also complicated because of the devastation brought about by the 1972 earthquake which still leaves most of central Managua devastated.  This devastation has been allowed to continue because of the misappropriation of funds made available through international agencies.  I travelled to Nicaragua without preconceived ideas and attempted to tackle our job there with regard to the elections in an open-minded way.  I went out to talk to all concerned in the election process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be getting away from the subject matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has detailed the problems of Nicaragua in his speech and they are also referred to in the reports of the Communities.  During my stay I had discussions with as many groups and individuals as possible.  I would point out that even though we had a personal guide we were allowed to communicate freely with all those groups and were allowed to travel throughout the countryside unattended.  Free and democratic elections were one of the main objectives of the Sandinista revolution which was <Col N="1972" /> supported by all groupings including the Catholic Church in Nicaragua.  The elections, along with a policy of non-alignment and a mixed economy, were the chief aims of the new Government.  However, the five year rule of the Government had been marked by a counterrevolution which, admittedly, resulted in the erosion of civil liberties.  But in February last elections were called to take place in November 1984 to elect a President, Vice-President and Constituent Assembly.  All political parties in the state were asked to participate.  The establishment of electoral laws was discussed by a Council of State earlier this year.</P>
      <P>There is a wide range of political parties existing in Nicaragua but they can be broken down into two main sectors, the Patriotic Front of the Revolution and the Co-ordinadora group.  I shall not go into the details of those political groupings. All parties who decided to register fully for the elections received political rights and those that did not register were not recognised as legal political parties for electoral purposes.  All parties who registered for election were given access to radio, television and the press there. The group opted out, deciding not to register because a number of their policy decisions regarding nomination of their candidates was not met.  As a result the only parties that participated in the election and who nominated candidates were those from the main bloc, the Sandinista group, the Patriotic Front.  Seven parties decided to participate and the decision by the opposition group not to register meant that they lost their legal rights. Therefore, they must face some criticism for their self-elimination, abstentionist decision.  Their attitude was that by abstaining they denied the election the tag of legitimacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In travelling to Nicaragua I decided that the following major decisions had to be posed: First, taking into account the situation in Nicaragua, the guerrilla warfare, the social consequences of the earthquake and so on, would the voting process express voters' wills or would their citizens be forced to behave in a <Col N="1973" /> specific manner because of the threat of unpleasant consequences which would result if they did not take part in the election process?  Second, had the ruling body guaranteed that the result of the election would be respected and would power be handed over in the event of an opposition victory?</P>
    <P>In attempting to assess whether the election held was a free one we were somewhat hindered by the proximity of the election and the difficulty of arranging meetings with all the parties involved.  It was not that we were unable to get the co-operation of the authorities but, as with elections in any other country, the people concerned were totally involved in the campaign itself.  We were also somewhat hindered by the absence of a number of Ministers who were attending the funeral of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, former chairperson of the Non-Aligned Group.</P>
    <P>The Sandinista movement, who had been ruling the Government since the revolution, had ruled for five years.  In that time the party and the state had come very close.  This gave the main grouping, the Sandinista grouping, a very definite advantage in the election campaign. However, I believe that did not prevent fair elections being held especially when one remembers the economic crisis confronting the country.  Our discussions in Nicaragua have shown that press censorship was eliminated almost entirely over the last two months of the election campaign.  Registration of voters took place in August and 1,500,000 people registered to vote.  That figure has been accepted by all commentators as realistic, bearing in mind a population of three million people and a minimum voting age of 16.  The voting process was up to European standards in that voting secrecy was ensured by the same process as is allowed here.  Therefore, my conclusion was that the voting operation itself was technically maintained.</P>
    <P>In attempting to come to a conclusion we discussed the election process with one of the non-participating parties, the <Col N="1974" /> Socialist Christian Party.  We had discussions with their candidate for the Vice-Presidency &mdash; had their party participated &mdash; Mr. Aidan Fletes, and with their vice-president, Miss Anucena Ferrey. They refused to register because of the alleged lack of free speech prior to the date of registration.  They have now come to regret their decision as they stated that the situation in that regard improved considerably since the date of registration and that conditions over the last few months were proper for a free and open election.</P>
    <P>On election day our group split up.  I shall not go into details on this except to say that in all of the polling booths we visited, even those visited at random, the election was seen as a simple, efficient, honest one, totally secret, with no coercion being visible.  All of the observers present were highly impressed by the arrangements at those polling booths.</P>
    <P>Having made as many inquiries as possible in the days we were there before election day, and having witnessed the proceedings on election day itself, we came to the conclusion that the election was a fair one in the circumstances, that voters were in a position to express a preference freely and in secret.  On the evening of election day a meeting was arranged of all European parliamentarians who had observed the election.  Even though minor reservations were expressed about certain aspects, everybody agreed that the election itself and the campaign had been democratic.</P>
    <P>Dealing briefly with the second major question of whether the ruling party would relinquish power in the event of defeat, that question cannot be answered because of the non-participation of the major Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>Dealing now specifically with what this and other European countries can do in the way of development aid to Central America, I should say that a meeting was held in September 1984 in San José between European Community Ministers and Central American representatives when Ireland, among others, rejected the United States' suggestion of excluding Nicaragua from any regional <Col N="1975" /> aid package.  Many Nicaraguan leaders, including their now President, Daniel Ortega, expressed to our delegation their appreciation of the Irish Government's stance at that meeting.  However, having visited Nicaragua and recognised the urgency of the situation obtaining, I consider that Ireland should examine seriously our overall policy with regard to that country, taking positive action to support its defence of its national sovereignty. I was glad to hear Deputy G. Collins support that view in the House earlier today.</P>
    <P>Most democratic observers of the Central American situation are in agreement that the solution to the problems of the region are best achieved through political rather than military means and that the build-up of military infrastructure in the countries surrounding Nicaragua constitutes a threat to the fragile stability of the entire region.</P>
    <P>Ireland, in our historical tradition of upholding principles of non-intervention and respect for the sovereign right of countries to determine their internal affairs, should use our unique relationship with the United States to influence the current United States Administration in the direction of a political solution to the problems of the region.  There are definite, concrete ways in which Ireland can take such action.</P>
    <P>Ireland should recognise the considerable advances made for democracy in Central America as a result of the free and fair elections held in Nicaragua.  We should support the Contadora process. At the meeting of EC Ministers with representatives of the Central American countries and the members of the Contadora group, Ireland, together with its fellow European countries, stated its diplomatic and political backing for the Contadora initiative.  Ireland should seek to reaffirm this position in all international fora, promoting the support of all democratic countries for the Contadora process.  Ireland should seek observer status of the Contadora group and encourage its EC partners to do likewise. Ireland should also seek to establish some <Col N="1976" /> form of formal diplomatic links with Nicaragua and other Central American countries, at least at consular level.</P>
    <P>More contacts and exchanges with Nicaragua should be encouraged to enable the Irish people to have access to information about the progress of the Nicaraguan situation.  This is very difficult because of the very slanted reports about that area coming from the international press agencies.  I attempted to assess the situation before I went there by reading reports in international magazines but I found the reality to be totally different. We should encourage politicians, journalists and representatives of other social groupings to avail of the opportunity to visit that area and gain understanding of its complexities.</P>
    <P>The Nicaraguan Government recently asked for adequate food supplies for the population during 1985.  In order to fulfil their needs they have appealed directly for emergency aid, including wheat and powdered milk.  More importantly, they have sought long term development aid in the form of financial and technical assistance for their agricultural development programme.  This is an area in which this country can become involved in a major way.  I laud the efforts of the Irish people in relation to Ethiopia but it is an attempt to close the stable door after the horse has bolted.  What we should be attempting to do is to set up the necessary structures to prevent such appalling situations developing.  We have the opportunity in areas like Central America where serious problems will arise if we do not make available the necessary technical and financial investment in their agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>In addition to aid on a Government to Government basis, the Irish Government should use their voice in international aid agencies, particularly the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to ensure that countries like Nicaragua are not jeopardised through lack of finance in their attempts to bring stability to their country.  The success or failure of the democratic process in that area depends to a large degree on the extent to which European Governments can convince the <Col N="1977" /> United States Administration to adopt a new and different policy to the Central American region, especially towards Nicaragua.  A vigorous attempt should be made to ensure that all military assistance is brought to a conclusion.  I am not talking only about US aid to the counter-revolutionaries but also about aid from Eastern bloc countries to some administrations in the region.  There should be urgent dialogue with the United States and Eastern bloc countries in order to exclude external interference.</P>
    <P>Since our visit there, talks have taken place between the newly elected Government and the Opposition parties in order to work out a political pact involving issues such as a pluralist society and a mixed economy.  This pact would ensure a realistic part in the democratic process for the Opposition.  Unfortunately the negotiations are not being helped by the tensions created by threats of external intervention.  If these threats were eliminated I am satisifed that the democratic process could be worked out.  I welcome the statement by the Minister this morning and also the statement contained in the communiqué from the summit on Tuesday.</P>
    <P>The report also deals specifically with a matter of particular interest to me, namely, environmental protection.  One of the major problems facing the EC is trans-border pollution, especially the problem of acid rain.  The Community must address itself to the control of acid rain as a matter of urgency.  We have seen examples in Germany and elsewhere on the Continent of the damage caused to forests by high levels of sulphur dioxide being emitted from industrial complexes. The problem is also raising its ugly head in this country.  The first signs of damage to our environment are being seen.  The greatest amount of acidity in rain is in Dublin.  Much of it is self-produced but under certain weather conditions much of it comes from mainland Europe and Britain.  I am anxious that attempts to control environmental pollution be brought under one agency.  Responsibility is too fragemented to be effective at present.  I would ask for the setting up <Col N="1978" /> of an environmental protection agency to tackle the serious problem of acid rain pollution before it reaches crisis proportions. I would also ask the Government to ensure that a definite policy evolves in Europe.  There is no such policy now and we must not reach the stage of formulating policies when the damage has already been done.  The evidence already exists on mainland Europe and is becoming apparent here and the problem deserves urgent attention.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Deputy Collins on their positive statements. I am grateful for the opportunity of putting on record my views on these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>These reports give us an opportunity to discuss developments in the Community.  Because of the elections this year many of the developments in the Community were discussed publicly. There was an opportunity during the election campaign to highlight many of the areas of development in the Community which have been referred to in the report. A lot of what is in the report has been decided on.  It would be useful for us to look ahead rather than looking back over reports of recent years.  It would be more useful if we discussed future prospects for the Community bearing in mind what has transpired in recent years.  It was interesting to note that in spite of the public debate on development in the Community in the course of the campaign the turn out at the polls was very poor. It makes one wonder if our people have become disillusioned with the Community and feel that developments in Europe are not relevant to them.  It is important that we take note of the fact that the turn out in that election was a lot lower than we anticipated.  Part of the reason was that even at this early stage of our membership the Community is becoming more remote from the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that our people are not as familiar or involved in Community discussions as they should be.  We have an opportunity this afternoon to keep up the momentum of interest in the Community. Some recent events will no doubt <Col N="1979" /> make people more aware of the importance and significance of the Community. They will bring home to the people the relevance of the Community to our economic and social position.  With the help of the newly elected members of the European Parliament I expect that our people will become more involved in Community developments and I do not think we will see a repeat of the disappointment in the election turn out.  It was unfortunate that many people considered their vote in that election to be irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of fisheries, the developments that have taken place in regard to that industry and the importance of them to the Common Fisheries Policy.  Those involved in the negotiations are aware that it was difficult to conclude an agreement on a Common Fisheries Policy.  Discussions took place over five or six years involving not only member states but other countries who had arrangements with member states. That resulted in complicated arrangements being hammered out.  It is unfortunate that a short time after that policy has been agreed, and as it is working successfully in the Community, an application for enlargement will disrupt it.  That disruption will have serious consequences for the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Since negotiations commenced to establish a Common Fisheries Policy the hopes and expectations of those involved in the industry here rose.  As a result many invested heavily in boats, fishing gear, modernisation and training. Those people find now that because of the proposed enlargement there is the possibility of a threat to their livelihood because 17,000 Spanish boats are waiting to take advantage of some suitable accession arrangement.  All the investment and training that has gone into the building up of our fishing industry is seriously threatened by the negotiations.  Indeed, the Common Fisheries Policy is threatened. The enormous Spanish fleet will seek certain rights and quotas within the Community. That was not a problem up to now.  It appears that the Common Fisheries <Col N="1980" /> Policy will be thrown into disarray unless the negotiations are handled carefully. Those negotiations will have a significant impact on our industry.  Our national interest must be protected.  The rights of the Irish industry must be safeguarded in any arrangements made to enlarge the Community.</P>
    <P>The question of limits on quotas, the introduction of new structures and the provision of funds for modernisation of our industry, which were firmly established in the Common Fisheries Policy ratified in 1983, must be dealt with.  There is a danger that that agreement will be undermined and rendered irrelevant. Those involved in the industry here, and many of the interests in the Community, are not satisfied that proper procedures will be adopted to protect their position and ensure their viability and expansion in the future.  All the investment that has been put into building up our industry and the efforts to have an effective policy in the Community to ensure maximum development of fishing is under threat because of the pressure to enlarge the Community.  Many people question the need for such an enlargement.</P>
    <P>I do not have a big objection to the enlargement of the Community provided such a move is in the best interests of the Community and that the various interests are not adversely affected.  From the point of view of fisheries I cannot see any advantage resulting from an enlargement. In fact it is apparent that in the negotiations that have taken place to date Ireland will be at a disadvantage following the enlargement.  That has not been helped by the secrecy surrounding the negotiations that have taken place so far. Many fears are being expressed because of the lack of information on a clear cut policy statement from the Government or the Taoiseach in regard to enlargement proceedings.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful to think that the Taoiseach in the course of his statement on the summit did not mention anything about a fisheries policy to be adopted by the Community on the enlargement of the <Col N="1981" /> Community.  We can only rely on newspaper reports and we understand that they are fairly reliable.  Is it true that the position is that there will be a ten year transition period with the possibility of a further five year transition period being negotiated during that time?  Is it true that after that time there well be an abolition of the Irish box which protected our industry from the threat of Spanish boats?</P>
    <P>We have only to look over the last year to see the number of breaches of existing regulations and the difficulties experienced by our protection services to control the activities of the Spanish boats within our 50 mile limit, and to recognise how enormous the problem will be for them in an enlarged Community.  When negotiations are taking place on the transitional period the applicant countries may claim that they will be able to systematically fish in our waters.  That would be disastrous for our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>There has been no indication from either the summit or in the statements by the Minister in this House that there is any recognition at Government level of the seriousness of the situation, the damage that is likely to be done to the Irish industry and the way development in the industry will be halted and reversed in the enlarged Community if negotiations continue along the present lines. As the Minister said, these discussions did not start yesterday or even during the summit.  They have been going on since last summer.  In the original discussions it was anticipated that a transitional period of 20 years would be sought before the entry of Spain or Portugal.  In that 20 year transitional period efforts would be made by the Community to help the Spanish Government to restructure and rationalise their fleet because everybody agrees there are not the stocks to justify such a big fishing fleet.  If Spain did not reduce her fishing fleet it would pose a major threat to our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>As the discussions develop it has become obvious that there has been a weakening in our position.  Already the 20 year transitional period is being reduced to ten years, with a possible <Col N="1982" /> extension of a further five years, but there is a demand from the Spanish Government that there be no transitional period except for a phasing from year one, coming into the 12 mile limit, the six mile limit and, if necessary, the three mile limit.  This would spell ruin for the Irish fishing industry.  This move must be resisted.  There is no evidence so far that the Government are taking this seriously. At the summit issues, such as wine, which have no relevance to this country seem to have been given prominence rather than issues of vital national interest to Ireland which we, as President of the Council, should have been putting forward.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is left in a hopeless situation.  The framework agreement agreed by the Community in Spain, ratified and signed in 1980-81, sets out the systematic reduction of Spanish fishing off the Irish coast.  Now two years later Spanish fishing off our south west coast has been reduced by over 50 per cent.  In the discussions taking place now there is a complete reversal of that position, with concentrated efforts being made by the Spanish boats to come into our six mile limit and establish rights they claim they had under the London Conventions before the Community was established.  We are not satisfied, and neither are the fishing interests, that our fishing interests are being protected in the present negotiations.  We fear that the Irish fishing industry will not be able to expand in the future if negotiations continue along the present lines.</P>
    <P>Since we joined the Community our fish catches have increased enormously and this has helped to stabilise our industry and offered hope for the future. There is a genuine fear that the enlargement of the Community will put the Irish industry back ten to 15 years if negotiations continue along present lines.  We have seen strenuous objections to the Norwegian application for access to blue whiting in our north west waters.  I acknowledge that the present Minister for Fisheries fought against this application. We see a fairly valuable potential for supplies of blue whiting in the future. <Col N="1983" /> We must continue to strenuously oppose any efforts by the Norwegians or others to gain access to blue whiting and other stocks which might not have been traditionally fished here in the past.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the fishing industry knows that expansion in traditional areas of fish is limited.  Everyone admits that if our industry is to develop and expand we must get involved with the non-traditional quota species.  We had discussions about dogfish at Question Time today. The Norwegians are prepared to fight strenuously, even though they are outside the Community, to gain access to our blue whiting stocks because they can see the benefit of these stocks to their industry.  I acknowledge that the Minister fought the Norwegian attempt to gain access to our blue whiting stocks and he must continue to do that.  He must also continue to fight the pressures to reduce our mackerel quotas.  Mackerel is very important for the Irish industry and the mackerel export refund was abolished in January 1983.  We expected to see some positive results since then, but they have not materialised.  Our fishing industry lost up to £25 million or £30 million because of the abolition of that refund.  The Minister did all in his power to re-establish that export refund which was very important to our industry but he did not succeed.  I should like to bring home to the Minister the urgency of pressing ahead with the campaign which he undertook to have that export refund restored for the mackerel fishing industry and that he will continue to do that within the Community, especially now when that industry is so important for the development of our fishing industry here.</P>
    <P>All these areas are very important for the future development of the Community. We do not feel that the interests of the Irish industry are being protected. Fish which could be processed and developed here is being dumped.  It is intolerable that we go abroad seeking outlets for fish and fish products and at the same time we are importing huge amounts of fish which could be processed here.  There <Col N="1984" /> is a crying need for investment in processing industries.  There is also a need for investment, through European funds, of more money into the development of the processing industry so that we can not only catch the fish here under the policies laid down by the Community but that we can also develop them into primary and secondary processing plants in order to provide jobs as well as having the value of the catch.</P>
    <P>The cheapest varieties of fish are being imported at enormous prices while our fish is being dumped.  The market here in relation to fish is totally unexploited in so far as job creation and revenue for the State are concerned.  When are we going to do something through the institutions of the Community for the development of processing in this vital area, because the fishing industry has a very big impact in regional areas and in smaller coastal regions?  This has been recognised not only by the Community but by the Canadians and others.  There must be investment in coastal areas and the way to do that is by basing it on the materials which are available.  It makes common sense to do this by basing it on our own resources, by processing our fish and feeding ourselves with that fish rather than exporting it and reimporting it when it has been processed abroad.  In that case the benefits and jobs accrue abroad and we are the losers.  It is a crazy system which must be tackled with the help of the Community.</P>
    <P>People here are losing interest in the Community because it does not have relevance to their needs.  We should be able to turn this around if we take the initiatives which are needed and if we can build into the Common Fisheries Policy agreement policies in relation to the creation and exploitation of our own industrial projects.  This would provide jobs and revenue for the State and it makes sense.</P>
    <P>To get away from fisheries, I noticed recently in some press cuttings that huge amounts of funds were available from the Regional Fund for the development of industry in the United Kingdom.  I drew this to the attention of the Minister for <Col N="1985" /> Finance because we seem to have lost out in relation to the funds which are available.  The British Government have also given large sums to the textile industry.  This was done through the EC, although I understood that there would be no assistance for that measure.  Nevertheless, the British Government secured large sums from the Regional Fund to aid the textile industry.  Our textile industry is in chaos.  A few days ago in my constituency we had the closure of one of the major textile firms, the Burlington industry in Clonlara, with a loss of 250 jobs.  The textile industry could be saved if there was investment in new plants, new machinery and new equipment. They could then make a profit and jobs could be saved.</P>
    <P>I thought that the Community would not fund industries in the textile area because of the Community policy which laid down that funds were not available for investment in that area.  The British Government and the British Minister for Industry can announce substantial funding in that area which will protect jobs in the textile business in the United Kingdom. We should be entitled to the same facility for our textile industry to ensure that there are no more closures.  I am aware that some work has already been done in relation to changes in the way in which funds can be got from the European Regional Fund, especially in the non-quota section, but we must get substantial aid for our textile industry to stave off job losses.</P>
    <P>We have also seen the closure of the ship and boatbuilding industries here.  At the same time the British Government under the same Regional Fund recently announced substantial funding from that fund for the British shipbuilding business. Hardly a day goes by here without a closure of a boatbuilding yard but we were told it is Community policy not to grant-aid or assist projects in the shipbuilding area.  How then can the British Government benefit in this area?  Millions of pounds have been given from the Regional Fund to build up industries in the Six Counties.  These are very welcome but we should also benefit.  It is time that <Col N="1986" /> the Regional Fund was looked at very closely by the Government and by the Dáil to see if any changes can be brought about to make it more relevant to our needs and to deal with some of the problems which we are experiencing in some very important areas.</P>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly to a point which was made by Deputy Allen.  I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments he expressed in relation to efforts in the Community to control and eliminate pollution in so far as it is possible to do so.  I am particularly concerned about the discharge of sulphur dioxide and the effect of discharges which will be emitted from the Moneypoint station.  I was amazed to read recently in one of the newspapers that emissions from Moneypoint were damaging the environment in the south-west.  The writer obviously does not know that the station has not yet been completed.  Chimneys have not emitted any effluent at this stage but there is a real possibility that when the station is operational, probably in mid-1985, there will be a threat to the environment from the discharges from the chimneys at Moneypoint.  This can be rectified now if the equipment for the control of emissions is installed in the station.</P>
    <P>The Moneypoint station is a huge generating station by any comparison one cares to make even in Europe.  It will generate an enormous supply of electricity but it will also create a serious environmental problem unless care is taken and the necessary equipment installed to control emissions from it.  I am aware that grants are available from European funds for this purpose.  However, I am not certain that the Department of Energy have recognised the threat that will exist and have not availed of the money from Community funds to install this highly sophisticated equipment.  I ask the Minister for Energy to use those Community funds to make sure that the necessary equipment is installed.  If the station is allowed to go into production and to have these discharges it will be too late to tackle the problem.  The time to deal with the problem that will arise in the future at Moneypoint is now before the station goes into <Col N="1987" /> production.  I know that the Minister visited the site recently and he is aware of the urgency that is needed to deal with the matter now.  The funds are available to do the job if the will is there at departmental level.</P>
    <P>This report is useful in that it gives us an opportunity to debate some of the matters that have caused us concern.  In the future development of the Community it is essential that we make our voices heard in relation to our specific demands. While we can look favourably at the development of an enlarged Community there are also threatening signs that that enlarged Community may damage certain sectors here and we have an obligation in the negotiations to ensure that our vital interests are protected.  I am not satisfied that has been done up to now.  I am not satisfied that the proper negotiating stance has been taken in relation to fisheries.  I am not satisfied that there is any advantage for the Irish fishing industry from the kind of enlarged Community we will have, especially if the demands that are being sought by people who are not members of the Community are met or if our position is weakened any further in the negotiations that are taking place at the moment.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate is an indication that we will have further debates on this topic of Community involvement in our affairs. I should like this House to be given an early opportunity to debate the question of enlargement of the Community and the effects that will have not only on the fishing industry but on the development of our economy in future years.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy McCartin starts his contribution I wish to inform the House that the Minister for Justice has been given permission to make a short statement at 4.45 p.m. The Deputy's contribution may be completed at 5 p.m. but I ask him to be prepared to be interrupted at 4.45 p.m.</P>

      <P>Apart from statements by the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition no meaningful debates on the <Col N="1988" /> European Community are held in this House except in relation to reports such as the one we are discussing now.  However, these reports deal with matters that are over and done with.  We do not have an opportunity to debate future developments in the Community and this was pointed out by the previous speaker. When we discuss the EC we seem to do it at a time when the House has not a full programme, at a time when most people have gone away and when the journalists are bored with the number of subjects that have been discussed during the week.  That is when the European Community is discussed in this House and then we take the opportunity to grumble and grouse about what has happened in the Community, especially if it has not been sufficiently charitable from our point of view.</P>
      <P>In the debate today one speaker discussed Nicaragua which is relevant in a sense.  Other speakers attacked the decisions taken regarding the entry of Spain and Portugal and they grumbled about the risks to our economy.  Mention was made of milk and the failure to produce the right figures last year.  We should be more constructive in our attitude and we should discuss the developments we want in the Community.</P>
      <P>With regard to the summit, the chief Opposition spokesman for this subject lashed the Government regarding unemployment which he said was not discussed at the summit meeting.  It was really a complaint that the participants in the summit did not push the employment button and get out the jobs.  Everything that was discussed at the summit has a bearing on employment.  The whole process of working towards greater cooperation in Europe is geared towards the objective of having a more successful economy is western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some speakers have blamed the Taoiseach but I think this has been a good week for him.  With respect to the previous speaker, the EC have not the power to keep out Spain and Portugal.  The Treaty of Rome does not give any country the right to veto.  That Treaty opens the Community to all countries that accept <Col N="1989" /> democracy and the rule of law within the Community as it is laid down.  We can negotiate with Spain and Portugal about the terms under which we will pursue various economic policies when they enter but we do not have the power to keep them out.  The Treaty of Rome is very explicit on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was extremely successful in working out a solution to the problems.  Until the present members agreed on a common approach it was not possible to proceed towards the final phase of the discussions for the entry of Spain and Portugal but we have got the kind of agreement we needed.</P>
      <P>Wine may be irrelevant to the west of Ireland.  It is irrelevant to the people in my constituency but it is not irrelevant to millions of people in the Mediterranean region, in France, Italy and also in Germany and Luxembourg.  We should not dismiss difficulties regarding wine any more than we would like to see people in the Mediterranean region dismiss difficulties regarding milk and dairy products. It is very unfair of us to be dismissive of that problem.  The Taoiseach did a great job in bringing together those conflicting interests and at arriving at a point where the present Ten could agree to admit two other nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome their comments.  The continent of Europe is a comparatively small area and even with the newly enlarged Community it is right to reflect that with the way the world population is increasing, at the end of this decade the European population will be less than 5 per cent of the world population.  We have new and fragile democracies looking to their neighbours in the more developed part of Europe for assistance and membership of the Community.  They hope that this will consolidate the democracies and give them the opportunity to enjoy more prosperity.  It is a victory for us all that the Ten have sat down and agreed on <Col N="1990" /> the terms under which their entry can be negotiated.</P>
    <P>There was a bad turnout here for the European elections in June.  There is a lot of talk about the cynicism of the Irish, their disappointment and their disillusionment. If they are disillusioned about what has happened in the Community, the people who have failed to inform the Irish public on the work of the Community are more or less to blame.  The public were probably led to believe that the new European Parliament would have vast resources and introduce all sorts of legislation, bringing direct benefits steaming home across the Channel to the Irish people.  That point of view was put around by some people.  It is a great misconception that the new Parliament would have seriously increased powers compared with the old nominated or non-elected Parliament.</P>
    <P>Recently, when we discussed the budget at European level it was clear that people do not realise generally how that budget is estimated any more than it is known how we in this House estimate and vote moneys under the various headings to finance all our policies.  They do not understand what happens in Europe. It would be difficult for them to do so.  A claim was made that one member of the recently elected Parliament had succeeded in proposing and having passed an amendment which brought Irish agriculture 1,000 million ECUs.  Anybody who understands anything at all about the process by which the budget is decided in the European Parliament knows there are two distinct areas.  One is compulsory spending, which is the whole area of agriculture &mdash; everything that we are obliged to finance or subsidise under the treaty. Parliament does not have any say there. As far as the whole agricultural area is concerned, apart from structural aids, when prices are fixed the level of spending is decided upon.  That has not yet been done.</P>
    <P>The total margin which the Parliament have to work on in this year is estimated by the Commission, and the Parliament are obliged to work within that margin. There was a serious dispute this year <Col N="1991" /> about that margin but the maximum that Parliament could argue that they had to decide on was 400 hundred million ECUs.  The Council of Ministers thought it was 280 hundred million ECUs.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point that the public have not been well informed.  People making dishonest statements of this sort are guilty of spreading the disillusionment which caused some people not to vote in the last European elections.  It is hardly worth my while, in the time left, starting to develop a number of points which I wanted to develop.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has asked me to give the Minister for Justice an opportunity to make a statement and it is almost time. We will return to this subject at another time.  I briefly refer to a matter raised by Deputy Daly about the Regional Fund, having read in the papers that money was being provided for a shipyard.

      <P>I was making reference to the subject of the European Regional Fund.  We get the quota which is allocated to us.  There has been a new development in the whole area of the Regional Fund, a very welcome development, but we have some very serious thinking to do here in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we became a member of the Community and since the Regional Fund first came into existence and Ireland was designated as one entire region with economic difficulties, the money has been paid to the Irish Government. Under the terms of reference laid down by the Community, the Government were free to spend the money as they chose on various projects.  The Government did this.  It was direct spending from the Department of Finance allocated under various headings, for example, arterial roads, harbours, the development of our infrastructures, telephones, industrial projects.  I understand that the Naas bypass and the Alcan project in Limerick also were aided from the Regional Development Fund.  We got a specific amount of money and spent it as we saw fit.  There was no more available and had we chosen to spend this money in another way, for instance, to allocate it around the various local authorities, allowing them to submit their various projects, then at national level we would have to replace by some other means, the other grants which we paid.  It would not have added anything to the amount of public spending here.  In the area of the Regional Fund we were particularly good at getting all the money available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there was the question of the British refund.  The European Parliament objected to the system by which the Council of Minister agreed to pay direct refunds to Britain.  Parliament contended <Col N="1994" /> that this was Community money and it must be spent under schemes and directives of the European Community. Therefore Britain had a certain amount of spending which that country claimed was a spending of their own national exchequer, but which the Community will say were grants given to them by the Community under the terms of agreement arrived at.  This creates a false impression that Britain was getting more than her share.  We accept that she was getting a little more than her share, but what she was getting were refunds negotiated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the one that you are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot hear the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy said.  There are some areas where we can claim not to have exploited all the resources available from the Community. Many grants were applied for under FEOGA but for one reason or another the promoters were not able to raise the necessary capital.  The projects were uneconomic and the money which was allocated was never spent.  Sometimes that creates a bad impression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking all these things into consideration the recent report from the Central Bank indicates we had a net benefit of something like £640 million cash flow from the Community last year.  That is a considerable amount of money.  It is very hard to understand why people are disillusioned when we consider the importance of that amount of money in an economy like ours.  At least £400 million of that was aid under the guarantee and guidance section of FEOGA.  The total income in Irish agriculture last year was estimated to be around £900 million.  The direct transfer of money from Europe was almost equal to half the total income of Irish farmers.  It could be argued that if that money was taken away farmers' <Col N="1995" /> incomes would drop by half.  It is strange to hear people shouting about disillusionment when we consider the amount of money involved, and many people in Europe are themselves disillusioned when that kind of attitude is adopted.</P>
    <P>It is not just the question of direct cash transfers which we should study when discussing developments in the Community. I appreciate the concern of Irish fishermen.  Spain has a fleet equivalent to 70 per cent of the entire Community fleet. We must recognise that their fleet has been built up over the years and that they have been fishing; otherwise they could not have developed this size of fleet. Before we became a member of the Community and before we had a common fisheries policy we should consider what our fishing industry was like.  We had a small inshore badly equipped fleet.  The EC gave us assistance with which to catch fish.  We have now developed a medium distance fleet.  It has been developed with State assistance and considerable European assistance.  We have been assisted by way of FEOGA grants and now can freeze and partly process the fish.  At present we catch £40 million worth of fish and export £72 million of frozen and further processed fish and employ 1,700 people.  The size of the industry, the extent to which it has grown and given incomes to the people involved in it can be attributed to the development of the Common Fisheries Policy.  We could not catch, process, preserve or protect the fish before we joined the Community. That is the truth of the matter.</P>
    <P>If we are less than satisfied with the way things are now and how they will develop in the future, we should remember that we are considerably better off in a Community with Spain as a member.  It might be a little easier to police the Spanish fleet when they are within the Community. We will have it within our capacity to impose sanctions and demand observance of the rules.  I recognise, and we all know, that even within the Community there have been instances where the fleets of nations within the Community have not observed the letter of the <Col N="1996" /> law.  However, we will never know what the Spaniards are catching or landing until they become a member of the Community and until we have our inspectors on their boats and in their ports.  If the Spaniards make agreements with us, we will have the power to enforce them and to impose sanctions if the agreements are broken.  The experience within the Community is that rules are generally observed if slowly, and we have not known any state to openly defy the authority of the Community or decisions made by the court.</P>
    <P>We can make too much of the fears and concerns of people and we can excite fears and concerns which are not realistic. It is just like exporting cattle to Libya. We are glad to export cattle to these regions or to any other middle eastern or third country.  It is good to have those markets.  Very often we fail to tell people what the Libyans are paying for cattle and how much of the money that Irish farmers get comes in the form of export refunds from the EC.  That is another benefit which is generally forgotten in the euphoric moments when we are clapping hands and making deals, deals which could never be made if it were not for the assistance of the export refunds we get from the Community.</P>
    <P>The question of world hunger was raised.  It is unfortunate that a by-product of this discussion has been the criticism levelled at the EC for its failure to rush in and resolve this problem.  I spoke about this before but it was not well heard. What was heard was the criticism of the Community.  The Community is not something out there: we are the Community. The criticism levelled against the Community was that it was a monster with barns full of food which it refused to share with hungry and dying people. The truth is the EC does not have food. It does not have within its control all the millions of tonnes of dried milk, butter and grain.  All this food has been bought and is held by the intervention agencies. Those agencies hold the food and the Community pays only the financial and storage charges.  The Community does not have the resources immediately to <Col N="1997" /> hand to buy all this food.  If the Community was to distribute this it would have to pay Irish farmers or intervention agencies the full intervention price for these products. That would necessitate having a new supplementary budget at a time when we were in the process of finalising an already difficult supplementary budget. This was not possible.</P>
    <P>The EC is more generous in the assistance it gives to the Third World than any other part of the world.  Of the £35 billion given annually in such aid throughout the world, Europe gives something like 14 per cent.  Total assistance from the EC is more than that of the US, Soviet Russia and the Eastern bloc countries combined. <i>Per capita</i> only the OPEC countries, which are in an enviable position in that they have a ready cash income, are giving more than the EC.  We have been congratulating ourselves recently on the fact that we give more per head of population than any other country in the world.  That is not correct.  What we are talking about is that we have raised more per head of population by voluntary means in the last few months.  That is an entirely different thing.  We give .2 of 1 per cent of GNP, which is considerably below the amount recommended by the United Nations. Only the Dutch give a figure equal to that which is recommended by the UN.  We have a long way to go.  Somebody said in this House that we have aroused the conscience of the EC.  I think that our first business is with our own conscience and not with that of other peoples or nations in the EC.  When we are at the 0.7 of 1 per cent recommended by the UN we can say that we are out in front of everybody else, we have been more generous, we have met our obligations in full.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern has been given permission to raise <Col N="1998" /> on the Adjournment the subject matter of a Private Notice Question which he submitted today to the Minister for Finance but which did not qualify as a Private Notice Question.  I ask him please to read the question by way of introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if, in view of the strike by members of the Irish Customs and Excise Union due to commence at midnight and the grave financial, economic and social consequences for the country which such a strike will have, he will state the steps he proposes to take to prevent the strike; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing this question. I know that you have been very much tried during the course of the week and you were very helpful in allowing Deputy Gallagher and me to raise this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that this is a serious strike and I have not brought him back here from his Department at 5 p.m. to create any unnecessary row.  This strike is partly the concern of his Department but mainly of the Department of the Public Service.  At midnight tonight 700 of the officers involved at airports, the land frontier, as it is called, and the various ports will leave their duty posts and will not be replaced.  While a tiny number of other people are involved, it has been made quite clear on an unofficial basis what might be said on an official basis, that these people will not be in a position to do any of the duties done by these 700 people from midnight.  I will be glad if I am not told anything else because that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda have made it quite clear that they have not the resources to take up any of this work.  They are involved in security and will not be involved in this. Therefore, the position arises that for 24 hours at least all the points of entry into the State will be totally clear for people to bring in whatever they like without documentation.  Not only will it cause major problems tomorrow but it will <Col N="1999" /> cause major problems for trade, industry and the economy.  The Minister recently tried to regulate in an effort to control the amount of goods coming into the country and to change the limits.  I agree with the proposals he made then, but that work will be totally negatived from midnight.  It is commonly known in this city, in the northern constituencies, in your own constituency, Sir, in Deputy Gallagher's constituency and by all my colleagues that a huge shipment is ready to be organised into the Twenty-six Counties from midnight.  We have received enough information on this to keep me here night and day considering what is going to happen, which the Minister will know far better than I through his Department officials.</P>
    <P>This strike is mainly about four very minor things.  A document No. E105/2/80 dated 5 July 1982 with circular 11/82 covered travelling and subsistence regulations for the members of the Customs and Excise Officers Association.  This issue has been going on for two-and-a-half years and last Monday letters surfaced relating to some of the matters raised by the officers.  I do not believe that they will want a strike and even at this stage the Minister for Finance in conjunction with the Minister for the Public Service could easily avert this strike.</P>
    <P>The matters at stake are very minor. There are two questions of definition, of where a home is for an individual &mdash; which I am sure is not too difficult to define &mdash; and where an individual's headquarters are.  Those matters do not seem to be the reason for tonight's proposed strike.  They can be negotiated and agreed quite easily, and I got that assurance from senior members of the association today. The third point is about payments of daily rates for subsistence and temporary transfer which again I do not believe is a reason for the strike.  The fourth is the motor mileage rate and I believe that is the reason for the strike.  The issue of this strike is fairly simple.  It has seemed complicated in latter days, but the point is that a relief officer who is daily at a <Col N="2000" /> particular station if moved to go temporarily to another station under 15 miles away, at present will receive half the rate set out in the 1982 document which is half the Civil Service subsistence and travel rate &mdash; we are talking about travel rate. If a relief officer goes to work tomorrow morning and is told that he is not in his present location, and has to go to a different location under 15 miles away, he will get half the Civil Service rate.  If on the following day he was to get an instruction to go to your house, a Cheann Comhairle, about some matter, he would get the full rate although that house might be only a very short distance from the headquarters.  The issue of this strike is that they are demanding the full rate whether they go to your house to check a query or to their base.</P>
    <P>Fewer than 20 staff are concerned.  It cannot be costly.  If it was a matter of cost that might present a strong argument, but the officers some time ago, to put pressure to finalise the decision, decided that they would not use their own transport, they would use taxies.  Now when a relief officer is sent from his normal post to another post he gets a taxi instead of the mileage rate.  The taxi fare is far dearer.  Therefore, far from this being an increase on the Exchequer, the Revenue Commissioners' bills for mileage, probably would be a decrease.</P>
    <P>The consequences of tomorrow's strike the Minister knows only too well.  It will be used as an occasion for smugglers to bring in large quantities of whatever they wish.  Householders perhaps will bring in a certain amount but I am not too sure that the abuses in that are major and they are often exaggerated.  The big smugglers, apart from smugglers of drugs, a very serious matter, will have almost a free day.  That has been accepted and yesterday the commissioners accepted that customs posts along the Border would be left unmanned.  That is extremely serious and it is publicised in the front pages of this morning's newspapers. Therefore, I am not scaremongering.  The Garda accept that this is the position. Responsible officers of the Irish Customs and Excise Union accept that that is the <Col N="2001" /> position.  I talked to a number of their officers today and I know that they would like to see this strike deferred because they realise that it is not in the interest of the State to allow it to go ahead.  They have seen the movements today of certain people with trucks, individuals who they know are involved in smuggling in a large way.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister who still has five or six hours in which he, his officials, the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Labour can act quite easily.  I do not think any great matters of principle or great amendments of regulations would be involved.  It all comes down to the definition of what official business is and how that is interpreted in the document.  While it may be suitable for some official involved in this directly to have to stand his ground, I am sure that the Minister or some of his senior officials at this stage could arbitrate easily and divert quickly a potentially serious strike.  I ask the Minister to endeavour in the interest of trade and of the State to avert this strike and the problems that will go on long after tomorrow if it takes place.  There is a possibility that it could continue after tomorrow.  If that is so, in future when customs officers question people about their possessions they will be told: &ldquo;We brought that in on 7 December and it was legal&rdquo;.  This could have all types of consequences.  Now we are asking the Minister to spend these few valuable hours in an attempt to avert this strike.  If this matter had been raised on Tuesday we would have asked him to do so then.  Now time is running out.  This strike would not be difficult to avert as some strikes would be.  In the interest of all concerned I ask the Minister for Finance to take action over the next few hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take the opportunity to impress on the Minister the disastrous effects, as Deputy Ahern has pointed out, which this pending strike will have.  It is to be hoped that the Minister for Finance, or, more appropriately the Minister for the Public Service will take action this evening before it is too <Col N="2002" /> late to try to avert this strike.  I have tried to raise this matter on a number of occasions this week because, coming from a Border county I am aware &mdash; as I am sure the Minister is &mdash; of the disastrous consequences of a strike such as this.  I do not believe that there will be any winners or losers if this strike takes place.  The commitment entered into in 1982 was concluded for the public service generally in relation to travel and subsistence and it included the members of the Irish Customs and Excise Union.  Now these people who are temporarily movable, being relief officers in areas, are entitled to and were being paid prior to March 1983 approximately 50 per cent of the rate paid to civil servants.  Therefore the Department of the Public Service feel that these people should be paid, but not as much as was agreed in 1982.</P>
      <P>The officers decided then to take taxis. While the mileage rate for civil servants was in the region of 40p to 45p these people up to the end of March were being paid in the region of 22p to 24p.  Since it is necessary for a taxi to do a double run, the cost to the State is 80p to 90p. Common business sense suggests that we should revert to the system that prevailed. We are talking about only 20 people.  The negotiations have been taking place during the past two-and-a-half years.  The Customs and Excise Union are not looking for anything in addition to what they are entitled to.  At least that is my understanding.  However, we cannot allow this strike to begin because it would have a disastrous effect on the Border counties particularly but also on the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be searching in the coming weeks for millions of pounds in relation to his budget but by resolving this dispute this evening he can immediately save millions of pounds.  The amount of money that would be lost as a result of this proposed strike would be incalculable. The strike would be the first by the customs and excise officers since the foundation of the State.  It could result in there being no mobile patrols and no surveillance along the Border.  What is particularly of concern is the loss that <Col N="2003" /> would be suffered by people in the Border areas.  Only today I have spoken to a number of people in this city who are prepared to go to the Six Counties tomorrow.</P>
    <P>An answer such as the one issued by the Civil Service yesterday does not make sense because if the strike begins there will be freedom of movement and if gardaí are to be taken from their ordinary duties to deal with the illegal importation of goods from the North, we may suffer in other ways.  However, if there should be no repercussions as a result of the strike, one must ask the ridiculous question whether the 700 customs officials are necessary.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that such items as video recorders and television sets can be purchased much cheaper in Northern Ireland than is the case in this State. Tomorrow will present an ideal opportunity for anyone to purchase either of these commodities or any other electrical goods because there will be no officials at the frontier posts.  In this matter we must distinguish between the frontier posts and the road stations.  For up to three years afterwards customs officials could visit any house in the State and ask when certain goods were imported.  If the person being questioned were to give the date as 7 December 1984, there would be a great obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to prove that the goods were taken in illegally.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear what powers the Garda will have tomorrow to prevent people from bringing in goods illegally.  I would be concerned particularly about the importation of drugs especially into my own county.  I regret to have to say that I am receiving reports daily from constituents about the availability of drugs in the county.  Obviously, these drugs are being imported through the various ports or airports or across the Border.  The strike that is due to start tomorrow would afford an opportunity to those involved in drug smuggling to bring drugs into the State.</P>
    <P>If the Minister tells us this evening that he is prepared within the next few hours <Col N="2004" /> to meet senior officials of the union to discuss the issue with them, he will have nothing to lose but will stand to save millions of pounds.  I shall be writing to the Minister later about the electrical trade but suffice it for the moment to say that in the past couple of years about 2,000 jobs have been lost in that sector. If the strike goes ahead there are likely to be another 2,000 lost.</P>
    <P>We are confident that the Minister is anxious to ensure that the Border posts are manned tomorrow.  There is time left in that respect.  We have given the Minister every opportunity in the past few days and we plead with him now to meet those people this evening with a view to coming to some definite arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern shown by both Deputies in raising this matter this evening though &mdash; I trust the Deputies will understand this &mdash; it seems to me that their action represents a very good way of encouraging people to bring in drugs, for example.  I say this because the Deputies have emphasised the opportunity that will be presented tomorrow to people of that intent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputies could have been a little less lurid and a little more constructive in expressing their concern.</P>
      <P>We are talking about an industrial relations matter.  It is not my intention to become involved across the floor of the House in the kind of discussion that ought to take place between the union representatives and the Revenue except to make the point that the 50 per cent mileage rate to which the Deputies have referred does not apply only to the officers in question.  It has general application throughout the Civil Service with one area of exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies have outlined, the Customs and Excise Union have threatened a one day stoppage for tomorrow. <Col N="2005" /> They are in dispute with the Revenue Commissioners on the one issue of the motor mileage rates though, as I have pointed out, the rate in question applies generally in the Civil Service in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ahern mentioned, there were a number of other items in contention. Three of these other areas of disagreement were resolved but it has not proved possible to reach a conclusion on this one point.  I regret very much that the union have decided to take industrial action on an issue such as this.  The consequences of their action would be that the regular staff would not be available to man customs posts.  I do not envisage any significant disruption of the import or export of freight though there may be some minor delays at some posts. Arrangements are being made to ensure that the strike situation cannot be exploited by persons who would decide to break the customs regulations.  I do not intend going into the details of those arrangements because such an exercise would be neither wise nor useful at this point.  I would not wish to prejudice the effectiveness of such measures.  The Garda are fully aware of the situation.  I am concerned to ensure that the Garda authorities will have a proper presence.</P>

      <P>No agreement between Limerick Gas Company and BGE has been submitted for my approval.  The supply of natural gas by BGE to Limerick is still under discussion.  I am anxious that a satisfactory outcome to the discussions should be achieved so that a decision can be taken on this project shortly.  The time-scale for pipeline construction and the arrangements for the distribution of natural gas within Limerick city are dependent on the outcome of these discussions. A potential route for piping natural gas to Limerick has been identified by Bord Gáis Éireann but I consider that it would be premature to publish details of the proposed route at this stage.</P>

In calculating this amount the deciding officer took into consider ation the gross yearly value of the farm at £4,887.87 less expenses amounting to £2,262.23 incurred in earning that income leaving a net profit of £2,600.  On a weighted basis the applicant, his wife and four qualified children were deemed to enjoy three-quarters of the net income <Col N="1965" /> namely £1,950 per annum or £37.50 weekly.</P>

      <P>The double payment will also be made to recipients of the following health allowances:&mdash;disabled persons' maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance, blind welfare allowance and domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children.  These are the same categories who benefited from the Christmas double payment in the last four years 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983.  In all, some 414,000 persons will benefit from the extra payment at a cost to the Exchequer of some £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The double payment is being made at post offices this week.  Old age, blind and widows' and orphans' pensions will be paid on Friday 7 December, the other categories on Thursday 6 December.  The amount of the extra payment will be equal to the face value of the weekly pension or allowance order and will <Col N="1966" /> include all increases in respect of adult and child dependants and any supplements such as the living alone allowance which form part of the regular weekly payment.  For example, an old age contributory pensioner with an adult dependant will receive an extra £78.05.  Certain long term recipients of occupational injury benefit by way of pension are being paid by cheque monthly in advance and these are being issued with cheques at the equivalent of five weeks payment instead of four.  Persons receiving health allowance payments will be paid the extra amounts by the health boards.</P>

      <P>Availability for work is a condition of entitlement to unemployment benefit and to fulfil this condition the claimant must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 10 October 1984 and her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for work.  She appealed against the disallowance and her case has been referred to an appeals officer for determination.  An oral hearing of her appeal has been arranged to take place next week.  Her entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>

The position in that regard as far as the prisons, St. Patricks and other places managed by the Department of Justice are concerned, is that nobody under 17 is serving a sentence in accordance with those sections.</P>
