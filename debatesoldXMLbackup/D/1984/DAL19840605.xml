    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if in view of the very serious unemployment problem in Dundalk he will declare it an unemployment black spot; and if he will ask the IDA to take urgent action to secure new industries for the town.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if the IDA have an action plan to promote small industries in Dundalk as part of their overall promotion of the town as an industrial base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the serious unemployment situation in Dundalk and am assured that the Industrial Development Authority are making every effort to attract new industries to the town and to assist existing companies to strengthen their operations.</P>
      <P>The IDA have an advance factory of 46,500 sq. ft., a privately financed factory of 42,000 sq. ft. and 90 acres of land available for further industrial development in the town.  In addition, the IDA have provided a total of ten small industry factory units in Dundalk, seven of which are now occupied.</P>
      <P>The IDA have appointed a small industry specialist to their north-east regional office to encourage the development of small industries in the region.</P>
      <P>Later this year the IDA will hold a small industry promotional compaign in the town to encourage local people to set up new small industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there has been a 22 per cent increase in the number unemployed in the town of Dundalk <Col N="19" /> in the last 12 months, could the Minister be more specific and tell us what measures the IDA and the Department have taken to secure industries from abroad to invest in the town?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows from his experience &mdash; if he does not Deputy Faulkner will tell him &mdash; that there has been a very serious decline in the amount of available international investment.  The experience in the countries we are competing with is that there is a diminishing pool of such investment. While I will do everything in my power to encourage foreign investment to come to Dundalk and recognise the seriousness of the problem in that town, I do not think one should look to foreign investment as the solution to the problem of unemployment in Dundalk.  It is for that reason that I have actively encouraged the IDA to have a specialist in the north-east regional office looking for small industry opportunities particularly in Dundalk.  That is what the IDA are doing.  For the same reason, a small industries promotional campaign will be launched in the town later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's intention to promote small industries locally.  Everyone will agree that there is great necessity to do so and encourage entrepreneurs to put their expertise to work for themselves and for the good of the nation.  However, I impress on the Minister the serious situation that exists in Dundalk.  It is a centre towards which people have tended to gravitate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the subject matter of the next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that Dundalk has not attracted an equitable share of industry over the last 20 years because of its geographical location? Does he accept that Dundalk is not a high priority area and compares very badly with the priority given to Cork and Galway?  Does he believe that the creation of a task force for the Border region would be beneficial to the industrial situation in Dundalk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy was here last day he will remember I was not very sympathetic to the idea which seeks to <Col N="21" /> better one part of the country at the expense of another.  I do not think that is a productive way to approach this problem. However, the facts are that the rate of increase in unemployment in Dundalk has been significantly above the national average.  There are many places about which I will be asked questions later today where that is not the case.  I am also aware that the Deputy has invited me to visit Dundalk to see the problem for myself and I have accepted that invitation. I am very concerned about the problem of unemployment in Dundalk in particular, which is a Border area whose problems are aggravated by that fact. Further, there is a special problem which we need to reassess as far as the regional policy aspects of industrial development are concerned in regard to towns like Dundalk which have a relatively long industrial history.  They seem to be worse hit by unemployment than the newly developing areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that no town in this country has suffered as grievously from the Ulster troubles&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is relevant. There is a special case to be made for Dundalk and its needs because unemployment is very high in this town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any point in getting into an argument about whether Dundalk has suffered more than Clones, Monaghan town or any other Border town.  I have accepted that there is a serious problem in Dundalk, and that is as far as any Deputy can expect me to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister direct the IDA to concentrate their efforts in Dundalk and if after a certain period those efforts are not bearing fruit, will he declare Dundalk a disadvantaged area and increase the percentage grants available for industrial promotion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The IDA are already concentrating their efforts in the Dundalk area.  I have already indicated in reply to the Deputy's original question two special measures that have been adopted for Dundalk which are not being adopted elsewhere.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if the IDA have as part of their industrial promotion of Dundalk identified the particular industries which will benefit most from natural gas being available to them; and if so, the industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if his Department will identify the type of industry which will benefit most from natural gas being made available in Ardee, County Louth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The industries most likely to be attracted by the availability of natural gas are those premium users for whom gas is an advantage in the production process, for example, chemicals, glassmaking, pottery and foods.  However, as natural gas is widely available throughout Europe its incentive value in its own right is limited.</P>
      <P>It is considered that the demand for natural gas, were it to become available, for existing industries in Dundalk and Ardee would be determined largely by the cost competitiveness of gas <i>vis-à-vis</i> other fuels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the long-established industries in Dundalk be in a position to benefit from the availability of natural gas?  If we are to accept at face value the Minister's reply, does this not bring into question the economics of the gas line being brought so far in the first place? Was it not part and parcel of the overall <Col N="23" /> benefits of the natural gas pipeline that industrial promotion would get the necessary shot in the arm, in addition to the primary producing areas in the economy like horticulture which will stand to gain very considerably from gas in terms of jobs created, import substitution and so on, provided the gas is made available at a proper price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows the pricing of natural gas to individual users is a matter for An Bord Gáis and their general policy is a matter for the Minister for Energy, not the Minister for Industry.  However, it is intended that provision will be made in the design of the northern pipeline for possible offtake to centres located in proximity to the line, such as Dundalk.  Any decision to supply a particular industry will be dependent on the technical and financial feasibility of the project.  Clearly An Bord Gáis have to more than cover their costs in any extensions of supply.  It is my hope, having been involved with others in bringing the supply of gas to Northern Ireland to a happy conclusion, that it will prove of benefit to areas such as Dundalk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Locally the people who would be interested in the availability of gas feel an effort should be made to co-ordinate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the various survey works in relation to natural gas.  In view of the fact that industrial promotion is a key element, would the IDA become involved in this, in addition to those involved in supplying gas, those involved in horticulture and so on, to avoid the possibility of unnecessary duplication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to hear what the Deputy has to say, but I am not aware of there being a problem in this regard.  However, I will ask the IDA to enter into discussion with An Bord Gáis to see if anything needs to be done at this stage.  We are at a relatively preliminary <Col N="24" /> stage in this process and it is possible that any intense activity that might be undertaken now would be premature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that while there is no particular industry in Dundalk at the moment which would benefit from natural gas, Premier Periclase in Drogheda would definately benefit and it is vital that we get natural gas as soon as possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will indicate any plans he has for the provision of industry in the Leixlip-Celbridge area of County Kildare which might have the effect of ensuring continued employment in an area with a rapidly expanding population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1982, the Industrial Development Authority agreed to purchase 50 acres of land at Lexilip for future industrial development.  However, as a result of an appeal by local objectors, planning permission was not secured for <Col N="27" /> the development and the purchase could not be completed.</P>
      <P>The IDA continue to promote the north Kildare area for small industry development.  They have completed negotiations recently with a new small industry which intends to establish in the former Ardagh Traders factory in Celbridge to manufacture industrial boilers and grate stokers.  This project is expected to commence production in the near future.</P>
      <P>Telemechanique Electrique who are now well established in Celbridge are also providing very substantial employment in the area, as are Irish Meat Packers who are based in Leixlip.</P>
      <P>In Kilcock, Leaf Ireland recently announced plans for an expansion which will lead to additional jobs over the next two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate what steps are likely to be taken by the IDA in relation to pursuing the possibility of acquiring an industrial site or a site for an industrial estate in the Leixlip area, having regard to the increasing population which is at present 12,000.  There is a considerable number unemployed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the problem. However, the IDA recently made serious efforts to buy land there and met with objections.  I should imagine that if they were to proceed in, not having bought the land, a costly process, they would want better assurance that they would not find themselves again before the Planning Appeals Board.  Probably their best first step would be to have discussions with Kildare County Council on the matter.  It might be useful if the Deputy would consider raising the matter with the county council to see if the county development team could enter into discussions with the IDA to arrive at a mutual arrangement for the acquisition of land which would not have the difficulties which the existing 50-acre site has had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I mention, first, <Col N="28" /> that the county development team are concerned about the situation.  The difficulty at present is that industrialists seeking a site cannot have such a site provided for them in the Leixlip area. Might the Minister, in turn, pursue with the IDA the possibility of resurrecting the previous application, whether on the same site or on an alternative site, with a view to acquiring the site in the reasonably near future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will now state the number, if any, of small industries that have started up as a result of the closure last year of the ATT plant in Tallaght, County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that prior to the closure of the former Telectron plant, an advice service centre was set up at Tallaght to encourage employees being made redundant to start their own businesses.</P>
      <P>As a result, two small industries have commenced operations and a further project is at an advanced stage of negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give some more details of the two projects which have been established?  How many people are employed and what is the projected employment in the area? Would he accept that with the closure of ATT and the subsequent loss of 500 jobs, those small projects which he mentioned hardly make a good success record in view of the talent, expertise and skills which were available in this and other of the newer type of industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a mouthful of a question, anyway.  First, I am disappointed that more projects have not emerged from this study.  Something <Col N="29" /> must be learned from it.  Following the closure, the IDA set up an advice centre in the offices of the VEC at Main Road, Tallaght from 25 to 27 May, inclusive. This was promoted through the local papers, through individual letters to each employee and at church services.  A representative from AnCO and the Centre for Enterprise, Development and Organisation also attended at this advice centre, in addition to the IDA.  Fifty-nine people came, of whom 37 were former Telectron employees, so there were 20 others.  The vast majority of the callers had no business ideas, which is inevitable.  They were not conversant with how one should consider setting up a project.  The IDA endeavoured to indicate to them how to go about trying to identify a business idea and the manner of assessing a market for it.  There has been no further response from the callers in question.  However, two Telectron employees to whom I was referring earlier had, in fact, started small businesses on a part-time basis while working with Telectron some months prior to the closure and these plants are proceeding and expanding.  We need to improve considerably the measures taken to encourage redundant workers to set up their own businesses.  The success rate has not been particularly good.  I had then instructed that a special leaflet be prepared to go out with all redundancy notices indicating the full range of services available, so that people can be encouraged to set up employment-generating businesses.  However, I concede that this is an area which requires further study to reach an improved procedure in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my original question.  He must have forgotten about it.  How many people will be employed in the two projects which he mentions?  He must accept that it has been a very poor record with regard to replacing the 500 jobs lost in this increasingly populated area.</P>

I am not suggesting that there are very large numbers. As I have already indicated to the Deputy, I believe we need to do better in this area.

It has been between 2 per cent and 3 per cent whereas the national average growth in unemployment has been about 13.5 per cent.  This lower rate of increase is partly due to the work of the IDA.  I have indicated a significant list of projects where expansions in employment have either taken place or are definitely to take place in the near future.  Tralee already qualifies for the highest level of industrial grants and is, by virtue of its designated status, getting preferential treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the excessive level of taxation on cigarettes and on beer and spirits is having a significant effect in decreasing the demand for these items?  This is working its way back to the source and it is having an effect on the people employed in the industries concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>

Because of the fall-off in demand, will the Minister not agree that the time is opportune for him as the person with direct responsibility for job creation to say to the Minister for Finance that the taxation measures are having a serious effect on our employment position?

      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to get involved in a discussion on taxation at Question Time.  The Minister for Finance does not wish to have this high level of taxation.  It has occurred only because of the deterioration in the country's finances over a relatively extended period, with which the Deputy will be familiar.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that I recognise &mdash; and have recognised during the past hour &mdash; that there is a serious unemployment problem in Dundalk and an unemployment problem of considerable magnitude in Drogheda.</P>

This committee have now reported to me.  Arising from the committee's report I intend, in the near future, to make proposals to the Government concerning NET.  Until such time as the Government have considered these proposals, it would not be appropriate for me to make any further statement in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultancy report was not made to me but to an inter-departmental committee.  The committee made their report to me about three months ago, although I do not wish to be categoric about that.  Almost immediately after that there was a major change internationally in the price of ammonia and this, to a large extent, removed the basis on which much of the report had been based.  The assessment I am presenting to the Government is one that is based on the new facts rather than solely on the consultants' report or the report of the inter departmental committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of finance for NET is a matter that will be dealt with by the Government on foot of my recommendations in the relatively near future.  It would be premature at this stage to speak about the amount of money required or the method whereby that would be provided.  If it is to be provided in the form of capital, clearly it would have to be found within the confines of the budget but if, on the other hand, there was to be an extension of guaranteed borrowings the situation would be different.  However, I do not wish to get involved in a detailed discussion on the financial provision until the decisions in principle have been taken by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that the provision in respect of non-programme outlays which the Government made was a general one which did not specify individual plants.  The division of <Col N="43" /> the money in question during the year is to be a matter for decision from time to time by the Government.  The provision or otherwise of a particular item for NET has no implications one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's reluctance to give me the information I sought.  In bringing together the total for non-programme outlays, either he made a submission to the Government in relation to NET or he did not.  All I want is a straight answer, yes or no.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The needs of NET are not possible to determine until the Government make their decision and were not possible to determine at the time of preparation of the budget for the same reason but they are borne in mind in the setting of the global figure for non-programme outlays.  However, a specific figure was not pencilled in, either explicitly or implicitly, because to do so would not be meaningful until decisions were taken regarding the future of NET.</P>

He has been doing that work quite vigorously and I met him on a number of occasions. Some other staff have been employed on short-term contracts to assist him in his work.  As I will indicate in response to the next question, I am quite happy that the National Enterprise Agency are doing valuable work.  I hope that, in the relatively near future, they will be incorporated in the National Development Corporation which will have a somewhat wider mandate.  I intend that the work which the NEA are doing will continue under the aegis of the NDC.  That is the best way to proceed at this stage.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Since the Wool Council have been abolished, does this section give statutory recognition to the fact that the council ceased to operate from January 1 1983?  Also, in so far as it repeals section 18 of the Principal Act setting up the Wool Council, would the Minister indicate and give a clear declaration as to whether the wool industry will be safeguarded?  Will he ensure that his Department will carry out the functions of the Wool Council as they were carried out by the former council which was set up in 1968?  I should like the Minister to assure the House categorically that this will be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on the last occasion on which we discussed this matter, there are a number of factors that will not change.  One is that the intelligence data will be available on the same basis in so far as marketing arrangments are concerned.  I explained on that former occasion that probably this was the most important aspect of the entire wool buying season, so that producers would know exactly what was happening not only in England but all over Europe.  I can give the House an absolute assurance that this will continue in the <Col N="92" /> same way.  Also the question of inspection of premises will continue at the same level.  There were always approximately 24 AOs involved, who will continue to be involved, calling at three, four or six weekly intervals to the various wool-buying premises to ensure that standards are maintained.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Wool Council had an additional function in regard to the promotion of the sale of wool and in the conducting of a campaign for its proper presentation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, as I said on the last occasion on which we discussed this matter, it is my view that all of the functions assigned to the Wool Council at its inception have expired.  In recent years in particular such has been the information available through the various agencies that the role of the Wool Council has ceased and there would not now be any need for its continuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I must disagree with the Minister.  Since the sheep industry is becoming more and more an important feature of agricultural development, sheepmeat being perhaps the only meat not overproduced within the EEC, and since our sheep numbers have been increasing in recent years, rendering the industry lucrative, the Minister should give the House an assurance that the functions of the Wool Council will be continued by his Department.  I cannot agree with him that its functions have expired; I say: far from it.  I should like to see producers, processors and the industry having an input into wool promotion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The irony of the situation is that, since the disbandment of the Wool Council, for one reason or another the actual price paid to Irish producers is between 8p and 10p per pound <Col N="93" /> higher this year than last year.  As we are all aware, it is the price the sheep farmers receive for their product at the end of the day that matters, and in that regard this year looks like being one of the best for quite some time.  Therefore it is ironic that in the very year in which the Wool Marketing Board has been disbanded the actual price per pound paid for wool has increased by 10p or 11p, depending on grade.  The wool business is quite lively this year and I understand that the short term view is that that trend is likely to continue.</P>
      <P>All possible assistance will be given by my Department, where there is enormous technical expertise available at present, to any groups in need of such. In so far as the input of producers, retailers and others to the whole of the industry is concerned, I might say there is nothing preventing producers, through any of the IFA organisations or others, from forming a producers' organisation &mdash; something not unknown in other countries. However, that is not a matter for this debate.  However, as far as sheep farmers and wool producers are concerned, I would consider it a step in the right direction and something to be highly commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister will be aware that there is a proper marketing structure, statutorily established, in most wool-producing countries of the world.  Surely what the Minister says would not be acceptable to the processers or producers and that, rather than the abolition of the Wool Council, its role should be strengthened. Is the Minister aware that one of the recommendations of the committee established in 1965 to investigate wool development here was that the Wool Council would eventually develop into a full wool marketing board?  Therefore a haphazard approach is most unsatisfactory with regard to wool promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>One can appreciate the Deputy's concern about the report he mentioned because at that time there was reference to the eventual establishment of such a wool marketing board.  If we <Col N="94" /> consider the position of our British counterparts and their Wool Marketing Board then I do not think too many of our wool producers would be happy living under such a regime in the sense that I understand it costs approximately 12p. or 13p. per pound of wool to pay for its administration. There are many other things one could say about the British system which is entirely producer-orientated. The history of our wool marketing board has been, if you like, an association of various interests.  At any given time there will be many differing opinions on who should have the say on an Irish marketing board.  As the Deputy is aware, there are varying opinions between the producers, the wool buyers and the retailers.  We cannot say that a marketing board is the answer to our problem because of the different systems we have.  Under the British system there is a cost of 12p or 13p per pound to the producer.  No Irish sheep farmer would be too happy about that.  We are making available marketing intelligence and information on world trends and we will continue to make them available.  This is a very important to every sheep farmer.  Irish sheep farmers avail of this service.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Wool Council was abolished as from 1 January 1983.  I cannot accept that producers will be charged something in the region of 12p or 13p per pound.  The Council was set up in 1968 to safeguard the interests of the producers and the processors.  The setting up of that Wool Council was promoted by the producers and the various organisations such as Macra na Feirme and the NFA as it was then known.  The income small sheep farmers earn from the sale of wool is a very large part of their entire income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister hopes to save £100,000 by abolishing this council.  This is another attack by the Government on small farmers. I do not blame the Minister.  He is not a member of the Cabinet and he has <Col N="95" /> to carry out the instructions which are handed to him.  This cost saving exercise is a very narrow approach.  The Government are neglecting the rural areas and particularly the western seaboard.  This shows a lack of commitment by the Government and the Minister for Agriculture. It is a step in the wrong direction. The council has ceased to exist and the Minister is saying the producers and processors can come together in a haphazard fashion.  That is the way the Government are promoting the wool industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years I have been involved with Macra na Feirme and the wool industry.  When the board was set up there was a massive job to be done on the question of clean wool and the proper storage and sale of wool. The wool marketing board were remarkably successful.  Every sheep farmer now knows there are two ways to have his wool ready for the market, the way he used to do it and the new way which will get him the best possible price per pound. We then had to consider what was happening on international markets.</P>
      <P>This was a bone of contention for many producers.  Having sold their wool they found they could have got more for it in another market in another part of the world.  The intelligence part of the operation will be made available in the coming months as it was in the past.  The wool board have completed their task.  If the producer groups want to come together nationally there is nothing to stop them. The Department will be only too delighted to give them every assistance possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true to say a marketing board <Col N="96" /> is the answer to all the problems because of our situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> our neighbours in the United Kingdom.  Deputy Noonan said this is a step backwards, but I will leave that to be decided by every sheep farmer who is getting more for his wool this year than he got for a long time.  That is the bottom line.  If a national producers' body feel it is important to have a marketing board for the sale of wool, the Department will give them all the help possible.  The wool board have completed their task and the various functions the Department are retaining on behalf of wool and sheep farmers will be more than sufficient to ensure that every Irish sheep farmer gets a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pathetic to hear the Minister of State trying to defend a Government decision which is absolutely indefensible. He is trying to put some gloss on that decision and seeking to create the impression that what he is doing is correct.  I am afraid he is failing miserably in that attempt.  There is no doubt that education is a continuing process. The Wool Council was established to provide advice for sheep farmers to enable them improve the quality of the wool they were sending to the market and thereby ensure they would get maximum benefit for their product.  The education and advising of our sheep farmers is not something that can be started and ended over a fixed period.  Their education must be on a continuing basis.  The young farmers who take up sheep rearing in the years ahead will not, it seems, have the benefit of a body such as the wool council to instruct them on the best method for handling wool and developing and presenting their product to the market.  That was what was intended when the wool council was established.  I was a Member before the wool council was set up and I can recall receiving many deputations from my constituency, and other parts of the country, seeking the establishment of such a board to provide the necessary advice to help farmers improve the quality of wool.  Happily the representations we received from those people were listened to when we conveyed them to the <Col N="97" /> Minister for Agriculture at the time, Deputy Blaney, because he established the wool marketing council.</P>
      <P>It is sad that after a short period of years the Government should dismantle that council and bring the excellent work it had been doing to a halt purely on the basis that this was a good way to save money.  This is a retrograde step that will have a bad effect in the long term on the returns to the agricultural industry.  It will have a bad effect on the continuing efforts to improve the quality of wool.  I represent a constituency where difficulties are experienced by hill sheep farmers, particularly those in Connemara and I am disappointed that a western Member has been sent here as Minister of State to seek to justify the Government's decision. The Minister of State in the House has been involved directly in the industry and he must be aware that what he is asking us to agree to represents a backward step.  He is aware that he should not be asking us to support this move.  We will find it difficult to support the measure.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable after so many advances have been made in this area that they are swept aside purely for the expediency of saving a few shillings.  That is not the way to develop agriculture but it is another indication to Fianna Fáil Members of the total lack of interest by the Government in anything that has to do with western counties.  We could keep the Minister of State all day in the House if we decided to list the schemes introduced over the years to help farmers that are being cancelled out and dismantled by the Government.</P>
      <P>Today we are discussing the wool council which was established by Fianna Fáil.  It surprises me that those who were so vocal in the National Farmers Association &mdash; now known as the Irish Farmers Association &mdash; about the need to establish a council and were so full of praise of their work since it was set up have remained silent while the Government dismantled the council.  It is an indication that politics exist in the IFA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who made strong representations some years ago for the establishment of a wool council were active in the National Farmers Association and it seems strange that now that the Government have decided to discontinue that council that those people have not been more vocal in their dissatisfaction with that move.  The silence from the IFA indicates that their participation in criticism of matters affecting their industry are often tempered by a consideration for the party in power.  It is our view that there is a need to continue with the Wool Council and farmers' organisations should have been more vocal in their support for that.  Organised farming is not strong in many areas in the west where there are many small sheep farmers whose voice does not play a major role in the IFA council chambers.  At the same time they represent an important section of the community and have the difficulty of eking out a living for themselves and their families.  The wool industry is a precarious one with prices fluctuating from time to time.  The returns are not always very generous considering the amount of effort and risk involved in rearing sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disgraceful that a body such as the Wool Council which was set up to help farmers get better prices for their product <Col N="99" /> and develop the sheep rearing industry is being taken from them.  I cannot allow the Minister to seek to justify that decision on the grounds that there was no need for the council, that the task they had been given had been completed, that the job they were set up to carry out was now completed.  I do not accept that. How can the Minister say that job has been completed?  How can the Minister say that the work done over the last 15 years will be of benefit to farmers who are too young to benefit from it?  Future young farmers will not have the opportunity to learn more about handling wool or how to ensure that it arrives at the market place in good condition.  All the good work that has been done by the Wool Council is now in danger of being lost.  There is an assumption on the Minister's part that those who have benefited and are applying the best methods will be able to pass on their knowledge to their successors.  That is an assumption the Minister will find difficult to prove.  It would be foolish to suggest, for instance, that we could close down our schools and universities on the basis that those who have passed through them will be able to pass on the knowledge they gained to future children.  It is ludicrous.  I am not satisfied that the Government are serious in the interest they are taking in the industry.  For the sake of saving £100,000 this move was a very mean act on the part of the Government.  It is another act that is increasing difficulties for those who farm in rural areas.  Many schemes were introduced to assist such farmers, give them a better standard of living and a hope of improving their way of life but they are being taken from them by the Government.  The Government are stooping once again to another mean low act.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will have second thoughts about the provisions in the Bill.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, will agree with the sentiments expressed by the Opposition. It is regrettable that the Minister who agreed to this cut when the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture were being considered at Cabinet level has not <Col N="100" /> had the courage to come to the House and fulfil the obligation he undertook at the Cabinet table.  This unnecessary and savage cut will affect small farmers who need more outside assistance.  Farmers who are involved in sheep rearing in a big way may be able to employ all modern techniques and qualified staff, but the small man has more or less to eke out a living on his own, work his lonely patch, his hill, mind his sheep and his dog and gather in the neighbours to help him at shearing.  He has not available to him the modern machinery and techniques which might be available to a man of greater means who usually has a bigger holding. The small man is hit time and time again and it is he whom we must defend here. He is bearing the brunt of this miserable Government decision to save £100,000. Why has Deputy Deasy, Minister for Agriculture, not come in here himself to explain what he is doing?  Why has he sent in a man who was not present at the Cabinet table, or is Deputy Connaughton, Minister of State, so wholeheartedly in agreement with what is proposed here that he has no qualms of conscience in coming in to defend the decision?  Does he support this decision 100 per cent or is he just giving us the brief and hoping that it will be all over in a few minutes and we can get on to the next item on the agenda?</P>
    <P>I must say these few words because I helped to bring this board into existence. We were very pleased that the campaign which we mounted in the middle sixties resulted in the establishment of this board.  I am delighted that even the Minister in his speech had to confirm that it was the right decision to set up the board, and he has heaped praise on the Wool Council, on the staff who worked as they did in giving advice to the farmers, and on the improvements which resulted from their demonstrations and instructions and the overall benefit which has accrued to the wool industry because of the work of the Wool Council.  The Minister himself is praising the Wool Council. It is very false praise to come in and thank them and congratulate them on the excellent work they have done and then tell them that he is dismantling the whole <Col N="101" /> outfit and the only reason is that the Government want to save £100,000. Surely the continuation of the wool industry and seeking the highest, most up-to-date standards in the quality and presentation of the product is something which we must always seek and be anxious to improve.  We cannot say about it that the task was specific, it has ended and there is now no need to continue to seek to update our methods and techniques. There will always be a need to continue developing the processes and to match those of one's competitors, who are not going to sit back and leave things as they stand.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, education is a continuing process and it is to be regretted that the Government are choosing to dismantle the Wool Council as they are proposing in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refute some of Deputy Molloy's assertions such as that the Government are running away from their responsibilities.  I would like to refer briefly to two major points that Deputy Molloy made about young people getting into farming.  I assume he spoke particularly about the hill sheep farmers.  I had occasion to be in the heart of his constituency at Maam Cross a few months ago when I presented ACOT certificates for sheep husbandry to 50 or 60 young farmers from the hills in that area.  That was the first time that that area had the benefit of a very long and involved course, which took in all matters relating to wool.  Advisory services through ACOT, the green certificate, 100 and 60 hours courses are all being made available now all over Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will let the farming organisations speak for themselves, but one other reason why many sheep farmers are relatively happy at this stage is that, in the last three years, for the first time in many decades, sheep men have been getting a reasonable return for their labour.  There are many reasons for that, but at least they are now not the Cinderella of all the farming enterprises.  The hill sheep farmers, about whom Deputy Molloy spoke so eloquently, are entitled to the highest payment ever through the EEC ewe premium <Col N="102" /> which will amount to something like £13.8p for every ewe on every Irish farm this year.  Some of it has already been paid and the other part has been calculated and will be ready for distribution very shortly.  That type of thing, together with our access to the French market, means that because of the expanded markets and the fact that we have now a quality product, our sheep farmers for the first time ever are getting a reasonable return for their lambs and sheepmeat generally.  I am not satisfied with that return and I would much prefer that they would get more, but it is far away above and beyond anything that they were accustomed to getting before that.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to believe at this stage that some of the educational aspects of the Wool Council's activities will now cease to operate.  There are sheep shearing county and all-Ireland finals all over the country, as has always been the case, organised by Macra na Feirme or other interested parties, and many people come out to watch these competitions.  In regard to that I see no slack around the country this year as opposed to any other year.</P>
    <P>The Department are taking a keen interest in what is happening to wool all over the world.  We must keep abreast with developments, and I guarantee to the House today that we will be able to do that.  If the graph continues in the direction indicated at the moment, the sufficiency of sheepmeat in the Community will be such that we will be allowed to expand &mdash; in fact it is one of the few commodities in which we will be allowed to expand.  Deputy Noonan referred to this.  While it is always dangerous to crystal gaze at any time, I would say that the future looks quite good for our sheep farmers.  The bottom line for any sheep farmer is what he is getting for his produce. Therefore, I refute what Deputy Molloy said.  The industry is in a quite healthy state and, because of where I come from, I will do everything possible to ensure that it expands and goes from strength to strength.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Deputy Molloy never said otherwise, but we on this side of the House want to ensure that it will continue to stay in a healthy state. It is because of the Wool Council that the industry is in such a healthy state at present. The Wool Council have contributed a great deal to the whole sheep industry. The Minister has pointed out rightly that the price of wool is on the upward trend. Again, that is due to the groundwork and the foundations laid by the Wool Council since 1968.  Now the Minister is prepared to abolish this council for the saving of a mere £100,000.  Is he prepared to throw the whole sheep industry out through the door?  Is he prepared to throw away the whole wool industry with all that it means to the small farmers on the western seaboard? The council are the only body who have co-ordinated the wool industry in this country since they were set up in 1968.  The Minister is throwing the wool industry to the wolves although he knows that small farmers are the backbone of the economy and that they rely mainly on sheep.</P>
      <P>At present our sheepmeat is acceptable in the EEC markets and we have many openings for our lamb in France and elsewhere. Therefore, now is the time to have an agency that will promote our sheep and wool industry, but the Government chose to abolish the Wool Council for the sake of a saving of £100,000.  I do not accept the assertion that the industry itself agrees with the abolishing of the council, which was set up in 1968.  When he said that, the Minister was not aware of the facts.  I have spoken to producers and they do not agree with the move. They regard it as a backward step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the council was set up in 1968 we regarded it as only scraping the surface in regard to wool development.  The UK and many other wool producing countries wisely have progressive wool boards which play a major role in wool <Col N="104" /> promotion, and that makes it all the more difficult for us to accept the Government's move.  We have heard that one man in the Department of Agriculture is now doing the work of the council and that four others who were employed by the council have returned to their duties in the Department.  No matter how good that one person is it will be impossible for him to do the work of the council to develop this major industry.</P>
    <P>There has been an upward trend in the wool market and wool production is responsible for 3.6 per cent of our total agricultural output.  In 1982 it was valued at £78 million.  These are indications that the industry was progressing strongly and yet the Minister throws it all away for a saving of £100,000.  Fianna Fáil always supported the view that small farmers must be kept on the land, and that being so, because they rely so much on sheep and wool, the abolition of the council was a backward step at a time when we should be making every effort to develop it and give it help.</P>
    <P>The people know that there is a Government trend, and this Bill is part of it, to downgrade agriculture as a major source of income.  We saw the suspension of the farm modernisation scheme; and, no matter what the Minister may say about its reintroduction, the agricultural community do not accept that it is of much help to agricultural development. Another part of the Government anti-agriculture trend is the cut back in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The council, before their abolition, did excellent work to promote wool production but the Government acted without ascertaining the views of either the producers or the processers.  At this late stage I ask the Minister to take a look at the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring to the notice of Deputy Noonan some figures which I think will disprove entirely the case he is making.  The first significant figure is that there has been an increase of 6 per cent in sheep numbers this year. We must ask ourselves what is the reason for this increase.  Obviously, farmers realise that there is money in this line.  As I said earlier, it is significant that the past two to three years have been the best in terms of the sheep business.  On the question of the wool market, anybody who has a reasonable knowledge of the industry will know that the sale of wool on the world market has been always a fluctuating business.  It is almost like the Stock Exchange in that sense.  No wool marketing board anywhere in the world seems to have the ability to stabilise the world wool market.  Consequently, the next step for the wool market would have to be something to do with a marketing arm either by the people involved, the businessmen and so on, or the producers.</P>
      <P>There is no question of our turning our backs on the small farmers.  The return from the enterprise last year was the best ever.</P>

      <P>The board were set up for a specific purpose and they have achieved that purpose.  There is no point in having an organisation carrying on a function when time has caught up on them in so far as that function is concerned. I am convinced that because of the new ACOT training schemes, because of the market intelligence my Department will be making available and because of all the other aids to which I have referred, our wool will attract the best possible price on any market.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister has confirmed my argument by telling us that there is an increase in sheep numbers and that the past few years have been the best ever for the sheep industry. This success can be attributed to the efforts of the Wool Council, which the Minister is abolishing now in order to <Col N="106" /> save a mere £100,000.  So far he has not put forward any logical argument as to why the council should be abolished.  All he is saying is that because the wool industry is on the upward trend there is no need for an advisory service.  The Minister should take note of the point made by Deputy Molloy that education, whether in agriculture or otherwise, is a continuing process.  Surely that continuing process is all important in the promotion of the sheep industry and in educating our farmers to produce at the highest levels possible.  In abolishing the Wool Council the Government are failing those involved in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reply briefly to the question of the advisory service.  I wish it to be known that there are in progress between my Department and ACOT negotiations with a view to ensuring that there is an even stronger link with sheep farmers by way of the provision of sheep-shearing courses and so on.  I must refute the argument that the advisory service as such will not be available.  Regardless of the light in which the Opposition would like to show this Bill, the vast majority of our sheep farmers know that in the past year clipped wool has increased from between 10p to 12p per pound.  There is a very lively trade and we have access to various markets. It would be difficult to argue the case that because of the achievements in the industry in 1983 it would be to the detriment of farmers in Leitrim or anywhere else to abolish the Wool Council. Because of the changing fortunes in the sheep industry the people involved are beginning to demand a type of livelihood that they should have enjoyed many years ago but which for one reason or another was not possible to achieve.</P>
      <P>The record of the old board was excellent. We all accept that but there comes a time when a programme has outlived its aims and objectives.  That is the position at present.  I do not believe there will be any kick back provided that what I have outlined to the House is carried out. I have given a categorical assurance to the House that it will be done.  We are here to protect the sheep industry.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am more and more amazed at the lack of information.  Surely the Minister of State knows that the allocation to ACOT was reduced by the Government and that the approach by ACOT, as far as advisory services are concerned, is geared to a certain section of the farming community. Sheep farmers will not be in that category.  The ACOT advisory services will not replace the advice given by the board which the Minister is abolishing. Irrespective of the arguments the Minister makes, he cannot disguise the fact that this is a backward step or that ACOT will take over where the Wool Council left off.  Far from it.  As a result of the Government's approach and because of their lack of financial support for ACOT, they will not be in a position to provide the services they provided heretofore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy's allegation that ACOT will not be making specialist instructors available. One of the reasons why ACOT was formed was so that there would be a specialist client based advisory service. This was a deviation from the general purpose type of approach we had.  We will now have specially trained sheep specialists. This is an important development. The specialists are giving an outstanding service.  I compliment the gains made by the old Wool Marketing Council.  We are talking about two different types of advice.  At this stage what we want is specialised instruction for sheep farmers by specially trained advisory staff.  I refute what Deputy Noonan said because it is at variance with the facts.</P>

We cannot depend on ACOT to provide additional services, information or advice.  They are hamstrung for funds.  Last year, many local authorities were reduced to such an <Col N="108" /> extent that their activities were greatly curtailed.  In my county we are trying to develop the growing of fruit and vegetables. This council was abolished to save a very small sum of money.</P>

Anyone who is involved in farming or represents a farming area knows that there is a &ldquo;chop, chop&rdquo; attitude in relation to farming.

      <P>The Minister seemed to imply that the work done by the Wool Council will be done to the same extent by ACOT yet when he was asked to give the number of ACOT officials who will be involved he did not know.  The Minister is making a contribution to the debate and trying to sustain his arguments <Col N="109" /> without having too many facts to substantiate what he is seeking to convey. In the Minister's words, the Wool Council undertook a task and were carrying it out successfully.</P>
      <P>The council are being abolished to save money and that is the only reason for it. The Minister for Finance dictated to the Minister for Agriculture and told him there would have to be cutbacks.  We have seen the effects of cutbacks in other areas such as in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  These resulted in the complete disruption of the farm modernisation scheme, the cessation of the lime subsidy scheme and the land drainage scheme in the west, a reduction in the income limit to qualify for cattle headage grants which were introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government, a cutback in farmers dole and now the abolition of the Wool Council.  The Minister seeks to justify what he is doing by saying there has been an increase in the number of sheep and in the return to sheep farmers.  The sheep industry is now profitable and is going through a period of strong marketing.  That is all very satisfactory. All of this is as a result of contributions made over the years.  A valuable contribution was made in developing the wool industry by the Wool Council.  The Minister acknowledged that and praised them for their work.  If the work was well done why abolish them?  If the work they were doing was valuable, why stop it?  If the work they were doing needs to be continued, surely it should not be stopped and the board abolished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give more details on what he saw as the specific task the Wool Council were given when established, how he considers that task has been completed, why there is no need to continue the type of work they were doing, and what he sees happening in the future in regard to educating and advising young farmers in the techniques of husbanding wool, such as the cleansing of wool, sheep shearing, presentation to the market place and the need to continue to improve and keep abreast of developing techniques in that area.  What does the Minister see as the specific role the Wool <Col N="110" /> Council got and which could be deemed to have been completed?  It seems to me that the work they undertook was of a continuing nature, was beneficial, and should be continued.  It would be helpful if the Minister would give some idea of what he interprets as the specific task of the Wool Council and why that task need no longer be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the indications are that in future we will be looking to sheep production to pick up the slack in many areas at a time when there will be an overproduction of milk?  Immediately after the discussions on the super-levy many people predicted that they would be facing the same problems in beef production in the next few years.  When sheep prices were low the prices the sheep producers got for wool was a great boost.  Would the Minister agree that there is not sufficient emphasis on sheep production generally, because it looks as if it will be a fairly remunerative enterprise for farmers in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the point raised by Deputy Molloy first.  It is important to go back to the sixties before the board were set up and to have a quick look at the situation then in the sheep industry.  We were tied to a very restricted market.  It was very difficult to sell land during the sixties and the fashion trade began to look at synthetic fibres. As a nation we had a very fine sheep flock but our presentation of our meat and wool products was very bad.  One of the aims and objectives of the Wool Council was to grade wool.  This was the talking point up and down the country.  On the positive side it was decided that there would have to be a bonus system introduced and, on the negative side, a deduction system.  If a person put up for public auction a product which did not meet the market requirement, such a person would be penalised; or, in the case of a product which did, compensated.  That was the beginning of the Wool Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the extent that this created an educational awareness among all farmers, the Wool Council have been spectacularly <Col N="111" /> successful.  That is why I pay the board this compliment.  This system had not been introduced before, but at that stage some farming organisations got involved with the work of the board.  This was a huge exercise.  It was a familiar sight to see a farmer shearing his sheep in the corner of a green field with grass mixed with the fleece.  In years past a farmer was paid as much for a product of that description as he was for a product he had spent a lot of time on.  The board went to great lengths, through their wool graders and educational activities and through liaison with the farming organisations, to ensure that that was done.  In that area the board's work is done, and has been done for a number of years. There are very few Irish farmers who do not understand the mechanics of the wool business.  When they are shearing their sheep and presenting their wool for sale they know the type of wool they must produce to get the optimum price.</P>
    <P>There were many other activities in which the board were involved but they are too numerous to mention now.  They had the visual displays, publicity, advertising and co-operated with Macra na Feirme over the years for the all-Ireland sheep shearing competition.  Some years I saw 8,000 or 10,000 people at the sheep shearing finals.  This was an event at which the sheep shearing champions of Ireland came together to show what could be done by training.  The old board also dealt with problems between the trade and the producers and the question of storing wool on wool buyers' premises. This is something we will continue because it is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>In the last 13 or 14 years the board have achieved their goals and there is no need to tackle the same job in the same way now.  That is not to say that there is not a necessity to make advice available to sheep farmers for wool husbandry and so on.  That aspect is being looked after through the various courses I mentioned, such as that at Maam Cross.  These courses are available to young sheep farmers.  It is against that background that I have to say that the objectives of the Wool Council have been achieved <Col N="112" /> and from now on a different approach will have to be adopted.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I want to take issue with what the Minister said about specialist advisory personnel.  These sheep specialists were always available. It was not today or yesterday that they were appointed.  I would also like to take issue with him on his statement that the advisory services will be taking over the role of the council so far as giving advice is concerned.  I want to reiterate what Deputy Leonard and I have said. Because of the depleted finances of ACOT the number of specialists giving this advice will be substantially reduced. Irrespective of what the Minister says, the people about whom we are concerned now will not get the necessary advice because more often than not they will not seek it.  Under the new regulations concerning ACOT unless there is a demand for the services they will not be provided. These services are now being geared to a special category of farmer &mdash; is the Minister aware of that?</P>
      <P>With regard to the functions which were carried out by the board, who will now devise ways and means of increasing wool export and who will now be dealing with the maximising of home produced wool by our manufacturers?  I understand that the Wool Council were considering setting up a processing industry.  Are there any plans in the Minister's Department to do this for the industry?  These are the areas to take note of if we are interested in wool production and in continuing the upward trend in sheep numbers. There is also the other important aspect of job opportunities in this industry which is coming more and more to the forefront, which opportunities will be available if we set about expanding this industry and setting up a processing industry.  Would the Minister comment on this?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, their approach now is through a group system, in the sense that these are people of like minds who have the same type of project.  This is catching on extremely well, in particular in the hill sheep areas.  There is a demand there which is being shown up through the various ACOT seminars and courses, and that demand will be met.  As never before, sheep farmers will have at their disposal sheep specialist advice.</P>
      <P>In so far as the export of wool, and indeed sheep, is concerned, the same applies as with any other product.  If the producers get paid for what they are doing, and if the markets are there to absorb their products, one will get the response from farmers that one always got down through the years &mdash; if there is profit in it, the farmers will be there.  At present, the sheep industry is quite profitable, although I should like to see it improving.  It is certainly starting off in the right direction.  The EEC live premium is a very important addition to any sheep farmer's profits and is his profit base.  At the moment we are doing quite well out of that section.  In certain parts of this country sheep farmers are now getting £23 per ewe, depending on the type of disadvantaged area.</P>

      <P>The Minister is talking about the welcome for specialisation, and we did welcome it.  We demanded specialisation from this side of the House. However, there must be money to pay for it.  If one were to ask for an ACOT officer to be sent out on a fairly extensive campaign to sheep producers, one would be told that the funds are not there and it cannot be done.  The Minister has indicated that if groups got together &mdash; producers, farmers, ACOT advisers and so forth &mdash; it would be ideal.  Would it not have been better if that matter had been examined prior to this Bill and prior to the abolition of the Wool Council? That would be the time to set up an alternative structure and improve and expand this industry in the context of the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>An Chomhairle had very little property.  The premises were leased and the office furniture and a van had already been transferred to the Department of Agriculture.  There were various other smaller items like equipment, <Col N="118" /> tents, fencing, gates and all the things one associates with sheep handling, which were sold by public auction and the proceeds have been credited to the Department's Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister implied earlier that the competitions would continue and his Department would take over some of the work the former Wool Council were carrying out, such as advice and demonstrations which had been undertaken for the benefit of sheep farmers and those engaged in wool marketing over the years.  If the equipment which the Wool Council owned has been disposed of it is difficult to see how the Department intend to continue with that aspect of the work which the Wool Council were previously undertaking.  I understand over the years the Wool Council had built up a complete set of equipment for use at sheep shearing competitions throughout the country.  I understand the equipment consisted of pens, shearing boards, shearing machines, a tent and equipment for putting on educational exhibits and a van for transporting the materials around the country.  The sheep shearing competitions and demonstrations, as we have been saying, were responsible for the very great improvement which has taken place in sheep shearing techniques over the past few years.  It seems from what the Minister said that this equipment will no longer be available for that purpose because it has been disposed of.  If all that area of advice, demonstration and assistance given to sheep farmers in developing knowledge and techniques in this area cannot continue because the equipment has been disposed of by the Department how can the Minister expect us to accept that this valuable work will continue in the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>All the people who had an interest in this type of equipment we were talking about were informed prior to the auction of the equipment that it was being sold.  I had the pleasure of organising two or three of the All-Ireland sheep shearing competitions and much of the equipment involved had nothing to <Col N="119" /> do with the wool board.  The sheep shearing machines were always supplied by manufacturers of such machines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The wool board owned four obsolete machines.  That is all they owned.  On the occasion of the All-Ireland sheep shearing finals the machines used were always provided by certain firms interested in that kind of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; puzzles me.  Why would the Wool Council own obsolete sheep shearing machines? The Minister is trying to play down the fact that he has already disposed of all the equipment used for demonstrations and holding competitions.  This indicates that there is some intention on the part of the Department to drop all that aspect of the work the Wool Council were previously carrying out.  In view of the Minister's statement that he was involved in organising some of those competitions I am sure he must have seen some merit in holding them.  It attracted the interest of young farmers who had the opportunity to study and learn from the techniques employed by the experts who participated in those competitions.  This would have been to the benefit of the wool industry in relation to the assimilation of knowledge and experience.  If the property, including the van, has been sold it seems that all the work the Wool Council were doing, which has been praised so lavishly during the course of the debate by the Minister, will no longer continue.</P>

It is caused by the decision of the Coalition Government to cut back in this area, as in so many other areas, thus contributing to the dreadful tragedy of unemployment. This decision is throwing more people on the unemployment heap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every individual suffers an indignity <Col N="123" /> when he is deprived of the opportunity to exercise his skills and ability.  When somebody has been loyal to an organisation, particularly a semi-State organisation, it is a matter of great regret that he should not be treated in a just and fair manner.  He should be relieved of the trauma and the distress imposed on him by the Department.  It is clear this is an area the Department are seeking to bring back under their own wing and it is further evidence of the extension of bureaucracy which is something all of us decry.  Whether the loyal people in the Civil Service like it or not, it is the wish of the people that we manage our affairs with a greatly reduced number of public servants and obviously any attempt by the Civil Service to increase their area of influence will lead to a further increase in their numbers.  That is not something the country or the economy needs at the moment.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in the matter.  If any more former members of the staff feel aggrieved at the decision, I ask him to deal with the matter in as humane a way as possible and to bring it to an early conclusion.  There is nothing more distressing for any man and his family than to have negotiations of that kind protracted over a long period. When dealing with a large Department such as the Department of Agriculture the individual is a very small and weak person to compete against-that type of establishment.  It can be very intimidating. I ask the Minister to exercise his humanity in ensuring that there is a quick solution to this matter.</P>

The man in question was excellent at his work and I am delighted to say that he has got employment.  However, because of the particular circumstances outlined by Deputy Molloy regarding one man who did not have a job to which he could return, I share the concern of the Deputy.  I can assure the House that everything possible that can be done is <Col N="124" /> being done to ensure that this man will leave on a mutually satisfactory basis.

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat my welcome for the Bill.  There is need for a consistent set of national building regulations, including fire regulations.  At present there are many anomalies and standards vary from region to region.  By-laws in relation to buildings exist in only seven or eight local authority areas.  The Bill is important because the construction industry is our second largest industry.  I am glad the Minister has indicated that the building regulations referred to in the Bill will be published shortly and I understand this Bill is enabling legislation to implement those regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears the Bill is an omnibus one, somewhat similar to the Fire Services Act, 1983, except perhaps in relation to sections 4 and 5 which empower building control authorities to issue relaxations either generally or specifically.  There can be little argument against the case put forward for the introduction of controls. However, great care should be taken to provide for the situation ably described by the Minister in his speech, namely, that for most of the country there is no experience in any of the bodies that will be set up as control bodies.  This will require close monitoring at the introductory stage of the regulations to ensure that uncertainty or lack of experience <Col N="125" /> does not give rise to inactivity on the part of the authorities.  Unfortunately, I do not see any provisions for this and I should like the Minister to tell us what monitoring will take place when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>The regulations may be applied nationally or locally.  Therefore, they may be applied in different degrees in different areas and to specific buildings or classes of buildings in different areas.  With the relaxation of provisions of sections 4 and 5 this could lead to a chaotic situation where the same standards need not necessarily apply to a specific class of building in different areas.  At its most absurd, it could result in two exactly similar buildings in the same street having different standards.  The building regulations to be made under section 3 and the control procedures under section 6 have not been published and I am awaiting their publication with interest.</P>
    <P>When drafting my contribution to the debate I asked for opinions from a cross-section of people involved in various areas of the construction industry. The responses I got varied considerably in their content.  I have little experience of the construction industry and I found it difficult to assess adequately the many opinions I got from the various vested interests.  However, having considered them all I decided to give my reaction to the Bill in the House.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with that, however, I should like to refer to public buildings and the way Government buildings in general are exempt from the provisions of the Planning Acts.  In my own city of Cork there are a number of examples in recent years where public buildings were erected without any consultation with the local authority regarding design and layout. There is one such building in the city centre and there is another on the hills overlooking the city, particularly one in the Churchfield area.  It has scarred the skyline of Cork.</P>

      <P>Not only has it scarred the skyline but the mast there is interfering seriously with television reception.  However, that is outside the scope of this Bill. That building has scarred the skyline of Cork city of which we were proud.  Local residents were unaware of the type of building that was being constructed until the project commenced.  The State have broken the city development plan which was drafted by the local authority in the Cork region.  The public in Cork look upon Government Departments and semi-State companies as being above the law and not answerable to anybody in relation to planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>A Bill similar to this has gone through the House of Lords recently and since the publication of this Bill the Minister, from public statements which he made, has received numerous submissions.</P>
      <P>The Bill has little or nothing to do with town planning but it will enable the introduction of new regulations and the updating of regulations in existence since 1878. Since then we have not kept pace with the introduction of new technology, new materials such as plastics, and new methods of construction.  These new developments have resulted in the need for legislation in a hurry and no reasonable person can object to the sections of the Bill which provide for the introduction of new technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which the Bill allows local authorities control of building in their area is the most controversial part of the Bill.  The present system is that architects submit plans for approval under health, fire, sanitary and other Acts and the local authorities when giving approval impose a number of conditions, usually suggesting minor alterations in the plans to ensure that they comply with regulations.  A typical example is the fire officer requiring the walls on a staircase <Col N="127" /> to be of fireproof material.  Another condition is that windows should be a certain minimum size for natural lighting and ventilation in accordance with the Health Acts.  Generally, the regulations and their application work well, although I can only refer to my own area, Cork city.</P>
    <P>There is a good relationship between the industry and the local authority.  The local authority officials have been most helpful to the personnel in the construction industry.  Unfortunately, under the new Bill this will be changed.  Building products will now have to be submitted under two headings, compliance with the new building regulations with regard to construction, drainage, height and so on, and it will be necessary to obtain approval in advance from the fire officer that the building complies with his requirements. This would be known as the fire safety certificate and is referred to in line 30, page 8, of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed building regulations referred to in the Bill, the local authority officials will not be obliged to comment on building proposals before they are carried out.  Their function will be to register the receipt of plans.  When the job is completed the building owner will furnish an architect's certificate of compliance stating that the building is constructed in accordance with the new regulations.  This will throw enormous responsibilities on architects because if there are any subsequent defects in the building, or if the architect has interpreted the regulation in a different way from the local authority, he is liable to put it right at his or the building owner's expense.  This could cause a problem for architects in relation to insurance, which has already been mentioned.  It may be said that architects are responsible for the safety of their buildings but that is not the full story and this has been gone into in detail already in the press and in this House.</P>
    <P>At present local authorities are responsible to the public for buildings erected in their area.  They have to inspect and approve foundations, drains and other aspects of the building.  In the past few years in Britain there have been numerous <Col N="128" /> examples of structural failures of private buildings but, fortunately, in Ireland there have been few examples of this. Because of the danger of legal wrangling and legal action, architects' fees will, because of their increased liabilities, increase dramatically.</P>
    <P>Building construction in this country can be broken into three sections: commercial and institutional, civil engineering and water supply schemes and housing provided for sale by private companies and built to contract for local authorities.  From the point of view of private housing it is important to get accurate statistics and to look at the effect of any additional controls being brought in.  It is claimed by the Department of the Environment that approximately 26,000 new houses were completed in the last 12 months, 5,000 of these were built by local authorities and another 5,000 to 6,000 were built as once off houses by private individuals.  That means that very close to half of the houses in the State were provided by other than private builders building for sale.</P>
    <P>Private housing contractors building on their own land for subsequent sale to the public are faced with the following regulatory controls in Dublin and Cork cities.  They must comply with conditions laid down by agencies to whom drawings, specifications and appropriate fees must be paid.  They must get planning authority, building by-law approval, in the national house building guarantee scheme and up to recently they had to obtain a CRV, but I understand that has now been dispensed with.</P>
    <P>It should be taken into account that there is now quite an overlap of agencies inspecting for different reasons and there can be no justification for some of the duplication which takes place as it ultimately costs the house purchaser more money.  If we consider the basic type of house built, a typical three bedroomed house which is so common in the Cork area and costing in the region of £24,000 or £25,000, the purchaser wishing to buy this house and getting a building society loan will have to pay a fee to the building society's surveyor to inspect the house and the builder, on the other hand, is <Col N="129" /> paying a fee to the national house building guarantee scheme for the Department of the Environment to inspect the House.  If the purchaser applies for a grant the Department of the Environment will inspect the house for grant purposes and while all this is happening the inspectors from the building by-law insection will be inspecting the house while it is under construction.  They inspect at various times during the course of construction. Therefore, the Minister should take this into consideration and all house building should come under building regulations.  A method of certification of design and construction compliance should be devised.  This should be a certificate which would in future be accepted by building societies, the Department of the Environment and other agencies interested in the quality of standards in the construction of houses.</P>
    <P>These points are not relevant to commercial building but purely to housing for sale by private builders on private lands. I am very worried about the possible additional cost to the house purchaser. Perhaps the Minister will allay my fears later.  To my knowledge there are at present three inspections of houses carried out by the Department for the purpose of the national housebuilding guarantee scheme, which take place at foundation stage, on roofing and on completion, the cost per house at present being £30.  If self-certification, or certification by the building control authorities, is to be implemented then three visits to a building site to ascertain that houses are being built to standard requirements would have to be paid for.  Any inspector issuing such a certificate would have to make sufficient visits before he appended his name to any document of certification of the building in question.  This raises the question of cost.  For instance, if four visits were necessary by an architect it would cost approximately £40 per visit. There is at present no indication of how much a local authority would charge for this purpose but this is a charge which would be added to the ultimate cost of the house and would have to be met by the purchaser.  It should be understood clearly that if this additional cost comes <Col N="130" /> into being other costs like inspections for the purpose of the national housebuilding guarantee scheme or building society inspections should be lifted as a requirement. I foresee many difficulties arising in the sale of houses if this process becomes law.  For example, before a house can be provided for sale, a purchaser's solicitor would have to seek evidence that it complied with the building regulations, there being two stages in this, that the actual design of the house and its ultimate construction comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>The implementation of any new regulation carrying a cost factor must be fully considered from the point of view of the ultimate purchaser.  There should be a streamlining of all the agencies involved in the inspection of houses and an attempt made to save purchasers unnecessary expense by there being a general acceptance by lending agencies, grant agencies and the national housebuilding guarantee scheme of a certificate of compliance with the building regulations.  As these are all separate agencies protecting their separate interests it may be necessary to include a section dealing with this matter.  We must be very aware of the problems occasioned by increased costs especially at a time when so many people find it difficult to even raise the deposit on a house.  That being said, we must be prepared to accept some cost increases as a result of these proposals because safety and quality standards must not rank second in importance to cost factors.  Perhaps the Minister would examine some of the suggestions for the streamlining of the whole operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy not aware that in the course of the Minister's speech he said that all low-rise housing would be exempt from the scope of the control system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware.  But, if the Deputy looks at the Minister's remarks again, he will see that there is also a qualification included:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exclusion of low-rise housing and other small works from the control <Col N="131" /> system will significantly reduce the amount of work which will have to be dealt with initially by the building control authorities.</P>
    <P>Therefore, at the same time, they will have to comply with regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister is specifically excluding all low-rise housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that later. Essentially the provisions of the Bill do four things: they remove building control from the Planning Acts of 1963 and 1976 by repealing sections 86 and 42; they create within local authorities, who are fire authorities, a building control authority which would be vested with certain regulatory powers and functions; they enable the introduction of building regulations and, finally, set up a building control advisory body comprised of persons representing the various interests. Though not specified I presume such advisory body would represent the City and County Manager's Association, An Foras Forbartha, the IDA and the IIRS. I presume also that there would be included a representative from the Construction Industry Federation.  However I should add that all builders building houses are not members of the Construction Industry Federation.  When making these appointments I wonder if the Minister will consult the register of members included in the national housebuilding guarantee scheme.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill allow the Minister to consider many options of control procedures but we shall have to await the relevant regulations to know what are his precise intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in section 4 for referral to arbitration by an applicant in the event of a dispensation being refused. From my reading of the Bill it is not clear that this would go to the District Court. If that is the intention, I would be somewhat unhappy about that as constituting a solution.  Perhaps that is not the intention but I cannot be certain from my reading of the Bill.  Obviously any such argument advanced in court would be of <Col N="132" /> a highly technical nature.  It would appear to me that a much more efficient method of dealing with this or any other type of appeal under the provisions of the Bill would be the establishment of an appeals tribunal to be staffed on a rotation basis by officials of the Minister's Department &mdash; I presume his technical section &mdash; by members of the Royal Institute of Architects and perhaps also of the Institute of Civil Engineers with presumably also nominees from the Construction Industry Federation.  In other words, I contend that technical arguments should be resolved by technical rather than legal people.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with that point when replying.</P>
    <P>In his introductory remarks the Minister said:</P>
    <P>As I see matters at this stage, if we want a comprehensive system of building control, the only way in which we can achieve it, without embarking on the establishment of an elaborate, costly and time-consuming apparatus of administrative and technical control, is to go for a system of certification by appropriate people.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am strongly of the opinion that the most expeditious system of administering building regulations is by way of a certification system of control.  Under such a system designers and builders of individual projects will, on their own responsibility, provide certificates of compliance with the requirements of the regulations.  Apart from reducing delays and costs and allowing simpler administration, such a system can obviously be more easily introduced into areas of the country where systems of building control have not been operated up to now.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined how the certification system would work.  I am slightly unhappy with the term &ldquo;appropriate people&rdquo;.  It is vague.  Mainly we have two types of building at present: commercial development and housing development. Could the system proposed by the Minister operate for both types of development? On the question of commercial <Col N="133" /> development, a client depends on an architect and subsequently a contractor to undertake the project, whereas in housing development the project initiator is usually the builder himself.  I wonder how the scheme outlined by the Minister would fit into the two developments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the exclusion of low-rise housing.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The exclusion of low-rise housing and other small works from the control system will significantly reduce the amount of work which will have to be dealt with initially by the building control authorities.  However, I would again emphasise that exclusions from the control procedures will not affect the designer's or builder's obligation to comply with the technical requirements of building regulations in relation to the works concerned.  In any event, consideration will be given to widening the scope of the control regulations as soon as circumstances seem to make such an expansion practicable.</P>
    <P>I have read and re-read that and I feel there is some contradiction there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confused by the reference in the Minister's statement.  It needs to be clarified.  My original reading of it was that low-rise housing would be excluded and yet we are told we must actually comply with the regulations.  Let us take an example of how that would be applied.  The solicitor of a purchaser from a builder who is providing houses for sale will demand some form of evidence that the house was built in accordance with building regulations.  Where does the evidence come from?  The Minister's statement seems to indicate that the house is exempted and, on the other hand, it indicates that it needs to be built to the standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not arguing that houses should be excluded from building regulations, controls or standards.  If they are to be built to specific regulated standards, some form of certification needs to be provided <Col N="134" /> or we will be going around in circles.  If solicitors have not got some form of certification, delays will occur which will add to the purchaser's costs.  This section needs to be clarified.  I am sure that by reference to the files in the Department of the Environment information regarding house starts and completions should be readily available because every start and completion of a house built by a builder for a client is covered by the national house building guarantee scheme and the Department carry out the inspections.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to nominations to the advisory body and I should like the Minister to consider my suggestion as to whether the CIF or membership of the national guarantee scheme should be used.  I am in favour of the national guarantee scheme.  The Minister referred to the difficulty in dealing with the draft regulations.  From the people I spoke to I understand the construction industry would welcome a clear-cut workable document. I hope the Minister will come up with that shortly.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the cost implications and I will not go into them any further.  On section 12 the Minister may by order prohibit the use of certain classes of materials or forms of construction or types of equipment.  I welcome that section.  It is long overdue.  This is an omnibus Bill under which control can be exercised by the building control authorities in a flexible way.  My only serious concern lies with the appeal and enforcement procedures.  They could be tortuous and create difficulties and expense for some local authorities particularly county boroughs like my own in Cork city where building seems to be more dense and diverse than in most other areas.</P>
    <P>Because of that I would prefer to see a clause in the Bill saying in effect that no structure subject to building control under these regulations may be let, sold or occupied without first having received a certificate of compliance from the building control authority and, in appropriate cases, the fire authority.  A clause to that effect would be a more effective penalty than court fines or jail terms for noncompliance. The financial institutions, <Col N="135" /> the lending agencies and the legal profession could come to our aid in enforcing the regulations.  They will always ensure the security of their clients' money.  I ask the Minister to consider an amendment to this effect.  The Bill is long overdue.  It will enable the long awaited regulations to be introduced, I hope, before this Bill is finally passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us has been long awaited.  Surprisingly to date it has generated very little interest inside or outside the House, and certainly in the public press.  It is surprising that this is so in view of the far-reaching effects which the Bill, if enacted, will have.  It is likely to have much the same effect on the physical shape of our towns, housing stock and so on as the planning Acts had in the early sixties.  It is true to say that the effect of those Acts is still working its way through our society.</P>
      <P>We have to have a system of construction standards to control and regulate the building industry.  That is necessary because experience has shown clearly that sufficiently high standards have been sadly lacking down the years.  It should only be necessary to refer to the Stardust tragedy where standards of fire protection were virtually non-existent and to such housing fiascos as the low-cost housing schemes introduced by Fianna Fáil in the early seventies to indicate that.  That type of housing is still causing problems in many areas.  A number of those houses are in my constituency and I am aware that there are some in Cork and other areas.  The cost to local authorities of maintaining those houses as a result of the poor standards of control exercised at the time they were built is phenomenal. It is difficult to see what life span those houses will have.  Without the expenditure of significant amounts of money on them they will not have a very long life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that there is a necessity for a system of control and a need to implement standards to regulate the building industry.  The system must be a formal one because there are vested interests involved in the building industry who <Col N="136" /> contend that the planning Acts are causing them too many problems such as unnecessary delay and expense.  They contend that to add in these building regulations will cause further delay and more expense.  It is also claimed that the simplest form of control is to accept that the building industry has sufficiently high standards at present.</P>
    <P>The examples I have given indicate that the standards in operation are not sufficiently high in all cases and that there is a need for a form of legal control.  The low standards, when they occur, are primarily because of the effective operation of the profit motive in our building industry. From experience in my constituency it seems that when there is a choice between maintaining standards and maintaining profit margins that the standards suffer if the builder involved thinks it is possible to get away with low standards. For this, and many other reasons, it is the duty of the House to enact laws that will regulate and set high standards for the good of the community.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the old by-laws was to secure the public health and safety of the community.  Those aims have been added to by new building regulations and it is proposed to include the convenience and welfare of people in buildings such as making buildings accessible to the disabled or to provide such things as energy conservation and the efficient use of resources.  That is welcome as a general principle and provides an excellent basis for the formation of regulations and standards.  The regulations were published in draft form in 1976 and there has been considerable debate as to their technical content.  I might add that the debate has taken place within the confines of the professional bodies involved and there has been little obvious public debate on their effect or effectiveness.</P>
    <P>There are some serious shortcomings in the regulations but they can be remedied and the general content improved providing a sound basis for standards in the future.  To illustrate one of the features lacking in the building regulations I should like to refer to a debate in the House, if we can call it such because it only lasted a few minutes and was on a <Col N="137" /> Private Member's motion which I moved seeking postal votes for disabled, which was attended by a number of disabled people.  Those people had great difficulty not only in gaining access to the House &mdash; for instance, it was not possible for them to get to the Visitors' Gallery and they were accommodated at the back of the Chamber &mdash; but had also great difficulty in gaining access to a toilet.  The building regulations do not rectify that position.  They do not propose to enable any controlling authority ensure that existing buildings are converted to permit access by the disabled and provide toilets for them.  I am thinking in terms of public buildings in particular where the disabled have a right of access.  They have a right to the same facilities that more able bodied people have.  We should seek a change in the building regulations to ensure that their rights are met.</P>
    <P>The building regulations have been criticised in that, we are told, they are written in what is known as parliamentary English which without considerable experience and practice is difficult to read and understand.  As a means around this it is suggested that a guidebook could be provided which would go a long way towards solving that problem.  I understand that the Minister has indicated that An Foras Forbartha are preparing such a book.  That is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The building regulations have also been accused of being too specific and restricting, particularly regarding opportunities for being innovative in design and allowing for the emergence of new building materials.  It is argued that instead the regulations should be expressed as simple functional requirements. The so-called &ldquo;regarded as satisfying&rdquo; system would go some distance towards overcoming that objection and it is to be hoped that in future further clauses would be added to take into account changing methods and materials. I hope that in time through experience the regulations will become more readily understood and nearer to perfection.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill designates as building control authorities those local authorities who are at present fire authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1981.  This <Col N="138" /> means that there will be in the region of 80 to 90 building control authorities.  I would like the Minister to indicate how the proposed reorganisation of the Dublin sub-region will be affected by this measure.  Is it in this instance the Minister's intention to have one building control authority for the whole of the Dublin sub-region, in other words Dublin city and county and the borough of Dún Laoghaire?</P>
    <P>Section 3 contains the power to make regulations and specifies the buildings to which they will apply and the purposes for which they can be made.  I am not at all happy that the regulations are not to apply to existing buildings and in this regard we will be looking for a date to be set by which all existing buildings will be required to meet the standard of the building regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides the power for building control authorities to dispense with or relax provisions of the building regulations in individual cases.  It is noted that an independent arbitrator will adjudicate in situations where there is no agreement.  That is a totally unsatisfactory way of dealing with the matter.  We believe that bodies similar to An Bord Pleanála should have the powers to adjudicate on disagreements.  Also, I ask the Minister if this proposal goes forward who is to pay the arbitrator's fees?  Is it the Minister or the objector?</P>
    <P>A large number of materials are produced the use of which in the building industry should be strictly controlled.  It goes without saying that materials such as asbestos and in particular polyurethene foams which give off dangerous fumes when burning should be strictly controlled.  In my view polyurethene foams should be banned entirely from use in the building industry.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 6, we believe that the introduction of building regulations will have a lasting and profound effect on the building industry and the built environment generally.  As I said earlier, this effect will be as large and revolutionery as the changes which were brought about by the Planning Act of 1963 and subsequent Acts.  Section 6 of this Bill introduces the concept of privatisation and <Col N="139" /> self-certification into building control matters which were traditionally dealt with by the public authorities under public law.  For that reason we have very serious objections to that section.  It is significant that the Bill is not accompanied by any consultative documents dealing with the proposed control system. That the Minister can expect the House here to debate a Bill which purports to set about controlling the building industry in this way without indicating in detail what kind of control system he proposes to operate is unrealistic on his part.  Possibly this debate is on a par with the other debate going on in this House on the Criminal Justice Bill under which we are being asked to give fairly wide powers to the Garda, again without having details of controls and various other matters which could have a bearing on whether this House passes the Bill. Before the debate on this question goes much further the precise system of control the Minister proposes to operate should be put before us in this House.</P>
    <P>However, a number of pieces of information are available which perhaps indicate the line the Minister proposes to move along.  We have not got the details, but I would like to refer to three matters which need to be dealt with.  First, section 6, the main part of the Bill, probably is copied entirely from British experience without any benefit being taken from that experience.  Up to 1979 there was little enthusiasm for drastic reform of the building control system in use since the early sixties.  This system was far from perfect but when examined closely it proved to be basically good.  It had developed in response to needs over hundreds of years and had the merit of having been tested in use, being familiar to those who needed to use it as well as to those who administered it.  Furthermore, there was a constant process whereby the building regulations themselves were being simplified to basic functional requirements, as I mentioned earlier, in the so-called &ldquo;deemed to be satisfied&rdquo; system.  However, this was not good enough &mdash; I am speaking about the British experience. After the 1979 election the new Environment <Col N="140" /> Minister, Mr. Michael Heseltine, saw a golden opportunity to indulge in two favourite Tory pastimes, bureaucracy-bashing and, of course, privatisation.</P>
    <P>This concept originated across the water and we seem to be taking it on board.  It seems strange that a Department with a Labour Minister is proposing that this form of privatisation should occur.  The concept of privatisation and self-certification into building control matters, which traditionally were dealt with by public authorities under public law, is being introduced in section 6.  It is significant that the Bill is not accompanied by consultative documents dealing with the control system.  How the Minister expects the House to discuss the Bill honestly and sincerely in the absence of such critical information is beyond comprehension.  However, I will deal with the bits of information which we have.</P>
    <P>Before doing so I will refer to three matters of a political nature which have arisen as a result of the Bill.  First, section 6, which is the main part of the Bill, is slavishly copied from the British experience without any benefit gained from their experience.  Up to 1979 there was little enthusiasm for drastic reform of the building control system in use since the sixties.  That system was far from perfect but when examined closely it was basically a good one which had developed in response to needs over hundreds of years and had the merit of having been tested in use, being familiar to those who needed to use it as well as those who administered it.  Furthermore, there was a constant process whereby the building regulations were being simplified down to basic functional requirements as in the &ldquo;deemed-to-satisfy&rdquo; system.</P>
    <P>However, in Britain this was not good enough for the Tories after the 1979 election victory and the new Environment Minister saw a golden opportunity to induge this favourite Tory pastime of bureaucracy-bashing and privatisation which has produced the 1984 Housing and Building Control Bill in Britain.</P>
    <P>Much of the foregoing probably explains why much of the debate on this <Col N="141" /> Bill is clouded in secrecy.  Obviously it is not in the interests of individuals concerned to be identified closely with the interests of private consultants and the proposed stranglehold which private consultants will now be permitted with the introduction of private certification.  It is my information that the Minister all along has been holding secret negotiations and consultations with the representatives of private consultants in organisations such as the Royal Institute of Architecture in Ireland, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, the Institute of Engineers in Ireland and the CIF.  It is also our information that he has been unable to reach agreement with those people, who apparently have a veto boycott over the introduction of the control system by threatening not to participate in the certification process.  This will make nonsense of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The failure by the Minister to negotiate agreement between these competing bodies has denied this House information on the control system which it is entitled to have, which it is essential to have if we are to legislate effectively through a Bill. Will the Minister inform the House on the discussions he has had with the trade union movement in regard to this Bill? For instance, what will happen eventually to the workers in the building by-law departments in Dublin and Cork now that they are to be phased out?</P>
    <P>As I have said, the effect of this Bill will be far reaching and we should now think carefully of these new proposals, for a number of reasons.  First, we must ensure that the emerging regime of control will assist the efficient and orderly development of the building industry. Second, we must create a system of control which will have the confidence and support of the public.</P>
    <P>To achieve these aims the system of control must be easy to understand as well as being effective from the point of view of the consumer.  From the information to hand, the proposals for certification will not achieve the desired aim &mdash; indeed they will have the exact opposite effect.  The proposals are not only cumbersome but tortuous.  The opportunities for conflict, misunderstanding <Col N="142" /> and abuse inevitably will lead to long delays and cause large increases in building costs.</P>
    <P>Who will write the certificates?  This question is fundamental to the control system.  Presumably the certifiers will be people such as architects, engineers, surveyors, builders, technicians etc. &mdash; the list could be endless.  How will those people be prescribed?  Will the Minister appoint them?  Who will decide who is suitable to be a certifier and who is not? If the Minister is not to be involved in the vetting of individuals, is it intended that the professional consultant bodies will perform vetting duties?  Perhaps the myriad organisations representing the various professional, technical and building bodies will each nominate certifiers in their own areas, or will the Government set up a &ldquo;quango&rdquo; to certify certifiers? Can we be given the answers to these questions?</P>
    <P>There are a thousand other questions which must be answered.  Will there be different grades of certifiers for electrical work, mechanical work and building work?  If, for instance, architects are to be approved certifiers will they be allowed to certify their own designs? There is not much objectivity there.  Will self-certification be limited?</P>
    <P>What about fees and the cost of certifiers? Obviously a certifier will have to carry out a detailed analysis of any submission to him before he will write a certificate of compliance.  This will involve considerable cost and each certifier must have full administrative backup to do a proper job, in much the same way as local authorities process building by-law applications at present.  He or she will have to carry insurance cover and the cost of this plus the administrative and other costs will ensure that considerable fees will be charged by certifiers.  It is significant that this service currently is provided free of charge by the building by-law departments in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>From the consumers' point of view the new system of control must ensure that they will have the right of redress in the event of negligence.  If negligence is proved, the guilty party must pay.  Is it intended to limit the period during which <Col N="143" /> it will be possible to sue for negligence or damages?  Will the right to redress shift back to the local authorities in such cases as appears to be the position in Britain consequent on court cases there?  If that is to be the procedure, why remove that right from local authorities in the first place?  Is the Minister negotiating insurance guidelines with the private consultant bodies?  It was suggested in Britain, for example, that a minimum of £1 million by way of cover would be necessary for individuals engaged in private certification. Would that be adequate insurance in the event of a very large building being constructed and for how many years would the cover last?  There are many questions which remain to be answered and it is not possible for this House to continue realistically with the Bill until such time as the Minister provides other information on all these matters. It is not proper for the House to give the Minister power to introduce a controlling regulation certifying system without this House having examined that system and agreed on its being the correct one.</P>
    <P>The system of building control we would favour would be one which would ensure that local authorities in Dublin and Cork retain their existing powers and that these powers be extended to the rest of the country.  While county councils and county boroughs as well as urban district councils all apply and enforce the Planning and Development Act only seven of a total of more than 80 authorities administer building by-laws and of these only four have special staff and back up to deal with the technical aspects of by-laws. Our view would be that the building regulations be introduced to replace the by-laws as a first step and then to extend the administration of the regulations throughout the 80 planning authorities by acquiring the necessary technical staff over a phased period.  It would be necessary to introduce a control system of application for approval under the building regulations and to follow up with a system of inspection of building works. In addition we would propose the introduction of a statutory period of six weeks <Col N="144" /> for dealing with all applications maintaining the existing liability situation which has proved down the years to be adequate. It should be the case also that where commercial applications are being made for approval under building regulations, these applications are charged for at a commercial rate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I reiterate that we consider the Bill to be totally inadequate. The Minister is asking us to empower him to introduce a control system about which we have not a clue apart from bits and pieces of information picked up here and there.  We are aware that some negotiations are in progress in the background with some bodies but as of now we are being sold a pig in a poke.  The Minister has not come clean.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Bill is being considered in the light of the Fire Services Act, 1981 because the two form a very important duo in dealing with building control, specifically in the context of fire regulations.  The backdrop to our deliberations here must be the Stardust tragedy and the deficiencies in building control revealed during the inquiry that followed that tragedy.  The Stardust tragedy is etched in the memory of all Irish people but especially in the minds of certain families in my constituency.  It is worth recalling the deficiencies that were identified.  The first concerned the Planning Acts whereby the dubious legality of the conditions placed on planning permission was raised by the tribunal. Although there were conditions imposed they were not adequately enforced by the operators of the premises on the occasion of the tragedy.  The tribunal commented that the legal force of the conditions was in doubt.  It is very important that that problem be met and that is what we are trying to do in this Bill.  Equally, serious deficiencies were shown up in terms of by-laws.  One of these related to the minimum penalties being imposed for breaches of the by-laws, also their lack of legal force and the deficiencies among the inspectorate who took a very narrow view, according to the tribunal, of their duties in relation to the by-laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft building regulations were <Col N="145" /> before the people who designed that building but they were not complied with, especially in respect of timber partitions, electrical fittings, wall linings, seat coverings and so on.  In a very large way these deficiencies contributed to the tragedy that followed.</P>
    <P>It is critical that this Bill would fill the legal gap whereby the draft building regulations had no legal force.  The big deficiency identified was in the area of fire management where notices, drill, equipment and so on were deficient and where exists were locked.  The legislation before us today goes a long way towards remedying the deficiencies identified in the Stardust case.  I welcome in particular the comprehensive cover which includes electrical insulations, fire detection appliances, means of escape and so on.  There are proposals in the legislation, too, for the imposition of proper penalties and full legality is being given to the system of inspection and enforcement.  In addition they include the requirement that fire-safety certificates are not to be granted on a self-certification basis.  The single greatest conclusion emerging from the Stardust Tribunal was that local authorities must not run away from their responsibilities in relation to fire.  In recognition of this, the Minister is proposing in this Bill that fire-safety certificates be granted on an approval basis and not on a self-certification system which is the system proposed for many other types of building control issues.</P>
    <P>While there is real progress in so far as the legislation is concerned we cannot be sanguine that we have either a modern fire safety code or an effective fire safety organisation to implement such a code. The recent RTE programme which detailed enormous defects in buildings already in use as places of public assembly would strengthen our feeling that we are seriously defective in this area.</P>
    <P>Staff of the required expertise must be available in the fire authorities if they are to monitor and enforce building controls. It is clear that at present staff of the required expertise are not available.  This is a serious deficiency that will have to be tackled.  The Minister has met my next point to some extent and that is co-ordination <Col N="146" /> under the two Acts.  The precautions required under the Fire Services Act would have been more easily implemented if they were specified at design stage.  It is important that the personnel who would be looking at the Fire Services Act, which lays down the precautions necessary for management of a premises, would work in close co-operation with those who set out the design qualities of a premises.  The Minister has recognised that by making the fire authority the building control authority.  While it is good that the powers rest in the same authority, it is necessary to ensure that the two systems work together and that we do not have unnecessary headaches as a result of lack of co-ordination.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that we do not have any fire management regulations before us.  I know that the fire service council are working on these.  The Bill was introduced in 1981 and we still have no regulations.  The recent RTE programme illustrated areas of deficiency as regards ensuring that there is adequate management. The sooner we have management regulations the better.</P>
    <P>The need to get a licence is haphazard in that it applies only to places of public assembly which actually require a licence. Many places of public assembly would not come under that criterion. There is a serious problem to be solved there.</P>
    <P>This Bill is enabling legislation.  No regulations are implemented as yet.  To read the Bill and the commitment to set up a body to consult and consider a way in which control can be enforced, would lead one to believe that it will be a considerable time before there are regulations.  We are still in the limbo of legal unenforceability identified by the Stardust Tribunal.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously the recommendations of that tribunal especially where they suggested that regulations should be introduced immediately.  That would meet the deficiencies identified in their report as regards materials used and so on.  They also recommended the immediate introduction of fire certificates for places of concentrated indoor assembly.  I am concerned that this will not be implemented <Col N="147" /> until consultations are in progress.  That is my reading of the Bill.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that fire certificates will be required immediately for places of concentrated indoor assembly and that we will not have to wait for tortuous negotiations on how the controls should be implemented in other areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider seriously the problem regarding existing premises. The Stardust Tribunal clearly recommended that the building controls where they related to fire should be brought in for existing buildings as well as for buildings that are at construction stage.  The specific items they mentioned related to escape, coverings used, warning and detection systems.  They are not items which have a major structural bearing but are critically important in relation to the safety of such places of assembly.  The Minister should seriously consider extending the scope of the Bill so that certain controls would apply to existing buildings.  Perhaps he will be able to meet that when he brings in the fire regulations.  Certain structural items of a minor nature will still remain which should be enforced in all existing buildings as well as in those which are newly constructed.</P>
    <P>Important questions are left unanswered by the Bill.  One is the process of control and the other is the issue of liability. Under the process of control I support the Minister's contention that self-certification in the non-fire area is the correct response.  I am convinced that responsibility must be placed fairly and squarely on the professional designers who are on site.  They should not be allowed to rely on local authorities to ensure that standards are met.  It is their job to ensure that, from design to completion, standards are observed.  It is only sensible that self-certification should be the response in that area.  However, if self-certification is to be effective there must be random checking.  If that is to be administered properly there must be staff to do it.  A system of self-certification would reduce the staff requirement but people would still be required to spot check and ensure that where deficiencies <Col N="148" /> arise strong action would be taken against the errant party.</P>
    <P>One issue not touched on by the Minister was that of qualifications required for people who issue certificates.  Stardust showed us that those commissioned were not adequately aware of the implications of the draft building regulations.  If we rely on self-certification we must specify what qualifications are needed.  We must ensure that they are rigidly laid down or that some specialist agency would provide advice on a fee basis.</P>
    <P>Liability falls on the certifier or builder in the case of self-certification.  One issue to be dealt with is how long liability would last and what limits there are on liability. If these points are not clarified it will be very difficult for those who have to certify the buildings.  This Bill attempts to remove all liability from local authorities but the fact that they have power to verify and inspect may impose certain legal liability on them particularly where they make a spot check.  UK case law puts liability on them.  This comes into starker relief where we have the approval system under the fire items.  Liability will clearly fall there on the local authorities.  This is not met in the Bill.  There is a danger that the building control system, in cases where the approval system is used, will put heavy liability on the local authorities not already catered for.  I ask the Minister to clarify that area.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann declares that, in view of the revelation that the 1984 budget was falsely based, it no longer has confidence in the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>We are pressing this motion tonight because we believe in one of the most fundamental democratic principles, the principle of ministerial responsibility before Parliament.  The Minister for Finance is responsible not only for his own actions, but for the actions of officials of his Department.  We are not talking about some minor administrative or executive error by a junior official, which can occur under any administration.  We are talking about a major blunder, which undermines not only the Government's but the country's financial credibility, and demolishes completely one of the pillars on which the Government's whole budgetary strategy was based.</P>
      <P>Up till last week we were led to believe by the Government that the balance of payments deficit on current account had been reduced in two years from almost £1,400 million to £350 million, in other words, that it had been reduced to a quarter of what it was, since the effects of the second oil crisis were at their height.  Now we learn that in fact the reduction, from almost £1,600 million to £863 million, did not even halve the balance of payments deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> For months now the Government have been desperately pointing to the dramatic reduction in the balance of payments deficit as evidence of a success resulting from Government policy.  This claim was never an honest one.  The Taoiseach, speaking in this House on his nomination on 14 December 1982, after a year in which we also had effected a significant reduction in the balance of payments deficit, indeed a part of the reduction the Government are now claiming credit for said and, I quote, &ldquo;certainly the improvement in the balance of payments reflects particularly the depth of that recession&rdquo;, Volume 339, column 49 of the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The Government, this Minister and this Taoiseach came to power originally in July 1981 on very specific promises. They presented themselves as the apostles of a new and superior fiscal rectitude. They juggled with figures, they extrapolated them.  They left the electorate worried, confused and demoralised.</P>
    <P>The principal qualification the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance tried to present to the public is their alleged capacity as the people who get the sums right.  Not everyone in this State, to put it at its mildest, understands fully the balance of payments deficit, the current budget deficit, the level of borrowing and a host of other important economic variables. They understand however that these things are important to the nation's financial standing in the world and to our ability to undertake necessary borrowing. They were brainwashed up till last week that this Government understand finance, and that when the Minister for Finance stands up and says that the balance of payment has been reduced from 8½ per cent of GNP to 2½ per cent of GNP in a year that he is speaking the truth and that he knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, this is not the case and the Minister not merely got his sums wrong, but went on misleading the public long after senior officials in his Department and the Central Bank knew the truth.  The Minister is forced to admit that his estimate of the balance of payments deficit is £500 million out, and that it is 6½ per cent of GNP, not 2½ per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> There is now an attempt to suggest that a mistake of this magnitude does not really matter, that it is just a reclassification of accounts.  The balance of payments mattered, when the Minister tried to boast about his spurious success in reducing it to 2½ per cent of GNP.  It mattered when seeking to justify the budget.  This Minister will not succeed in persuading the House or the country that now you have got your sums wrong it no longer matters.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments is along with the borrowing level, to which it is connected, a key indicator as far as the international business and banking community and foreign governments are concerned.  The Minister will not persuade the OECD, the EEC, or the IMF that the size of the balance of payments deficits does not matter.  They will hardly be impressed that they too will have to revise what they have printed about Ireland in recent months, and admit on the basis of information supplied by his Department that they too published misleading information.  It is bound to raise serious doubts in these circles about the competence of the Government and of this Minister for Finace and of their management of the economy.</P>
    <P>The shortest explanation of why the balance of payments deficit matters is given by Dr. Antoin Murphy, the economist who originally highlighted the &ldquo;black hole&rdquo;, in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> this week.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Some commentators, as well as a variety of unofficial spokespersons, have attempted to create the impression that the country is no worse off as a result of the shifting of a large part of the unexplained outflow from the capital account to the current account of the balance of payments.  These people imply that there has been just some reshuffling of the overall balance sheet. Is this a correct interpretation?</P>
    <P>The answer is unequivocally no. There is a fundamental difference between money leaving the country on the current account and money leaving through the capital account.  Money <Col N="152" /> that goes on the current account side leaves the country permanently.  There is no possibility of it returning.  Money leaving the country on the capital account side is invested outside the country and may be repatriated by its owner in the future.  It may be brought back into the country when the investor decides to use it domestically.</P>
    <P>During times of severe recession the balance of payments tends to correct itself, as imports are squeezed.  In 1975 the deficit dropped from 10 per cent of GNP to ½ per cent.  However, in times of growth, as experience of the years 1979-81 show, the balance of payments can prove a real constraint, as the imports are sucked in.  A base of 2½ per cent or less of GNP should in theory provide more room for manoeuvre, when the economy picks up.  A base deficit of 6½ per cent of GNP however provides very little room for manoeuvre at all.  That is the fundamental difference between the two figures.</P>
    <P>Certainly the weekend press did not accept the specious explanations of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> called it &ldquo;a major error&rdquo; and said &ldquo;the Government simply must take responsibility&rdquo;.  It went on:</P>
    <P>It is simply not good enough for the Government to say that the discovery of the &ldquo;Black Hole&rdquo; makes no difference to economic policy.  To say that the Government would have framed the same budgetary strategy confronted by a balance of payments deficit of £350 million or £850 million, is either an indictment of a do-nothing Government or of a Government who failed to grasp the nature of economic policy.  The balance of payments deficit has always been a major constraint on economic policy in Ireland and as a result has always been a central policy target.</P>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Press</i> called the £500 million mistake &ldquo;one of the biggest blunders in the history of the State&rdquo; and &ldquo;furthermore it is a scandal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is attempting to present two fronts at the same time. <Col N="153" /> In public he is maintaining that nothing has happened to cause concern.  However, in press briefings the Government and the Minister are attempting to pass the blame onto departmental officials, to the Central Statistics Office and the Central Bank.  I would like to quote again from the Sunday newspapers.  First, the <i>Sunday Tribune's</i> political correspondent said:</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance, it is now claimed by senior Government sources&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Note this great new word &ldquo;sources&rdquo;.  You never name people.  They masquerade under the handles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;knew the seriousness of the situation a long time ago, but those working on the problem allegedly kept this information to themselves because it conflicted with earlier assessments to Ministers.</P>
      <P>That is a feedout from the Government, from the handlers, trying to put the blame on officials.  The Government should be ashamed of themselves.  <i>The Sunday Press</i> goes even further.  They say that an official of the Department of Finance is suggested as having given advice to the Minister on the basis of which he misled the Dáil on 7 February of this year. Again, this is an attempt to blame officials of the Department of Finance.  Now we have a rather peculiar comment from the political correspondent of the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>  He claims that the withholding of information, the cover-up if you like, was deliberate.  He states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the earlier months of this year, the Department of Finance was negotiating its borrowing for 1984 and also renegotiating some existing loans to take account of falling international <Col N="154" /> interest rates.  The Government then identifying a problem to which as yet they could offer no solution, would serve only to raise fears, reduce international confidence and prejudge the terms on which borrowing could be secured.</P>
    <P>This argument of political expediency was presumably put to him by some Government source but in effect means that the honesty and credibility of the Government's figures will inevitably be suspect in future.  It is a strange standard of journalism to suggest that it is all right for a Government to mislead the country and the world about the budget and the balance of payments deficit provided they are doing it for some peculiar purpose of their own.</P>
    <P>I regard it as scandalous that the Government should, as a matter of policy, seek to blame officers for ministerial error.  It is an attempt by the Government to subvert the principle of ministerial responsibility on which parliamentary democracy is based.  Is the Minister for Finance accountable or not accountable to Dáil Éireann for the budget, for the information he gives in reply to questions in the Dáil, for the speeches and statements he makes?  Or should we invite officers of the Department of Finance to answer this debate, and to present the budget in future?  Is the Minister just a cypher, a mouthpiece for his Department, without independent judgment?  Is the Minister or is the Minister not in political control of his Department?  If the Minister for Finance is not responsible for the nation's finances, then he should not be Minister for Finance.  That is why we are expressing no confidence in him and that is why he should resign. I want the Minister, first of all, here this afternoon to state publicly that he accepts responsibility for the error, and to repudiate the aspersions that have been cast on his senior officials &mdash; something never done in this House before, as far as I can recall, by any Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>We in this House are going to hold Ministers accountable for their actions. The functioning of democracy requires Government accountability.  We cannot <Col N="155" /> allow blame for misleading statements by the Minister for Finance to be passed on to individuals or institutions not directly accountable to us.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have just quoted that the true situation was known for a considerable time.  The Minister presented a budget based on information known to be false.  That is quite sufficient cause for demanding here tonight that the Minister should resign.</P>
    <P>In condemning the Minister who is responsible to this House for his Department, I am not implying that other institutions are free of blame.  The information that would explain the &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; that grew enormous in 1983 was apparently available in the Central Bank.  The Central Bank's latest report published last week was written as if the now discredited figures were still valid.  I would accept, too, that the operational methods of the Central Statistics Office require examination and updating.  But I reject imposition of the form of political control by means of a Government appointed Statistical Council as the correct way of doing this.  The liaison between the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Central Statistics Office definitely has been shown to be in a lamentable position.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the House the trick which this Government are now attempting to perpetrate.  Day by day, week by week and month by month the statistics going out from the Central Statistics Office make it abundantly clear that their economic and financial policies are a disaster and that they are leading this country into economic ruin.  Now they decide that perhaps they should have a say in these statistics.  Up to now in this country we have always had totally objective, impartial statistics produced by a completely independent office.  Now the Taoiseach proposes to appoint a politically appointed board, or council &mdash; call it what you will &mdash; to supervise the Central Statistics Office.  We reject that. That is not acceptable to us and I believe that it will not be acceptable to the country. Whatever else we may argue, dispute or debate about in this House, at least we <Col N="156" /> should have totally reliable statistics from non-political sources.</P>
    <P>This episode is the second major blow to confidence for which the Minister for Finance has been responsible this year. His Budget Statement, you will recall, brought the Stock Exchange to a standstill. As a result of that he had to go and do the very thing that he had been preaching against since he became Minister for Finance &mdash; borrow abroad.  He cut off from himself, by his own stupidity, the resource, access to domestic borrowing. As a result, in January to March of this year he has had to rely to an unprecedented extent on foreign borrowing and, as I pointed out last week, in the first three months of this year alone he borrowed about 80 per cent of last year's total foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>The sad reality is that the Government have not succeeded, even by the crushing taxation which they have imposed on the country, any worthwhile improvement in the public finances.  The current budget deficit is now into four figures for the first time, and as far as ever from being phased out.  The national debt increased by a record £3 billion last year, and the foreign debt by a record £1.7 billion.  Since June 1981, indeed, the foreign debt has grown from less than £3 billion to £7½ billion.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget came, by the Minister's own admission on budget day, as a &ldquo;shock to the economy&rdquo;.  What did it achieve?  The Minister's Budget Statement, if he were honest to this House, should now be amended and the crucial sentence in that Budget Statement should now be amended in the light of the facts which have been disclosed to the following: &ldquo;While inflation has come down somewhat &mdash; not significantly &mdash; and the balance of payments problem has been slightly alleviated &mdash; not greatly &mdash; consumption has declined, investment has fallen, unemployment has risen and growth has been stifled&rdquo;.  This treatment had all the primitiveness of mediaeval medicine.  Bleed the patient to death, if you call it a cure.</P>
    <P>In my view, the recent reduction in the unemployment figures reflect increasing emigration.  I do not think there can be very much doubt about that.  A reduction <Col N="157" /> in unemployment achieved by increased emigration is the hallmark of failure, not of success.  One of the achievements of which we can be most proud over the last 20 years was that not merely did we halt emigration, but we actually made it possible for thousands of Irish people to return to take up jobs in this country.  I remember being in Donegal when a teacher of a class pointed out to me with pride that one out of every five children in that school was the son or daughter of a returned emigrant.  Is it Fine Gael strategy now to deal with unemployment by means of emigration?  Is that what it has come to?</P>
    <P>Lack of confidence in the Minister for Finance is not confined to this side of the House.  On a number of occasions last year the Labour Party and their Leader showed that they had not confidence in this Minister for Finance, in relation to the size of the deficit, in relation to tax reform and in relation to expenditure cuts.  There is virtually no group in this country, be they the farmers, the trade unions or the employers, not to mention those on social welfare, who have any confidence in the Minister for Finance, as shown by their comments following the presentation of his two budgets.  The collapse in private investment last year and the size of the profits repatriated in 1983 show that investors have no confidence, either, in the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to return to where I started.  The Minister for Finance, misled this House in his Budget Statement and in reply to a question by Deputy O'Kennedy on 7 February 1984.  He made statements which were known at the most senior levels in his Department &mdash; and as far as we know, by the Minister himself and the Taoiseach &mdash; to be false. He not merely made misleading statements, he actually made claims which can now only be regarded as fraudulent, not once but on several occasions.  He has undermined trust and confidence in the national finances.  The principle of ministerial responsibility is fundamental to the operations of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>His attempt to deny or to sidetrack that <Col N="158" /> responsibility cannot and will not be accepted by this House.  That is why we have no confidence in the Minister and that is why we are calling upon him to resign.  Before this debate ends, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance must deal with one very important issue &mdash; that is their credibility in this matter.  I point again to the document published before the budget &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget, 1984,&rdquo; on page 8, of which it is stated:</P>
    <P>The coverage of the statistics for the national balance of payments is being reviewed and the results which may be available later this year could require the estimates of the current accounts deficit for recent years to be revised. However, the revisions are unlikely to alter significantly the improvement in the trend in the period under review.</P>
    <P>The key word there is &ldquo;current&rdquo; and I want to direct the House's attention to it. They knew before they brought in the budget that there was something wrong on the current side.  I want to suggest that if they knew it was on the current side that the mistake was, they must also have had some very good idea of the size of the mistake.  I want the Minister to come clean with this House in the course of this debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This presentation this evening by the Leader of the Opposition seems to me and to anybody listening to him to have been culled very largely from last Sunday's newspapers.  I am bound to <Col N="160" /> say that it was a statement that was delivered without any particular appearance of passion or conviction one way or the other.

I assure the Chair I have no difficulty whatsoever in standing over anything I have said in the House, published or carried out in terms of economic policy in the last two and a half years.  Let us look back over what has been happening. The Opposition have criticised budgetary policy in 1983 and 1984.</P>

      <P>They have had remarks to make about planning over that period.  I would like the House to reflect on what has happened and, in particular, on the role of the Leader of the Opposition in economic policy over the last four years. In 1980, when the Leader of the Opposition had a majority of 20 seats in this House and when he actively identified the problems facing us, he walked away from them in the same way that he is walking away from this debate this evening.</P>

He did not take that opportunity.  As far as planning is concerned let us look at the immediate record of this Opposition in relation to planning, a Government which produced <Col N="161" /> a plan in October 1982 and repudiated it within a matter of a few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the comprehension this Opposition have of what economic planning is all about.  We have heard criticism during the course of last year and this year by the Opposition, as we have heard this evening, of the level of the current budget deficit, the Opposition criticising the level of the balance of payments deficit and the level of borrowing. I would like to know &mdash; I have not been able to discern it since December 1982 &mdash; which way the Opposition are facing on any one of these issues.  The discussions we have heard since December 1982 and on this matter we are discussing tonight have shown the Opposition facing several different ways at the one time.</P>
      <P>The Opposition would have us believe, for example, that they would like to make more progress against the current budget deficit, yet they would have us believe that we should not reduce expenditure. The Opposition would have us believe that we should make an even greater attack on the balance of payments deficit, yet they would have us believe they are against deflationary policies at a domestic level.  That is an example of an Opposition who do not know which way to face on economic policies and who have produced no single proposal since December 1982 aimed at dealing with any of the problems in relation to which they have criticised the Government, with the exception of one: Deputy O'Kennedy claims to have found overspending, or what he thinks is overspending, in relation to consultancy services.  It is the only area on which we have had any specific indication from the Opposition in relation to what they would do in terms of policy.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition claims that this years's budget was based on information which was known to be false.  He has asked me specifically if I withheld information from this House and from the public.  I want to say categorically that I have not withheld information. In fact, if the Leader of the Opposition were only to reflect for a moment when he read that passage from the Economic Background to the Budget, he would have understood what we knew at that time, and I repeat that I stand over everything that was said in that document. We knew at that stage that a revision of the balance of payments figures would be required.  We knew at that stage that the revision would be on the current side.  We did not know at that stage what the size of the revision would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I forecast at that stage that it would not show a major change from the underlying improving trends in the balance of payments deficit.  That has been borne out by the revised figures published by the Central Statistics Office. Deputy Haughey obviously did not listen the other evening and he raised again the question of the level of foreign borrowing during the first quarter of this year.  I ask the Opposition, and Deputy Haughey if he were here to hear me, to think a little longer before shouting about a matter like that.  In the first quarter of this year and since then it has been a prudent and necessary thing to do to arrange as much of our foreign borrowing programme in the early part of the year as we could.</P>

      <P>I will get back to the Deputy in a moment.  Anybody with half a head on his shoulders looking at the <Col N="163" /> international banking and credit scene today would realise that was the proper and most prudent policy to follow this year.  That is why we have followed it and I believe it has been a very good experience and has paid off.  I want also to say that the international banking community have understood perfectly well what is involved in the revision of our balance of payments statistics because we have had no adverse reaction whatsoever from the publication of the figures.  I could not put it better than a phrase which came to me the other day when speaking to somebody in Laois-Offaly about what was going on.  He asked me: &ldquo;What is all this about a black hole?&rdquo;&mdash; the greatest misnomer that was ever put on it.  I told him: &ldquo;It is like waking up in the morning with your nose blocked, your throat feeling sore and pains in your knees and elbows.  You do not know what is wrong so you call the doctor.  He comes sometime after and you explain the symptoms to him.  He says &lsquo;Yes, you have the flu&rsquo;.  You are neither worse nor better off for knowing that you have the flu&rdquo;.  That is the best parallel I can draw to this.</P>

      <P>We have heard this evening some fairly extraordinary allegations from the Leader of the Opposition about what was going on here and some curious definitions and allegations as to what was being said about civil servants. I will not accept a single allegation from anybody on the other side about what I have said about people working in the <Col N="164" /> Central, Bank, the Civil Service or the Central Statistics Office because I have not made any comment about them.  It is very interesting to see that in the same newspaper article to which Deputy Haughey referred, based on whatever winds of rumours could be gathered, we have a direct quotation from a front bench Member of the Opposition party. We have the disedifying spectacle of Deputy Ray MacSharry now shifting the blame for the revenue shortfall in 1982 by claiming that what happened then was not that the figures were got wrong by the Government but that the Revenue Commissioners were getting so much stick for understimating the revenue figures that they decided to overestimate them.  That is the comment he is reported to have made.  That is the kind of dance in which I have not engaged and will not engage.</P>
      <P>The Opposition and some commentators have been referring to this matter &mdash; the infamous &ldquo;black hole&rdquo;, to use the buzz word &mdash; in terms that show very clearly either that they do not understand it or do not want anybody else to understand it.  It has been referred to, for example, as an unrecorded outflow.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is an outflow that has been recorded for quite some time and my concern and that of the Government has been to find out the explanation.  We have done so and it has been published by the Central Statistics Office.  We now know exactly where the outflows arose. Now that the explanation has been furnished, for which the Opposition have been asking since earlier this year, we have the spectacle of the Opposition kicking up because the explanation does not conform with their hopeful prejudices. We have the extraordinary spectacle of an Opposition, who claim to have been active in inviting foreign industry to come to this country, criticising the very same industry for doing the thing we want them to do, that is, to make profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is merely an outline of my reaction to this Opposition motion.  It has been put forward by an increasingly desperate and directionless Opposition because they have no particular course to put before the people in terms of economic <Col N="165" /> policy.  This Government have never made any secret of the direction of their economic policy and I have never made any secret of my determination to carry on in that line because those are the policies which will deal with the problems that face us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what this main argument is about.  We have had statements from the Opposition about the central importance to budgetary policy of the balance of payments deficit.  I had occasion to remark the other evening that if Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Haughey ever based their central budgetary strategy on the absolute level of the balance of payments deficit it is no wonder they were so far out in the policies they pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious motion put down with serious intent because the balance of payments is the basic barometer on which we can base our financial and economic strategy.  I take it that statement would find acceptance within financial institutions at home and abroad.  The fundamental error by the Government in completely misreading our current balance of payments position represents a high degree of irresponsibility on their part and must lead to a loss of confidence on the part of financial institutions both here and abroad.  There is no point in having a blustering debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in introducing the 1984 budget only a few months ago, made a substantial claim in regard to the balance of payments position.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While inflation has come down significantly and the balance of payments <Col N="166" /> problem has been greatly alleviated...</P>
    <P>These are the words he used in the major economic speech on behalf of the Government.  At this stage it appears that &ldquo;alleviated&rdquo; was hardly the correct word. The balance of payments position has been exacerbated by at least £500 million and that is only what can be ascertained on the basis of the repatriation of profits from industries here on current account. It does not account for further possible substantial leakages of money by reason of the erosion of confidence in other investor areas.  On the single ground of export or repatriation of profits in certain specified and ascertained industries, the figure at bottom line is £500 million more than anticipated by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech.  In view of the seriousness of this motion, the Minister owed it to this House to explain the situation where, on the one hand, he claimed that the balance of payments problem had been greatly alleviated while, on the other hand, it now appears to have been exacerbated by at least £500 million.</P>

      <P>The balance of payments deficit was reduced from over 8½ per cent of GNP in 1982 to about 2½ per cent in 1983.</P>

      <P>I do not want to engage in cross-talk but I would suggest that the Minister could hardly stand over the balance of payments deficit relationship of 8.5 per cent of GNP in 1982 to 2.5 per cent in 1983.  Does he still stand by that relationship of 2.5 per cent?</P>

      <P>The budget statement issued by the Minister for Finance is provenly wrong.  There cannot be a relationship of 2.5 per cent in 1983 between balance of payments deficit and GNP.  The claimed reduction is untrue.  It is obvious that the relationship mentioned of 2.5 per cent in 1983 is blatantly wrong.  There is no point in the Minister dodging the issue and stating merely that it will have to be revised.  The Minister has been wrong with regard to two fundamental elements in the area of balance of payments. Essentially that is the reason we put down this motion.  We are a trading country and our balance of payments is the basis on which economic and financial policy can be decided.  It is far more important than the budget deficit about which there has been so much public debate.  The Minister for Finance has been blatantly wrong in his assessment of our balance of payments position as it stood a few months ago.</P>
      <P>The serious aspect is the way this will be interpreted by financial institutions at home and abroad.  If we cannot read our balance of payments right, then we can do nothing right.  As a trading country we should be able to read our balance of payments position.  We have the statistics available or we should be able to have them available.  There is no point in the Minister saying that mistakes were made in the CSO or in the Central Bank.  The most elementary application to the job should have ensured that at least the balance of payments figures were right, because in a country like Ireland they are very uncomplicated figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> As has been borne out by economists who have made contributions on this matter, the Government have pursued a negative policy in curtailing capital expenditure on the capital budget side. Because they have regarded the balance of payments situation as presenting no problem, they have allowed themselves to be deluded into thinking that they could benefit only from this form of investment while ignoring home investment if they did not have this albatross tors could provide immediate employment if they did not have this albatross around their necks with regard to the capital budget.</P>
    <P>Instead of dealing with the current budget and with the balance of payments problem, as they should have done, the Government proceeded to take the easy option for ideological reasons.  The easy option was to curtail capital expenditure but the main sufferer was the construction industry.  That industry does not cause any balance of payments problems because 75 per cent of the requirements of the industry come from the home market. It provides the greatest spin-off but it has been neglected in the past two years.</P>
    <P>This Government are pursuing the wrong economic objectives and are following the wrong economic indicators. They have ignored the construction industry and other enterprises by Irish enterpreneurs that would not have involved any repatriation of profits as happened.  This Government must be severely indicated.  They could not see the wood for the trees and they misread the range of economic options open to them. One such option was to stimulate Irish industry at home, such as the construction and the tourism industry these industries employ Irish labour, they depend to a far lesser degree on foreign inputs and they are free from any danger of repatriation of profits.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government should come clean on the matter.  I am thinking of the economy and of the future of this country and I am not interested in scoring political points.  We are concerned about the level of employment and where employment can be placed. <Col N="169" /> We can only do that if we have our balance of payments position right and if we concentrate on industries that interfere as little as possible with the balance of payments.  The tourism and construction industries, instead of receiving maximum support from the Government, have received minimum support from them.</P>
    <P>In my view the £500 million represents only the bottom line in respect of the repatriation of profits.  I said before, and I stand over it, that the figure will be in the region of £800 million eventually. Because of the ideological conflict between Fine Gael and the Labour Party there has been a serious outflow of funds.</P>

      <P>These funds could have been available for investment here.  Further amounts are in danger of following the £500 million.  We have taken the extreme step of putting down a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Finance to ensure that there does not develop a complete and total lack of confidence in our country.  Part of the Government are advocating steps that are totally unacceptable to Irish society.  There is no point in chasing hares, for example, the National Development Corporation or the nationalisation of banks or in hinting about such matters as the Tánaiste has been doing recently.  That is all nonsense. If this Government wish to encourage employment they must devise a range of taxation incentives to encourage employment. In particular, they must encourage small and medium-sized operators and entrepreneurs at home in a whole range of services and manufacturing employment. That is the kind of positive action the Government should take.  People with enterprise and initiative &mdash; those traditional Irish characteristics &mdash; are holding back.  They are not making the decisions necessary to provide employment.</P>

As long as that exists we will have this Minister for Finance boasting about bringing in neutral budgets.  We do not want neutral budgets.  We do not want neutral positions which can be built up into a &ldquo;cosmetic halo&rdquo; by a few handlers who are professionally employed to organise this.  Politics are about serious business and not about a Government submitting themselves to the massage of the national handlers.  If the Government want to take that soft option, they can do so, hire them and pay them well from the public purse.  It is one area of public purse activity that has increased enormously in the last 12 months.</P>

      <P>The Government again got their priorities wrong in this area because, for once, the Minister for Finance got his script printed, published and read in the House without any assistance from his ideological friends in the Labour Party.  There was not a single mention in the budget speech about the grave social evil of unemployment which is the major problem facing us.  The Government have all their priorities upside down and, instead of looking after basic matters such as the reduction of unemployment, job creation for our young people, spreading taxation as equitably as possible, ensuring that there are incentives available to small and medium sized Irish industrialists and people in the service industries to give employment, they ignored all these matters and chased hares of an ideological kind which will go nowhere and succeed in running this Government into the ground.  From talking to a number of people at all levels in society in recent <Col N="171" /> weeks I can assure the Minister for Finance that the universal feeling at present is that he has failed.  The final nail in the coffin is his performance in eroding confidence in what was a respected institution of the State.  The advice given by a Minister for Finance in his budget speech and the behaviour of the financial institutions in the State were the basic strengths of our economy over the years and the credibility on which we were able to establish a creditworthiness to raise the necessary funds essential for economic developments.  These fundamental aspects have been very seriously eroded and damaged by the Minister for Finance and by the Government.</P>

The handlers are good at specious matters but no use when it comes down to serious politics involving the credibility of the State and our creditworthiness with international financial institutions all over the world. This involves our credibility to run our affairs properly.  It is real and serious politics and the Government should fire the handlers prior to letting a real Government into office to run the country properly with a clear majority.</P>

He has displayed his numerous talents and shown that he is, in political terms &mdash; I hope he will take it as the compliment which is intended &mdash; a man for all seasons in relation to any kind of attack which Fianna Fáil want to make on any issue.  He has managed to touch all the appropriate buzz words, the <Col N="172" /> construction industry, an appeal to nationalism and solidarity, without addressing himself to the fundamental issues which have already been answered but which I will attempt to answer again.</P>
      <P>In <i>Revisions to the Balance of International Payments and the National Accounts</i> the Central Statistics Office said:</P>
      <P>A review was begun by the Central Statistics Office in 1982 of the various data sources and estimation methods used for the annual estimates of the National Accounts.  This included in particular the Balance of International Payments Statement, where the existence of a relatively large residual was calling into question the consistency and coverage of the constituent items. While this review is ongoing it has reached the stage where it is possible to take account of important revisions. Revised estimates for the Balance of International Payments and for the main aggregates of the National Accounts are presented for the years 1979 to 1982.  The first preliminary estimates of the main items of the 1983 Balance of International Payments have also been prepared.  While the review to date has concentrated on the period since 1979 it is expected that some revision will be found necessary to the estimates for earlier years to ensure comparable time-series.</P>
      <P>I put it to the House and to the sole remaining Front Bench member of Fianna Fáil and to his Donegal back bench colleague that, if we are going to have a motion of no confidence in a Minister for Finance, we should go back as far as 1979 and bring in all previous Ministers for Finance since that period if we are going to address ourselves to what the Opposition would like us to do.</P>
      <P>I will quote again from the same document. It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main conclusion to emerge so far is that for recent years there was a higher outflow on current account than had previously been estimated.  The increased current debit estimates arise mainly in the case of trading and investment <Col N="173" /> income and in purchases of certain services.  These had previously been under-estimated.  Because of the changes on current account and changes in presentation there have been consequential revisions to specific entries on the capital side.</P>
    <P>It is not just the balance of payments figures that have been changed, other figures have been changed as well in a positive manner to the benefit of the economy.  I should like to give them because the Opposition, in their selective and frenzied attack on the Minister for Finance, have studiously chosen to ignore them.  The original estimates for the growth in our gross domestic product at constant 1975 prices were that in 1979-80, a period of Fianna Fáil rule, was an increase of 3.7 per cent.  The revised estimate is down to 3.4 per cent.  In 1980-81 the estimate was 1.6 per cent; the revised estimate is 2.3 per cent.  In 1981-82 the original estimate of 1.2 per cent was revised upwards to 1.8 per cent.  The figures I have given prove that the statistical basis upon which this Government were responsibly acting and making policy decisions has proved to be inaccurate over a whole matrix of figures, not just one set of figures.</P>
    <P>The fundamental charge the Opposition are attempting to make in relation to the Minister for Finance and, by extension, to all the members of the Government is that we were manifestly dishonest in the way in which we presented our argument in the budget.  What we have argued consistently is this, that there has been a basic improvement as shown in the downward figures of the balance of payments and in the overall performance of the economy, that the economy was on the mend; that by a variety of indices &mdash; whichever one cares to choose &mdash; there was an overall improvement that could be quantified.  We argued that the overall figures in relation to the balance of payments and the current budget deficit were downward and positive, that the figures which we received from the Central Statistics Office &mdash; which the Minister for Finance and the Government used as the <Col N="174" /> basis for policy-making &mdash; had not been revised at the time.</P>
    <P>Our analysis in general terms has been correct.  None of the arguments advanced here by Opposition speakers, in particular those advanced by Deputy Lenihan and his leader, Deputy Haughey, challenged that point.  Perhaps Deputy Noonan, or some other speaker from the Opposition benches &mdash; in response to the specific motion of no confidence &mdash; would use the entire set of revised figures the Central Statistics Office have published in order to justify their argument and their endeavour to pin on the Minister for Finance the kind of charge articulated by Deputies Haughey and Lenihan, that this Minister for Finance has been patently and clearly dishonest in the presentation of figures.  That is the issue of no confidence which brought Fianna Fáil into the House this evening and to lay that charge against not alone the Minister for Finance but, by extension, the remainder of the members of the Government.  I refuse that charge entirely.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement in relation to this whole phenomenon attempts to set the record fairly straight in relation to what is meant by the overall revisions and what they mean to the economy.  In the course of his speech to the House on Thursday last he said that there was no &ldquo;missing&rdquo; £500 million.  Secondly, he said that a flow of money from this country which was thought in 1981-82 to be capital has now been identified using aggregate exchange control information as (a) repatriated profits and royalties, (b) payments to international consultants and (c) trade with Northern Ireland.  He said there remains a still unidentified amount, equal to about one quarter of the original unidentified total, a residual which is at a level normal even for countries such as the United Kingdom and the USA with more highly developed statistical sources than Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear &mdash; though the Leader of the Opposition attempted to muddy the waters in this respect &mdash; that there have been difficulties encountered in relation to the accurate estimation of financial statistics in this complex area.  It <Col N="175" /> is quite clear also that that dates back to 1979, a period when, with our joining the European Monetary System, our currency, for the first time since the Act of Union, if not before, stood as an independent currency.  Therefore capital outflows and money inflows of one kind or another which had previously been measured by the Central Statistics Office in a way which was untouched by any Government since the foundation of the State, that kind of published, returned data &mdash; this is not secret data found under the counter or somewhere else, these are properly filed returns available in a statistical sense &mdash; had not been properly or fully analysed.  It is quite clear from the point of view of the Central Statistics Office that our entry into the EMS in 1979 created a new situation in which they themselves subsequently revised estimates based on the totality of data available to them.  The Government were not involved in that revision.  The Government are not now proposing to change or alter in any way the operations of the Central Statistics Office &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in a way that would impinge on their impartiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second charge Deputy Haughey attempted to level at my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and, by extension, the remainder of the Government was that in relation to the action the Government have taken under the 1924 legislation, to set up a Statistical Council to advise the Central Statistics Office.  There was an implicit suggestion that somehow or other this administration, by setting up that council of academic experts &mdash; renowned in their own right and recognised as being independently-minded people &mdash; were attempting to nobble the books in the future.  That is a totally reprehensible accusation.  It is significant that Deputy Haughey is not in the House to repudiate it.  On behalf of the officials who work not just in the Central Statistics Office but in the public service generally I would hope that it will be repudiated <Col N="176" /> particularly by a party like Fianna Fáil who spent so much of their time in government and who recognise the complexities and difficulties, indeed the strengths of the public services.  To suggest, as did Deputy Haughey, that that would be the effect of the establishment of that council is reprehensible and should be withdrawn.  As the Taoiseach has already indicated, what that council will do is assist the Central Statistics Office, in an objectives, non-party political manner, in seeing that statistics which are available and published are properly presented and interpreted.  It is quite clear from the way in which the Central Statistics Office have reacted that they would welcome such action, that such revision and analysis of our statistics is rendered all the more pressing because of the economic difficulties to which both Deputies Haughey and Lenihan referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan attempted to turn his contribution &mdash; which centred on one quotation from the budget speech of the Minister for Finance and his estimate of the balance of payments at that time as a percentage of GNP &mdash; into a general all-purpose Fianna Fáil type speech.  Predictably he ended up with the old reliable, the construction industry, as being the salvation of our economic growth.  I work and did work in the construction industry.  I am aware of the enormous damage Fianna Fáil did to that industry between 1977 and 1981 when they totally overheated it, to an extent that existing suppliers of raw materials of building products were given totally false pictures of the level of demand and embarked on capital investment programmes, with the aid of capital grants or loans, for a sustained, anticipated level of demand in the industry totally artificially generated.</P>
    <P>The result has been that we now have surplus capacity in nearly every major building product.  Indeed, so overheated was the building construction industry there was net importation of building materials from third countries which seriously damaged domestic producers and distorted prices on the home market. There was similar distortion of market prices in relation to wage levels with disastrous effects.  I want to nail the lie about <Col N="177" /> this Government not doing sufficient for the construction industry: seventy pence of every £1 spent on a building site in Ireland is put up by the Irish Government, through taxpayers' money.  The fall-off in investment in the building industry, with the consequent decline in employment, has been in the private sector which had done very well in previous years.  I make that point in particular to nail the lie that Deputy Lenihan so typically wanted to introduce into this discussion.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the need for an accurately-based set of statistics.  I repudiate what the Opposition had to say in this discussion.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Having listened to the Ministers for Finance and Labour for the past hour or so, I am still convinced that this motion should be put to the House.  Nothing I have heard has made me change my mind.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour tried to twist what Deputy Lenihan said about the building industry.  Irrespective of the gloss the Minister might try to put on it, the building industry is in a very serious situation.  Seventy pence out of every £1 of taxpayers' money is being spent in the building industry.  This did not happen today or yesterday.  It has happened down through the years.  I do not see any reason why the Minister should take credit for it.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the Minister's approach to agriculture and to outline how the Government have downgraded the potential of agriculture for the development of the economy.  If we are to rise swiftly and steadily out of the recession we must utilise every resource we have, human and natural.  Despite rumours of oil finds and the growing importance of natural gas, our farm land is still our greatest resource.  Over the years the prospects in agriculture have been a barometer showing how the economy was faring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Governments have introduced schemes in an attempt to enable the industry to reach its true potential. The fact that we joined the EEC gave us an enormous boost and took a great deal <Col N="178" /> of pressure off our own financial resources.  We had to ensure that the industry moved in the right direction.  To this end various EEC and national schemes were implemented.  Farming is more important to us than it is to any other EEC country.  One in four of our workforce is employed in farming, and agricultural exports account for one-quarter of total exports and because of their low import content this latter figure underestimates their net benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>Looking at these figures I cannot understand the attitude adopted by the Minister for Finance.  He does not appreciate the vital role an expanding farming sector could play in leading us out of our current difficulties.  We could help to solve the terrible problem of unemployment by keeping as many workers as possible on the land and by providing many thousands of new jobs in an agriculture based industry.  This in turn would greatly improve our balance of payments deficit.  With this in mind we should gear ourselves towards increased productivity with a maximum yield for farmers, Government and European agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government continue to put very large sums of money into creating jobs through the IDA and youth employment schemes.  Yet our most productive industry is being downgraded by the Government. Is it because the industry is home based?  Is it because it is agricultural? Why is the Minister for Finance prepared to turn a blind eye to it?  We must increase employment in the productive sector and so increase exports.  Increased agricultural exports would be of great benefit to the economy.  It is hard to understand the cuts in the promotion of agricultural output which seems to have been singled out.  Investment of money in any scheme must be fully investigated and be able to show its worth in a cost benefit analysis. This has been done very positively so far as agriculture is concerned.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture cannot be considered as an isolated industry because of the enormous volume of agriculture related business.  It is an Irish industry and yet the Government are not prepared to give it the priority needed.  Their approach <Col N="179" /> demonstrates the chaotic mess they have made of the agricultural industry.  The two parties who make up this Government have removed agriculture from their economic thinking.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Their arrogance and contempt for original thought or advice led them to ignore the report of a committee which we set up when we were in Government to consider a four year national plan for the agricultural sector.  The country was clamouring for such a four year plan and shelving it because its origin is not acceptable. The four year plan for agriculture has just been published.  It was delayed since last October for reasons best known to the Government.  Last October it was available for publication.  Now we are told by the Minister for Finance that it will be part of an overall plan for economic development.  This is a further downgrading of agriculture by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I want to quote from a report made by the Minister's representative in the working group who produced this plan.  I suppose this minority report was put into the report at the behest of the Minister for Finance.  On page 131 we read:</P>
      <P>The purpose of a plan for agriculture is, or ought to be, to determine the most effective manner in which limited resources can be used to achieve a high level of development.  This objective involves the establishment of priorities and the resolution of the conflicts necessarily involved in the allocation of available resources to serve those priorities.</P>
      <P>Any report which fails to tackle such issues becomes merely a list of desirable measures rather than a plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report puts forward recommendations involving substantial public expenditure and, while it indicates a number of areas where expenditure reductions might be made, the overall <Col N="180" /> effect of the recommendations is a significant net additional burden for the Exchequer.  The report fails to establish priorities consistent with available resources and does not take due account of the present grave difficulties in the public finances.</P>
    <P>The following is the important sentence in the report:</P>
    <P>Thus it tends towards a list of desirable measures rather than a plan.</P>
    <P>Although the report issued carries the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo; in its title, the Minister for Finance does not consider it a plan but a list of desirable measures.  It is difficult to understand the thinking of the Minister for Finance as far as that four-year plan for agricultural development is concerned.</P>
    <P>Cattle and beef production are the most important agricultural enterprises here but that sector has been dealt two further serious blows by the Minister. The valuable calf premium has been substantially reduced with a loss of £23 million to the country.  That premium was won at EEC level against difficult odds. We had intended to have the premium granted by way of interest subsidy rather than a straight grant.  The second blow, which followed as a consequence, was that the national beef cow herd which we had built up to more than 700,000 head has been allowed drop to a disastrous low of 400,000.  We all realise the damage done to our balance of payments by that move and the unemployment that has resulted in our meat factories.</P>

The performance of the Minister has affected farmers in western countries and other disadvantaged areas.  In recent years the priority accorded to farming in those areas has waned.  Many of the schemes introduced by Fianna Fáil for those areas have lapsed completely.  That has happened because the Minister is not prepared to support those areas.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Those interested in farming appreciate the importance of increasing our cattle herds and sheep flocks, increases which can mean a great improvement in our balance of payments.  However, because of the actions of the Minister for Finance, those numbers have dropped dramatically.  A lot of State investment seems to find its way into the pockets of large multinationals and the bank balances of foreign firms.  It is a national disgrace for the Government to be singling out our farmers to bear the brunt of reduced State expenditure.  Fianna Fáil have always appreciated the importance of the small family farm.  However, the Coalition appear determined to remove people from those farms.  They should not be permitted to dash the hopes of a big sector of our population in their pursuit of a policy of so-called fiscal rectitude. As far as agriculture is concerned we have lost all confidence in the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Deputy David Andrews has sought and has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the matter of the continuing inconvenience faced by people taxing their cars at River House.  He has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful, Sir, to you for giving me the opportunity of speaking on this very important question, probably one of the most important questions raised on the Adjournment since the beginning of this Dáil, and it concerns what is perhaps the largest population base in the country.  I see it under a number of headings including that of political will, the convenience of the public, the convenience of the taxpayer and the convenience of the car tax payer.  In other words the individual who wishes to pay his car tax has every known obstacle in his way.  River House, as we know, is situated in Chancery Street behind the Four Courts and its location alone is probably one of the most inaccessible parts of Dublin.  The much harassed car owner has to go to this location if he wants to pay his car tax personally.  I will not go into the question of paying one's car tax through the post.  I mean no disrespect to our postmen whose integrity I have never questioned nor will I do so, but if you put your car registration book into the post then it is a question of a lottery.  Will it arrive?  If it arrives will it be processed and returned?  How long will it take through that method or system to have your car registration book returned to you through the post?  That is not what I am concerned with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned with the convenience of the public.  We public representatives who know Chancery Street and River House are embarrassed day in and day out when we see large queues of people in all sorts of weather at River House. The queue stretches around the back of the court house there almost meeting the queue again on the far side.  It is as bad as that on some occasions and this should <Col N="184" /> not be so.  I want to make it clear that this is not an attack on the staff in River House, the officials of Dublin Corporation who operate this insidious system. Quite the contrary.  I see part of my contribution being in ease and aid of these much overworked and, in my experience, very courteous staff.  However, I am not so much concerned with that aspect as with going to pay one's tax willingly and being met by these obstacles.</P>
    <P>My solution to the problem is quite simple.  It has never been tried and it should be tried as a matter of urgency. We should have available to us a car tax system under which the individual car tax payer can go into a sub-post office or a post office in his or her area for the purpose of paying the car tax.  That solution is simple, maybe too simple.  Alternatively, if the bureaucratic and political machine cannot come to grips with that simple solution then another solution presents itself.  Surely in addition to the location of the car tax registration office at River House we can have two car tax registration offices on the south side of the Liffey to cater for the people living in the southern part of the county and city of Dublin and two car tax registration offices north of the Liffey to cater for people living in the northern part, and we could have one or two car tax registration offices situated in west County Dublin.  Perhaps also we could have another car tax registration office in the centre of the city.  Is that too much to ask for?</P>
    <P>I have given this matter a great deal of thought and I have concluded that the whole problem is symptomatic of the lack of political will.  We run the country from Leinster House and it seems to be impossible for this moribund Government &mdash; I say that with no disrespect &mdash; to get down to this problem and solve it.  We were sent here to represent the people and on this issue we are not representing them. We are responsible for the system.  Civil servants and Dublin Corporation employees are operating the system that we have given them.  We give the public service a system and they operate under it.  The system at present operated by Dublin Corporation is nothing short of <Col N="185" /> scandalous.  However, the Minister is finally responsible for its application and is also responsible to the long-suffering public for the long delays and the inconvenience they have to suffer.  I have received much correspondence and many representations in connection with the problem.</P>
    <P>You go along to River House and you are lucky if you are not at the end of a 40 yard queue.  You go there perhaps by bus, but inevitably if you go by car you park your car on a double yellow line and when you come out of River House you find a parking ticket on your car and, in addition, a summons for not having taxed your car.  You have gone into River House to tax your car but your tax has run out and, due to the system, you are delayed for so long.  It is ironic that you come out to find a parking ticket on your car and also a ticket indicating that you must go to court for not paying car tax. This is an unfortunate matter and it can be cured as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I believe I have the Minister's spiritual support in this matter but I do not know whether he can indicate his support. Being in Government he has his responsibilities. I can understand that he may not agree with me or may appear not to agree with me.  He is a Dubliner and I myself am a third generation Dubliner and proud to be so.  There are only a few of us left.  I think the Minister will come part of the way with me on this.  He is well ensconced in the philosophy of Dublin.  Is it too much to give our fellow citizens the convenience of access to what is, after all, an imposition on them?  They go along to pay their tax, albeit in many cases like myself unwillingly, but they do it to conform with the law of the land. Instead of having ease and access to these payment areas they meet obstruction, obstacles, inconvenience, and a wetting if the weather happens to be bad on the day they go to queue outside River House.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is that to my knowledge people have taken a day or a half day off work to face up to this Everest-type endurance test.  They may come from the other side of County Dublin, from Shankill perhaps.  Consider the loss <Col N="186" /> to the country in terms of service and national productivity.  If our economists could quantify the loss to the economy in time because of the number of people using time going to register their cars at River House probably we would find that the loss in economic terms would be massive.</P>
    <P>This problem comes back to politicians, ultimately, to the Government in particular.  It is an extremely serious one which causes much hardship, concern and irritation.  It can be solved by the introduction of a very simple system.  I have asked questions and offered solutions and I hope for some action.  I believe that the Minister of State has goodwill towards the suggestion for improvement.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time I have raised this and if a solution is not forthcoming I intend to continue to raise it, to harass the Government, not in an intimidatory fashion, until a solution is found in the interests of the people of greater Dublin. I note that Deputies Skelly and Burke are anxious to contribute&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A number of small operators are providing a service on payment of a queueing fee.  People can go along and pay a queueing fee of between £3 and £5, as well as the tax charge.  I must say I give full marks to those operators for the initiative but they will be put out of business if my proposed solutions are adopted.  The answer to this is in the good and capable hands of the Minister of State.  Let us have a system through which the thousands of greater Dublin citizens will be able to pay their tax through post offices, not necessarily sub-post offices, in the built-up areas of the city and county.  Alternatively we could have a number of outlets through Dublin Corporation in the north, west and south of the city.  The problem can be solved and an immense burden taken from the citizens of Dublin city and county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Andrews in appealing to the Minister of <Col N="187" /> State to take action in this matter.  We must remember that more than one-third of the county's population reside in the greater Dublin area and consequently that one-third of the vehicles of the country are located here.  For such a massive population we have only one registration office, which means that people have to give up a day's work in order to have their cars taxed.  There was never a time when productivity was more necessary and this system of taxation, which means that people lose a day's work is the very antithesis of productivity.  We know the delays in the post these days and if people post their taxation forms with the required amount of money they may have to wait for their tax discs.  Meanwhile, if they have to come into the city they may be approached by traffic wardens or members of the Garda and even though they may be discharged by the courts they have to go to the inconvenience of attending court and consequently lose a day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Andrews that people should be allowed to transact their tax business in sub-post offices throughout the greater Dublin area.  We should have at least one sub-post office in the north city and county, another in the west and a third in the south to provide a service for the public.  It is ludicrous that private enterprise should be able to enter the market to provide an efficient service. For the payment of a fee motorists can hand in their tax forms and have their discs back within 24 hours.  That has become necessary because the public authorities have not provided facilities for speedy collection of tax and the issuing of discs.  The Minister may say this is the responsibility of Dublin Corporation, but there are Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  Dublin Corporation could be responsible for the issuing of tax discs in the city and the other two bodies could provide a service for the greater Dublin area.  The present registration office is beside one of the biggest Garda stations in the country, the Bridewell, and it lacks parking facilities for the thousands of people who have to call there.  I ask the Minister to use his <Col N="188" /> good office with the corporation to come up with a solution to this serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputies Andrews and Ray Burke in their pleas to have this archaic system reorganised.  It is unfortunate that this country in many instances is seen to have to wait until a system almost breaks down or cries out for overhaul before we do anything about it.  The time loss and the cost to people who have to go to the central office where there are very limited car parking facilities impose great hardship on many people who have to take a half-day or a full day away from work.  It is wasteful. Queueing has been referred to.  It is extraordinary in 1984 to see people having to queue to tax their cars.  The position was not much different when the office was in Church Street.  I do not know how the present centre was selected but the location seems to be the worst possible in Dublin for the transaction of this type of business.</P>
      <P>When I was living in Canada 20 years ago you taxed your car on one day of the year.  The tax plates were blue and white one year and white and blue the next year.  On that one day the police went out on the roads and cars which did not have the proper tax plate were just swished off the road and their owners had to tax their cars before they were allowed back on the roads again.  It was all done in two or three days and all cars were taxed for the rest of the year.</P>
      <P>We have a different system.  We can tax cars for a quarter, six months or nine months, or for the entire year.  It is so bad and has been occuring for so long that some people are selling their cars and advertising them as &ldquo;taxed for the rest of the year&rdquo; as an incentive to purchasers. We have the ridiculous small disc which you would need a pair of binoculars to see, unless the car is almost stopped, to decide whether the car has been taxed.  We lose much revenue by messing around like this.  It is a very inefficient method of collecting tax.  It could very easily be changed if we had the will to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The postal service is ridiculous because if you send away your tax form you may <Col N="189" /> not get the disc back in time and in the meantime you may be summonsed for not having the car taxed and for not displaying the disc.  You have the bother of going to court even though you may have told the garda that you have sent the tax form away.  He cannot accept that from everybody.  If this were a private business problem it would have been sorted out years ago.  Here we have an enormous amount of business coming in, people are queueing to pay their tax all the time.  An enormous number of people are willing to purchase the tax system.  All we have to do is sit down and work out an up-to-date method of motor tax collection.  In Dublin we seem to have an into-town mentality: people go into town to do things that they should not have to do, whether it is to pay the ESB bill, the telephone bill or the tax bill.  It is ridiculous. The Minister has the goodwill of everybody on all sides of the House to work out an up-to-date system.</P>

    <P>Of a national total of 897,000 vehicles registered, 235,000, or 26 per cent, are registered in Dublin.  All these vehicles are registered in a single office which is located in River House and quite adjacent to the Fourt Courts.  Arising from discussions between officers of my Department and Dublin Corporation, as well as from a subsequent examination undertaken by the Department, I am prepared to agree in principle to the opening <Col N="190" /> of a sub-office, on a trial basis, on the south side of Dublin.  By a trial basis I do not mean the provision of an office as a temporary expediency but we will see how it operates and decide whether we should do something else in conjunction with the staff.</P>

      <P>The primary cause of the complaints is that apparently people prefer to queue and register their cars personally, although there is a postal system in operation.  That system has been criticised but the waiting period has been reduced to two weeks.  The problem is often worse at opening time and immediately <Col N="191" /> after the lunch break but we are considering ways in which an improvement might be made.  I consider a two-week wait to be reasonable in respect of the use of the postal system, so perhaps more people should avail of that procedure.</P>
      <P>The possibility of the use of the Post Office in this area has been mentioned. It is a possibility that I have referred to also in the past.  We will have discussions with An Post with a view to operating with them some system on a trial basis. The possibility of any such system was ruled out on the basis of legal, administrative, financial and accounting problems. It was ruled out by some of those people who have spoken tonight but who were in power then.  However, I am not ruling it out.</P>

The possibility of providing the service through the Post Office will be pursued.  If, after examination, the possibility is considered feasible we will go ahead with it.</P>
      <P>Later this year we will be introducing a Bill providing for the filing of certain vehicle data at the Shannon computerised space centre.  That will take the workload off the staff thereby permitting more of them to give their time to expediting applications for vehicle registration.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> The question raised is one that has been troubling the motorists in Dublin county and city for some time.  I am confident that the setting up of an office on the south side and on a main thoroughfare will prove successful.  We are not living in a world in which such matters can be dealt with overnight.  We would hope to have the co-operation of staffs concerned in respect of any change that may be proposed, whether in conjunction with An Post or within the Department. If we have that co-operation we will make progress.  The problem has been left aside for far too long.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government they ignored it but something is being done now.</P>

      <P>I am aware that this firm has gone into receivership recently and that there is a prospect of it closing in the near future. The IDA have had discussions with the receiver and will endeavour to assist him in every possible way to try to identify a party, either in Ireland or overseas, interested in taking over the plant.</P>
      <P>With regard to the efforts which are being made to provide new employment opportunities in Portlaoise, the IDA have provided a cluster of four factory units, of 3,000 sq. ft. each, in the town and these are being actively promoted as locations for suitable small industry projects. In addition the IDA have an industrial site of 50 acres in the town for future development.</P>
      <P>Also as the Deputy is probably aware, I recently announced expansion plans by ENB (Ireland) Ltd, which will provide an additional 30 jobs in due course and involves transfer of the ENB operation to an IDA 43,300 sq. ft. advance factory. When this move is completed the 24,000 sq. ft. factory currently occupied by ENB will also be actively promoted by the IDA.</P>

In addition one cruise (about 17 berths) on <i>Asgard II</i> is fully reserved each year for students from comprehensive and community schools and another cruise is fully reserved for students from vocational schools.  In 1983 a further cruise was fully reserved for students from both community and vocational schools.</P>
      <P>The sail training scheme is intended to provide adventure training and character formation for young people.  It is the policy of Coiste an Asgard which manages <i>Asgard II</i> that as far as possible priority in the allocation of berths should be given to young people who are likely to derive most benefit from the scheme.  An coiste is satisfied that this policy is implemented by Irish Shipping Ltd. which handles a number of matters including the allocation of berths on behalf of an coiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest date for the receipt of completed applications for berths on cruises on <i>Asgard II</i> this year was 15 January 1984 and the allocation of berths on the cruises was made towards the end of January 1984.  Applications for berths on a particular cruise were received in mid-February 1984 from eight students of the school referred to by the Deputy.  When the principal of the school subsequently spoke to an official of Irish Shipping Ltd. regarding the application no berths were in fact available on the cruise in question. It was however found possible to offer him three berths on the cruise by altering other applicants to other cruises.  He was also offered seven berths on one of the <Col N="52" /> cruises to take place next autumn.  He did not accept either offer.

      <P>Security services are liable to VAT at the rate of 23 per cent and taxable persons acquiring these services for business purposes are normally entitled to a credit for the tax borne in the cost of the services.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the case in question and in the case of most shopping centres and similar property developments, security and other costs, such as the cleaning and lighting of public areas and insurance, are borne in the first instance by the landlord and reimbursed to him by the tenants under a covenant in the lease. However, once the initial lettings of developed property have been completed most landlords are no longer taxable persons under the VAT system.  They do not continue to be registered for the tax and cannot, therefore, claim a credit for the tax borne on the services in question. Neither can the tenants of the property claim a credit because although the cost might rightly be regarded as having in effect been ultimately borne jointly by them as an addition to their rents, the various services are not supplied to them.</P>

      <P>The tax on non-alcoholic beers was set at the same level as that on normal beers up to February 1982 but was then reduced substantially. The present level is the same as that on table waters, i.e. excise duty of 37.2p per gallon (equivalent to 2.3p per half-pint bottle) and VAT at 23 per cent.  I do not see any reason for reducing it further outside of a general reorganisation of tax structures.</P>

      <P>Differences in the rates of social welfare payments for married women and other categories have been a feature of social insurance since the present unified system was introduced in 1952.</P>
      <P>This approach was undoubtedly relevant at that time when it was exceptional for a married woman to take up employment outside the home.  Married women would normally have looked to their husbands for maintenance and those who did engage in employment would have done so, generally speaking, in order to augment the family income.  The same level of responsibility or need would not have existed for them as in the case of other beneficiaries and it would also have been necessary to ensure that the level of payments to them did not provide an incentive to exploit the system.  The married women who were not dependent on their husbands &mdash; such as those who were separated and not being maintained by their husbands &mdash; received the full rates of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elimination of the differences referred to is being considered in the context of the provision of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security in accordance with EEC <Col N="79" /> Directive 79/7/EEC.  Legislative proposals to deal with this matter will be introduced later this year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Traditionally officers of the Prison Service, as members of one of the disciplined services of the State, have been clean-shaven and have worn uniform caps on duty.  Regrettably the standards of discipline, neatness and deportment had become eroded in recent years and, among other things, caps ceased to be worn by many officers and some officers grew beards.  The authorities of the security services were particularly concerned by the fact that the wearing of beards by officers in Portlaoise and Limerick prisons might lead to problems of identification in certain circumstances <Col N="84" /> since a proportion of prisoners in those prisons also wear beards.</P>
      <P>The situation has been of concern to my predecessors and to me.  At my first meeting with the Prison Officers Association in January 1983 I specifically asked the officers of the association to co-operate in getting their members to wear caps and appear clean-shaven on duty but to no avail.  In the circumstances I was satisfied that it was in the best interests of the Prison Service that the directions in question should issue.</P>

      <P>My Department notified the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee on 18 April last of its provisional <Col N="86" /> 1984-85 teaching staff allocation for day courses.  While the allocation showed a substantial increase over the current year's staffing, the committee has indicated that it still may not be adequate for its requirements.  The provisional allocation was made on the basis of information supplied by the committee in February last.  My Department is awaiting receipt of additional and more up-to-date information so as to enable it to review the situation.</P>
