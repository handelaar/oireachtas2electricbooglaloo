      <P>On the Order of Business, last night as the Dáil was concluding, a query was raised about the actual receipts from the 1 per cent income levy. I do not think that it was sufficiently answered and in fairness to the Minister I feel that an explanation should be given as to why in one set of figures in the supplementary tables accompanying the budget the total taken into account was £74 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was not answered. The simple matter is that it was raised last night, but the Chair would not let the matter proceed any further because he was under an order of the House to have a division at 12 o'clock.  The Minister for Finance did not explain the matter.  I do not think it is unreasonable that on the following morning we ask for a simple factual explanation of a very important aspect of the budget.  The budget figures are already under suspicion as far as we are concerned.  This is one clear matter which can be identified and explained.</P>

      <P>I am raising the matter in the hope of getting an answer from the Government side.  I do not mind whether it was given by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance, but somebody should give clarification to the House about it.  The distinct impression created by the Minister for Finance's budget speech yesterday was that the total revenue from the 1 per cent levy for 1984 would be £45 million, £5 million of which he would refund to those with an income under £5,000 &mdash; a total of £40 million, but, in effect, in another table of figures the total levy for 1984 is taken to be £74 million.  Either the impression which is created is wrong or the figures are wrong. It is up to the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance to clarify the matter.</P>

      <P>Last night, at the request of the Chair, Deputy Reynolds moved the adjournment.  We are still today continuing last night's business. Last night's business was adjourned by Deputy Reynolds to be resumed this morning.  So it is quite impossible for you to suggest that this is new business we are on today which has no connection with what took place last night.  It is a continuation of last night's business.  Before we parted last night the House was in doubt as to exactly what was the position in regard to this.  No explanation was given. Therefore, it is very logical and reasonable for us to ask first thing this morning that this very important matter be cleared up.</P>

      <P>Before any Member of this House addresses himself to the budget Resolution, a discrepancy which emerged last night between the budget arithmetic and the tables accompanying the budget must be clarified, a discrepancy of £34 million.  In those circumstances is it reasonable to ask any Member of the House to address himself to a budget resolution while there is a discrepancy of that sort remaining unclarified?  That is the issue that the Taoiseach has to face now.  It is not something he can deal with later after three or four Members have spoken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night when we finished on the budget debate we asked a very important question of the Minister for Finance to clarify the situation in that, in his budget speech, he said that the receipts from the 1 per cent levy in this year were £40 million.  Yet, as Deputy MacSharry correctly pointed out, when one goes to the budget figures themselves a figure of £74 million is taken in.  We asked a very reasonable question, a reasonable explanation as to what was the situation.  The Minister for Finance attempted, in the first instance, to say that the £40 million represented nine months' revenue.  Yet when he thought for a second time and he took a <i>pro rata</i> increase on that, he realised that that would bring him up to only approximately £53 million.  Therefore, we still asked for an explanation of the £74 million. The Minister for Finance received a second note from his advisers.  I do not know what was in that second note but it certainly did not please him anyway because it caused consternation between his four advisers who were there.  The end result was that 12 midnight came and you drew down the curtain.  Deputy MacSharry asked that an explanation be given to the House this morning to allow a proper debate to take place on the budget, and more especially on the current budget deficit, so that we would know which figure we were talking about. What is the correct figure?  Is the House to be misled?  How can the Minister for Finance say one thing in his speech while the budget arithmetic says another?  We asked again here this morning and had to proceed under protest because we were given no explanation whatsoever of it.  I <Col N="1022" /> can only assume that it is another sleight of hand presentation of which there are quite a few in this budget.  This is in stark contrast with the sort of Government we were promised by the Taoiseach of the day, not in the last general election, nor even in the one before but in the last three general elections.</P>
      <P>Before getting on to the budget one could reasonably ask a few direct questions of the Taoiseach and I am glad to see that he is in the House.  I am merely re-echoing the sentiments and calls of people up and down this country, north, south, east and west, when they say: &ldquo;Oh, Taoiseach what happened to the promise and the dream, the promise by yourself, your party, when you came together with the Labour Party, a promise of strong Government, of stable Government, a promise of honest Government and of open Government?&rdquo; What happened the dream, a dream that was dreamt by thousands of people but more especially the young people up and down the country who saw his coming on the Irish political scene as a potential Taoiseach, as a new Messiah, the man who had the answers to everything? Indeed I have heard him named as the economic pope of the Irish nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a new one; the Taoiseach should put it in his book because it has been very relevant since he assumed office, the economic hope, the pope who in a very short time has become fallible.  He is not the infallible economic guru this country was led to believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another one; we borrowed that one from them.  He did not prove to be what many people thought he was and in a very short time the people have realised differently.  If strong government means a crisis at practically every Government meeting that takes place, a crisis not every day or every week but, over the last few months, every hour of the day, than if that is what strong government means the word &ldquo;strong&rdquo;<Col N="1023" /> warrants a different meaning in the dictionary.</P>
      <P>We have had a charade from various Ministers of the Government, indeed from various Ministers within the same parties in Government, on the part of various Ministers of State in the same Departments as their Ministers and <i>vice versa</i> with regard to Labour, Ministers who time and time again came out making totally different statements as to what they felt Government policy should be doing.  If that were a Fianna Fáil Administration, we would be run out of office by economic commentators, by the editorial writers and everybody else and they would be right.  They would contend that there was total instability.  If one cannot have it within the Cabinet room and around the Cabinet table, there is little chance one has of governing this country in times of very difficult financial situations? Nobody will deny that.  I would be the last person to deny it.  The Government have failed to deliver on their promises. The excuse for the failure of their first budget is that they were too short a time in office.  They were in office for nine months then and, subsequently, Fianna Fáil were expected to do everything in nine months.  I am glad the Coalition Government have had the opportunity to introduce two budgets and I hope they will be there to introduce a few more because it will finally nail the lie that they have the answer to everything. Last year, the Minister for Finance said he had not much opportunity for innovation and new approaches but that they would be addressing themselves to every single aspect of the economy throughout the year and that we could all look forward to a real Coalition budget in January 1984.  Well, that budget has come and we know what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that any government worth their salt would put that budget together in two ordinary Cabinet meetings.  What did we get?  Starting last summer we had the meeting in Barrettstown Castle, not just to review expenditure in mid-year but to focus their minds and attention on their plans for 1984, to look at Departmental Estimates <Col N="1024" /> and to set their priorities.  That was laudable but the result was the same as that of the many sojourns that took place in recent months &mdash; you changed the current budget deficit figure you had, you say you were not going to make it so you increased it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Anyway, they got down to discussing the Estimates and it took five months to produce them.  The Estimates finally appeared in December and it was obvious that the Government could not agree among themselves as to what they should or should not do.  We were told they were not final Estimates and that we could expect more cuts on budget day.  Lo and behold, when budget day came, there were no more cuts in spending, in fact there is more spending and the best that I can say about the budget is that it has no relevance whatsoever to the economic situation or to the problems facing us at present.  It was cobbled together for naked, political expediency. I could even describe it as a lasso to corral Deputy Frank Cluskey back into the fold along with some of his party.  It is also a lasso to corral Deputy Spring and whatever members of the Labour Party support him at this stage.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the majority of the members of the Government have said often enough, inside and outside this House, what the problems of the economy are. Their analysis was correct but the prescription that the learned doctor has prescribed many times has failed to cure our ills.  Everybody had been convinced that the Government which came in on a ticket of financial rectitude were doing just that.  People are still-convinced and it is time that they were given a few straight facts they can understand so that they will no longer be confused by statistics and percentages which mean nothing to them.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are better than anybody else at confusing people with statistics and percentages.  They throw figures around like snuff at a wake.  Very few people are on their wavelength regarding the real position of the economy.  The ordinary people should not be under-estimated. You can fool some of the people some of the time but you cannot fool all the people all the time.  It is time we looked at this policy of financial rectitude to see what success it has brought the country. Have we gone anywhere along the road we are supposed to have travelled over the last year or so?  Many people are convinced that the Government are doing a great job and that they are not borrowing any money.  They think that the hardships they have to endure are worthwhile because we are getting out of the wood.  The Taoiseach has said, time and time again, that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Is the Taoiseach convinced that the light is not a train coming the other way?</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry asked a question here last Tuesday about the national debt for 1982, 1983 and the estimate for 1984.  The Minister for Finance replied that the national debt at 31 December 1982 was £12.8 billion and was estimated to have been £15.7 billion approximately at 31 December 1983.  That is an increase of £2,900 million in the national debt after the first year in office of the Government. The Minister was not prepared to project <Col N="1026" /> figures of the national debt for a variety of reasons and he regretted that he was not in a position to give a figure for the end of 1984.  That increase in the first year of the Government represents an increase of about 22 per cent.  This time next year we will probably see that the national debt for 1984 had increased by between 40 per cent and 50 per cent in the first two years of Coalition Government &mdash; if they last that long and I hope they do if only to blow this myth sky high. This Government have been trying to convince everybody that we are on the road to financial rectitude and that we are getting somewhere, but those are the facts of life.  Those are the facts the ordinary people understand and it is time this myth was exploded.</P>
    <P>The recent Central Bank report blew another myth sky high.  They said the borrowing over the last ten or 12 years was the responsibility of consecutive Governments and that it was time we got down to solving the problems and stopped trying to apportion blame.  The 208,000 unemployed are not interested in that sort of argument but they are interested in honest facts and figures.  I hope they get the message.  Then they will know exactly what the position is after one year of Coalition Government and, even more important, what, if anything, we have to show for all the money we had to borrow.  The ordinary people entrusted the reins of government to the Coalition parties and they are entitled to ask what we got for the extra £2,900 million national debt.  When they look at this budget they will see a figure of almost £9 billion in which they will not in any way share.  Yet, they get calls from this House about what they should and should not do.  They are beginning to ask what value we are getting for this money and if there are any people here who are capable of managing our affairs.  This Government said they had the answers and know that financial rectitude is the answer but still they try to con the people into believing that they are not borrowing any money.  I am not saying the Coalition ever said that, but that is the perception abroad, and it is time that myth was exploded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> Another big issue on which this Government prided themselves was the current budget deficit.  Do not tell the people in the streets about percentages, GNP and so on; they understand simple figures.  What are they?  The current budget deficit this Government set themselves last year was £870 million.  During the year they went a little off the rails, but we do not know by how much. Instead of taking the decisive, unpopular decisions which they always said they would take in the interests of this nation, they changed the figure to £960 million. They upped the figure because it was easier than taking hard decisions and becoming more unpopular.  The adjusted provisional outturn on the summary of current and capital budget for 1983 was £1,085 million, the highest in the history of the State.  What is the budget deficit for 1984?  It will be £1,089 million, an even higher figure, the highest current budget deficit this country has ever seen. We are getting these figures from a Government who preached that when they came to power their first priority would be a reduction of the current budget deficit because taxation could not be reduced until this was done &mdash; I agree &mdash; and progress, development and investment could not take off while we had to borrow so much money to meet our day-to-day expenses.  As I said, next year's figure is estimated at £1,089 million but who knows, when things get tough later in the year or when the Labour Party come under extreme pressure in the aftermath of their Limerick conference next April, that we will not see a repetition of Barrettstown Castle, when the figure will be increased again.</P>
    <P>Those are simple facts and figures the people understand and it is time politicians in general stopped misleading the people.  These are Government figures; they are not fabricated.  They were produced by the Government's own people and the current budget deficit was presented here yesterday.  Time and again our economic problems were analysed. We have had so many consultants' and committees' reports that they must be filling almost every State office in Dublin. <Col N="1028" /> Everybody knows what the problems are. The Government know.  They said Fianna Fáil could never take the proper decisions but if the country elected them they would put everything right.  They were elected and we all see what they have done in the first 12 months in office, and we saw from yesterday's budget what they intend to do in the next 12 months. As I said earlier, I hope this Government will be in power long enough for the people to remember their actions for the rest of this century.  Let the facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Irish people are losing confidence in their Governments because they are not being given all the facts.  This was clearly reflected in recent opinion polls. The best opinion poll in recent months was the Dublin North-Central by-election. Fine Gael got a jolt they did not expect but everybody knew what would happen to the Labour Party.  That was one of the reasons why proper decisions were not taken in this budget and another was that the Labour Party would not agree to many of the things the Fine Gael felt should be done.  Sometimes one wonders if they were at the table when some of these decisions were made, or perhaps they were so corralled by an attack from The Workers' Party on the one side, an attack by Deputy Cluskey from the centre, and an oncoming assault from Limerick looming up in April, that they buried their heads and said they would make the best of it and hope things would come right.  That may be their philosophy.  I do not know.  It is none of my business.</P>
    <P>It is my business to ask about the days, the nights, the hours, the amount of Government time, ministerial time, executive time and official time spent in crisis Cabinet meetings about the budget, about the Estimates, about what the economic and political options were.  They were all being looked at and analysed and brought back again, with this budget as the end result.  It is well known that Labour said no to what the Fine Gael Party wanted to do, and Fine Gael said no to what the Labour Party wanted to do.  I do not know how many hours they spent on this, but I have a fair idea.  At <Col N="1029" /> the end of the day they found out all the things they could not do, and very little they could do.</P>
    <P>Three or four months ago the Taoiseach said £500 million would have to be cut from spending this year.  The Labour Party said they could not have that.  The next statement to emanate from Government Buildings was that the £500 million was to be taken from the demands by the various Departments to the Minister for Finance.  Those of us who have been in Government know that all Departments put in beefed-up estimates to the Minister for Finance.  That is the reality.  They feel that, if they do not look for enough, they will be left short.</P>
    <P>We then end up with a supposed saving of £411 million, but all it is doing is cutting down on the departmental estimates. That is like me going into a bank manager and asking him for £50,000 knowing that, being the sort of bank manager he is, he will not give me £50,000.  He will try to cut me down.  In the heel of the hunt I wind up with £30,000.  That is what I was looking for in the first instance, and that is what I expected to get.  What sort of a fool would the bank manager think I was if I said to him: &ldquo;I have done a good day's work for you.  I have saved you £20,000 of your own money&rdquo;?  Yet we are told all this money is being saved.</P>
    <P>The reality is that current spending was up by 13½ per cent in 1983 and is budgeted to go up by 10½ per cent in 1984, by a Government who are trying to convince the people that they will reduce spending. When will the Irish people get an opportunity to express their views on how they have been misled and how their finances and their affairs are being managed?  I do not know, but the sooner the better.  We all know what the result will be.  If that is the way they intend to govern in the future with that sort of information being disseminated, it is our job as a constructive Opposition to point out the facts.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance know the proper solution to our economic problems.  They know they have to reduce day-to-day spending.  As I have said, day-to-day spending went up by 13½ per cent in 1983 and is budgeted to go up by 10½ per cent in 1984.  The <Col N="1030" /> Government go for the soft options by letting current spending increase and reducing capital expenditure to try to bring the figures closer.  By doing that they are ensuring that there will be less and less employment, that more people will be out of work and that the dole queues will be longer.  They try to bundle the figures together at the end of the day to show they are reducing expenditure.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, if your wife or my wife ran her household budget in the same way as the Government are running the national budget, her bank manager would call her in and say: &ldquo;Stop the rot. Your overdraft is climbing every day.  It is time you lived within your means&rdquo;. The Government are not prepared to take the unpopular decisions people believed they would take.  Over the past few years they were brainwashed into thinking Fine Gael always put the nation first and Fine Gael second.  It is quite clear that, in putting together this budget and the last budget, Fine Gael put Fine Gael first and the nation second.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party always wrestle with their conscience about problems like this. When we count how many of them have the Mercs and the perks, it is easy to see they will continue to wrestle with their conscience, sell out the soul of the Labour Party and stay there at whatever cost.  At the end of the day the Labour Party always win the fight with their own conscience.  We cannot afford this type of management of our economy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach knows day-to-day expenditure should be reduced.  That is the only way to get down taxation, the only way to get investment going again. Capital expenditure should be kept up on the basis that it is invested properly to give us the proper return.  We learned from the Government recently that they want an immediate commercial return of 4 or 5 per cent over the normal returns. There are infrastructure projects which need to be tackled and will have to be tackled some day.  They might as well be dealt with now, rather than having 208,000 people on the dole while we borrow £1,000 million to pay for their unemployment benefit.  The young people cannot understand that type of economic <Col N="1031" /> philosophy.  They cannot understand that, while so many things need to be done, while there are so many infrastructure improvements to be made, after a large investment by the State and their parents in their education, they are being left in the dole queue.  They cannot figure out that philosophy.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that yesterday's budget will have the same effect as the budget produced this time last year.  It will contribute to a rise in unemployment.  It will do nothing to stimulate investment.  It does not suggest to the taxpayer that he will get a fair deal.  Yesterday it was broadcast to the four corners that there was great relief in the budget for the PAYE sector.  I know 15,000 people were taken out of the lower income bracket but 56,000 people were put into the 35 per cent bracket.</P>
    <P>Many people will not believe what the real outcome for them will be today or tomorrow but they will believe it when they got their first pay packet after those supposed income tax reliefs have been introduced.  Anybody earning £6,000, £7,000, £8,000, £9,000, £10,000, £11,000 or £12,000 a year, with a wife and two children, will find that the princely sum of the increase in his pay packet from all these marvellous reliefs being dished out here will be approximately 86p a week. Out of all that he will have to pay 6p more per gallon of petrol and 8 per cent VAT on any clothes he wants to buy for himself or for his children aged over ten years or approximately ten years.  I do not know what is meant by &ldquo;approximately&rdquo;. Does it mean nine, 11 or 12 years of age?  Are we to have a birth certificate and an identity card in order to buy clothes for a child in Switzers or any other shop in Grafton Street?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather unusual, to say the least, to have to ask the Taoiseach to stop interrupting me.  Maybe he is afraid I will go on to say in relation to birth certificates that it will be all right for some people over there because the Taoiseach has a man who can fix the right dates on birth certificates.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned the person who will be getting relief of 86p per week.  The Government talk about equity in taxation. If we consider the man earning £20,000 or £30,000 per year we see that he will benefit much more than the man earning between £6,000 and £12,000 per year.  This is a Government of which the Labour Party are part and who are supposed to have a social conscience.  That social conscience has been buried for quite a long time and the reality is coming to the surface.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget will be seen as a failure because it fails to recognise the real problems of the economy.  The major problem is unemployment.  There are one or two instances in which the word &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; appears in the Minister's speech, but there is no concern expressed about the state of unemployment and not a single action to deal with it.  That is the biggest failure of this budget.  It will do nothing to stimulate investment in order to bring about growth in the economy. Another failure is that it will do nothing to restore the incentive to work harder for the PAYE taxpayer or the manager who is earning £30,000 or £40,000 per <Col N="1033" /> year.  The politics of envy have crept into this country and this is reflected in the budget.  The same mistakes which have characterised Coalition Governments through the years are being repeated. The construction industry is on the floor. It suffered a steep decline in 1983 and will sink even lower in 1984.  One out of every two people in the construction industry is now out of work.  The ratio is probably 1:3 when one considers those firms which depend on the construction industry, such as electrical firms, plumbing firms, builders' suppliers and distributors. This is the industry where an injection of money will give the quickest return in terms of employment and general benefit to the overall economy.  Very few requirements of the building industry are imported.  Native materials are used and money in circulation among the building work force would give a badly needed boost to the economy.  The Government are not interested, yet many infrastructural developments are needed. We are wasting our manpower and our financial resources in paying people to sign on for the dole.  The average amount being paid out by the way of dole differs very little from the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>I had hoped for some new thinking in this budget.  There are supposed to be plenty of brains among those opposite but I see no evidence of them in the budget.  The Government have produced the old solutions which have failed this economy.  Why have we not had some new thinking?  Another opportunity has been missed.  I had thought that the Government would have seen fit to declare an unemployment emergency. There are now 208,000 people unemployed and it is mounting up to an emergency. The Government have conceded in various statements that the number of unemployed will increase this year by 25,000 or 30,000.  This is an admission of defeat.  This is the way to depress and demoralise the people in the coming year and we could be sowing the seeds of future problems.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach interrupted me a short time ago when I was talking about the 8 <Col N="1034" /> per cent VAT on clothing.  Clothing for children up to the age of approximately ten years will be excluded and will continue to be zero-rated.  I did say &ldquo;approximately&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>They are hitting an industry which lost 10,000 jobs in the last ten years.  It is a labour intensive industry and needs all the support and help it can get.  For a long time it competed unsuccessfully with cheap imports.  It was beginning to come back into its own and <Col N="1035" /> it was hit slam bang in the face with 8 per cent VAT.  What will happen?  They will have to start all over again and try to compete with cheaper imports from Taiwan and elsewhere.  There are already 5,000 jobs hanging in the balance and I would not be surprised if this tipped them over the edge.  That is what the Government are doing for industry.</P>
      <P>I do not like to bore the House again by asking if the Government have any policy on unemployment at all, but it is an important question.  Has the Fine Gael-Labour <i>Programme for Government</i> been scrapped?  Has it been relegated to the waste paper basket?  According to the Government they would halt and reverse the trend in unemployment. We had a task force of Ministers sometime last year but we never heard from them.  It was to be chaired by the Taoiseach but we do not know if they ever met or produced anything.  We were told that the National Planning Board would report last September.  They have not yet reported.  We are now told they will report in April but we do not know if they will.  However, the real answer to unemployment was to be the National Development Corporation.  This was the real beaut coming from the Labour Party and reluctantly accepted by Fine Gael. In the budget last year £7 million was allocated for it and £3 million for the National Enterprise Agency.  Despite the fact that unemployment rose by 28,000 last year all that money remained unspent at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and again I raised the question of how the National Development Corporation would be brought into being and was told that legislation had to be prepared. I put it again on the record that if the Government were sincere or serious about it the corporation could be brought into being any day as a limited company under the Companies Act.  The Taoiseach will probably say that is not the way they do business, but there are a few State companies which were set up in that way.  The Irish National Petroleum Corporation operates that way.  I am not saying that I agree with the National Development Corporation.  The same <Col N="1036" /> job could be done by the National Enterprise Agency if anyone was seriously interested in operating it.  The same paltry sum has been allocated for the corporation for 1984 and this time next year we will probably be asking what happened. Was the Department too busy to prepare legislation for it?  I ask the Taoiseach to come clean and tell us what will happen.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Government</i> it was stated that the equity capital and borrowing limitation of the corporation would be related to the flow of new projects and investments undertaken by the corporation itself as well as to the needs of existing State enterprises for funds for additional productive investment and for necessary financial restriction.  Priority in the capital programme would be given to new projects to be undertaken by the NDC and initial equity capital for new projects envisaged was £200 million to be taken up over a period of years with a borrowing limitation of £500 million.  The Labour Party seem to have forgotten all about that, but that is something for them to come to grips with.  If the Government want to stay on that road they are welcome to do so but it is not what the unemployed expect from them.</P>
    <P>Where is the White Paper on Industrial Policy?  Last July I put a question to the Taoiseach about it but he was not able to give me the information without checking the record.  I understand that since he is a very busy man.  He said it was before the Government and would be out shortly.  We know of the arguments and various ideological approaches to this within the Government from time to time.  However, after the departure of Deputy Cluskey I thought we might see the White Paper before Christmas.  What happened?  The Government let us know in their own inimitable way.  There was a leak of the full document.  RTE did two programmes on it.  On the day after it appeared on RTE a spokesman from the Department said it had not gone before the Government.  On the programme we saw various aspects of the document and time after time we could read: &ldquo;It has been decided&rdquo; that this or that will be done.  One side of the Government said it had not gone to the Government while <Col N="1037" /> the document stated that decisions had been taken.  I was part of a Government on two occasions and no Minister can issue a White Paper saying the Government have decided this and that if they do not have the document.  What are we supposed to believe?  Life gets more complicated and difficult.  I can only accept that there was such a head-on collision between Deputies Bruton and Cluskey on the different aspects of the industrial White Paper that someone looking after his image in the public arena said: &ldquo;Let us let out the White Paper.  This is what I want in it and if at the end of the day the Government alter the decisions I believe are right, history will record me as having put my views down and it was the Government that changed them&rdquo;. There is a lot of this going on in the Government.  Ministers are worried about their own image.  I will not deny that we were not when we were Ministers but we were never able to develop the technique of the Coalition Ministers successfully. I would have been caught had I tried it, but these Ministers are dab hands.</P>
    <P>While the country lingers on in an unemployment crisis we have this messing taking place with Ministers more concerned about their image in public than about governing the country.  The Government have told us that exports in 1983 were very strong, and we were delighted to hear that news, but if they were not strong I do not know where we would be today.  If one examines the position one will see that those exports came from two areas of industry, pharmaceutical and electronics &mdash; two of the latest industrial sectors to develop here. We are all proud of the way they have performed and I hope their export markets will be stronger in 1984.  However, many of the increases are short-term because they are the result of IDA plants coming into full production.  In 1983 we did not have many announcements of new industries.  That is a serious matter. In the House last week the Minister responsible admitted that the IDA did not have anything in the pipeline.  I sympathise with the Government that international investment has, by and large, <Col N="1038" /> dried up.  However, when I hear people talking about the recession lifting and that automatically we will get out of our troubles I cannot help thinking that they are living in cloud cuckoo land.  We need to develop our own industrial base.  We can no longer rely on international investment to do it for us.  We must look at our own strengths and weaknesses and build on those strengths and remedy our weaknesses.</P>
    <P>Our strengths lie in the development of our natural resources, forestry and fisheries.  I am aware that the Minister of State responsible is interested in those areas; but until he grabs his Department by the scruff of the neck and decides on his policy, and not the policy being pursued by civil servants in key positions, we will not get any benefit from our forests. One of the most stupid decisions ever taken was the one to close the Scarriff factory.  I am aware that the factory was not doing well a couple of years ago and did not produce good products but it was closed after they had developed new products and succeeded in capturing 50 per cent of the Irish market.  A report published this week was to the effect the factory should be supported.  It is possible that the Minister responsible reached his decision on the basis of the information available then but it was not commercial information.  The decision to close was not in the national interest and that is why I urge the Minister of State to prepare his own policies and get on with the job.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to adopt a similar attitude in regard to the fishing industry.  Countries with a developed fishing industry have a jobs ratio of 1.5 or 1.9 but in Ireland it is less than a 1.1 ratio.  We are not doing anything about that and we prefer to wait until foreign investment comes in to do it for us.  Foreign investment will not do anything for us in the future and the sooner we realise that the better.  Our greatest raw material of all is in agriculture, but there were very few references to that industry in the budget speech and the Minister put a few things back costing a few million pounds. They were not in the Estimates but, obviously, the Minister was under pressure <Col N="1039" /> to put them back.  It is an insult to the farming community to treat them in that fashion particularly when the greatest potential for the country lies in that area.  We have our own raw materials and we are turning out good food technologists and agricultural graduates but they are left idle.  We should be investing money in developing new products.</P>
    <P>I welcome any foreign investment that can be obtained by the IDA or anybody else, but if the IDA are aware of the position they are not spelling it out.  Has any job target been set by the IDA for 1984?  I do not think one has.  A strategic ten year plan was produced in 1982 by the IDA before I left Government, but it has not seen the light of day since because the Government cannot agree on an industrial policy.  We cannot allow a good professional organisation such as the IDA to get away from setting objectives and maintaining them.  Fianna Fáil cannot allow the Government to continue aimlessely without any objectives. The old saying that, if one does not know where one is going any road will get one there, applies to the Government.  The budget introduced yesterday is a repetition of the 1983 budget.  It will have the same fall-out effects, create more unemployment and will not give any relief to taxpayers.  I understand that 56,000 taxpayers will now go into a higher tax bracket and that £663 million will be taken out of the economy in increased taxation this year.  The Government do not have any concern for investment or rewarding risk-takers.  Like many people, the Government continue on aimlessly. If any corporate entity had a managing director and board of directors that developed its business on lines similar to the way the Government are moving it would be out of business very quickly.</P>
    <P>We need more business acumen and more attention to getting value for money.  Nobody can deny that waste occurs in Government Departments.  I saw it when I was Minister and I worked hard to eliminate it.  The Estimate I prepared for 1983 was down 2.14 per cent on the 1982 outturn and that had been reduced in mid-July by Government cut-backs. <Col N="1040" /> That is the type of commitment and management that is needed in Government Departments.  I do not say that can be done in all Departments but it can be done in some.  We need to get more value for money and greater reform.  To the Minister for the Public Service who ridiculed public servants for not doing their job I say: &ldquo;Shame on you; you should start within your own courtyard first&rdquo;.  Civil servants are working a system handed down to us by the British and it is not a system that is conducive to any country with a population of 3,500,000 people.  There is little point in blaming the people who operate that system. The Ministers should get more involved in the workings of their Departments.</P>
    <P>I can never understand what a Department of the Public Service is all about.  If the Government were serious about improving the economic position they would abolish that Department.  If one looks at the management structure in that Department one will see that there are more officials there spreading all over the place than there are in any of the economic Departments.  It is the best built pyramid I have ever seen in public administration. It is not so many years ago when the work of that Department was managed by a section in the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>This Government appointed a Minister to take charge of it and thereby gave it more status than it ever had before.  The Taoiseach cannot deny that it is the most beautiful pyramid that exists in the public service.  The Government have given that Department extra status by appointing a Minister to take charge of it.  If the Government were interested in cutting public expenditure they would scrap that Department and appoint the officials to other Departments.</P>

      <P>When I was in Government <Col N="1041" /> I considered that Department to be a watchdog and a nuisance.  They would not make a decision to keep themselves warm.  The structure there is a disgrace and is a reflection on the Government.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach thinks that our economy can continue with this disproportionatly low expenditure in economic areas it is no wonder that our economy is lagging instead of progressing.  Expenditure has been going in the wrong direction and we expect people in those areas, with a lousy 8 per cent increase in expenditure, to produce the wealth that will sustain the services of the country.</P>
      <P>It is time we got our philosophy, our planning and our priorities right.  It is time we set our priorities against a background of self-reliance because others will not do it for us.  It is part of our culture, history and make-up that we have been a dependent nation.  We were downtrodden by the oppressor for centuries and we have not got over the lack of selfconfidence.  We need leadership to motivate the people, to give them back the confidence that they had to solve their own problems in their own way, but we do not need any more of this leading our people down the garden path, trying to pretend we are reducing the foreign debt when the figures show that we are not. We are trying to pretend we are not borrowing money when the national debt has gone up by £2,900 million this year, with very little to show for it.</P>
      <P>The Government have been trying to pretend that they have no responsibility to provide employment.  Of course, they have.  They have the responsibility to create the environment for proper investment. They have been promising it continually, but like many other things the Government have been saying in the last 13 months, they have been doing nothing about it.  They have not done anything about tax reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will leave the details of the various tax impositions to my colleagues.  However, I am announcing the broad strategy of my party.  This budget will do nothing to solve our major problems.  If the good doctor himself, the Taoiseach, had followed earlier prescriptions and did what he said he would do, we would be making <Col N="1042" /> a start on the road to recovery.  He did not do it though he was prepared to let people think he was doing it.  The problems are increasing instead of getting smaller.  Postponement from this year to next year is only a soft option.  Taking the soft option of reducing the capital programme two years in a row is purely pretending.  When the Government should be reducing current expenditure they are reducing capital expenditure. When they should be halting the rise in unemployment they are causing increased unemployment.  When they should be reducing inflation and getting us to become more competitive in the market places in which we have to sell, this budget alone puts almost 1 per cent on the CPI.  Ministers for Finance in the past kept the CPI increase down to a minimum, but the Taoiseach knows as well as I that when he puts 6p a gallon on oils it will add to manufacturing costs and find its way to the shop shelves, and the consumer will be paying at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on what I believe is a step in the right direction. Three times this year I have advocated the move towards the setting up of venture capital here.  I do not think the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance knows the format this new tax incentive for people to invest in industry will take. However, it is a welcome move which was badly needed because it is quite clear that the equity ratio to borrowing is far too high and that we need to get venture capital going.  The incentive was never there; it was always in favour of the office block builder or the safe investor in Government gilts.  The risk that has to be taken to develop industry was never recognised.  I am glad to say that the first step has been taken.</P>
    <P>I will write to the Minister for Finance to explain the various proposals I have been making.  I believe much can be achieved if we do the thing right.  There are many people here, professionals, and others, who are earning decent money who, if they thought they could invest £25,000 or as much as £50,000 in industrial projects, would be prepared to pay their capital gains tax if they succeeded <Col N="1043" /> and who, if they lost their money could write it off against their tax assessments. If that were to happen there would be quite an influx of money.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think this should be confined to individuals.  That sort of money lying around the Irish economy has to be corralled and collected together.  The Government should recognise the companies who would specialise in getting venture capital ready for investment in Irish industry.  The money is there.  Nobody who saw the hundreds of millions of pounds available for speculation in oil shares can doubt that.  That money needs to be put to better use.  It destroys the ethos of our people to see hundreds of millions of pounds coming from nowhere to be speculated in shares, yet when money is needed to give employment, it is not to be had.</P>
    <P>The time has come when that type of speculation in shares should not be allowed to continue.  It most certainly would not be allowed in America on the stock exchange.  It should be stopped here because it is having a detrimental effect on the unemployed, on our young people, on the whole ethos and culture of our people, when they think that hundreds of millions of pounds are changing hands every day for manipulation of the stock exchange, by hook or by crook, call it what you like.  Those people would not get away with it in the United States stock exchange.  If it is not controlled urgently we will be seen as a paradise for speculators at a time when there is no money for investment in the things badly needed in our economy.</P>
    <P>I would applaud any Government that would take action in this area.  I cannot understand the logic of retaining ACT.  I read the Minister's speech about it but I should like to hear more about it.  As I said in the budget debate last year, this advance tax is total discrimination against native industry.  It does not affect the multinationals or the foreign investors.  It affects only Irish companies who have built themselves up and become strong.</P>
    <P>Which philosophy are we to follow in the future?  Do we want to build up strong Irish companies that can trade internationally <Col N="1044" /> in goods and services or do we want to depend on outsiders to do the job for us?  If we want to build up a strong Irish economy we need to look again at ACT.  The media and politicians get up and talk about Michael Smurfit and his organisation going to the States to expand their empire and when they see Cement Roadstone going to Denver in Colorado.  Will they stop to ask themselves why are those companies going there?  They are going there for two reasons: one, the return on risk in the Irish economy is not being remunerated, and two, ACT has been a real slap in the face to a least one major company.  I could name others, but I will not name companies in this House.  We know what our public companies felt when ACT was introduced.  We know what happened to companies who invested £100,000 in Irish industry.  We have decided that if we can find foreign investment, and it is becoming scarce, we will let it in and at the same time let imports run riot through the economy.  In time we will become a large warehouse with a computer.</P>
    <P>Is that what our future is all about?  Is that what our people want to see?  What we need now is an interim plan to tackle unemployment, to declare an unemployment crisis, to consider a national construction corps.  Economists may argue against it.  There are jobs which can be done.  If infrastructure, roads and other areas use Irish raw materials and use the money we are paying out in dole with very little top-up, that is better economics. Those are the type of questions the people on the street are asking us.  There is no point in giving them an airy-fairy answer.  They want to know where is the logic of borrowing money to pay unemployment and not borrowing it to put money into infrastructural projects.  If somebody does not come up with answers maybe some of the people out there will deliver different answers.  We cannot afford to ignore the rising tide of unemployment. We invested a lot of taxpayers' money in educating those young people. They are coming out of the universities and regional colleges very articulated but they do not see any hope for the future.</P>
    <P>The Government should be able to <Col N="1045" /> give those young people some hope.  They are not being given any hope or shown a national economic plan they can follow. They are not being shown anything they can identify with.  It is important to give those young people an interim plan to show them that we know where we are going and a long-term national economic plan based on export-led growth and import substitution.  I hear very little from the Government on import substitution. During the short term I was Minister in the last Government my colleague, Deputy Ray Burke, and I had two import substitution units established in our Departments because we identified in the import lists a very serious erosion of raw materials not alone in Government contracts but in semi-State contracts and requirements.  That programme seems to have died when Fianna Fáil left office.  I hope it has not.  I would like to think it would be pushed forward. I put it on the record today that on the analysis that was done in the short term I was there, by taking 10 per cent off our import list at the moment we can create 16,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the well publicised scandal of what is happening in our food business.  Until some Government take the radical step of deciding that one single Department will be responsible for the development of our food industry and forget the spread which exists between at least three Government Departments and probably eight or nine semi-State bodies we will continue to have an absolutely crazy situation.  Somebody at some stage must decide to appoint one man, invest all the authority in him, and finish with a spread all over the place, having one Department fighting against another and each Department wanting to hold on to their own little bits and pieces, their own independence, authority and programme. We have as good food technologists coming out of our schools of technology and universities as there are in any place in the world.</P>
    <P>I am still waiting to see the White Paper published.  I made a proposition in that White Paper that one organisation should <Col N="1046" /> be given the job of developing our food industry on a pilot basis.  The organisation which I chose then to do it was SFADCo because I believed they had done a marvellous job in pioneering many new concepts in the small industry area.  I believed they had reached their zenith there and that they were looking for new challenges.  I genuinely believe they should be given the opportunity on a three-year basis to take over the whole food industry in an area which spreads very far.  Perhaps it would be necessary to extend their area slightly to take in another few co-ops but there was an entity there.  There was an organisation there and the challenge was open to them.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have always shown themselves capable of taking the initiative, doing a pilot scheme on various projects and then coming back to the Government and being able to say that this was the project and the direction we should be going.  We continue to talk and set up task forces.  I saw recently where a junior task force of Ministers is to be set up to look at what might be done with the food industry.  While we continue to do that and have committees sitting on this and committees sitting on that, task forces of Ministers on this and that and task forces going down to Cork to ask what the problems and the answers are down there, we will never get anywhere.  We all know what the problems are in Cork.  The Taoiseach knows them as well as I do.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and everybody else know them.  There is no point in wasting executives' time sending them down to Cork.  One would think that Cork was in South Africa.  There is no point in sending down task forces of top men, wasting their time, writing another report to pile on top of other reports.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on giving the go-ahead to the Ringaskiddy project. At least it is some vote of confidence in the area.  I cannot understand the logic of the previous Coalition Government taking it out two years ago when they said it should not be done.  Now it is put back in again.  I consider the Government are right to do it and I compliment them for doing it.</P>
    <P>We know there is no instant solution <Col N="1047" /> to the problems in Cork.  Cork has a long industrial tradition but attitudes have become very rigid in certain areas there. That is not the way forward.  I believe they are entitled to know from the Government what is the future of Irish Steel; they are entitled to know what is the future of Verolme Cork Dockyard and the future of NET.  All those are coming in on a cloud of depression which has descended on Cork.  We must clear that out of the way and start anew.  Cork is getting together a new industrial base. That has to be encouraged because it is the future for Cork.  There is no point in looking back on what has happened.  We want to build anew and restore confidence in Cork.</P>
    <P>The electronics industry are building up a fine base in Cork.  I believe this should be complimented by setting up a software centre similar to the one in Dublin so that the young graduates and young technologists coming out of Cork can, along with the Micro Electronics Research Centre, get together and use their talents in developing new software programmes.  The Taoiseach probably knows as well as I do that the world market for software is not within 35 per cent of being satisfied.  Software is the one development that really suits this country because it uses people and not capital goods.  It uses brain power.  Any industrialists that I met in my short term in promoting the IDA in the east coast or west coast of the States, in Germany or anywhere else, said that our graduates had the most creative minds, that they are far ahead of the US graduates, that the US graduates are stereotyped coming out of the universities but our graduates are very creative, openminded, anxious to learn and anxious to get on with a new challenge.  We are letting them go to waste in the dole queues throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Government should put a software enterprise centre in Cork.  It will probably cost only £1 million like the one in Dublin will cost.  The young people should be put in there and international companies who will set up in Cork and probably in Limerick as an advertisement alone will <Col N="1048" /> put computers in there for those people if they want to work on other projects. The Government should use the brain power that is there to develop the software programmes which are needed all over the world today.</P>
    <P>A small Irish company, who went public recently, developed their own software programme and went out to the States with only one programme in their bag.  That was for the building societies in the States.  Many people thought this would not be possible.  They have been so successful in selling that programme to the building societies in the States that they have taken over an American company. I visited the Nixdorf computer set up in Germany.  This is an interesting and enlightening trip for anybody.  This is a self-made man who has built up his computer business despite all the bureaucracy and red tape put in his way, despite not getting any assistance from the German Government and despite their intrusion into the way he was training his people. He set up a training centre on the campus. The German Government frowned on this but four years later they came to recognise that he was doing the right thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>He was doing the right thing.  He trains 2,300 young graduates on the computer side, in software programming, writing, technical areas and so on.  We need that sort of development. I agreed with Herr Nixdorf before I left Germany, in conjunction with the Irish Government, meaning the IDA, to set up a similar training unit in Bray where he has a very fine plant and he is committed to expand it with no strings attached as to where the graduates trained in that centre are to go.  He did not say that because it was on his campus and because he has a 50 per cent share-holding in it he has to get X, Y, Z or 20 per cent of those graduates.  Since I left office bureaucracy has bogged that down. Whether it is in the Department of Education, the Department of Labour or wherever, it is a poor response that, having agreed with a man of the stature and <Col N="1049" /> calibre of Herr Nixdorf, a year and a half later we have done nothing about it.  Any inquiries I have made have led me to believe it is bogged down in bureaucracy and there are 300 young graduates in this city who could well do with that type of training and programme.</P>
      <P>I came across a firm in Colarado whose idea was to develop new business and new ideas.  They would take over office blocks and get a large international computer company to set a computer on every desk with no charge whatsoever to the young people who wanted to go in and develop their ideas.  Out of that grew in 12 months 2,000 business ideas and small businesses.  We have plenty of IDA factories idle and we have office blocks idle also.  Indeed, it is probable that the Government own office blocks which they have not gone into yet.  Irrespective of that, that company were prepared to come to Ireland in response to a request. I do not know if anything has been done about that.  Such a positive move would give hope and confidence to young people.</P>
      <P>We must not take up a defeatist attitude. There is a way out of our problems if we decide to solve them ourselves.  The Government cannot solve every problem for everybody and they have never claimed that they can, but they have a responsibility to create the right environment in which investment can flourish and enterprise will be encouraged and at the end of the day the risk-taker will be rewarded.  We must not pander to ideologists left, right and centre and say that we must do this or that because the ideology says so or not do that because it will be seen to be working for private endeavour and private enterprise.  Let us have the courage of our convictions, nail our colours to the mast, decide on the best route to take, and take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget is a disappointment in all the things it did not do and the very few things it did.  I welcome anything that is positive in it, but it has been a total disappointment to the PAYE sector who were led to believe that they would find relief here because of a nod here and a wink there, but 50,000 people have gone into a higher tax bracket and £663 million <Col N="1050" /> more is being taken out of the economy. I have often heard calls from the opposite side of the House: &ldquo;If you want to do something where do you get the money?&rdquo; If only a fraction of the extra taxation taken out was left there, how much could consumer spending be boosted?  How many more jobs would be retained that will be lost in the coming year?</P>

      <P>I started with one and I will go on with more.  I told the House what I did to reduce current expenditure in the Department I was in for nine months and the record is there to show it.  Reduce it by 21 per cent and if you get 14 other Departments to do that you are well on the road if you want to do the job properly.</P>
      <P>The budget is disappointing generally for what was not in it and what it did not do and could have done, the lost opportunities, no encouragement for investment, for the risk-taker or the man who wants to work harder, more tax taken out, national debt going up by £2,900 million in 1983 and the people on the street asking who is spending their money, what are they getting for it.  If that is the best we can do, maybe we should have a different system and if we do not watch ourselves that will happen.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to answer the question posed in a disorderly way on the Order of Business which I would have been happy to answer then but the Ceann Comhairle ruled that I should not do so.  There appears to be some extraordinary confusion on the part of the Opposition over these figures about the employment level.  It was explained last night.  I was not here at the <Col N="1051" /> time but perhaps in the hurly-burly in the concluding minutes of the debate they did not take up what the Minister said. The position is simple and I am astonished that the Opposition should not understand it.  This was a temporary levy introduced and allowed for in the Government finances for a single year.  It has now been extended for a further year. In the estimates of receipts and expenditure the figure shown for 1983 of £40 million, is the product of this for nine months with a lag in payment because payment is X months in arrears; therefore you get less than three-quarters of the full amount in that year.  On the other hand, the figure shown for 1984 of £34 million was the amount that would have come had the temporary levy been terminated, allowing for the fact that the lagged payments would mean that you would get that three months' payments in that year.  In the budget, however, we decided, as was announced, to continue that levy for a further year subject to a remission in the case of people who in any week earn less than £96.  The result of that was as set out in the table at the end of the budget speech, to add £40 million under the heading of &ldquo;Temporary Tax Measures to be continued, income levy £40 million&rdquo;, that being the £45 million if it were continued without remission less the £5 million remission for people earning less than £96 per week. Then in the yellow table showing the outcome of the budget the £40 million extra as a result of continuing it and it coming in during approximately eight months of this year added to the £34 million from the imposition of last year which would have come in in the ordinary way, add up to £74 million.  I fail to understand how the Opposition could not grasp that.</P>

If you decide to continue it you will get the money for the rest of the year and you add that in to the budget figures when you produce the budget.</P>

      <P>He said that at the column for 1984 in which appears &ldquo;Revenue £74 million&rdquo;, the period covered is the 12 months of 1984 with the renewed levy. The column for 1983 shows £40 million, the total in 1983.  He went on to say that the figure for 1984 includes the figures of the adjustment for the remainder of the year, the reintroduction of the levy, but the Deputies would not listen to him.</P>

      <P>There were three months to be added in.  If you took <i>pro rata</i> three months and £40 million for a full year you would get £13.3 million and if you add that to £40 million you will arrive at £53 million.  Instead of that the budget figure is £74 million.  There is no explanation of that.  Also the budget speech clearly gives the impression that <Col N="1053" /> the receipts from this 1 per cent levy are £40 million when in effect they are £74 million.  The Taoiseach cannot deny that.</P>

      <P>I have the text in front of me and the Minister did not say three months.  If the Deputy is unaware that payments of tax are lagged by a month and that that effects the figures it is a different matter, but I do not believe he does not understand that.  He was one of the more intelligent Ministers on the other side.  The Minister's speech explained the additional amount raised by introducing the levy and the table at the end of the speech refers to the addition of temporary tax raised by the income levy at £40 million.  The Deputy could have read that.  Perhaps other Members opposite were less able than Deputy Reynolds to grasp the simple facts involved.  However, having exploded that imaginary balloon which was launched with such aplomb this morning by the Leader of the Opposition, I shall now make my own speech.</P>
      <P>This budget is a further step in implementing the strategy set out at the end of 1982 in our <i>Programme for Government.</i></P>
      <P>The extra taxes which the budget imposes are less than in any budget of the last four years and these taxes are balanced by welfare provisions matching the cost of living.  The budget will, in fact, take an estimated 15,000 people out of the tax net.</P>
      <P>The level of increase in the consumer price index involved in the budget changes &mdash; at less than 1 per cent &mdash; is smaller than in any of the last four budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget will reduce the level of the current deficit from the 12.5 per cent of GNP that it would have reached in 1982 if we had not taken immediate steps to control the situation when we assumed power in June 1981 to a figure for 1984 which on an equivalent basis is just over half that level.  That is the progress made on the deficit after two-and-a-half years work by the Government.  It reduces borrowing as a proportion of GNP from a threatened 21 per cent of GNP to a figure about two-fifths lower than that.  Those are the achievements of this and the other <Col N="1054" /> budgets we proposed and in two out of three cases introduced in this House.</P>
    <P>In general the budget will add a stimulus to the economy, while at the same time moving in the direction to get the economy right and to increase employment opportunities for our people.</P>
    <P>We recognised when we took over in mid-1981 and again after a brief interval at the end of 1982 that the task of halting and reversing the growth of unemployment, while phasing out the current budget deficit, posed a greater challenge than any Irish Government or the Irish people had faced since the early years of the State.</P>
    <P>We promised then to face up to this twin challenge in a manner that would evoke from the nation a co-operative response to the policies necessary, given firm leadership and equitable handling of the problems created by the crisis.</P>
    <P>We recognised at that time that the phasing out of the current budget deficit over the years to 1987 would have to be undertaken with due regard to prevailing economic conditions as we said at that time.  There is now general acceptance of the need for such a prudent but positive approach.</P>
    <P>In particular we pointed out the importance of achieving economic growth and dealing with unemployment.  The increase of more than 28,000 in unemployment in 1983, though showing a slower increase in the past nine months, only serves to underline the fact that the most urgent economic and social problem facing us is that of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Government have in this budget concentrated on measures to achieve the maximum economic recovery consistent with international economic developments and protection of our international credit standing.  Until the economy is once again expanding employment will not rise at a rate sufficient to stabilise and reduce unemployment to a level where greater revenue buoyancy and reduced social welfare spending can contribute to the elimination of the current budget deficit by 1987.  The reduction in the current deficit from 8.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent of national output strikes the appropriate balance between correction of the public <Col N="1055" /> finances on the one hand and ensuring the stability of the economy and the possibility of growth on the other.</P>
    <P>Few if any economic commentators foresaw in 1979 and 1980 the depth of the international recession that has taken place since then and from which we are just emerging.  Unfortunately, recovery that began to take place in recent times has not resulted in a fall in unemployment except in the US.  In the European Community there were more than 12 million people unemployed at end 1983 compared with six million at end 1978.</P>
    <P>At the same time, on the positive side there has been a stabilisation at a low level in the rate of inflation.  The OECD forecasts for 1984 show a total for the seven major countries of 5 per cent as compared with 4.75 per cent last year. The rate of inflation in this country in the past 12 months, exclusive of the cost of living effect of last year's budget, was less than 7 per cent.  This year the budget adds less than 1 per cent to the cost of living, smaller than in any of the last four budgets and giving an underlying inflation rate of under 8 per cent.  Policies to match the lower rate of inflation elsewhere are essential so as to encourage increased employment here and, in time, lower unemployment.  We must now move to control internal costs so that our annual rate of inflation through 1984 and into 1985 can with the benefit of international price developments be held at or, possibly and preferably, even below the level elsewhere.  This is not an academic argument: it is the only basis on which our economy can grow and our people find employment within their own country.</P>
    <P>The overall strategy of the budget is to provide the conditions for faster growth and a recovery in employment.  We are doing this by reducing the real level of Government supply service expenditure as much as possible and by redirecting available resources to productive investment. In determining public expenditure policy we bore in mind the advice given recently by the European Commission in their annual report for 1983-84 that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> In pursuing this objective, however, it is important to maintain an appropriate balance between tax increasing and expenditure cutting measures given their respective economic costs. Recent budgets have stressed large increases in the level and scope of taxaction, while the current low level of activity reduces tax buoyancy; this suggests that a new general increase in taxation would not be appropriate in 1984 but that attention should now be directed at achieving significant real cuts in expenditure.  Pressure on scarce Exchequer resources is likely to continue, principally because of the continuing high level of interest charges on the accumulated national debt and increasing demand for social expenditure. Great efforts are therefore necessary to reduce both current and capital spending programmes.  It would seem appropriate to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1984 by 1 to 1.5 per cent of GDP by reference to the likely outturn for 1983 and on the basis of the current budgetary definitions.</P>
    <P>That is what we have done.  It is against the background of this authoritative advice that I want to present my analysis of the budget.</P>
    <P>I propose in the first instance to place this budget in the context of a series of financial measures which had to be taken, and which remain to be taken, in order to restore to us full control over our own financial affairs.  The situation in which £3 out of every £8 of taxation is used for interest or sinking fund payments on past borrowings and where, in consequence, only £5 out of every £8 of taxation is available to provide public services, to stimulate growth and employment, and to improve equity in the distribution of resources is frankly intolerable.  It is all the more intolerable when the need to raise such sums for this purpose, which offers no present or future benefit to our people, entails a level of taxation which both in respect of direct and indirect taxation is by any objective standards much too high and offers a disincentive both to work and to enterprise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> Once public borrowing has been allowed, as it was allowed, to reach a certain level it is in danger of becoming self-perpetuating because the annual increment of additional interest and sinking fund payment begins to rise at a rate that pushes up faster and faster the total level of current Government spending each year.  Every £1,000 million spent to finance the current deficit adds about £150 million to the taxation which the Government have to raise annually in subsequent years.  This faces Government and people with a choice between an ever-rising level of total spending, or cutting back with ever-increasing sharpness the actual level of spending on the public services.</P>
    <P>This country reached that danger point some years ago after a four-year period in which current public expenditure as a share of national output was recklessly increased by more that one-fifth, from 38.5 per cent to 46.5 per cent of GNP. The initial response of the then Government to the financing of this expenditure explosion which they engineered was to cover about half of it by tax increases, raising taxation from 27.3 per cent of GNP in 1977 to 32.3 per cent of GNP in 1981, but leaving the remainder to be covered by a sharp rise in borrowing.</P>
    <P>Because of the threat posed to our financial stability by the enormous rise in borrowing required to finance both half of the extra current spending, as well as a big increase on the capital side, successive Governments of different complexions have had no alternative in the past three years but to take the steps necessary to reduce sharply the total level of borrowing as a percentage of GNP &mdash; which in the budgets between July 1981 and March 1982 involved very sharp increases in taxation.</P>
    <P>During these past two-and-a-half years an effective start has been made in bringing under control the surging burden of additional interest and sinking fund payments. This action was rendered all the more necessary because the level of borrowing itself had reached proportions which raised the spectre of a loss of control of our own affairs through a possible inability to borrow the ever-increasing <Col N="1058" /> proportion of GNP demanded by the spiralling financial crisis set off in 1977 to 1981.  Some figures may illustrate the extent of the problem and the extent to which already it has begun to be successfully tackled.</P>
    <P>Between 1977 and 1981 the current budget deficit had risen from 3.75 per cent of GNP to 8 per cent of GNP and the level of Exchequer borrowing from 10 per cent to 16.57 per cent of GNP. This situation was aggravated by the fact that during this period the proportion of borrowing that had proved possible to effect on the domestic market fell sharply.  In 1977 net foreign borrowing amounted to only £86 million, or 1.5 per cent of GNP, and the bulk of the borrowing requirement, at 10 per cent of GNP, was available from domestic sources. Incidentally, there was no net increase in foreign borrowing that year as that £86 million of extra borrowing was offset by £87 million of a reduction in duty on exchange rate movements which at that time were favourable.  We ended that year with a £1 million reduction in the net amount outstanding.</P>
    <P>By contrast with the situation in 1977 when 8½ of the 10 per cent of GNP was borrowed at home, the availability of the necessary domestic borrowing had been reduced in 1981 to the point where it was only half as large as a proportion of national output, 4.25 per cent of GNP. The situation had deteriorated to the point where the Government's capacity to borrow at home had been halved in relation to GNP although their borrowing needs had increased by two-thirds. That was the degree of mismanagement of our economy in those four years.  As a result, in 1981 no less than three-quarters of the total amount required to be borrowed to finance the current deficit and the increased capital programme had to be borrowed abroad.  That involved a level of foreign borrowing equivalent to 12.5 per cent or one-eighth of GNP, an appalling figure and a level of foreign borrowing which to anyone with any knowledge of the kind of foreign borrowing undertaken by countries with stable economies obviously constituted a threat to our stability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> It was this that set alarm bells ringing and it required the most drastic action to be taken if the country's national solvency was to be protected and its ability maintained to borrow at home and abroad the reasonable sums needed to sustain the economy and to prevent a massive economic collapse.  That was the position that faced the Government elected in mid-1981, but the threat revealed when they came to power was far greater even than these emerging 1981 figures revealed.  On the information provided to the Government by our advisers when we came into office at the time, the current deficit likely to emerge in 1982 in the absence of most drastic budgetary action, would jump further from 8 per cent to about 12.5 per cent of GNP and the level of borrowing required would increase in 1982 from 16.75 per cent to about 21 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Immediate action had to be taken to stem this disastrous slide, and the budgets of mid-1981 and January 1982 &mdash; the latter of which was actually implemented by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government with some unfortunate modifications as to content &mdash; succeeded in reducing these threateningly high figures back down to about the same level as in 1981.  Moreover, borrowing on the domestic market was possible on a larger scale as confidence returned following these measures, with the result that foreign borrowing was reduced in that year from 12.5 per cent to 9.75 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The progress made since then in the budget of 1983 and in the budget now before the House has been significant. The level of the current deficit this year would, but for the technical adjustment arising out of the vesting of the Post Office, have been just half that threatened for 1982 at the time when this Government took office two-and-a-half years ago.  In two-and-a-half years we have solved half of the problem of the current deficit left to us in June 1981 by Fianna Fáil.  Similarly, Exchequer borrowing in the current year on the same basis has been reduced by something not far short of half &mdash; from 21 per cent of <Col N="1060" /> GNP to a figure which but for the Post Office adjustment would have been just over 12 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>In the light of this presentation let no one say that this Government are preoccupied with book-keeping for its own sake.  Since we first came to office in mid-1981, and despite the short break in the life of the Government during part of 1982, we have been fighting a battle against a threat to employment that would have been on a far, far larger scale than that which now faces us.  We have been fighting also to create the conditions in which it would be possible to bring in a budget that would not be deflationary in character, that would not add significantly to inflation, and that would contain provisions designed, even if in the first instance on a small scale, to stimulate employment, as well as some measures of relief to the general taxpayer and to particular sectors of the economy faced with extreme difficulties as a result of the recession.</P>
    <P>As a result of our persistence during the two-and-a-half years in the face of inevitable unpopularity and political opposition in the Dáil, we have succeeded in attaining this objective of introducing such a budget within two-and-a-half years of starting on this road, and despite the interruption of our work, and a considerable loss of ground resulting from that interruption, during the course of 1982.  In this year's budget, for the first time in two-and-a-half years, it has been possible as a result of tight control of expenditure, to limit the net increase in taxation to a small figure, offset twice over by social welfare increases, while, at the same time, continuing the process of reducing the current deficit and borrowing as a share of GNP.</P>
    <P>By any standards this is no mean achievement, and I do not propose to under-sell it.  To describe the budget as neutral is to understate the position so far as its impact on the man or woman in the street is concerned.  Leaving on one side such measures as the earlier date of payment of tax on building societies and the capital tax and stamp duty provisions and other measures of this kind, the actual additional taxation payable by <Col N="1061" /> individuals through excise duties, VAT, and so forth, is around £75 million, whereas tax reliefs to persons are about £40 million and additional social welfare provisions about £70 million.  Thus, in terms of the availability of money to the broad mass of the people, there is a net relief &mdash; small but a relief nonetheless &mdash; of the order of £35 million after two-and-a-half years of tackling the crisis left to us by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>At the same time the budget contains a number of measures designed to promote employment.  The greatest of these is, of course, the restoration of stability in the public finances and the promise it brings that we can, gradually, reduce taxes and encourage enterprise in an environment that is not clouded with uncertainty, either economic or political. But there are a number of other more specific measures to which I would like to draw the attention of the House.  In addition to the review of the enterprise allowance scheme, introduced towards the end of 1983, which has been proved so successful, there are:</P>
    <P>additional resources for an employment support scheme to be provided by Córas Tráchtála;</P>
    <P>tax reliefs for long-term venture capital in new enterprises.</P>
    <P>I noted Deputy Reynolds's welcome for that proposal.  I share his sentiments generally about the contrast between the need to get venture capital into industry and the type of speculation which we have had with oil shares.  Indeed, if I might say so, while the first hour of the Deputy's speech was of an understandably political character of scoring points, the last half hour of his speech, apart from the concluding couple of minutes, was a very interesting and constructive analysis by someone who, as I know, has extensive business experience.  It is a matter of regret that these were only between one and three members of his party there to listen to him during that part of his speech.  I certainly listened to him with attention and interest when he turned from politics to business.</P>

      <P>I do not feel that we should encourage Deputy Haughey to let himself down any further.</P>
      <P>Other measures included were:</P>
      <P>a very substantial improvement in the tax provision in relation to profit sharing;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> a renewal of the corporation tax deduction in respect of additional employees;</P>
    <P>an extension of the initial allowance for plant and machinery and initial and annual allowances for industrial buildings which were due to expire;</P>
    <P>an extension of the industrial buildings provisions to laboratories used for analysis work in connection with mining and oil exploration;</P>
    <P>an extension for a further three years of the allowances to encourage people to invest in the private sector in the construction of toll roads, bridges and multi-storey car-parks, which were due to expire on 31 March next;</P>
    <P>abolition of the claw back of stock relief once granted;</P>
    <P>a new system of stock relief on the basis of the opening stock shown on the accounts;</P>
    <P>and a reduction of VAT on concrete from 23 per cent to 5 per cent from 1 March next.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural sector the AI and ground limestone reliefs which were due to terminate have been extended and a special provision has been made to help with the domestic co-operative marketing of potatoes.  In addition, the stamp duty provision designed to encourage the transfer of farms to young farmers has been extended for a further year, taking account of the fact of the difficulties which some young farmers have experienced in acquiring the necessary number of hours training to qualify in time for this relief.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, the budget provides:</P>
    <P>an additional £8 million for road improvements &mdash; £1½ million more than the amount taken in additional road tax; the amount available for housing through SDA loans and Housing Finance Agency have been increased by £3 million each &mdash; a total of £6 million more for housing; an additional £2 million has been provided <Col N="1066" /> for the repair of primary schools; and funds have been provided for two projects of significant importance to major provincial centres &mdash; the Ringaskiddy deep-water berth and Galway airport.</P>
    <P>The total increased provision for capital spending on construction work is over £18 million.  In sum, taking the range of additional and extended incentives, the measures in the agricultural sector, the additional capital spending in these areas, in a situation of great financial difficulty, I believe that this Government have done well to provide this additional incentive for employment over such a wide range, even if the total allowance necessarily has to be limited.  I would add that, in the area of tourism, there has also been extended a reduction in the rate of VAT on car, caravan and boat hire to 18 per cent and the allocation of an additional £300,000 to Bord Fáilte to enable them to take advantage of the present opportunities in the North American market to attract visitors to Ireland, arising from the current favourable exchange rate situation affecting potential American visitors, with the dollar at just half the rate it was at about three years ago.  The punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> the dollar is half the rate so that holidays in Europe, and Ireland in particular, are very attractive to American visitors.  A further boost to tourism is the scheme to refund VAT on retail purchases by tourists exported in their personal luggage.  As I mentioned yesterday in the course of the discussions during the evening, this will be of particular value in relation to American visitors because, of course, visitors in the EEC can export £145 of purchases without paying VAT in the country to which they are returning.</P>
    <P>That it has been possible in this budget to make provision for such a wide range of measures designed to assist different sections of the economy, albeit necessarily at this stage in relatively small ways, is a measure of the progress that we have made in the short and interrupted period of two-and-a-half years since this Government first came to power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> But this budget has also concerned itself with issues of social justice and equity.  Provision has been made for social welfare including children's allowances in line with the expected increase in consumer prices during the 12 months from when these increases will apply. Following on the accumulated effect of the last two budgets, in which the provision for social welfare over a period of two-and-a-quarter years exceeded significantly the increases in the cost of living during this period, these social welfare provisions indicate the commitment of both parties in this Government to the maintenance of the living standards of the least well-off in the community, even at a time when the living standards of others have necessarily had to fall.  I doubt if there are many, or perhaps any, other European countries whose record in this respect during these difficult recent years matches that of our Government in the three budgets which we have had the responsibility for preparing in 1982, 1983 and now in the current year.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, at a time when average living standards over these years of those in employment have fallen by something in the order of 10 per cent, average living standards of the less privileged groups of the community, those on social welfare, have risen by approximately an equivalent amount.  In no other European country of which I am aware, has anything of that kind happened.  On the contrary, other European countries have been cutting, in real terms and indeed in some cases in current terms, social welfare benefits.  We stand in this respect, as a result of the efforts of this Government in the three budgets which they have prepared, alone and unique in Europe and are proud to do so.</P>
    <P>There is also a further point, which seemed to be widely missed last year, that these social welfare provisions have been made now for two successive years without any increase in the pay-related social insurance premiums either by employers or workers.  The ceiling for payments of PRSI was increased last year but there was no further increase in the ceiling this year, when the actual rates of <Col N="1068" /> payment have, uniquely, been held unchanged with a view on the one hand to minimising the cost to employers, and on the other hand of holding down the amount taken from employees through PRSI.  Again I doubt whether this record can be matched in many or perhaps even any, other European countries over this period.</P>
    <P>But the social welfare increases, undertaken without any increase in PRSI rates are not the only social provisions of this budget.  The tax changes include provisions that will place widows with dependent children in the same favourable position as married people.  Pension parity in the public service in respect of general pay increases is being provided for after many years during which it has been sought from successive Governments.  A measure of immediate relief to the low paid workers, most of whom are not liable to tax and so cannot benefit from the tax reliefs is provided by the remission of the temporary levy on any pay packets which, in a particular week, fall below £96.  And the Government's commitment to introduce a family income supplement, a provision to which my own party have been particularly strongly committed for some years past, is being fulfilled later this year at an annual cost of £13 million in a scheme, details of which will be announced by the Minister for Social Welfare.  I am particularly happy that we have reached the stage where such a scheme can be introduced, as I believe that the absence of any such provision has been one of the most undesirable features of our whole income-distribution system for many years past.</P>
    <P>Apart from the social inequity of failure to assist families where the breadwinner is at work and whose income may be no more than, or indeed lower than, those on social welfare, there is the economic disadvantage of that situation in which people find themselves, as a result, better off not at work than at work.  That we are proceeding to eliminate and, in this budget, eliminate in a positive way by supplementing the incomes of those at work.</P>
    <P>Another category of people who will be helped in this budget are older people <Col N="1069" /> who are tenants of private landlords and whose age has prevented them from benefiting from the tax provision we provided to cover this category in last year's budget.  The lowering of the qualifying age from 65 to 60 will, I believe, be welcomed by the 4,000 persons who will benefit from this provision, quite a number of whom will have suffered as a result of the increase in private rents arising from the abolition of rent control through a constitutional decision of the courts.</P>
    <P>So far as the income tax payers are concerned, the budget makes a provision to increase the exemption limits, thus relieving 15,000 people from the obligation to pay income tax.  It increases the personal allowances by £350 for a single person, a widowed person and a one-parent family and by £700 for a married couple, which, after allowing for the effects of the elimination of the 25 per cent income tax band, gives a measure of relief from income tax to all taxpayers. The Government would have wished to have been able to make further reliefs available in this area but within the constraints imposed by the need to control the current deficit and borrowing, and the need to provide the employment-creation measures and social welfare increases that I have already outlined, this is the limit of what is possible in the current year.  It represents, however, the start of a path which we propose to follow in future years.</P>
    <P>At the same time work of securing equity in the tax system has required attention to other areas of taxation.  In the face of the very considerable practical difficulties that exist in relation to the taxation of self-employed people on a current year basis &mdash; because of the manner in which their income is spread over the year &mdash; provision has been made to increase from 80 per cent to 85 per cent the proportion of the final amount payable by self-employed taxpayers who appeal an assessment.</P>
    <P>The capital acquisitions tax system is being rationalised, and the new system will yield an additional £1 million this year and £4 million in a full year.  At the same time action is being taken to prevent the abuse of discretionary trusts in <Col N="1070" /> cases where the settlor has died and the youngest beneficiary has reached 25 years of age.  This provision will not interfere with the proper use of discretionary trusts, but will operate as an effective discouragement of the abuse of the trusts for avoidance purposes.</P>
    <P>At the same time, in a decision effective yesterday, new section 84 lending and artificial preference share financing will no longer confer a tax advantage, and accelerated capital allowances in respect of assets leased will henceforth be allowed only where such leasing forms part of a grant-aided incentive package from the State agencies.  These measures will bring to an end avoidance mechanisms which have proved very costly to the State.  In the current year this change will yield £7 million, but the amount involved next year will be many times greater than this.</P>
    <P>Other tax avoidance provisions include those against bond-washing and the removal of tax exemption in respect of gains made on Exchequer bills and other similar non-interest bearing securities.</P>
    <P>The measures are in addition to the unprecedented drive against tax avoidance which we initiated last year and which included such very wide-ranging measures, indeed by far the majority of those put to us by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to deal with tax avoidance and which I understand are estimated to have yielded somewhat more than the figure for which we made provision for tax avoidance measures in last year's budget.</P>
    <P>The budget also contains other reliefs or grants which, although very specific will, I believe, be very generally welcomed. These include: reduction in VAT on theatre tickets from 23 per cent to 5 per cent; the grants to the GAA, to the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Olympics for the Disabled and the additional £50,000 for other sporting activities; the additional grant for youth activities in deprived areas which, coming on top of the other measures we have taken, the very substantial increase in grants for youth activities last year, and the making permanent of youth development officers, has shown clear evidence of the <Col N="1071" /> strength of our commitment to action in this area; the extra money for the Irish welfare centres in Britain; and the reduced charges for shorter-term passports for people under 18 or over 65.</P>
    <P>Within the limits of resources available, the Government have endeavoured to provide relief or assistance to as many areas as possible where it will prove of wide benefit or where it is clearly badly needed.</P>
    <P>In implementing these provisions, the Government have had to have regard to the need to make continuing progress towards the target of eliminating the current deficit by 1987 and towards reducing the level of borrowing.  As indeed indicated by the Government in advance of the budget, it was our view that the current year was not one in which it would be appropriate to proceed to a reduction of the current deficit by the full amount that would be required if we were to make linear progress towards our 1987 target.  I believe that this judgment is widely shared both by the public in general, by politicians and by economists.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's view that the correct approach to adopt in the current year is to reduce the current budget deficit as a proportion of GNP by three-quarter per cent by comparison with the figure of seven and a quarter per cent in 1983, which, adjusted to allow for the effects of vesting the Post Office, will on the new basis be eight and a quarter per cent.  At the same time the Government were concerned to reduce borrowing by an amount that would fall within the range indicated by the EEC Commission as desirable &mdash; namely, 1-1.5 per cent; the actual reduction is in the middle of that range, 1.25 per cent.</P>
    <P>These two constraints required &mdash; in order to make possible the provisions that I have been outlining in terms of employment creation, benefits to various groups in the community &mdash; some increases in indirect taxation this year. The Government have, however, been concerned to limit the amount of these indirect tax increases.  The very sharp increases in both indirect and direct taxation that has been necessary in the last <Col N="1072" /> couple of years have made it desirable to pursue a policy in the current year which in respect of a number of items &mdash; spirits, beer and petrol and equivalent products &mdash; falls well short of full indexation of excise duties on these commodities. Indeed in the case of spirits it was our judgment that no further imposition should be made this year and we also decided that the increase in the taxes on beer should be kept literally to a minimum. For petrol, the tax increase is only half the amount that would be required if tax were to be indexed in relation to the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The tax yield from these items, together with the new 8 per cent tax on adult clothing, is only a fraction of the amount raised in additional taxation in recent years.  I am sorry Deputy O'Rourke is not here.  I brought in specially to show her &mdash; in view of her concern last night and indeed that of other Deputies who showed their ignorance on the subject &mdash; the labels of clothing sold in Dunnes Stores.  If I may just mention them, there are, for example: age 5 to 6, girl's sweater, 58 to 60 centimetres; age 10 to 11, cardigan, 70 to 74 centimetres; age 9, boy's sweater, 66 centimetres.</P>

      <P>Last night's performance by the Opposition was one of collective ignorance of a most extraordinary kind.  I am glad to have the documentary evidence here but sorry that Deputy O'Rourke is not here for me to show it to her personally.  It means that if we do not actually visit Dunnes Stores together, the labels are here for her whenever she comes in.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the amount of increased taxation this year is no more than one-third of the average of recent years and less, in fact, than in any of the last four years. These additional taxes are balanced by generous welfare provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I and other Ministers made clear in <Col N="1073" /> advance of the budget, it was not possible in the current year to introduce a budget which would have a strongly stimulatory effect on the economy.  However, within the constraints imposed on us, I believe that the budget we have presented combines economic prudence, encouragement to economic activity in a wide variety of different areas, and social equity. I believe that this judgment will be widely shared in the community, where there is now a general widespread recognition of the grave difficulties that face the State and the need to pursue a delicately balanced policy.</P>
    <P>We must, on the one hand, encourage economic recovery and, on the other hand, continue to make progress towards restoring order to our public finances.</P>
    <P>There are of course, bound to be criticisms in details of the budget; it would be odd, and even disturbing, if this were not the case.  But there will, I believe, be a broad consensus recognising its balanced character in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is one danger, however, that one cannot ignore: the danger that in deliberately choosing to introduce a mildly stimulatory budget in present circumstances, public opinion might be misled into under-estimating the financial problems we face.  They still remain to be tackled.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance that all should recognise that, while in the current year, it has been necessary for the sake of the economy to reduce the pace of progress towards the reduction in the current deficit and a reduction of borrowing, this progress has to be resumed in the years ahead.  If we are fortunate, and if the world recovery now tentatively under way is sustained, and spreads to this country, where it will be aided by the general shape of the budget we have introduced, then the task of eliminating the current deficit and reducing borrowing, and of reversing the hitherto apparently irreversible upward trend in the share of taxation eaten up by debt interest and sinking fund payments, will have been rendered lighter, although still difficult. But the difficulties, even under the <Col N="1074" /> circumstances, should not be underestimated.</P>
    <P>If, however, the fears now being widely expressed about the danger of a relapse in the world economy prove justified, and the years 1985 and 1986 are once again years of general worldwide economic stagnation, the carrying forward of the process of eliminating the current deficit and reducing borrowing, and of relieving the burden on taxation of interest and sinking fund payments, will be very painful indeed: no one should be in any doubt about that.</P>
    <P>We are very far indeed from being out of the wood at this stage.  It is necessary to reiterate this and to hammer this message home, lest this budget, designed with great care to meet as precisely as possible the economic needs of the present, immediate, situation, should have the most undesirable effect of misleading people as to the realities we have to face. I would be failing in my duty to the House and to the country if I did not include this warning note in my remarks on the budget.</P>
    <P>The general strategy of the budget responds in many respects to the representations we have been receiving from economic and social interests throughout the country who are concerned, as we are, to generate increased economic activity and employment.  We think it provides a basis on which the community as a whole can unite in optimistic endeavour so that we can emerge again from the shadows which the appalling rate of unemployment in recent years have cast over our economic and social life. Towards this end we shall in the aftermath of this budget be pursuing the discussions which we have initiated with the major economic and social interests in the State.  As well as being delicately balanced to achieve the economic and social objectives appropriate at present, the budget has also helped to stabilise the general situation and I do not think that anybody will doubt that this Government will be introducing further budgets in 1985, 1986 and 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very depressing to listen to the Taoiseach here today.  Yesterday <Col N="1075" /> we tried to see what sort of measures were being taken and what positive proposals were being made, what was the direction of the economy for the coming year and what underlying steps were being taken to guide that direction in the years ahead.  We did not find that yesterday, nor did we hear it from the Taoiseach today.  The one major quality absent from the Taoiseach's speech, apart from the fact that it was a reiteration of yesterday's budget speech, was any indication of leadership.  It also lacks credibility.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is afraid that the public might be misled into believing that the situation will be easier in the near future. I think the public could be misled by not recognising the lack of credibility in the Taoiseach and Government.  The Taoiseach told us early on in his speech about the extra taxes and said they are balanced by the welfare provisions which match the cost of living.  How can the Taoiseach say that the welfare provisions match the cost of living?  He says that inflation will reach 9½ per cent, so how could increases match the cost of living?  In any event, these increases do not come into effect until later in the year.  I will deal with this in more detail later.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also said that the budget will reduce the level of the current deficit. He knows quite well that the current deficit has gone up from £750 million which he later adjusted to £897 million and then said that the target for the end of the year would be £950 million.  In December it became £960 million and we all know that it is now £1,088 million.  Yet he says the budget will reduce the level of the current deficit.  Of course he adds a little piece on to that because when things do not work you change the terms of reference and that is what economic statisticians very often do.  They switch figures around and confuse everybody. That is what the Taoiseach is doing at present although it is in conflict with what his Minister for Finance said in the statement to which I will refer shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said that the increase of over 28,000 unemployed in 1983 only serves to underline the fact that <Col N="1076" /> the most urgent economic and social problem facing us is unemployment. Although it is supposed to be our most urgent problem he says he is not going to do anything about it.  How can someone be credible when he comes before the House and says that the most urgent problem is unemployment &mdash; which it certainly is &mdash; and creating jobs and yet say he will do nothing about it?  How can such a document be credible or give any leadership?  It does not give leadership and that is the sad reality of the Taoiseach's speech here this morning.</P>
    <P>It is also quite clear from the Taoiseach's speech that he is looking backwards and confusing figures because he takes them out of context repeatedly.  I am sure people realise now that he switches from figures to percentages when it suits him.  The Minister for Finance does not know where to look so nobody is looking forward.  The Taoiseach is talking about a rosy position but the Minister for Finance is trying to be realistic although he is totally unimaginative and not prepared to look forward.</P>
    <P>It is very sad for those who are unemployed or who are about to become unemployed.  The Minister for Finance keeps repeating that this is a neutral budget.  The Taoiseach does not agree with him, he does not like to think it is a neutral budget.  There is a conflict between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance because they do not know how to describe the budget.  I would describe it as negative and indecisive and anyone who tries to understand our economy, our potential and our problems must recognise that this is the case.  It will obviously do nothing to stimulate investment and I will come back to that in some detail later.  It is bad for employment but it does not claim to be doing anything to create jobs or to take more unemployed off the register.  In fact it will create more unemployment.  The budget figures show an average of 225,000 unemployed which means that by the end of the year we will have between 240,000 and 250,000 unemployed. This budget is particularly bad for the poor.  I was horrified listening to the Taoiseach talking about the wonderful things they are providing for the poor. <Col N="1077" /> I wish he would face the realities in the outside world.  This budget offers no hope for 1984 and it does not even lay the foundation for future years.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that he has gone the wrong way.  He has lost an opportunity to lay a firm foundation for the future.  We must ask ourselves why should someone who has worked as an economist be so indecisive.  I know there is a difference between being an economist and a practical manager, but why is he so indecisive at this time?  He has opted out of management.  He has cut the capital budget for the second year in a row, increased Government spending and showed no imagination.  In my view the real reason for his indecisiveness was that the Government could not decide what to do.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Cluskey left the Government he said the Estimates were one thing, that he felt he had not done too badly in that area&mdash;he had not done too badly because Government spending had been increased &mdash; but the budget was something else.  This is where the problems arose because the Coalition partners could not decide on an imaginative programme for the creation of jobs for the future.  We heard of the many hours and days the Government partners spent trying to come up with solutions, but they came up with this indecisive, unimaginative budget.  This is not realistic or logical and if it is not logical there must be a reason, and in this case the reason was a conflict between the Government parties. Now we have a ship bobbing around the oceans not knowing which way to go. If I were on that ship, I, like Deputy Cluskey, would get off and travel on the nearest trawler or even in a canoe.  He knew what was going to happen.  In his statement the Minister said a new deal was to be worked out for the exploration of oil and the development of resources. These were obviously the two elements which influenced Deputy Cluskey to get off the ship and, in my view, he got out of the Coalition just in time.</P>
    <P>There is a major inconsistency in what the Minister said.  He said that taxation cannot be reduced &ldquo;until current expenditure is reduced and the current budget <Col N="1078" /> deficit eliminated&rdquo;.  He made it clear that taxation cannot be reduced until these steps are taken, yet he accepts a situation where the current budget deficit is increasing.  If he had said that the current budget deficit must be a certain percentage of GNP, that would be a different story but he did not say that.  He said he cannot do anything to give the poor, downtrodden PAYE taxpayer the incentive to work and to have a reasonable take home pay until the budget deficit is eliminated.  The Minister clearly indicated that nothing will be done for the taxpayer and as far as the PAYE taxpayer in particular is concerned this Government will do nothing to give him the relief he needs so badly.</P>
    <P>That fits in with a great deal of what has been said about social welfare.  The way to tackle the situation as far as the lower paid worker is concerned is to give him more take home pay and not make it more attractive for a person to stay on social welfare.  Let us hear from all those economists who agreed with the Minister when he said that the budget deficit must be eliminated.  Over the last 18 months they have spoken about the importance of this step on numerous occasions, but I hope they will identify the realities as spelled out by the Minister and will recognise that this Government are at sea and do not know where to go.  This will become clearer as time goes on.</P>
    <P>The increases in income tax amount to 20 per cent.  While there are some benefits, obviously more is being taken that is being given.  From the figures provided it can be seen that the Minister will receive an increase of more than 20 per cent from the hard-pressed income tax sector, of which the PAYE sector are paying 85 per cent.  Nothing is being done in this budget to alleviate that position.  The temporary income levy is still with us and this had a very seious effect on incomes because it was taken from gross income.  While there are some benefits in terms of the tax bands, they are only an attempt at catching up &mdash; the overall effect is to take a whopping 20 per cent increase in income tax.  If we compare taxation figures for other countries with ours we will see that 40 per cent of our population are <Col N="1079" /> taxed at over 35 per cent, while in the United Kingdom it is only 5 per cent and in the United States 12 per cent.  The Minister has made it quite clear that he does not intend to do anything substantial about this problem in this budget.</P>
    <P>We are all supposed to forget about the PAYE tax allowance, which was a special allowance of £600 given and increased by Fianna Fáil to all PAYE workers, and left at that level for the second year by the Coalition.  Nothing will be said about this and employees may even forget it exists, but it was brought in as an equity measure for the PAYE taxpayer.  It is quite clear that a married man with an income of £6,000 a year will save only £45 a year from these tax benefits. A married man with £20,000 a year saves £195 and a married man with £25,000 saves £255 per year.  If he gets an increase in his income he will pay more tax, and probably end up worse off at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I am most concerned about the social welfare area.  In this budget we have seen the lowest increase in social welfare since the Coalition budget of April 1977 which gave a 5 per cent increase.  Members of the Labour Party have to recognise the fact that again they have participated in providing the lowest rate of increase for social welfare beneficiaries since 1977. This 7 per cent is given from 1 July. Needless to say, the increases in VAT and other costs come into operation from 1 May.  Therefore the figure is probably 5 per cent or 5½ per cent for 1984 as an increase for old age pensioners.  That is very close to the Coalition 5 per cent in 1977.  The old age pensioners are back to Coalition times.  They know that.  I meet them quite often and they could smell it coming.  It can now be seen as a reality.</P>
    <P>A masterful public relations job is being done in relation to the poor.  I do not blame the media people because they have deadlines to meet.  They are fed information a short time before they have to meet the deadlines.  It is important to recognise what is being done, and I am very concerned about it.  An old age pensioner needs an increase to stay where he or she is.  People who should know better <Col N="1080" /> say to me: &ldquo;They did not do too badly in the past two years.  Those paying all the taxes and others on lower incomes are much worse off&rdquo;.  What is forgotten is the base for the old age pension.  It is very low.  An old age non-contributory pensioner is getting an increase of £2.70 a week from 1 July.  That will bring that pensioner to £41.30 a week.  This is where real poverty occurs.</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach said people are doing very well in percentage terms.  They are not doing well in percentage terms.  When you look at the reality of cash in the hand, how would you live on £41.30 a week?  The pension of a contributory old age pensioner is going up to £48.25 a week.  A non-contributory widow gets an increase of £2.65 bringing her to £40.50 a week.  She will have to meet all the extra costs for clothing and everything else.  The tax on clothing will have a much bigger impact on families than the Taoiseach realises. These beneficiaries are not codding anybody. They are on long-term benefit. They have been done down for the second year.  They have done much worse this year, and this will hit them very hard. Their real incomes are being reduced systematically.</P>
    <P>We stand over our record in this House and our record will stand for a long time. For three years in succession we increased the pensions of old age pensioners and widows by 25 per cent.  That sounds like a lot, but we must remember the base level.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance keeps switching the figures from the percentages to whatever happens to suit them at the time.  It is our job to point out the realities.  In their media campaign they talk about the percentages. They even have workers and middle income people and higher income people believing that social welfare beneficiaries have done too well and that the three 25 per cent, which brought them up from abject poverty, were too much, and that we can hold back and do nothing.</P>
    <P>That was echoed in the Taoiseach's speech this morning.  He kept talking about how well everyone has done over the past three years, and suggested that <Col N="1081" /> it is time to take it easy.  He said that in Europe they have not done as well, but he did not say what the base is in Europe. What absolute misrepresentation of the figures and the facts.  That is a scandalous misrepresentation by the Taoiseach of the position of the elderly and the poor. That is not responsible Government, or responsible management.  It is not a responsible speech in this House by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It is blatantly misleading to switch the figures around.  This is being done in every area by the Government.  They get away with it.  Outside this House who will say what the Taoiseach is doing to the poor and the elderly?  In this House we have absolute democracy.  Deputies from the hills or the lowlands, no matter what their status in life, who represent the people can come in here and say what has to be said.  Who will print it?  That is the question.  What is happening to our democracy at that end?  That is a very serious question and, in time, we may all be asked to answer it.</P>
    <P>That is the reality.  We saw a classic example of it here this morning on several fronts.  On no front was it worse than on the social welfare front.  The reality is that the base for the recipients is too low and must be put right.  Of course hard things have to be done to find the abusers and the wasters.  Nobody did more about that than we did and, in fairness to the Government, they continued that work which had to be done.  We accept that. Those people do not include widows or old age pensioners whose status is quite clear.</P>
    <P>When we talk about unemployment assistance a new reality is dawning throughout the country.  I know this because it pays to go out among one's constituents and see what is happening. I was at a meeting of unemployed people recently.  Of course there were people who wanted to rabblerouse and kick up a row in any way they could.  There were also genuine constructive people who were prepared to tell you their problems. One person said to me that there are two realities for the long-term unemployed. One is that they have no hope of getting employment under this Government. <Col N="1082" /> The second is that they have been so long on such low levels of income that they are now getting into deep poverty.  All the signs are there.</P>
    <P>A very significant and striking thing was said to me.  It is very hard to convey the reality.  One person said to me that what struck him was the smell of poverty in the community.  I did not invent that. That is what he said.  He was a genuine person.  The Government must recognise what is happening on the ground.  By holding down social welfare recipients on such low levels of income for so long an environment of poverty is developing within this city and in other parts of the country.  A person on long-term unemployment assistance is in great need of something extra and the Government have decided that he is to get an increase of £2 from 1 July, bringing the amount to £30.90 per week.  A married person is to get an increase of £3.45, bringing the amount to £53.20.  From that sum they must maintain a home and pay all the outgoings.  The Minister for Finance has given an extra 1 per cent allowance from 1 July to these long-term unemployed.  It works out at slightly under 30 pence per week.  This is an insult.  How can the Government say that 30 pence per week will do anything for these people?  It is difficult to understand the thinking behind it.  When I heard the Minister say that something was to be done for these people I welcomed it, thinking that the Minister had taken account of the representations made by me and by others. Something more worthwhile should have been done for these people.</P>
    <P>The Government are talking about transferring £70 million to social welfare recipients.  In 1982 when we were in office there was a £150 million hard cash transfer to social welfare groups.  The Labour Party are forever preaching about the size of transfers of money to the underprivileged. In current terms £210 million would be needed to match the 1982 transfer of £150 million but the transfer announced by the Government is only about one-third of that amount.  That is the reality of the harshness of this budget for the social welfare classes.</P>
    <P>There was no increase last year in children's <Col N="1083" /> allowances and the Taoiseach has talked about the increases given over a number of years while Fianna Fáil were in office.  Now he offers a derisory 7 per cent increase from 1 August.  The allowance of £11.25 per child per month will be increased to £12.05.  This represents an increase of 80 pence per month or 20 pence per week, which would not even buy a pair of socks with or without VAT. It is no wonder that families regard this increase as derisory.  We know that our rates of children's allowance are low by international standards and that is one of the reasons they were increased while we were in office.</P>
    <P>VAT on clothing will cause a great deal of difficulty and expense for families, expecially those in the middle and lower income groups.  The Taoiseach says that imports will bear the brunt of this 8 per cent imposition but this is not so.  It will be paid by consumers, basically families. The difficulty of defining the point at which VAT will become payable has already been pointed out.  The Minister for Finance has said that it will depend on the size of the garment.  Obviously there will be considerable difficulties. Confirmation ceremonies now take place at the age of 12 and it costs about £100 to fit out a child.  Should the age of Confirmation be reduced to ten?  Is this a Confirmation tax?  Is that what the Taoiseach had in mind?</P>
    <P>All children moving from junior school will be affected because uniforms will have to be bought.  Some schools use simple uniforms which are fairly cheaply available but they will still cost about £100.  Other schools use more expensive uniforms which can cost up to £200.  This will be a major extra expense for families and I notice that the imposition is to take effect from 1 May, well in time for the new school year in the autumn.  The Government are looking for every possible means to obtain money from low income families.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talked about a visit to Dunnes Stores.  I do not know if he realises the age groups in which they specialise. It can cost between £200 and £300 per annum to outfit a teenage girl and not <Col N="1084" /> much less for a teenage boy.  Somebody who has not had the experience of teenage children might not recognise the growth in the volume of expenditure in this area.  Some people would spend a great deal more than the amounts I have mentioned.  It would appear that a family with three teenage children will pay an extra £75 in VAT.</P>

      <P>VAT on clothing will have a devastating effect on families expecially those with teenage children.  At Confirmation time it will really be a Confirmation tax.  It is a going back to school tax for those going on to second level.  It will hit families very badly.  Has it been done without any reference to people?  Is it that the Government who have set such a dismal scene generally want a dismal people to go along with it?</P>
      <P>If there is one thing that could be said about the Taoiseach's speech this morning and the Minister's speech yesterday it is that they were colourless and unimaginative. We are forcing teenagers and young people to be colourless through the taxes which the House was asked to put on these garments.  Perhaps the Taoiseach wants us to wear odd socks and one armed suits to reduce costs.  There might be many of us going around like Bottler with our trousers at half mast trying to claim they fit us and it is all a question of size.  Perhaps we should follow Bottler's example at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government could have been selective in the way they applied the tax. It could have been applied to more expensive items.  The bulk to purchases are made by the middle income and lower income families.  It will deal a death blow to the textile industry, particularly in the mens area.  That is the view of people involved in the industry.  It is an industry where there has been a lot of unemployment. It needs assistance and stimulation rather than being hit hard.  There will be hardship for the low income group and the long term unemployed.  The heaviest demand for clothing is in the 17 to 25 year age group.  The heaviest demand also comes from working class people.  The factories which produce clothes teenagers go for are usually small factories. <Col N="1086" /> They will suffer most and not the big mass produced lines the Taoiseach mentioned when he spoke about Dunnes Stores.  The small specialised factories produce more colourful garments which those in the 17 to 25 year age group buy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance mentioned medical cards for the elderly and the improvement he was offering in this area of £5 for an elderly person on the income guidelines.  The income guideline for a single person is £59.  This will be increased to £64, which is a marginal increase.  Any increase is welcome.  We gave medical cards across the board to those on social welfare benefits.  There was a need to remove people on high incomes from that but there was also plenty of scope to substantially increase the basic guidelines.  However, the increase is of a minor nature and will have a marginal effect on the number of people covered.  Speaking of medical cards, what the Minister did not say was that at the same time as making this very small gesture he was removing from students of 16 years and over eligibility for medical cards in their own right.  This is a matter we will be taking up with the Government because we believe the measure is inequitable and very harsh particularly in cases where children have asthma.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the budget and the Taoiseach's speech is that nothing was done to promote jobs. The Taoiseach said this was the most important and urgent economic and social objective at present.  If we look at the strategy which the Minister for Finance adopted in opening his speech, where he said that consumption has declined, investment fallen, unemployment risen and growth has been stifled, it contrasts startingly with what the Taoiseach said.  That was an unusual admission by a Minister for Finance in the House.  However, as Deputy O'Kennedy said, at least the Minister was honest. The Taoiseach was not honest when he gave details of the present position.  He tried to paint a rosy picture looking back over two years and he did not look forward. I wonder what type of statement the Minister will make next year having <Col N="1087" /> regard to the proposals in the budget. Will the out-turn next year mean that we will have greater unemployment, depression and stifling of investment?</P>
    <P>The Government are budgeting for more unemployment and it is likely that next year we will have a similar frank admission by the Minister for Finance of total failure to handle the Government's principal objectives.  We are all aware that the country exists on its productive ability and this is maintained by capital expenditure.  Through that capital expenditure we are able to maintain and improve the base of our economy and our ability to produce.  During a time of recession it is important that we should expand on the capital side and in productive areas.  That must be done to maintain confidence and prepare the ground for economic recovery.  There is no evidence of that in the Minister's budget speech or in the Taoiseach's contribution this morning.</P>
    <P>When preparing the ground for economic recovery we should invest in infrastructure so as to make the recovery smoother once it gets under way.  We should provide short-term employment on many projects.  For example, road works schemes can be introduced.  We made major investments in our road network but that is being downgraded.  We can also assist new projects, and modernise older ones to contribute to our earning capacity through increased exports. That can be done, for example, when fighting against factory closures or strongly supporting Fóir Teoranta and the IDA and permitting them to be imaginative in their approach.  We can provide them with the resources, and the direction, to take more risks where they can be taken in productive areas.  It is no excuse to say that capital expenditure should be cut pending an examination of projects where the machinery is already in hand to do so.  Such projects can be examined quickly.</P>
    <P>The Government are indulging in yet another review and being indecisive.  The capital for new projects should be made available now and the feasibility study of each new project should be ongoing <Col N="1088" /> through the agencies set up for this purpose. On that basis we should not be cutting back on the allocation for the IDA as the Government are doing.  One of the clearest indicators of difficulty is when the Government tell us that they have vacant factory space and are, consequently, cutting back on the allocation to the IDA.  In a time of great recession, horrendous unemployment and a dismal lack of confidence the Government have set before us a programme designed to contract rather than expand the wealth producing base, particularly in agriculture and industry.  There is no doubt that we must hold back in our effort to get many of the social things we want until times improve but we should be investing in agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>If we look at the sectoral economic investment plans in regard to agriculture and industry we will see that in 1983 £85 million was provided for agriculture while industry got £322 million.  Allowing 10 per cent for inflation the proper figure increases by a further £41 million.  A proper budget would have brought the total for those areas to £448 million, allowing £94 million for agriculture and £354 million for industry but the Minister for Finance only increased that figure to £394 million, £77 million for agriculture and £317 for industry.  That leaves an overall shortfall of £54 million, which indicates a lack of confidence and preparedness on the part of the Government to invest in those areas.</P>
    <P>One would have expected the Minister for Finance, as a result of his previous experience with the agricultural industry, to have appreciated the problems in that area but it is possible that, because of his position in the Coalition and not being able to go one way or another, he is not able to produce plans to get things moving and deal with unemployment.  I would have thought that he would have appreciated that by creating an environment that would encourage investment in agriculture he would bring about extra production. There are various options open to the Minister to do this but he has stepped away from them.  An allowance for depreciation on farm buildings was suggested as a method of encouraging <Col N="1089" /> investment in that sector.  That would be an important move to help job creation. We are aware that such major and long-established concerns as Keenans of Bagnalstown and Kellys of Portlaoise went out of business recently.  The closure of those concerns indicates to us how much they depend on the Government's approach to agriculture and how they encourage investment in that industry.  If the Government do not encourage such investment business for such firms declines.  If agriculture was working on a basis comparable to industry it would be possible to encourage development in that sector.  For example, livestock housing is inadequate and approximately 50 per cent of our livestock is out-wintered still.  There is considerable scope in that area for improvement.  If we increased production in that area we would be dealing with farm buildings, exports, and meat factories.  That would lead to the creation of many jobs.  The Government do not appear to be interested in creating jobs in that area.</P>
    <P>If there was encouragement of investment in mechanisation and farm machinery many jobs would be created.  An increase in livestock numbers would also help but there is nothing in the budget to encourage farmers to do that.  We need improvements in the production areas to create employment.  The Minister could have chosen many options but he has stayed away from them.  It is hard to understand the Minister's approach in view of the fact that he was an agricultural economist.  It appears that the Government are not prepared to tackle the unemployment problem.  The agricultural industry is useful during a depression because it remains stable.  There is a degree of stability in country areas that does not exist in our major cities such as Dublin, and that is due to the position of agriculture.  The import content of our agricultural industry is about 12 per cent overall compared to 40 per cent to 70 per cent for industry.</P>
    <P>In agriculture there are approximately 214,000 people directly employed at farm level, while associated industries employ 56,000 people or 26 per cent of the total in manufacturing industry.  That means <Col N="1090" /> that a total of 270,000 are in employment arising out of agriculture.  It is obvious from those figures that if the Government give encouragement, jobs can be created in agriculture and its ancillary industries. That should be part of the Government's programme.  The budget is silent in regard to it.</P>
    <P>If we look at the proposed expenditure on roads and on the building and construction industry, we do not see any incentive, particularly in the construction industry, to encourage private investment in any substantial way.  The building and construction industry has been a great employer.  Indeed it and agriculture are the two great employers, and then manufacturing, which is giving a reasonably good return at the moment because it availed of IDA help in the past few years.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not provided additional funds for the Department of Justice.  It is clear from the Estimates that various sectors of the Department have been cut back severely. Given the high level of crime and lawlessness, the Department of Justice should have been given high priority but the provision for Garda travel has been cut by 3 per cent, Garda transport has been cut by 21 per cent from last year and there will be major deficiencies in Garda pay and overtime, as has been highlighted recently.  The provision for radio and equipment is minus 69 per cent &mdash; the amount of £1.6 million is substantially below the figure at the beginning of 1983, which was £2.4 million.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need in the Department of Justice for additional resources and I was extremely disappointed, therefore, to hear the Minister for Justice say last week that he will not go ahead with the purchase of helicopters for the aerial wing, though the Minister for Finance has told us he will go ahead with the sea rescue unit.  All this is very disappointing, indicating that the Government are prepared to put the crime and subversion operation at risk so that the Minister for Finance may be pleased.  There is no excuse for cutting back in such an important area as security.  We will be pursuing <Col N="1091" /> this matter further so that funds may be made available in this important area.</P>
    <P>This budget is a no-win one: we are all losing.  It is a depressing, dismal budget for those involved in investment generally. As Deputy Haughey has said, it is having a depressing effect already.  The Government have opted out, probably because of the difficulties they are having, as was indicated to us before Christmas, particularly by the departure of Deputy Cluskey.  There are indications that things are unhappy and bad in the Government and it is very likely that this will continue to be the position.  If we do not face up to the problems now they will only get worse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the year's budget provisions I should like to refer to the achievements in social welfare during the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>Last year was a very difficult one but I am glad to be able to say to the House that despite the many difficulties overall progress in the social welfare area was maintained.  In 1983 a budget increase of 12 per cent was granted in the rates of payments to pensioners and those receiving allowances of a similar nature, and there was an increase of 10 per cent at the same time in the rates of short-term payments.  These increases were paid from the end of June 1983 and fulfilled the Government's commitment to social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my comments on the main Social Welfare Estimate in the House in May 1983 I expressed concern at the plight of the increasing numbers of those unfortunate enough to be unemployed for a long time.  They must depend on unemployment assistance, and I was particularly concerned to improve their very low incomes.  I was glad, therefore, to be able to provide a further increase of five per cent from the beginning of October last for those on unemployment assistance who had been unemployed for 15 months or more.  This was in addition to the increase which had been given in June, and benefited about 75,000 recipients <Col N="1092" /> in 1983 at a cost of £2.3 million.  I also provided for a double week bonus payment at Christmas which was paid to pensioners and other recipients of similar allowances.  The cost of this double payment was £18.13 million and about 404,000 benefited from the provision.</P>
    <P>The Government after taking up office provided an additional £31 million in the Estimates for unemployment payments in 1983.  Later, however, I had to provide a further £20 million in the Supplementary Estimate which was approved by the House last December to meet the cost of additional unemployment benefit and the associated pay-related benefit.  This is a reflection of the continuing rise in the numbers of persons who are unemployed. I should like to point out that in 1983 overall expenditure on unemployment payments alone amounted to some £454 million, as compared with £345 million in 1982.  Payments to smallholders amounting to more than £34 million in 1982 and more than £36 million in 1983 have not been included in these figures.</P>
    <P>But we are not talking about unemployment payments only.  When we mention expenditure on social welfare we are talking about the largest public expenditure programme we have.  In 1983 total expenditure on social welfare amounted to some £1,907 million, and the Estimate provision for 1984 amounted to some £2,088 million at current rates of payment. This provision does not take account of the increases provided in the current budget.  These figures show the scale of social welfare expenditure which now amounts to more than 14 per cent GNP.  These facts show the continuing commitment of the Government to the social welfare structure.</P>
    <P>The published Estimates for 1984 show that the Exchequer cost of supporting the social welfare programme will be somewhat in excess of £1,185 million, not including the budget improvements.  The balance of more than £900 million will be borne almost entirely by the contributions of employers and employees, employers contributing approximately £600 million and employees £280 million through PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>The increase of £181 million approximately <Col N="1093" /> in social welfare expenditure in the 1984 Estimate as compared with 1983 is attributable to the extra cost for a full year in 1984 of the 1983 budget increases and of the 5 per cent increase from October 1983 to those who have been unemployed for more than 15 months.  Also there is the increasing trend in the number of beneficiaries particularly those who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>In the 1984 Estimate allowance is made for an increase of more than 30,000 on average in the live register.  Such an increase has a major effect on the cost of the social welfare services.  It affects not only the cost of payments to the unemployed but the income from PRSI contributions to the Social Insurance Fund. Payments to the unemployed by way of unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and unemployment assistance in 1984 are expected to be £105 million more than in 1983.  Every additional 1,000 persons on the live register will cost £2.4 million extra per year in benefit and assistance payments.  I very much regret that there has been some exaggerated comment about cut-backs in social welfare. In 1984 the cost of unemployment payments is expected to reach £559 million at 1983 rates of payment, as against £454 million in 1983.  This is made up of £325 million for unemployment benefit, including pay-related benefit, and £234 million for unemployment assistance. Moreover, it does not include the cost of payment to smallholders of over £35 million.</P>
    <P>When account is taken of the budget increases, the cost of unemployment payments in 1984, excluding the smallholders, will be the quite staggering sum of £579 million.  I stress that point.  I recently attended a meeting in Athens of Ministers of Social Security and in every single one of the nine countries not only have they not increased any social welfare payments they have reduced them.  Index linking is practically abolished, pensions cut by 8 and 9 per cent and employer and worker contributions up by anything up to 15 per cent.  We have not done that. When one goes to France, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, the UK or any of the <Col N="1094" /> nine, that situation appertains at this time so severe has been the recession and so severe has been the impact on the Exchequer of maintaining basic levels of unemployment payment.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the unemployment situation which is often lost sight of is the fact the it generates considerable extra work in the Department of Social Welfare. The work involved in processing claims and paying the increasing numbers joining the live register is only part of the problem.  In addition, it is necessary to determine the entitlements of claimants, who because of the duration of their unemployment, are obliged to transfer from benefit to assistance and whose means must be assessed.  The extra number of staff required to process the increased numbers of claims and pay the claimants is putting tremendous pressure on existing resources both in terms of staff and physical accommodation.  A programme of modernisation to overcome these problems by the use of modern computer technology is being devised and this will in time lead to a more effective and efficient service for the unemployed and I would also hope to considerable improvements in the working conditions for the staff of the Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increase in the numbers of unemployed, the numbers in receipt of most of the other social welfare services are constantly increasing.  Five years ago the total number of weekly recipients excluding the unemployed was 422,000 whereas the corresponding number in 1984 is expected to be about 464,000.  I am very conscious of the fact that this constant increase in numbers and consequential increase in expenditure impose an extra burden on contributors and taxpayers generally.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Social Insurance Fund.  The estimated income of the Social Insurance Fund from PRSI contributions in 1984 is £853 million.  This takes account of increased earnings in 1984 as well as the loss of jobs arising from the continuing upward trend in unemployment.  The figure of £853 million for 1984 is an increase of £91 million over the expected <Col N="1095" /> outturn of £762 million for 1983.  This increase is mainly due to the general rise in earnings levels in 1984 and to the impact of the ceiling of £13,000 for all of 1984 as against three-quarters of 1983, allowance being made for a drop in the numbers employed.  The Exchequer contribution to the Fund in 1984 was estimated for the purpose of the 1984 Estimates to be £306.6 million or about 26.4 per cent of the total fund.  This contribution will of course be increased following the implementation of the current budget increases.</P>
    <P>There are, however, difficulties in estimating income from contributions and these were highlighted in 1983 when the expected outturn of £762 million was £35.5 million less than the original estimate of £797.5 million.  There are many factors which affect contribution income among them and the amount and timing of pay increases, the level of unemployment and the degree of compliance by employers in paying over the contributions. Having regard to the large amount raised by PRSI contributions a variation in any one of factors mentioned can have a significant impact on the total collection. A shortfall in income, such as occurred in 1983, has the effect of increasing the Exchequer subvention to the Social Insurance Fund and, in consequence, the burden on the employers.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Adjournment Debate last December I referred to some changes which would be made in 1984 in existing schemes.  They are relatively minor and occur in the schemes of pay-related benefit and maternity allowances. They will come into operation from next April and are designed to keep those schemes in line with movements in pay. I wish to give some of the details for the information of the House.</P>
    <P>Regarding pay-related benefit the floor taken into account in determining the amount of pay-related benefit a person is entitled to is at present £36.  The original floor which was set in 1974 was £14 and it remained at the figure until 1981.  Since then it has been regularly increased.  If the same basis was now used as applied when the figure of £14 was decided in <Col N="1096" /> 1974 the floor would be £87.  I do not propose to introduce such a drastic increase but, in continuation of the recent policy of successive Governments to bring the floor more into line with current levels, I have decided to increase it by £7 to £43 from next April.  It will apply to all new pay-related benefit claims which arise after 5 April next.  The saving in 1984 will be £2.8 million.  This saving is minimal when considered in the context of the 1983 expenditure of £48.7 million for pay-related unemployment benefit and a 1984 provision of £62.3 million.  It is in this overall context that one must consider this relatively minor adjustment for new claimants.</P>
    <P>In determining the maximum amount a person may receive by way of disability benefit and pay-related benefit a wage stop is applied.  At present, this operates to limit the aggregate amount of disability and pay-related benefit to 80 per cent of a person's reckonable earnings in the relevant tax year.  In order to bring a more equitable relationship between take-home pay and income while in receipt of benefit I am reducing the 80 per cent wage stop to 75 per cent.  This will also apply from April next and will save £380,000 in 1984.  I want to make it clear that only the amount of pay-related benefit a person on disability benefit receives will be affected by this measure.  His flat-rate disability benefit will remain unchanged.  In 1983 some £20.5 million was paid out in pay-related benefit with disability benefit.</P>
    <P>As part of the Second National Understanding for Economic and Social Development it was agreed that a maternity allowance scheme for women in employment would be introduced.  The scheme was brought into operation in April 1981 and the details were worked out with representatives of employers and employees.  The purpose of the scheme was to ensure that women would be fully compensated for loss of earnings after all deductions.  The formula devised at that time, taking account of tax and other deductions, allowed for payment of an allowance amounting to 80 per cent of reckonable weekly earnings.  It is now evident that, because of changes which <Col N="1097" /> have occurred in the meantime in tax and other deductions, the original formula can provide levels of benefit which are very much higher than was intended.</P>
    <P>I am, accordingly, taking steps to deal with the anomaly by reducing the maximum to 70 per cent of reckonable earnings from April.  As a consequence of that change the minimum payment of £64.88 will remain at that figure for 1984.  These changes will result in a reduction in expenditure of some £1.13 million in 1984.  I would like to stress, however, that women benefiting under the scheme will still receive the equivalent of their normal net take-home pay.</P>
    <P>Regarding the 1984 budget increases the rates were stated yesterday.  The weekly rates payable to all pensioners and recipients of similar allowances, including health allowances, will be increased by 7 per cent from 5 July 1984. The weekly rates payable to those receiving short-term benefits, such as sickness and unemployment, will also be increased by 7 per cent during the first week of July.  These increases will not, however, apply to smallholders whose means for unemployment assistance purposes are still assessed on a notional basis.  They will, of course, apply to all those whose means have been assessed on a factual basis.</P>
    <P>I have expressed on a number of occasions my concern for the plight of those persons who have been unemployed for a long time.  Unemployment is a shattering experience at any time but in present circumstances of increasing duration of unemployment and the extent to which those who become unemployed remain on unemployment benefit for a limited period and then transfer to unemployment assistance, their long-term source of income is diminished severely.  In the early stages of unemployment the blow is to some extent cushioned by the more liberal compensation rates of unemployment benefit combined with pay-related benefit.  After 15 months a person's entitlement to benefit itself ceases and then he must rely wholly on unemployment assistance.  Therefore the differential is being introduced of 8 per cent for those <Col N="1098" /> unemployed for 15 months or more.  Over 75 per cent of all unemployment assistance recipients, including smallholders whose means have been factually assessed, will benefit from this increase.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of comment in recent times about the scheme of children's allowances and many commentators predicted confidently that in this year's budget these payments would be taxed.  This is not being done.  On the contrary, these allowances are being increased by 7 per cent from next August. The extra cost of all these improvements in rates of social welfare payment is estimated to be £67.6 million in 1984 and £139 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach outlined this morning the family income supplement is being introduced from the beginning of November 1984.  The cost will be about £13 million in a full year.  I will announce details of the scheme later this year, and it will require new legislation.</P>
    <P>On equal treatment, the provisions of the EEC Directive on equality of treatment for men and women in matters of social security are due to be fully implemented before the end of this year.  The matters still outstanding affect mainly the entitlements of married women.  These include payment of the standard rate of social insurance benefits to married women, provision of unemployment benefit to married women for the same maximum duration as beneficiaries generally, revision of the conditions governing payment of dependency allowances for spouses and children and giving married women entitlement to unemployment assistance on the same basis as married men.  These matters will require legislation for their implementation and the dependency provisions in particular are quite complicated.  It is my intention that appropriate legislative provision will be made to deal with the outstanding problems later this year.  I intend to have the provisions of the directive fully implemented and in operation by December of this year.</P>
    <P>Regarding the free travel scheme, free travel is generally restricted to off-peak periods.  However, certain categories of disabled persons who attend, full-time, <Col N="1099" /> long-term rehabilitation courses have an entitlement to travel during peak-hours in order to enable them to attend the courses.  I am now extending that concession of free travel during peak hours, for the purpose of attending such rehabilitation courses, to all blind persons, social welfare invalidity pensioners and recipients of British and Northern Ireland invalidity pension or benefit.  This is a facility which those concerned will, I am sure, appreciate very much and is overdue as an amendment.</P>
    <P>The free telephone rental scheme was introduced for the purpose of helping, with the cost of a telephone, social welfare pensioners living alone.  The intention was that a person living alone would by means of the telephone be able to summon help in the event of an emergency. In meeting the living alone condition disabled persons living with the pensioner were disregarded.  Cases have come to the notice of my Department and myself where a pensioner who would otherwise be qualified has had his application disallowed because of the presence of a young child in the house.  I am amending the scheme to deal with this anomaly so that in future the presence of a child under the age of 15 will not disqualify a person otherwise qualified from receiving the free telephone rental allowance.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of pay-related social insurance, notwithstanding the increases in the rates of social insurance benefits there will be no increase this year in the rates of pay-related contributions to the Social Insurance Fund.  There will be no change either in the earnings ceiling of £13,000 for the purposes of social insurance contributions or in the ceiling of £11,000 for pay-related benefit purposes. There will be a minor change in the rate of contribution to the occupational injuries fund.  This contribution is payable by employers only and will be increased by 0.1 per cent from April 1984 to enable the fund to meet the expenditure on occupational injuries benefits.</P>
    <P>The fact that the provisions relating to social insurance contributions remain unchanged does not mean that the Social <Col N="1100" /> Insurance Fund remains in a static condition. As I mentioned earlier, the fund is dependent on a variety of factors.  The chief among these is the level of economic activity which determines the level of employment and in consequence the level of contributions by employers and employees to the fund.  A further important factor is wage increases.  Whatever the outcome, it is the responsibility of the Exchequer to make good whatever shortfall remains after taking account of the contributions of employers and employees. Therefore, in 1984, taking account of the budget provisions the Exchequer's contribution to the Social Insurance Fund will be of the order of £342.8 million or 28.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Regarding voluntary organisations last year £0.5 million was allocated to my Department towards the work of suitable voluntary bodies in the social services area.  This money was fully allocated last year and I am satisfied that the exercise is worth repeating.  A further £0.5 million, therefore, has been allocated to my Department for similar purposes this year.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare were set up in August last year and they have been pursuing their work steadily in the meantime.  I am optimistic that much goodwill comes from the activities of the commission and that their recommendations will have a profound bearing on the structure of our social welfare system in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of the Programme for Government was the reestablishment of the structure of the Combat Poverty Organisation.  The initial steps towards this end have already been taken and I hope to be in a position to submit proposals in the matter to the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system is one with a very substantial framework of schemes and services.  The extent of this framework may not be generally appreciated. About 700,000 payments are made by or on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare each week.  When account is taken of dependents the total number who benefit amounts to some 1.3 million people.  On top of that some 476,000 families <Col N="1101" /> receive children's allowances each month.  This is a huge volume of activity and affects a substantial proportion of the population.</P>
    <P>An indication of the financial progression of the costs of social welfare services in recent years will be seen from the following particulars of overall social welfare expenditure: 1981, £1,192 million; 1982, £1,629 million; 1983, £1,907 million; 1984, £2,156 million (including budget provisions).  These figures are an indication of the extent of the commitment of this Government and of the Department of Social Welfare to the needs of the citizens of this State.  That commitment cannot be ignored or denied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the problems being created nationally in both urban and rural areas by litter and refuse; if, in view of the anti-litter laws now operating in the country and of the fact that the Government have introduced charges for refuse collection throughout the country, he will introduce a national scheme to ensure that there are ample locations throughout the country for the disposal of all types of refuse in both urban and rural areas; and if he will make a statement on the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have a wide range of powers and obligations in relation to control of litter and waste disposal.  The Litter Act, 1982, enables local authorities to make effective arrangements for the control of litter with a view to improving the quality of the physical environment in both urban and rural areas.  Under the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979, they are responsible for the planning, authorisation and supervision of <Col N="1102" /> waste operations and must prepare waste disposal plans identifying the quantities and types of waste arising in their functional areas.  These plans must include an assessment of the adequacy of existing collection and disposal facilities, provide for suitable disposal sites and for any special arrangements needed for particular wastes.  Detailed advice on the selection, design and management of tipsites has been issued to local authorities by my Department.</P>
      <P>The general strategy for dealing with waste includes the establishment of a central waste facility to handle limited quantities and types of waste, which will initially be bulked up and exported, for which environmentally acceptable alternative means of disposal are not available in this country.  It also includes the development by local authorities of a network of co-disposal sites at which industrial waste can be safely disposed of to landfill in conjunction with other ordinary waste, and the upgrading by local authorities of their existing tipheads to more acceptable environmental standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the disposal of both industrial and domestic waste is a major problem throughout the country and also that local authorities who are under pressure from environmentalists and so on have great difficulty in finding suitable sites for dumping?  Would the Minister agree also that because of the shortage of funds in all local authorities, they do not have the resources to provide proper facilities for the disposal of waste?  In these circumstances is the Minister in a position to give a commitment that a major effort will be made to ensure that proper facilities for the dumping of waste will be made available so that we may avoid a disease hazard or any other kind of hazard in this regard?  The problem is one that is affecting tourism and which is ruining the appearance of the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there are problems in this matter but to centralise the whole situation would not be to minimise it.  It would not mean that sites <Col N="1103" /> would be easier to find.  The opposite would probably be the case, because in acquiring a site it would be necessary to seek planning permission from a local authority so that one would be dealing with the same kind of pressure groups that must be dealt with now.  On the question of finance, local authorities received block grants and it is for them to decide on how the money is moved around to meet the needs of the community. Under the waste disposal regulations of 1979, local authorities were given certain instructions and regulations on how to maintain and regulate tipheads and so on.  Therefore, it is better to leave the problem with the local authorities because, knowing what the requirements are, they are best suited to deal with the matter.  We find that when there are problems at local level that cannot be dealt with there is a tendency to pass them on to central Government but in the long run that attitude is not in the best interest either of local authorities or of Government.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will review and update, existing environmental legislation with particular reference to atmospheric pollution regulations, to enable local authorities to be more effective in dealing with environmental problems in this area, bearing in mind (a) the contiguity of privately owned open spaces to urban communities and (b) the low pitch of chimneys on extensions to private dwellings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>In the meantime, air quality control is exercised through the Control of Atmospheric Pollution Regulations, 1970, and by means of conditions attached to planning permissions for developments which might give rise to air pollution.  There are also requirements arising from various EEC Directives designed to prevent or reduce air pollution; these relate to such matters as emissions of smoke and sulphur dioxide, lead in air, lead content of petrol and sulphur content of gas oil.</P>

I can refer him to correspondence of 18 July 1983 and to replies from the Department of 21 July last and of 2 September last.  In the correspondence of 2 September there is reference to the Department's intention to revise existing legislation in this area.  I would draw the Minister's attention also to a reply I received from the environmental section of Dublin County Council, dated 24 June 1983, informing me that the supervising health inspector <Col N="1105" /> investigated the very serious problem of the burning of carcases and other waste on a site adjacent to a built-up community but that he was unable to take any action &mdash;&mdash;</P>

Will he ask the people who are administering the scheme, the health boards in conjunction with the councils, to carry out an assessment of what is still required?

      <P>I agree that the scheme is excellent and the Government have given considerable funding towards it.  Because of its success I should like to think the scheme will be ongoing.  It provides a valuable service for the elderly. The fact that it is done through the health boards is important because the community care people know the problems. <Col N="1107" /> Very often elderly people do not know of their entitlements and the community care people can help in this area.  I have often heard people say the matter should be dealt with by local authorities but I believe it is better to leave it with the health boards.  I take the point made by the Deputy but I would point out that the Government have the will to help in this area.</P>

There is a long delay between the time an elderly person makes the application for assistance under the scheme and the time the work is carried out.  In my experience in the Galway area there are delays of from nine to 12 months from the time an elderly person discovers there is a scheme in existence and when that assistance is given.  Incidentally, the scheme was brought in by Fianna Fáil and we are pleased the Government are continuing with it.  However, some changes are necessary. There is confusion in the administration of the scheme because of the involvement of health board officials and of local authority officials.  Much time is wasted in the administrative area which could be eliminated.  I ask the Minister to review the operation of the scheme.  Will he consider handing it over completely to the local authorities and removing the <Col N="1108" /> health boards from operating it?  There should be enough experience gained now to have confidence that the local authorities can manage this scheme.</P>

      <P>I am not doubting what the Deputy has said.  I will have the matter investigated.  If a person reports a problem to the local authority and if he or she qualifies for the necessary funding the matter should be dealt with quickly. With regard to handing it over to the local authorities, as I have indicated, the community care people are meeting the elderly.  They know the problems and I consider they are the best people to deal with the matter.  I think it should be left with them.  However, if I thought the health boards were the people responsible for delays of nine or 12 months, certainly I would have the matter examined.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of each local authority to provide housing for those persons in its area who are in need of housing and unable to house themselves from their own resources. Local authorities house travellers as part of their regular housing programmes in accordance with their statutory schemes of letting priorities, and in the past, the majority of travellers who have been housed have been dealt with in this way.  To a much lesser extent, special group housing schemes, financed 100 per cent by my Department, have been provided for travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> Information on the number of travellers likely to be housed in 1984 under the normal local authority housing programme is not available in my Department. As regards group housing, the position is that 43 houses in 7 schemes have been approved; these are either under construction, or expected to be, this year.  Further proposals for the construction in 1984 of special group schemes may yet be submitted to my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to follow the Minister's reply.  However, I take it that there are only 43 houses to be specially constructed to accommodate travelling families in 1984, over and above whatever casual tenancies are created in the normal way through the local authority letting scheme.  Is it only 43 special houses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply would not seem to indicate that the Government have any great commitment towards proceeding at an accelerated pace with the provision of housing for this very needy sector of our community. Is the information which the Minister has just given about the 100 per cent finance from his Department really correct when one considers that, in fact, the Department do not make any payments towards the cost of maintaining these special housing schemes when they are built for travellers and the costs which arise in regard to caretaking etc., which are an essential part of any special housing arrangement?  These essential costs have to be met by the local authorities out of a small revenue fund.  The Minister should consider providing financial assistance in that area.  It is not just good enough to provide 100 per cent capital cost and ignore the rest.  There must be a follow-up to ensure proper supervision and caretaking.  That cost is a burden on <Col N="1115" /> the local authorities which the State should carry if it has any commitment to providing a housing scheme for the travelling community.</P>

      <P>Which can be quite excessive. Is the Minister aware of some special housing schemes which have been constructed for itinerant families and that the proposal as initiated and explained entailed strict caretaking provisions which would be an essential part in the overall success of the scheme, but because the Department are not prepared to fund the local authorities that part of it, did not fulfil their obligations in that area and some of these schemes have now deteriorated from the original concept and have not been a success because of that, which is very regrettable.

I hope that this will make significant changes both in houses for and attitudes towards these people.</P>

In addition, capital funds were provided in 1983 and I will be providing further capital in 1984 to assist local authorities in meeting the cost of specialist snow-clearing equipment.

In my county and in my constituency, in particular, the people are not aware of this facility.  Might I say with the greatest respect to the workers who are doing their utmost at the moment that there is something drastically wrong with the administration of this scheme, because Donegal County Council were somewhat indignant at the fact that I contacted the Department of the Environment on Monday morning last indicating that I wanted this emergency rescue unit.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware.  It is not proposed to abolish this long-standing practice because of the administrative problems and expense which would be involved in arranging to meet the potential demand from amongst an average of some 2,000 candidates sitting in 15 different locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this is a practice that should be abolished?  The Minister will appreciate that the idea of a nervous individual, boy or girl, coming along for a test being asked to cart a typewriter to the examination centre is ludicrous.  Surely the Civil Service, with its many thousands of typewriters, and indeed civil servants, could do the courtesy of providing a typewriter for such individuals.  Would the Minister tell us, on average, what would be the cost of hiring a typewriter for these individuals in the event of the majority of them not owning a typewriter?  Would the Minister &mdash; who has been seen to be a far-sighted individual over the last 12 months &mdash; not consider this a Victorian-type practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit that I rather shared the views expressed by the Deputy when this matter was first brought to my attention.  I discovered that, prior to 1963, it had been the practice to provide typewriters for applicants.  The practice was discontinued at that time, based largely on the cost element involved but not exclusively.  There are usually now approximately 2,000 applicants for this examination.  Therefore what we would be talking about would be the cost to the Civil Service Commissioners of finding 2,000 typewriters and making them available at 15 different locations around the country.  There would also be additional cost in respect of transportation to those centres.  Apparently also there is the fact that, in a number of instances, it is felt that candidates would prefer to sit the competition using the typewriter to which they are accustomed, on which they had <Col N="1121" /> trained and were familiar with rather than being asked to use a typewriter which they might well afterwards claim was not of sufficiently high standard and had interferred with their ability to compete successfully in the examination.  The cost of typewriter hire, were it to be considered for this examination, would fall somewhere in the region of £10,000 to £15,000.  I understand also that in a high number of cases where candidates have attended commercial schools or typewriter courses within their own school system the schools very often make those typewriters available to those candidates when they are competing in this examination.  That has some merits in that a candidate is then sitting the examination using the typewriter with which he or she is familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My main concern related to the cost of typewriters in the three individual cases brought to my attention.  While the Minister has outlined very clearly what he considers to be the position, would he consider the possibility of part payment of the cost to those who may have to hire typewriters on the basis that the spurious application fee for Civil Service jobs has now been abolished?  Would he not consider abolishing this piece of nonsense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Items such as these constitute one of the reasons a partial fee for application was introduced last year.  In the context of discussing in detail how an examination like this operates at 15 different centres, covering 2,000 people, the hiring of supervisors, attendant staff and payment for the hiring of the halls, the House may begin to get some idea of the total cost involved in running a single competition such as this.  If the cost of hiring typewriters were to be taken on board as well it would constitute a considerable additional cost <i>vis-à-vis</i> the entire examination.  As the Deputy said, the Government have discontinued the stipulation of an application fee.  It would be possible to provide typewriters if the Civil Service Commission were prepared to centralise the examination in one <Col N="1122" /> centre in Dublin, when the competition could then be held over a series of days. I believe that would be rather a retrograde step in that it would place an obligation or an onus, on applicants from centres outside Dublin to travel to Dublin to compete.  In many cases the cost and inconvenience to applicants of having to take on board the cost of travelling to Dublin would far out-weigh the cost &mdash; which, in many cases, is notional because very often the typewriters are either owned or borrowed &mdash; of providing typewriters at one of the provincial centres. However, I am quite prepared to bear Deputy Andrew's very understandable comments about this in mind to ascertain if there is any way in which the objectives of the Civil Service Commission and the convenience of the individual applicants might best be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the 15 centres and so on and the supply of typewriters, surely the Civil Service Commission would not have to supply 2,000 typewriters throughout the 15 centres?  Surely one or two typewriters in each centre would solve the problem?  Can the Minister say how many interviews are held at the various centres over a period of, say, 12 months.  I do not follow the Minister's logic in relation to the number of typewriters that would be required.  I would not have thought there would be too many at present anyway.  The Minister has been very forthcoming in his reply and I do not want to be awkward.  I am hopeful something may arise from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that procurement of a typewriter constitutes a major obstacle for these applicants?  Would he also agree that any applicant hiring a typewriter would not have any experience of that machine. Furthermore, would he not agree that it would be much more feasible to bring these applicants to the relevant Government Departments where the vacancies exist and where they could be tested on Government standard typewriters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The last part of the Deputy's question is rather contradictory. <Col N="1123" /> If applicants would be reluctant to hire a typewriter with which they would be unfamiliar they would be equally unfamiliar with a typewriter that might be provided by the Civil Service Commission or a Government Department and that is precisely the point which I was making earlier.  I do not want to appear unhelpful but I did not quite follow Deputy Andrews' question.  Last year there were 2,166 applicants who sat typewriting competitions at 15 different centres on the same day.  Even if the competition was held over a series of days, rather than talking about one or two typewriters which would obviously be feasible, we are talking about the provision of typewriters for everybody or placing the obligation on applicants to provide the typewriters.  We ought to place this matter in context.  In very many cases schools or commercial colleges where applicants have attended courses make their typewriters available to the applicants, typewriters with which they are familiar and which they bring to the competitions.  In many other cases, as Members of the House may know, the applicants will have their own personal typewriters because it is generally regarded that the amount of time spent on a typewriting course may not produce a standard high enough to pass a competition like this.  Therefore, some applicants have their own typewriters, some use the typewriters made available by the commercial colleges and others have to hire or otherwise obtain their typewriter. I will look at the situation but I do not think it is feasible to bring about what Deputy Andrews regards as an improvement.</P>

      <P>Payment of pensions at the revised rates will be made to retired <Col N="1124" /> civil servants at the end of January 1984 and will include arrears due up to that date.  The application of the revision to pensioners in other areas of the public service is the responsibility of the appropriate Minister in each case.</P>
      <P>As regards public service pensions generally, the current practice is to increase such pensions on 1 July each year by reference to changes in the pay rates of serving officers withing the previous 12 months.  There has been pressure for many years now for full parity, that is, for pension adjustments to take effect from the same date as the pay increases. Last year, as an exceptional measure, I agreed in the course of the pay negotiations that the first phase of the Public Service Pay Agreement would, in general, apply with effect from 1 September 1983 to pensions in course of payment on that date.</P>
      <P>The Government have now decided in the context of yesterday's budget that in the case of general pay increases such as the second phase of the Public Service Pay Agreement, full parity will be implemented from 1 February 1984 onwards at an estimated cost of £2 million.  So far as grade or special increases are concerned, parity will be dealt with in the context of negotiations for the next pay round and the new arrangements will be implemented in 1985.  Negotiators will, of course, have to take these commitments into account in costing future pay claims.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the discharge of radioactive wastes into the Irish Sea from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield. The Deputy is no doubt aware that during the Anglo-Irish Summit meeting last November the Tánaiste expressed the Government's concern in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Energy has also sought a meeting with the British Secretary of State for the Environment to discuss fully our concern about the effects of the Sellafield operation.</P>
      <P>I have not had discussions with the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the matter and in the circumstances referred to earlier I do not propose to take further action at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board, with the parent body, the Department of Energy, have statutory responsibility for these matters, including the disposal of low level radioactive waste generated in this country and the monitoring of waste in both fish and the seas around our coast.  That is an ongoing process and is done through continuous contact with the United Kingdom authority responsible for nuclear matters generally. As I said, there is ongoing monitoring of the level of nuclear waste and the effects it is having.  In relation to my own Department, we do not have the scientific expertise to assess the effects resulting from a discharge of nuclear waste.  This is being done by the body with statutory responsibility for it.</P>

      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board under the aegis of the Department of Energy, have responsibility for the protection of the marine environment. The Department of the Environment are responsible for pollution from land based sources.  The Department of Communications are responsible for dumping at sea.  As an example of the difference between the disparity of responsibility here and that in Britain, all this responsibility comes under the aegis of the British Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this matter has been raised on a number of occasions in recent years because of the expansion of the use of nuclear energy.  I am sure the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Energy Board are aware of the difficulties that exist and <Col N="1129" /> they will be advising on the best approach to this problem, but I do not know if they will eventually come around to recommending a central agency dealing with this <i>in toto.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the receiver, in conjunction with the IDA is seeking a purchaser for this company and that, in fact, a number of prospective interests have already emerged.  If a viable proposal materialises my Department will be prepared to negotiate, in as favourable a manner as possible, terms governing the supply of timber to the new enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister fully examined the report of the auditors for the period July to November 1983 which shows a net profit in the region of £90,000 to £100,000?  In the light of these figures will the Minister change his mind?  Will he finance the receiver to enable the company to re-open and to operate as a going concern while the negotiations to find an alternative purchaser are under way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the accounts were published some time in late December, and I received them last Friday.  The accounts relate to a period from 1 July to 18 November, the day on which operations terminated in Scarriff. From some of the background to the operations of CPL, very little can be based on this selective period because, as the Deputy knows better than most people, this was the optimum period for good results in an operation like this.  I would not consider the contents of these accounts to be a basis for changing my mind in relation to this firm.  Negotiations are going on between the agency responsible and prospective clients for the take-over of this company.  I suggest that <Col N="1130" /> public statements at this stage could be potentially harmful to the efforts being made by the IDA and the receiver in consultation with officials of my Department to get a potential client to take over CPL as a going concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider very seriously the fact that it would be a much more attractive proposition to dispose of the plant as a going concern?  It would be possible to negotiate to have this plant taken over as a going concern if the Minister were to continue to fund the receiver to enable the plant to re-open so that the workers can continue production.  Would the Minister not consider the possibility of funding the receiver temporarily until such times as these negotiations are brought to a successful conclusion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The information emanating from the accounts I received would not justify a change of mind.  The receiver, together with the IDA, is happy to negotiate with clients who are showing a very serious interest in this company.  I suggest that they be allowed to do their work without hindrance or without any public interference because this is a very sensitive issue and negotiations are at a very sensitive stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The accounts I have seen do not differ substantially from what I already knew.  They are based on certain assumptions.

Is he now aware of the very strong financial commitment made by the main private shareholder and the several commitments made by the dedicated staff? Would he now reconsider making funds available to the receiver to keep this factory operating until May of this year when his Department's agreement expires?  Would he then review the whole position to see if this company could remain operating as a viable trading company after May of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few questions there.  I have not been made aware of any substantial financial commitment made by the principal private shareholder. The contract in relation to timber has to run until next May.  That contract can be fulfilled if the receiver so wishes. As I have said, any interference or intervention at this stage could possibly result in disrupting the negotiations which are at a sensitive stage with the prospective clients who want to take over this plant.</P>

      <P>Please give me a moment.  My attention was drawn to that some time after I entered the Chair for Question Time.  I am told it was received in the office later than the prescribed time.  Later still, when I was in the midst of Question Time, I was advised by my advisers that the question was too late to process.  I was advised it was not in order and I disallowed it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly I find this incredible. My position in this matter is that I and my colleagues thought it was of sufficient and urgent importance to raise it during the course of the budget debate. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the Chair.  My colleague, Deputy Desmond, Minister for Health and Social Welfare, was occupying the Government front bench.  It seemed to me that there was an understanding &mdash; and I think the suggestion was made by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare &mdash; that I should raise the matter at 3.30 p.m.  I took it from that, that the Government were prepared to respond on a matter of urgent public importance.  It cannot be denied, Sir, that it is a matter of very real urgent public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> I certainly dispatched the question in time.  I regret it if it was not received within a few minutes of the time limit. The Minister has a very solemn Ministerial responsibility to deal with this matter here and now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Haughey to bear with me again and I would ask the House to keep cool about this.  There is no mystery about it. I entered the Chair for Question Time dead on 2.30 p.m. or shortly before that. Some time after that, my attention was drawn to the fact that a Private Notice Question was in from Deputy Haughey. I understood it was being looked at.  Of course I had no opportunity to deal with it because I was dealing with questions. Within the past 20 minutes I was given unanimous advice that the question was not received in time to be processed.  I was advised that it was not in order.  I was here in the Chair trying to deal with questions and, in accordance with that advice, I disallowed the question.  It is not a question of the Government.  It is a question of my being advised that there was not an opportunity to process the question and that it was not in order.  I disallowed it and that is that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat my astonishment.  First of all your Deputy, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, was in the Chair.  The understanding of myself and my colleagues was that he was concurring in my raising this matter and getting a reply at 3.30 p.m.  He certainly gave that impression.  I think he concurred with the Minister for Health and Social Welfare that that was the proper procedure to follow.  In those circumstances I did not think there could be any question of technicalities introduced to prevent my raising this fundamentally important and urgent matter.  Sir, I ask you: are you ruling that you are disallowing the question on its merits or because of some time factor?</P>

      <P>I understand that there was no question of a formal Private Notice Question being handed in until it was handed in some time after <Col N="1149" /> 2.30 p.m. I am disallowing the question simply and solely on the grounds that I was in the Chair at all times as far as I am concerned relevant to the processing of this question.

      <Col N="1152" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.</P>

      <P>On the basis that this is an informal intervention in the debate and not the concluding statement which I would normally make, I am happy to come here and discuss this issue.  In the first place I would like to point out that there is not a crisis in the stock market.  As Deputies opposite know, it is not at all unusual for a budget to be followed by buying or selling pressures in the gilt market, depending on the market's perception of the effects of the budget.  This morning there was a deal of selling pressure.  It was expected that the announcement in the speech yesterday in relation to bond washing would give rise to selling pressure, and this occurred. The fact that the amount of selling pressure that developed was greater than we had expected indicates that the practice of bond washing is even more widespread than we had suspected it to be.</P>
      <P>The pressure was dealt with in the normal way by the Government stockbroker who laid down terms for the purchase of Government paper and marked down the prices by £6 at the long end and £10 at the short end.  No business was done because that price proved unattractive to the people selling on the market.  There has not been a massive sale of gilts, as has been suggested on the opposite side, and to that extent no crisis arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have further confirmation that the practice of bond washing, which is a tax avoidance device, is more widespread than we had thought.  It reinforces the reasons I had in including this measure in the budget.  I am not in any way criticising <Col N="1153" /> those who are involved in this practice. It takes advantage of a loophole in our legislation to create the possibility of making tax-free income.  It is perfectly normal that we should proceed and find a way of making those people make a reasonable contribution in terms of taxation to the community in which they are involved, in which they are in business and on which they rely to make their investments pay off as they do.  The fact that this avoidance scheme is there is not in any way to be taken as a criticism of the people involved, but I have made no secret of the fact ever since last year's budget that tax avoidance was one of the areas with which I wanted to deal and this is part of this process.</P>
    <P>The manoeuvres that took place this morning are of the kind that normally take place after a budget and have not resulted in anything worth mentioning. They reflect in no way at all on the solidity of Government paper as an investment home for funds that come on the market. My Department will, during the course of the afternoon, be issuing a statement which will clarify certain details of the measure that has been taken.  My view is that this is very much a short-term reaction and that the market will sort itself out and settle down in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the amount of funds available for moving around in this short end of the bond market is normally about £500 million and that £1,000 million was offered for sale this morning.  This would seem to indicate that it is not as the Minister <Col N="1154" /> suggests, that there is more bond washing being indulged in than he expected, but rather that these proposals are having a serious effect right across the market and not just on the short end of the market. Secondly, when he says that markets react to budgets from time to time and when he said he anticipated that the market would react to his proposals, surely if he was so aware the Government stockbroker should have been in a position to cope with whatever developments emerged on the market this morning. One would have thought if the Government and their advisers &mdash; I place more responsibility on the advisers than on the Government &mdash; had done their homework they would have been aware of the repercussions likely to take place and the Government stockbroker would have been in the position to steady and stabilise the market.  It would seem that a miscalculation was made somewhere.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, I fully accept the Minister's assurance that these developments do not in any way affect the credibility of Irish Government securities which we fully support and agree are good securities. But does the Minister think that the reaction by the market this morning to his proposals will in any way interfere with the capacity of the Government and the Exchequer to raise their borrowing requirements domestically during the coming year or in the short term?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy indicated it was not concentrated on any particular end of the market.  Action was taken both at the short end and the long end of the market.  As regards the question of whether the Government stockbroker should have been in a position to cope, I made it clear in my statement that the Government stockbroker did exactly that.  He coped extremely well to the point where no movement took place on <Col N="1155" /> the market.  The third point was whether I was confident that this would not interfere with the Government's capacity to raise that part of the total borrowing requirement which we intend to raise on the domestic market.  The answer to that is that I do not think it will interfere in any way with that.  There is a measure here which will have an immediate effect. It is intended to close an unintended tax loophole which is why I called it tax avoidance.  There is no doubt that people who find themselves in a changed situation of that kind will react.  On top of that there is the normal manoeuvring which goes on in the market particularly after a budget to try to influence the course of interest rates.  That has happened on this occasion also.  Bearing those facts in mind, I have no fears about our capacity to raise the finances required.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his intervention.  However, I am not at all satisfied with the situation which has developed or that the Minister and his advisers anticipated the situation which they should have done.  I have doubts about the effect of the whole business on our public finances, but because of the courtesy which the Minister extended to us in this regard I do not intend to be tendentious about the matter at this stage but we will have to return to it on another occasion.</P>

      <P>In the time which I have left to me I propose to refer to the financial position.  Although I dealt with the financial position in my contribution to the December debate on the Adjournment, it is worthwhile underlining some of the salient features in order that Deputies will be clear about the financial background which must affect the planning and operation of the health services in the current year.  The non-capital allocation represents the major portion of the overall resources provided for the health services in the current year and I will deal in the first instance with the non-capital provision and its implications.</P>
      <P>The net non-capital provision in the Book of Estimates for Health is £963.612 million.  This compares with an out-turn figure of £936.7 million for 1983.  The Estimates provision for health services will enable a sum in the region of about £1,062 million to be spent on health services in 1984 when account is taken of Appropriations-in-Aid.  This represents an increase of £29 million on the 1983 out-turn of expenditure.</P>
      <P>Regarding private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals, charges have been increased by 25 per cent as from 1 January 1984.  Details of the revised charges have been published. The revised charges are still substantially less than the average actual cost.  For example, the revised charge for private accommodation is £69 a day in a teaching hospital.  The average actual cost will be about £120 a day and will reach about £135 a day in the case of major large teaching hospitals.  Voluntary Health Insurance members will be fully indemnified against the increased charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A hospital admission charge of £100 is to be made in the case of persons who <Col N="1157" /> have not discharged their liabilities in respect of health contributions.  Regulations in this regard are at present being drawn up.</P>
    <P>The threshold for the refund of drugs scheme has been increased from £23 to £28 with effect from 1 January 1984.  The amount to be refunded in respect of January 1984, and subsequent months, will thus be expenditure in excess of £28.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to record my appreciation of the efforts of health boards, voluntary hospitals and homes in successfully coping with their 1983 budgetary situation.  It is generally accepted that there were no major problems in 1983.  There was no need for a Supplementary Estimate.  Furthermore, I found it possible to make the required savings of £13.6 million in the Estimate without reducing the 1983 allocations of health agencies.  The satisfactory out-turn in 1983 helps to cope with the 1984 situation.</P>
    <P>The health agencies are at present considering the measures to be taken to avoid exceeding the non-capital allocations for 1984 which were notified to them last December.</P>
    <P>I will not in any way pretend that serious problems will not arise, involving difficult decisions, in securing the necessary cuts in expenditure.  All health boards have already met to consider their position and I am heartened by the fact that a number of boards have already adopted a range of proposals aimed at aligning expenditure with the allocation levels approved.  I would urge all other boards to give priority attention to the budgetary situation.  I would stress that there will be no extra funds at my disposal in 1983-84 that would enable me to ease the position for any health board or other health agency.  It is essential, therefore, that decisions are taken without delay as to how the budgetary situation is to be dealt with at board level.  The longer the delay the more difficult the problems become.</P>
    <P>I have no illusions about the magnitude of the task facing health agencies.  I am confident, however, that the various health bodies will deal with the situation <Col N="1158" /> in a responsible manner.  Officers of my Department will be available to discuss difficulties arising.  I met the Chairmen and chief executive officers in December last, for a preliminary discussion of the financial constraints.  I will be reviewing the position in the light of reports from the health boards on the measures they propose to take to operate within allocations and the implications of such measures.</P>
    <P>Much emphasis has been placed on the magnitude of increases in expenditure on health services in the last decade or so. In 1972-73 net non-capital expenditure on health services amounted to £108 million representing 4.7 per cent of GNP.  In 1983 expenditure reached £1,033 million representing just under 8 per cent of GNP.  It is noteworthy, however, that expenditure on health services has fallen in real terms since 1981.  The situation as regards the provision of resources for health services is not likely to show any dramatic improvement in the medium term.  Consequently, there is an urgent need to consider ways and means of securing necessary improvements in services in the context of continuing limitations on resources.</P>
    <P>It will be of primary importance in future to ensure that expenditure on the health services is used in the most cost effective way possible.  My Department are already taking steps to see that value for money is obtained across a broad range of services.  For example, a number of studies were carried out last year on supplies, energy, transport and housekeeping and the recommendations for improved practices set out in those reports have been circulated to the health agencies.  Other services, for example, patient admission procedures in general hospitals, are now being examined to ensure that they are being delivered in an efficient and effective manner and this process will continue.  Also, new financial and non-financial systems which are being implemented in health boards and hospitals will be of immense value to both local and departmental management. The management information that will be produced by those systems, for example in the costing area, will improve the <Col N="1159" /> quality of analysis and decision making by managers.  In general, it is fair to say that the rapid growth in expenditure in the past decade on the health services has meant that there is room for greater economies and better use of resources.  The studies I have mentioned, the critical evaluation of services, the new management systems being introduced throughout health boards and hospitals, all of these developments can only assist the Department and its agencies in delivering the services in an efficient way so that value for money is got for every pound spent on the health services.</P>
    <P>On the pay side of the health services I should mention that the allocation for the current year represents a 2¾ per cent reduction below 1983 pay volume.  I fully appreciate the efforts made by the health boards and other health agencies over the past two to three years to cope with the financial restraints which had to be imposed because of the economic circumstances in which the country finds itself. I am heartened and encouraged by the continuing search for economies and improvement in efficiency and effectiveness which have enabled us to absorb these financial restraints without endangering the fabric of our health services. For the time being I am afraid we must continue in our search for the ways and means to survive and keep intact the vital and essential elements of our services. Given the good will and co-operation of all concerned I have no doubt that the very valuable and worthwhile services which have been built up can be maintained, perhaps even in a more healthy state than they were before.  To facilitate the health boards and agencies in their task I am prepared to leave them relatively free to determine the measures they need to take to ensure that they will keep within their allocation.  This flexibility would also apply to the question of filling or non-filling of vacancies which may arise.  It will therefore be essentially a matter for each health board or agency to determine in the light of their own requirements.  Through careful and prudent management of their resources I am sure they can get through what is without <Col N="1160" /> question a difficult and testing time though at the same time a challenging one.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that the Voluntary Health Insurance play their part in controlling health care costs.  To this end, I have asked the board to examine, for example, ways in which the use of out-patient facilities might be positively encouraged as part of their schemes as an alternative to costly hospital in-patient treatment.  The board have also been asked to review their schemes generally in an effort to promote the use of the most efficient treatment procedures available.</P>
    <P>I might add that the most recent report of the VHI board showed the board's schemes to be still attractive to a significant proportion of the population and despite the general economic difficulties the VHI's membership has remained buoyant.  Indeed, the total number now covered by the board's schemes is over one million persons.</P>
    <P>I should also say in this context that the board have raised with me the problems which can be created for them by a situation in which the development of private hospital facilities is not statutorily controlled.  At present, there is no statutory control covering the establishment of private hospitals except where such private hospitals are intended to cater for the mentally ill or maternity patients in which case such hospitals are subject to the Mental Treatment Acts and the Registration of Maternity Homes Act, 1934.  In effect, therefore, other than in respect of hospitals catering for the mentally ill or maternity patients, anyone may establish a private hospital providing a range of services from general medicine to cardiac surgery without seeking any permission from anyone to do so.</P>
    <P>In the case of homes for incapacitated persons, nursing homes, certain standards are laid down in the Homes for Incapacitated Persons Regulations, 1966, made under the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act 1964.  Yet the only requirement laid down under the 1964 Act is that where a person proposes to establish a home, he shall, not less than one month before the date on which <Col N="1161" /> it is proposed to commence business, notify in writing the health authority in whose functional area the home will be situated of the name and address of the home and the name of the person in charge of the home.</P>
    <P>The majority of voluntary hospitals, with the exception of hospitals which are administered by corporate bodies established under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, are in effect private hospitals operating under charters or private Acts.  In reality, therefore, at present, there is little statutory control over the establishment and operation of hospitals or nursing homes here other than those hospitals owned and administered by health boards and statutory bodies.  If unchecked this could lead to chaos in the organisation of hospital services generally. I am therefore at the moment preparing a submission to Government in which I propose to suggest measures to remedy a gap in the controls available to my Department to secure the most efficient use of resources.</P>
    <P>I devoted a considerable portion of the contribution I made on the Adjournment Debate on 16 December last to my endeavours to systematically streamline institutional services with the twin objectives of eliminating wasteful use of scarce resources and of ensuring the continuation of vital services and the development by re-allocation of resources of facilities which it is absolutely essential to provide. While I have in the past year been involved in a number of closures of hospitals, for example Teach Ultain, Mercer's Hospital, Bantry, Trim and Dungarvan maternity units, I have at the same time provided for the expansion of cardiac surgery services at the Mater Hospital, of the establishment of a bone marrow transplant service at St. James's Hospital and the expansion of the renal dialysis services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I will continue with my efforts to streamline the services weeding out those services and facilities which are identified as patently unnecessary to the provision of an effective service.</P>
    <P>This year the Department of Health's capital allocation will be £55.5 million compared with £53 million in 1983.  This <Col N="1162" /> increased allocation will facilitate the continuation of an extensive building programme of hospitals and a wide variety of other health care facilities in various locations throughout the country. The capital development works in the health area this year are being carried through as an integral part of a medium term &mdash; five years &mdash; health capital programme. It is perfectly clear from the exhaustive review which I have carried out that the capital investment programme of our health services must have regard not alone to the likely future availability of capital funds from the Exchequer to plan and build essential facilities but equally must have regard to the additional revenue expenditure implications of new capital development which in the labour-intensive health sector can be particularly daunting.  Against this background it is imperative that a scale of priorities be identified so that increasingly scarce resources can be applied to those areas of the service in greatest need.  I am acutely aware that such a process must, of necessity, involve a number of difficult decisions for me and my Department as we can never hope to meet all the demands, both rational and irrational, which are daily made upon us. Unlike some of my predecessors, however, I am prepared to take up the challenge so that an attitude of pleasing all regardless of cost can be replaced by an honest, measured and coherent strategy of defining real priority needs and meeting those within a reasonable time frame. It will be necessary to reduce the scale of some developments particularly those in the general hospital area where past planning and inflated expectations must be brought into line with present and future reality.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation for 1984 will, on the general hospital side, allow for ongoing planning and/or construction of major new facilities in the different health board areas.  These include the six major hospitals for the Dublin area &mdash; St. James's, Beaumont, Mater, James Connolly, St. Vincents and Tallaght, including Naas &mdash; which will enable the replacement of a number of patently unsuitable hospital buildings dating from the middle of the <Col N="1163" /> last century.  Outside of Dublin funds will continue to be allocated for planned new development in Castlebar, Mullingar, Ardkeen, Sligo, Wexford, Cavan and the completion of new hospitals in Tralee and Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>I should say, particularly, that I am seeking to have the restriction upon the building of Cavan Hospital imposed by the taking of legal action by the Monaghan Hospital Retention Committee discharged by the High Court, and on the assumption that my efforts will be successful I have provided in the capital programme the money necessary to enable building to commence at the earliest possible date this year.  I am concerned to do so because I know that it is imperative that the existing surgical hospital in Cavan should be replaced at the earliest possible date.  In fact when I assumed office a year ago it was clearly identified to me as a project of the highest priority and I had provided for a commencement of building on the replacement hospital in last year's capital allocation.</P>
    <P>The allocation will provide for the continuation of the special improvement schemes within our public psychiatric hospitals, the provision of new facilities for the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped as well as the development of improved services for the physically handicapped including up-dated centres for the deaf and the blind.  A special emphasis will also be placed on the development and upgrading of geriatric hospitals and facilities throughout the country, e.g., St. Oliver Plunkett Hospital, Dundalk, and the Sacred Heart Home, Carlow.</P>
    <P>In general, it will be my aim to continue the process of diverting an increasing share of the available resources into the low profile areas of priority need within the services, particularly in the community area.  It is my intention to set aside a disparate allocation annually within the lifetime of the medium term capital programme to enable health boards to provide compact basic community care facilities which can be provided quickly and <Col N="1164" /> which will improve the effectiveness of the delivery of services within the community.</P>
    <P>In the past I have stressed the extent to which I am committed to the strengthening and expansion of community care. In asking health boards to consider the manner in which they could live within their allocations in the current year, I put it to them that they should aim especially to safeguard the existing community care services and to try to avoid, as far as possible, making reductions in those services.  I shall be examining, with particular care, when I receive their reports on their proposals for living within their allocations, the extent to which the health boards have found it possible to meet this requirement.  It is particularly important, in the current year, that they should make the maximum possible effort to do so since, to the extent to which health boards succeed in limiting admissions to hospital, operating day hospitals or providing five-day week hospital care, a further burden will be placed on the existing community services.  This is likely to be particularly true of the public health nursing services and the general practitioner services.</P>
    <P>I would hope that in the current year general practitioners will co-operate to the maximum possible extent in reducing the numbers of referrals to hospitals.  The constant increase in the number of hospital admissions has been a source of considerable concern over the past few years and I would appeal to general practitioners to ensure as far as possible that only those persons who cannot appropriately be treated in the community are referred for investigation and treatment in our general hospitals.</P>
    <P>I would like to say also that I appreciate the extent to which the changes in nursing services which it will be necessary to make in the coming year will impact on the existing public health nursing services.  These services provide, throughout the country, a high-class nursing service, which, particularly for the elderly, enables people to be maintained in their own homes where, in the absence of such services, it would be necessary to have them referred for institutional <Col N="1165" /> care.  I know the burden that this imposes on the public health nursing staff and I would like to pay tribute to the extent to which they discharge these practical nursing duties in addition to their preventive role which is of so much importance, particularly in relation to the health and development of children.</P>
    <P>We will, in the current year, clearly have to give a great deal more thought to the appropriate mix of services between the community and the hospital services. Of their nature the hospital services tend to be very expensive and while it would be a mistake to consider that, in all cases, an appropriate level of community care will necessarily be cheaper to provide, it is obviously desirable that we try to ensure that only those who require the high level of expertise and the technological facilities available in our general hospitals are admitted to them for care.  This imposes on us the need critically to examine all the services we are providing within the community in order to establish how effective these are, how they might be improved and how they can be altered to provide a more effective and efficient health service in general.</P>
    <P>Some of this work is currently being undertaken, particularly in the review body on the General Medical Services. This body who have representatives of the medical organisations and the relevant Government Departments are currently meeting frequently and reviewing the nature of the general practitioner services which might be provided in future, the manner in which these would be organised and the way in which these might be structured to assist in providing an effective foundation for an expanded system of primary health care.  I would hope that, if the current rate of progress is maintained, the working party will be in a position to finalise their report before Easter.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will know, there has, in recent years been a growing tendency to treat mentally ill patients to the maximum possible extent in the community. A review of services for the mentally ill has been in progress for some time and it involves representatives of all those involved in the provision of services.  I <Col N="1166" /> would hope in the near future that this review will also be completed and that it will indicate the practical arrangements which may be necessary to make available effective community care for those who may suffer from mental illness.</P>
    <P>In the past it was the practice that students and other young persons over the age of 16 years qualified for medical cards on the basis of their own personal income and without reference to their parents' financial circumstances.  The result was that the great majority of students aged 16 years or over were automatically eligible for medical cards. Many of these students belong to families for which the payment of fees for normal family doctor and pharmacy services causes no hardship.  Since eligibility for medical cards arises from hardship in paying for these services, the special position of students was an anomaly.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to remove this anomaly by taking account of family circumstances in determining students' eligibility.  The position now is that eligibility for medical cards will no longer be automatic but will be related to ability to pay for general practitioner services.  Any student who is a dependent in a family with medical card eligibility will retain entitlement to a medical card.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party decided on that but Deputy Woods ran away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special provision has been made to guard against the danger of hardship.  If, in the case of any student whose medical card is being withdrawn, the provision of a required service would cause hardship, the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board has been empowered to make that service available without charge.  It has also been provided that students will retain their eligibility for free hospital services, both in-patient and out-patient, including the services of hospital consultants.  Many of their parents are over the income limit for hospital consultants but they still get the full benefit <Col N="1167" /> of availability for hospital consultants.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased about the innovation for the elderly in relation to medical cards.  The Government have a particular concern to ensure that the medical needs of the elderly are safeguarded. I have accordingly arranged with the health boards that a special age allowance will be built into the medical card guidelines.  This special allowance will be £5 per week for a single person aged 66 to 79 years and £8 per week for a single person aged 80 years or over; the corresponding weekly age allowance for a married couple will be £10 and £16 respectively.  These age allowances will take effect from 1 July 1984.  They will ensure that all persons in receipt of the new increased rates of full non-contributory old age pension will remain within the medical card guidelines and so retain their medical cards.  I stress, since Deputy Woods raised the matter this morning, that these new additional allowances are additional to the 10.3 per cent increase in income limits of the guidelines which have been increased since 1 January last so they are a topping up in addition to the increase of 10.3 per cent generally.</P>
    <P>I am given to understand that the GMS working party is making reasonable progress and I expect to have a report from the group by the end of March.  This no doubt will have implications for the future of primary health care as well as for the GMS itself.</P>
    <P>Regarding child care services we are not, as I have repeatedly pointed out, living in easy times.  But I would hope that no one in the House would quarrel with me if I suggest that, despite the times, a special effort should be made to advance children's services, particularly those for children who require our protection.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that despite current financial difficulties, I have been able to make an additional £800,000 available for developments in the field of residential child care.  This money will be used to clear the deficits of children's homes, to end the unsatisfactory capitation based <Col N="1168" /> system of funding and to introduce a more favourable method of direct funding by the local health boards.</P>
    <P>The new funding arrangements for children's homes is the first major steps in the implementation of a programme for the re-organisation of residential care broadly along the lines recommended by the Task Force on Child Care Services. I would like to take this opportunity to record my appreciation of the outstanding work done by these homes, in some instances for over a century, and of their total commitment to the care of one of the most vulnerable and needy groups in our society.  I look forward to their continued involvement in child care and I have no doubt, on the basis of their proud record of achievement in the past, that I am justified in my confidence that these homes will prove both sensitive and adaptable in tailoring their services to the changed and changing needs of children today.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to update and expand our child care legislation and one of my top priorities in the legislative field is the introduction of a comprehensive Children Bill.  The Bill will include wide-ranging provisions relating to the development and improvement of services for children and will, in particular, strengthen the laws in relation to the care and protection of children and reform our juvenile justice system.  The Bill will replace most of our existing children's legislation, much of which has its origins in the early years of the century, and will reflect the increasing awareness and recognition of the rights of the child and the responsibility of the State to ensure that these rights are promoted and protected as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the Bill in my Department has, unfortunately, taken much longer than originally anticipated. The Bill deals with many difficult and complex issues, some of which &mdash; particularly those in the area of juvenile justice &mdash; involve consideration of serious constitutional questions.  There are no short or easy answers to these questions and it is vital that the difficulties are carefully examined and that all possible solutions are fully explored.  I might mention that <Col N="1169" /> other countries which have given a great deal of thought to the problem of protecting and controlling children have also found themselves faced with the same type of perplexities.  In some instances, as in the United Kingdom, new legislation came up against great difficulties in actual implementation.  I can assure the House, however, that my Department are making all possible efforts to resolve these difficulties and to complete the drafting of the Bill at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Adoption is an important element within the range of services for children whose security and well-being have to be protected by the State.  As the House will recall, responsibility for the adoption service was transferred to me last year from the Minister for Justice.  It is a service that has now been over 30 years in operation and while it is working very well I think the time has come to review its statutory basis and its procedures.  I expect that a review committee which I have established to make recommendations to me in that connection will report about the end of March and I intend acting quickly in regard to its recommendations.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned on previous occasions, I have reviewed, with my Department, the operation of the existing family planning legislation.  Deputies will be aware that I find a number of features of the existing legislation unsatisfactory and that I have a view on the appropriate changes which should be made in the legislation.  The review will shortly be the subject of discussion between the members of the Government and I shall then be proceeding with the preparation of draft legislation to amend the Family Planning Act of 1979.  I would hope that in this task I would have the co-operation of Deputies from all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The text of the Dentists Bill is currently being examined and cleared with the draftsman and the text will shortly be submitted to the Government for their approval.  I would hope it would be possible to have it introduced in the Dáil in about a month.</P>
    <P>Certain provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, have in practice been <Col N="1170" /> found to be inadequate and an amending Bill is at present being prepared.  I hope shortly to submit to the Government the draft heads of an amending Bill and proceed thereafter to have it introduced in the House during this session.</P>
    <P>New consolidated legislation for the nursing profession is at present with the parliamentary draftsman and I look forward to introducing it to the House in the current session.</P>
    <P>Regarding para-medical statutory registration, I have recently given consideration to the views expressed by the professions concerned on my Department's earlier proposals and I have proposed some amendments to meet these views.  I look forward to early agreement with the profession on the amended proposals which I will then be putting to the Government for their consideration.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that the Green Paper on the Disabled has now been completed and I am submitting it for the formal approval of the Government. The paper will range beyond the services for which I am personally responsible in the Health and Social Welfare areas.  All Government Departments concerned with the needs of disabled persons have participated in its preparation and my intention is that it will provide a clear indication of Government policy in the areas of most importance through those whose lives are restricted because of disability.  I am sure that I do not have to emphasise that we have a special duty, a moral duty, to help our disabled brethren to live a full life like the rest of us are privileged to have.</P>
    <P>These are the main points I wish to make in relation to my Estimate.  There is also need for a Green Paper on the Health Services and my Department are currently preparing one.  It will be a major discussion document which will review the present state of the health services and attempt to measure the progress being made towards meeting our stated objectives.  It will highlight the major outstanding problems and discuss some options for further progress.  It is my intention that the Green Paper now in preparation will stimulate this debate. <Col N="1171" /> I hope to publish that document during the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start by making a brief comment on the gilt situation which arose on the Dublin Stock Exchange this morning.  I call on the Minister for Finance to have a pretty urgent look in the next 24 hours at the exchange control regulations governing the flow of funds out of this country.  While today's fall in the price of gilts from 100 to 90 prevented the sale of, on the Minister's own admission, over £900 million in gilts, it only postponed it and there is now a clear determination by the owners of those gilts in the next few days to effect the sale of the gilts, which seems to be a direct result of the bond-washing tax decision made by the Minister.  In the five or six days ahead it is absolutely crucial that any funds &mdash; and there is £900 million of it &mdash; which come out of those gilts are available for investment in other Irish industries and that they do not become attractive, for want of a more devious word, abroad in that seven- or eight-day period.  It is a pity that we did not get a full discussion on this in the form of a Private Notice Question.  It is one of the most significant financial developments in the past 12 months.  I make that call to the Minister for Finance to examine the exchange control regulations urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another effect under that heading is that it is quite clear that fewer and fewer people in the next 12 months will put their money into Government gilts, lending money to the Government.  While in one way that is not a bad thing in the sense that the Government's appetite for funds is so enormous that any diminution of it to some extent can only be welcome, if it means however that the Government are unable to get sufficient funds and have to borrow the difference abroad, then a greater proportion of next year's borrowing requirement, which is listed in this year's budget in the figures presented here yesterday, would have to be borrowed abroad above and beyond what was originally intended by the Minister. He indicated that he intended to borrow the bulk of it at home and I suggest that he will be unable to do that and will have <Col N="1172" /> to resort to foreign currency borrowing, which means probably dollars and Deutschemarks, and that could mean more exchange losses.  We had exchange losses last year of £810 million.  That is a one-off straight capital loss to the State of £810 million purely because of the strengthening of the dollar and the Deutschemark. That is the scale of money involved in foreign borrowing.  Therefore, while on the one hand I must applaud the Minister's attempt to prevent any type of tax evasion, at the same time one must be careful that the disease one sets out to cure is not made worse by trying to administer the cure.  That is one of the difficulties arising out of this gilt situation.  The main thing is that the Minister acts in the next few days to ensure that exchange control regulations can handle the sale of, I would predict, well over £1,000 million in gilts which cannot be locked in much longer.  They have been artificially locked in today.  They will not be artificially locked in next week, because naturally the price must come back and it will be possible to dispose of them.</P>
    <P>The strategy of this whole budget is decidely wrong, particularly at this time. At another time it might not necessarily be wrong.  It is wrong now because of the desperate state of unemployment.  Most of all it is a missed opportunity.  That is how I see that budget after I have thought about it since it was presented yesterday. The effort seems to be to delegate responsibility to other countries for promoting growth here at home.  Strong performance of our exports is being depended on to effect economic revival &mdash; in other words, the strength of major industrial countries is being depended on to lift our exports and to lead growth here.  Recovery is not being led internally. I do not subscribe to the view that growth can be led only externally, which seems to be the present strategy.  I am not asking for old-fashioned pump priming or for any kind of reckless increase in the deficit or any reckless borrowing.  I am against that, but I am asking for some positive proposals and policies to encourage and restore investment and employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> Responsibility seems to have been delegated also to the National Planning Board.  After two budgets no coherent plan has emerged for dealing with the macro-economic problems facing us.  The Government seem to have failed yesterday to use the budget as an instrument of economic policy which is one of the few instruments available to a Government in a small open economy.  In that regard it is very much a missed opportunity.</P>
    <P>Progress to restore national finances is a necessary and legitimate objective of budgetary policy.  Public spending must be kept under control or reduced because it has reached an unsustainable level. Policies to promote growth and reverse unemployment can and must be pursued concurrently if the public finances are not to be damaged further.  The Minister's view expressed in his speech yesterday is that recovery must await budget balancing. He may balance the budget and some progress may be made in that regard, but at such a high level of unemployment and low level of activity as to preclude any hope for the future.  It is a parallel task. Both objectives can and should be pursued concurrently and if implemented in that way they can be mutually reinforcing.</P>
    <P>This would establish a virtual circle of growth rather than the vicious circle in which the economy has trapped itself.  My core objection to this budget is that it fails to adopt the twin approach of encouraging industry and employment while seeking to reduce the deficit.  The Minister's approach sees a balanced budget as a precondition of economic growth and employment.  I do not see it that way and that is my central objection to the budget strategy which this Minister has decided on.  Both objectives can be pursued concurrently and one is not a precondition to the other.  The Minister seems to be saying that we can make no progress on revival until the budget deficit is sorted out.  The present approach will so reduce the level of those at work as to destroy the country's already narrow tax base, necessitating a great tax burden on this dwindling base.  If the Minister had made employment the thrust of his budget strategy he could get <Col N="1174" /> people back to work, broaden the tax base, save unemployment funds and stem the enormous appetite of the State for more and more tax receipts.  For this reason I conclude that the budget strategy is decidedly wrong and represents a missed opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement identified correctly the restoration of competitiveness in Irish industry as the crucial policy required now.  I support the Minister's analysis and diagnosis in that area. This is a central issue but, amazingly, the Minister proceeded to ignore this policy in the provisions of the budget.  Is it not a contradiction to state that the restoration of competitiveness is crucial and then go on to increase the employer's rate of PRSI by .4 per cent, to increase petrol and oil costs while Irish industry is still heavily dependent on oils and diesels, to put an 8 per cent tax on the clothing industry which is struggling to achieve competitiveness, to place higher taxes on the self-employed who appeal their assessments with consequent cash flow difficulties especially for small business, to tie down tax base lending which has been the backbone of the provision of equipment for many years in the private area and, to maintain and reintroduce ACT?  Those measures are a direct attack on competitiveness and that is why I say that the strategy in this budget is wrong.</P>
    <P>There has been some relief given but I believe it will be short lived because the loss of competitiveness will lead to further job losses and that situation in turn will lead to higher taxation.  In other words the relief being given now will be of no consequence shortly because of higher taxation.</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation has reached the stage where most independent economic commentators have run out of adjectives to describe the extent of it. The word used usually in this connection is &ldquo;frightening&rdquo;, but what is even more frightening is the lack of appreciation that as well as competitiveness this is the central key issue and difficulty in the economic policy of the State today.  On coming into Government the Coalition in their programme described the then <Col N="1175" /> unemployment level of 176,000 as disastrous. But we were told that there was no need for anxiety because short-term emergency measures would be taken to deal with the problem.  The effect of these measures on the totality of the crisis of unemployment can be described only as pitiful.  The much-heralded enterprise scheme which emanated from Barrettstown and which was projected to reach a figure of 500 people, would not even mop up one week's school leavers at the present rate.  One might say that this is a negative view but it is realistic.</P>
    <P>The kind of policies that should be introduced are ones that discriminate in favour of increasing employment content. That might not be the correct policy at another time but it is the policy we should be adopting now.  State enterprise generally should be geared to encouraging and increasing the employment content in existing industries.  That simply means that there should be discrimination in the tax code in favour of industries that employ people.  That is the sort of political decision that the Government should have taken but instead they chose not to avail of that opportunity.  I say this especially in the context of the hundreds of thousands of young people who are not being given an opportunity so far as this budget is concerned.</P>
    <P>Had the Government adopted a policy of reviving the economy, and I am not being political in any way on this, while at the same time bringing the budgetary figures under control, there could be jobs for perhaps another 20,000 or 30,000 people.  This would involve the re-evaluation of industrial incentives which have fostered capital-intensive methods of production in the past.  It would mean giving employers an incentive to increase employment.</P>
    <P>The role of Opposition is not merely to highlight deficiencies in Government policy. It is not just to be a watchdog but where possible to suggest and propose in a non-political way areas that the Government should examine.  While speaking in Killarney last week I took the opportunity of proposing that the PRSI level on industries in which there is a high <Col N="1176" /> employment content should be reduced. It does not make any sense to have a tax on jobs when the central role of economic policy is to overcome unemployment. Neither does it make sense that an employer should have to pay the same rate of PRSI in respect of every person he employs.  I described this situation last week as national suicide.  An employer pays as much in respect of the first person as he pays in respect of the twentieth or of the three hundredth person he employs.  That is a direct tax on employment and as such it is regressive.</P>
    <P>On the occasion I am speaking of I suggested that the Government think about this situation but I am disappointed that instead of indicating in the budget that the matter would be considered, they increased the employer's share of PRSI in respect of every person employed.  In our present circumstances and in a country in which there are so many young people why must we put a tax on jobs? Such an imposition encourages people to import machinery that will replace workers.  It accelerates the high technology growth that the whole world is dashing after madly.  Therefore, we are talking of a very sad policy.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that when an individual or a company employ more than a given number of people, say 20 or 30, the employer's PRSI contribution is reduced. Any employer today will ask why he should give more employment when to do so would involve him in the payment of more tax.  I am asking both parties who make up the Government to consider a scheme whereby the more people one employs, the less tax one pays.  Such a system would be eminently sensible and workable and would not result in financial loss because by more people being employed, more revenue accrues to the Exchequer by way of taxation.  Why should the Government, particularly when they consist of a strong Labour element, not insist that taxation policies be geared to providing jobs for young people?  I am not here today to complain. I am putting forward a proposal which I hope the Government will consider.</P>
    <P>That is one area in which I am trying to be positive, and another area is the <Col N="1177" /> adoption of the kind of policies that favour risk taking, not in its speculative but in its best sense.  We should endeavour to provide a suitable tax environment to encourage that kind of activity. I welcome the Minister's announcement in relation to the creation of venture capital funds.  This will enable people to invest in industry.  He should know that the UK figure is £35,000, that is, an individual can invest £35,000 in industry and can write that off against taxation provided he meets certain requirements.  In this connection I should like to mention a recent article published by the Bank of England in its bulletin.  It stated:</P>
    <P>Venture capital has made an important contribution to the United States economy and its recent emergence in the UK deserves careful nurturing. The most important determinant in the provision of venture capital is Government policy in the area of taxation.</P>
    <P>I noted in the Minister's statement that this might be confined to new manufacturing concerns.  Before he drafts the Finance Bill, I ask him not to miss the opportunity of extending it to existing manufacturing industry.  Does it make any sense to set up a new manufacturing industry under this scheme, where people are given tax relief, and perhaps next door an industry is struggling, is letting people go and is winding down because it is an &ldquo;old industry&rdquo;, meaning perhaps it is two or three years old?  I do not believe it would cost very much more to extend it to all manufacturing industry. In fact, is there not an argument, if funds are limited, for starting with existing industries in order to maintain our existing industrial base that needs investment badly?  The IDA will tell one that most of the small industries they have set up in the past four or five years have little or no capital.  Losses for one year mean that the company concerned is gone.  That is an indication of the fine balance that exists in this sector.  In drafting the Bill the Minister should be careful not to get locked into the idea of confining the measure to new manufacturing concerns. I welcome the step forward but one has <Col N="1178" /> to wait for the small print before one can be sure of the result.</P>
    <P>Employment must be the central key policy issue in the budget strategy.  An 8 per cent tax has been imposed on the clothing industry.  This will crush employment in a traditional labour-intensive industry that is under pressure to modernise and to resist the massive volume of cheap imports.  It is an industry that has fallen from 14,000 people in 1979 to 10,000 in 1983, a loss of 4,000 jobs.  Competitiveness means a daily struggle to stay afloat.  There are many companies in this sector that are very near the brink and many of them will see this VAT imposition as the final straw.  A fall-off in consumer demand will be inevitable and, sadly, it will encourage retailers to import low-cost merchandise to the detriment of the home-produced product.  It is a pity the Government made this decision because this is a labour-intensive industry and, as such, it bears more than its fair share of tax and that tax is mainly in the form of PRSI.  There are other industries that are less labour-intensive, that are highly capital-intensive, and they do not bear anything like the same rate of PRSI. In my view the entire PRSI system is a mess.  It does not promote employment but rather discourages it.  It has to be examined urgently before we tax ourselves out of the market completely.</P>
    <P>I realise the State needs funds but I do not think this is the most effective way to get money.  If a few companies are pushed over the brink and if more imports are allowed as a result of this decision, will it have been worth it just to get the tax base looking as though it had been spread?  I do not think it will be worth it.  It looks nice to spread the tax base and to include items that were exempt previously but I do not think it will be worth the effort. The Telesis Report said that import penetration in the clothing industry has risen from 30 per cent of the Irish market in 1973 to 60 per cent by 1980 and is now at 90 per cent in respect of men's clothing. The VAT imposition will probably increase that figure and it will encourage people to go for imports.</P>
    <P>Trade figures show we had a plus balance of trade of £6 million in 1973 in the <Col N="1179" /> clothing sector.  The latest figures which are in respect of 1979 show that figure has decreased to a deficit of £17 million and I think the situation has deteriorated further.  Last evening there was a rather emotional reaction but I shall put the matter more calmly today.  It is the women who will suffer by this decision because generally they have to manage household budgets.  I know the Minister for Finance takes the view that tax concessions have been given and that they will balance the impositions but is it not the case that once again he has transferred money from the wife to the husband? She will have to seek recoupment from her husband's extra tax allowance to pay the additional VAT.  In that respect is it not a discriminatory move? I think what the Minister proposed was untimely and insensitive.  In the figures I have given I hope I have convinced the Minister that his proposals are a threat to the viability of this labour-intensive industry.</P>
    <P>Taxation should be used as an instrument for promoting equity and increasing incentive.  I contrast the excellent treatise <Col N="1180" /> given by the Minister in the budget speech with the situation on the ground today after the budget.  Taxation imbalances have not been reduced, especially the burden on the PAYE sector.  The Government's net tax take will increase by some £300 million.  The 1983 outturn was £1,664 and the 1984 post-budget figure was £1,952, that is, an increase in tax take of £288 million directly from the PAYE sector.  What is surprising is that the Minister is managing to take more tax from fewer people because, by the Government's own admission, 30,000 fewer people are employed this year and some 25,000 fewer people will be employed next year.  That means that there is a heavier burden on many other people and on the broad mass of taxpayers. Otherwise the sums would not add up.  This point was put to the Minister on a number of occasions but the point has not been clarified.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>The cost of conducting local elections is borne by the individual local authorities and there is provision for sharing costs where the polls at county and urban elections are taken together.  The last occasion on which local elections were held on their own was 1974.  On the basis of information furnished by local authorities at the time it is estimated that the cost of separate local elections could be in the region of £1 million.</P>
      <P>Based on information available in relation to the combined European Parliament and local elections held in 1979 it may be estimated that the additional cost of holding local elections with the European Parliament elections would be in the region of £600,000.  It is emphasised that both estimates are tentative.</P>

      <P>The number of cases settled outside of court between the Revenue Commissioners and people found to be in possession of spirits smuggled from Northern Ireland during 1983 was 71.</P>
      <P>The number of retailers convicted during 1983 of dealing in uncustomed spirits from Northern Ireland was three. The charges were instituted under section 186 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, and an additional charge was instituted in one case for breach of the Land Frontier Regulations, 1968.  The fines imposed totalled £400.  The seized goods and conveyances used in each case were forfeited.  It has been decided to take proceedings against a further 33 retailers for Customs offences detected in 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures adopted to counter smuggling are kept under constant review to ensure their maximum effectiveness. During 1983, Customs resources in the land frontier area were re-deployed and extra mobile units were provided.  Special patrols were mounted in areas away from the Border to supplement the normal surveillance patrols.  About 200 seizures of uncustomed spirits imported from Northern Ireland were made in 1983 and in five of those cases the offender was arrested by Customs and charged with the offence.  Legal proceedings have been <Col N="1140" /> initiated or are being considered in many other cases.  It is not possible to estimate the value of spirits smuggled during the year.</P>
