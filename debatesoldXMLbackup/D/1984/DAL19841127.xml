      <P>The Government have recently decided that the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, should be generally accessible to the public and developed, with its grounds, as a major centre for culture and the arts.  The north wing will be retained as an exhibit in its own right and for temporary exhibitions. It will also be used by the State for some of its protocol functions.  It is intended that the bulk of the accommodation in the east, south and west wings will be allocated to the National Museum to be used as a display area for material from the National Museum's collections.  Any residual space may, at the discretion of the Taoiseach, be reserved for national cultural organisations considered to warrant State aid, or for the administrative staff of self-contained Government agencies or commissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister inform the House how much money has been spent on refurbishing the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham?  Was there not a decision at some stage by some Government to reconstruct the Royal Hospital as a location for meetings of EC committees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>My brief did not extend to a detailed examination of the costs involved in the restoration work.  I understand there are separate questions on the Order Paper about this.  It has been published fairly widely that the overall cost was in the region of £20 million.  I would not dispute the general accuracy of that figure.</P>
      <P>So far as the EC meetings are concerned there were many ideas about the possible use of Kilmainham advanced from 1970 onwards.  In August 1978 the concept considered by the then Government was the building of a conference hall complex in the grounds of the Royal Hospital with underground connection to the Royal Hospital itself.  The restoration work was to go on at the same time and the hospital building was to be used as ancillary to the general conference complex. That was the idea at that time.  An integral part of it was the building of a new conference hall complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision was taken subsequently in 1981 not to proceed with the conference hall.  When my committee began to examine the possible future use of the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham, the first thing we had to do was to see could the existing building accommodate the conference hall complex.  We consulted the Office of Public Works and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  At that time the Office of Public Works were making preparations for essential renovations in Dublin Castle.  We found that the conference hall complex could be accommodated there. We asked for a cost analysis and we found that, as between building the new conference hall complex in Kilmainham and establishing it in the extra room available in the castle, the cost would be substantially cheaper to provide it in the castle. I understand that is the position at the moment.  That was our examination of <Col N="649" /> the conference hall complex and the possible use of the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham for EC purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is satisfied that Civil Defence resources are adequate to deal with the consequences of a nuclear attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): There are so many uncertain factors in relation to nuclear warfare and its consequences would be so diverse and catastrophic that no one could regard any amount of resources as adequate to deal with the threat of nuclear attack.  Indeed, at or near a point of attack there is virtually <Col N="650" /> no prospect of protection against the effects of nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>The primary response to this worldwide threat must be action directed towards eliminating the risk that nuclear weapons will ever be used deliberately or otherwise.  In that regard successive Irish Governments have voiced their concern at the dangers inherent in the continued growth of nuclear armaments.  They have consistently pursued efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and to secure agreement on measures designed to reduce their number with a view to their eventual elimination.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have also seen the need to maintain a Civil Defence organisation for the purpose of mitigating the effects of any likely form of wartime threat on the civilian population.  It is considered that the most likely form of hazard is not direct attack on this country but radioactive fall-out caused by nuclear explosives elsewhere.  Civil Defence arrangements exist for warning the population, predicting and monitoring fall-out and advising the public regarding the steps necessary to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly what resources are provided for this purpose?  While accepting that the Government are taking what steps they can to avoid such a catastrophe, would the Minister of State not agree that all possible steps must, nonetheless, be taken to alleviate the consequences of any such attack?  In particular, how much money is spent for this purpose, how many staff are employed in dealing with it in the Department and does any liaison exist between the Departments of Defence, Health, Communications and Energy to deal with the consequences of such an attack, should it come?  We might be on the fringes of it, but it would have dire consequences for large sections of our population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a long question, but this is a diverse subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> Civil Defence planning does not rule out the possibility of direct nuclear strikes in this country.  However, these are regarded as a possibility rather than a probability. Against any such attack there is virtually no protective action which could be taken, even with unlimited resources, except evacuation if this were feasible. The concentration of Civil Defence effort is directed towards protection against what is regarded as the most likely hazard for this country &mdash; namely, radioactive fall-out.  The main components of the Civil Defence measures against the hazard of fall-out consist of a wartime warning and monitoring network.  We have, as the Deputy is probably aware, a booklet entitled <i>Bás Beatha</i> which gives advice with regard to how private dwellings could be protected to form a possible shelter in the event of fall-out.  We have a public information and advisory service.  This is directed by the Civil Defence branch of the Department of Defence.  The updated contents of <i>Bás Beatha</i> would provide the bulk of the information and advice to be conveyed.</P>
      <P>With regard to resources, the Civil Defence organisation, directed and controlled by the Department of Defence and staffed mainly by volunteer personnel enrolled in the local authority based Civil Defence units, are financed by a specific provision under the Defence Vote and contributions from local authorities at an aggregate cost of approximately £2 million per annum.  The main resources are personnel who are organised and trained to carry out a range of tasks particularly relevant to wartime emergency.  Except in relation to the fall-out hazard, the organisation have only very limited resources in terms of premises and equipment.  However, these are continuously under review and, as resources become available, every effort will be made to increase the facilities made available to Civil Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> Yes, there are contingency plans drawn up involving a number of Departments.  The personnel involved meet on a regular basis to update these plans.  I would also point out that the wartime warning and monitoring network is comprised of Department of Defence personnel, the Army Observer Corps and elements of the Garda Síochána, the Meterological Service, Irish Lights, RTE, certain local authority personnel and volunteer personnel of the Civil Defence warden service. It includes radiation protection, national, regional and county control centres with communication links and a broadcasting facility from the national control.  Its equipment includes radiation measurment instruments.  Also, the network is tested once a year through national fall-out exercises and I must say that these exercises have been performed very well to date in the various tests carried out.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> The Deputy will appreciate that for security reasons much of this information is not made public.  As a former Minister for Defence himself he will appreciate the reasons for that.  However, as I said earlier, in the event of a holocaust there are no adequate facilities available to cater for such a disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the publications that are available for members of the public, giving general information and advice on civil defence; and if such publications give detailed and comprehensive information <Col N="654" /> on the effects of nuclear fall-out and protective measures to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> The main publication is my Department's booklet, <i>Bás Beatha</i>, which is available to the public free of charge.  The booklet gives detailed and comprehensive information on the effects of nuclear fall-out and the protective measures to be taken against that hazard.  The published information can be supplemented by direct inquiry to the local Civil Defence organisation or, if necessary, to the Civil Defence branch of the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>In the near future it is intended to distribute to schools an information package on Civil Defence which will provide resource material to teachers who will be encouraged to include Civil Defence as a topic in the civics course for junior cycle pupils.  The contract for the production of the major part of this package has already been placed.</P>
      <P>The Department of Defence welcomes public interest in Civil Defence and I would suggest that the best possible way of becoming knowledgeable on these matters would be a period of enrolment in the Civil Defence volunteer organisation. In that regard, we ask every Member of the House to encourage members of the public to support and join the Civil Defence organisation, even for a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the date on which that booklet was published? Would the Minister of State agree that it warrants a new edition and updating? Would he not agree that it would warrant a wider circulation than it has at present? Would he consider making arrangements to have it circulated, at least to local authorities, residents' associations, tenants' associations and as large a number as possible of local groupings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i>
        <i>Bás Beatha</i> was originally issued in 1965 when approximately 700,000 copies were distributed. Further distributions were made in 1968 and 1972 to houses built since the previous issue.  In other words, the <Col N="655" /> previous issue was sent to every household. Copies are handed out to the public at various Civil Defence presentations throughout the country and are made available to individuals on request, free of charge.  The information contained in the booklet is still substantially correct. A review of the booklet which is being undertaken is aimed principally at providing a slightly expanded and more modern presentation of the information.</P>
      <P>There are various other options for spreading the essential information as and when circumstances demand, many of which would be more effective than presentation of the information again in booklet form.  The Deputy may be assured that the updated version of <i>Bás Beatha</i> will be made available as he has requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that his replies to this question and the previous one indicate a rather pathetic response to the dangers, slight though we hope they are, to the risk of a holocaust?  Surely he is not telling the House that a booklet on this subject which was published in 1965 could be in any way up to date or include an assessment of the risks and dangers involved in this situation at the end of 1984.  Would the Minister not agree also that it is entirely inadequate to say that the last distribution took place in 1972?  Would he not consider arranging a distribution now to all possible local groupings, to residents' and tenants' associations and so on?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> On my coming to office I asked for an updated version of <i>Bás Beatha</i> and that updating is being undertaken.  I accept that there should have been a review before now but I do not accept that the resources in the area of providing for a nuclear holocaust are pathetic.  No country has resources that would be adequate to deal with a holocaust caused by a nuclear attack.  As I have said before, this country has been to the forefront in trying to promote what successive Governments <Col N="656" /> have regarded as the ultimate solution to this problem, that is, total disarmament.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> In the meantime we can only deal with the realities. The probability is that if we were to suffer from a nuclear attack it would be by way of fall-out.  I am satisfied that every effort is being made on a continuous basis to update, to co-operate with other Departments and to ensure that every possible means is available to deal with fall-out should such a holocaust occur.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the ever growing public awareness of the seriousness of a nuclear holocaust, whether by way of fall-out or otherwise, and has he or the Department any proposals to promote Civil Defence by way of co-ordination with the various other voluntary organisations, many of which have units in the various towns and parishes throughout the country?</P>

Such bodies as the Order of Malta, the Irish Red Cross, St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland and so on co-operate extensively with Civil Defence in this area.

      <P>Pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, the Defence Forces give assistance to the Garda Síochána in protecting movements of cash.  The estimated additional costs, excluding pay, in respect of the Defence Forces of providing such assistance, which commenced in June, 1978, are as follows:&mdash; 1978 (six months), £138,000; 1979, £362,000; 1980, £557.000; 1981, £623,000; 1982, £894,000; 1983, £1,028,000; 1984 (six months), £688,000.</P>

      <P>Would it not be reasonable to expect the banking groups and security firms to make some contribution to the service?  Would the Minister agree also that it is not appropriate that taxpayers be called on to fund entirely the cost of providing this protection to these private enterprises which is in addition to the service provided by the Garda?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Military escorts for the movement of cash were introduced in June 1978 following an armed robbery. The escorts were provided by the Government of the day in the interest of national security, to stop large consignments of money falling into the hands of terrorist organisations.  These protective measures were not requested by the banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that consideration has been given to the question of such a request.  As I indicated to Deputy Taylor, the escorts are provided by the Government in the interest of national security.  The banks might very well say that between special levies and so on they are making to the Exchequer a contribution over and above that made by normal commercial firms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">

      <P>Is it not unfair and unjust that, while this service is provided for the banks, the ordinary businessman must take the risks involved in taking cash to a night safe after he has closed his business?  He, too, is paying his taxes.  I have a similar question to the Minister for Justice and he will be telling us the cost to his Department of providing Garda security for the banking groups. Therefore, taking the expenditure by both Departments in this area, we are <Col N="659" /> talking about a colossal amount of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Military escorts are provided only where there are very large sums of money in transit.  The Deputy must know that it would not be possible for the State to provide protection for every citizen in the matter of the lodgement of money in the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This service is provided also for many of the large security firms. Would the Minister not agree that, while the purpose of the Government in providing the protection may relate to national security, there is a substantial ancillary benefit for the banks and security firms concerned?  Therefore, would he not consider at least raising with them the question of achieving, on a voluntary basis, some contribution to the increasing and substantial cost to the taxpayer of providing this protection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The banks are not the cause, so to speak, of the escorts.  The cause is the presence of terrorist criminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The State has an obligation to ensure that terrorist organisations are not funded by way of moneys got from armed robberies.  That is an obligation that the State must discharge to all its citizens.  It would be unfair to penalise the banks who are providing commercial services as part of the general economy but who are the unwitting victims of a terrorist situation.  Security firms are the subject of military escorts but in cases where they are carrying cash to the banks.</P>

      <P>Planning has not been proceeding for the past ten years.  First of all, there was difficulty in site acquisition. The original site turned out to be unsuitable. Another site was obtained subsequently after some difficulty.  The original site was militarily undesirable and unsuitable. It was in a saucer surrounded by hills.  A suitable site was obtained subsequently.  There were title difficulties which have been resolved and the matter has been referred now to the technical people to start the drawings. We hope to make substantial progress and perhaps get to tender stage at the end of next year or thereabouts.</P>

      <P>In line with an arbitration award to certain grades in the Civil Service, the pay of all ranks up to and including commandant was revised at the end of 1983.  The increase, which varied from 4 per cent to 6 per cent depending on rank and service, is payable in three <Col N="667" /> instalments the second of which &mdash; amounting to approximately 2.5 per cent &mdash; is due to be paid from 1 December 1984.  Payment of the revised rates will be made as early as possible after the date.</P>
      <P>In so far as any increase under a 24th round is concerned, the 1984 budget made no provision for a general round increase for public servants.  With regard to 1985, I refer the Deputy to sections 7.20 and 7.21 of the national plan <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he has any plans to promote FCA officers, NCOs and privates on full-time service on the same basis as the PDF; if he agrees that an anomaly exists in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Officers, NCOs and privates for the Permanent Defence Force may be promoted to fill vacancies in the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force and promotions of members of the FCA, whether they are serving in a full-time capacity or not, are made to fill vacancies in the establishments of the FCA.  There are no plans to enable members of the FCA serving in a fulltime capacity to be promoted to fill vacancies in Permanent Defence Force establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that in July 1982, other ranks personnel of the FCA then serving in a fulltime capacity who were under 39 <Col N="668" /> years of age were given the option of enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force under more favourable conditions than would ordinarily apply.  In the event, a considerable number enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force and thus became eligible for promotion in the Permanent Defence Force in the normal way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree about the circumstances referred to in the reply, would the FCA personnel have to go back to the rank of private?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that at one time serving FCA personnel on full-time duty were offered the opportunity to come in on a full-time, permanent basis to the Permanent Defence Force.  I am suggesting that in those circumstance, for example, serving NCOs in the FCA would have to return to the rank of private in order to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that would be so. They would not be able to hold their FCA rank when they would enlist in the Permanent Defence Force.  That was known to them and did not inhibit them from joining.  They got full credit for pay purposes in respect of full-time service in the FCA and there was provision for a shortened potential NCO course.  There were certain advantages to members of the FCA coming into the Permanent Defence Force under that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that as the regulations are at the moment, for example, an FCA officer with the rank of lieutenant would have to serve an indefinite period before he would be promoted, whereas in effect a regular Army officer holding the same rank has a set period for promotion to, say, the rank of captain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree with the Deputy that that is the position, but they <Col N="669" /> are two different establishments with different promotion regimes.  In the Permanent Defence Force for lieutenants and captains there is a fixed period for promotion.  There is not such a fixed period for promotion in the FCA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am making.  Would the Minister agree that there is an anomaly there in view of the fact that two men are serving on a full-time basis with the same rank, one having to wait an indefinite period of promotion and the other having a fixed period, even though they are giving the same service, perhaps even in the same station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>A distinction is to be drawn between the two officers concerned. One is a member of the Permanent Defence Force and the other is on full-time duty as a member of the volunteer reserve forces and he is only a part-time officer, albeit on full-time duty for a part-time indefinite period.  Having regard to the ranks establishment of the FCA it is not possible to do what the Deputy implies.  I do not think that any hardship is caused or that there is any unrest or unease over the situation, because the person on full-time duty from the FCA is there entirely as a volunteer.</P>

      <P>An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil is a component of the Reserve Defence Force with conditions of service different from those of the Permanent Defence <Col N="670" /> Force.  Service in an fórsa is normally part-time and even when a member is on full-time service he is in a position which is fundamentally different from that of a member of the Permanent Defence Force.  In the circumstances it would not be appropriate to seek to apply to FCA personnel provisions similar to those in the Defence Forces pensions schemes which cater for the Permanent Defence Force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the £1 million grant announced by the Taoiseach for the development of an airport at Galway has not yet been expended and cannot be expended until suitable grounds are made available upon which such an airport could be built?  In view of the fact that this announcement was made since last year's budget would the Minister not agree that there is an urgency about this matter, that an early <Col N="672" /> decision would facilitate the development of a very necessary facility for the Galway area and that the further delay in this matter is hindering industrial growth in that area?</P>

      <P>I would like to see an early decision on this matter but, for fear the Deputy's supplementary question gives the impression that the failure to spend this money is somehow due to the Department of Defence, I should like to correct that impression.  The grant was announced on the basis that there was another airport complex available in Galway on which it would be spent and which would be suitable for development. Subsequently, it turned out that that was not the case.  That, of course, did not have anything to do with the Department of Defence.  When the first intentions, and the first plans, fell to the ground the promoters in Galway then looked to the Department of Defence property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 3 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960 all members of the Permanent Defence Force appointed or enlisted on or after the date of the passing of that Act &mdash; 21 December, 1960 &mdash; are liable for service outside the State with a contingent of the Permanent Defence <Col N="673" /> Force dispatched for service with an International United Nations Force. While it is policy to send volunteers on overseas service and in general there have been more than sufficient volunteers for such service, this does not exclude the possibility of members of the Permanent Defence Force being detailed to fill specific appointments.</P>
    <P>The selection of personnel for overseas service is left to the discretion of the military authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it has been the proud boast of the Irish Defence Forces that all their personnel serving under the UN flag in other countries do so on a volunteer basis?  Will the Minister agree that now, following the recent decision of the Minister, the use of the section in the 1960 Act to detail an officer to attend for duty with the UN Forces in the Lebanon is a retrograde step?  Will he agree that it is introducing a new element of compulsion into service under the UN flag for Irish Army personnel? Will the Minister agree that it is a pity this should have happened?  Would it not have been better for the Minister to have seen to it that this matter was dealt with in some other way so that we could have continued our proud boast that all our men served as volunteers in that great UN force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, indeed, be desirable that every single one of the personnel in the contingent would be a volunteer.  The exception has arisen in the case of a very small technical corps and where there is a limited number of men.  In order to spread the load evenly between this limited number it was necessary to detail some of those people who had not volunteered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why there is this shortage of some technical personnel which is resulting in such extreme pressures and personal inconveniences on them and their families?  If such an unsatisfactory position obtains in regard to technical officers is it not the <Col N="674" /> responsibility of the Minister to set about remedying it?  There are plenty of young technically qualified people who must seek employment outside the country and they would be very pleased to serve in the Defence Forces if the Minister opened up those positions to them rather than keeping the numbers down and putting unfair burdens on serving technical officers in some cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister be so satisfied when, as he is aware, the position obtains where medical personnel serving in the Defence Forces are being transferred on an annual and biannual basis?  Surely the Minister agrees that this is not satisfactory, that there is an obvious shortage of personnel and a need for immediate action on his part to stop the disgraceful constant transferring of medical doctors from one Command to another and from one post to another <Col N="676" /> throughout the country and, as we see now, to the Lebanon for second trips on a detailed compulsory basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The shortage of people in the Army Medical Corps has caused some difficulties but they are being obviated now by the introduction of new members.  I have some supplementary information in regard to this question to the effect that two doctors were appointed under a short service commission scheme in April this year and five more are expected to take up duty on 1 January 1985.  Those extra personnel will improve matters in the Corps.  To suggest, as the Deputy has, that there is a harsh or unfair regime is unfair to the Director and the senior officers of the Corps.  It is a small Corps and they have to work together.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general aspect of your statement, Sir, you agreed that the amount of time Private Notice Questions take is not relevant and I am surprised therefore that you found it necessary to mention it.  May I put to you this aspect of the matter: for a long time in this House Governments from both sides were faced with the exasperating situation where matters very much before the public mind which were causing <Col N="753" /> anxiety, worry or speculation, could not be raised here.  Subsequently it was my understanding and the understanding of most Deputies, that some latitude was given so that matters which were clearly in the public mind, even though they might not come within the strict literary definition in Standing Orders, were being allowed.  There is general dissatisfaction on all sides of the House and among the general public with the situation, because matters such as the Glenholme case, reports about State companies being in trouble with their bankers and matters of that sort, which were reported in the papers and discussed in detail on radio and television, cannot be raised here in any way.  It seems that you are going back to a restrictive, limiting attitude in regard to these matters.  I suggest that that is not in the best interests of the House.  Under the approach which has been here for more than a year now, a number of the questions put down today would have been allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No request or attempt has been made to alter Standing Orders to provide for the procedure Deputy Haughey suggests.  If Deputies wish to relax the rules and introduce a system which would allow various matters to be raised on the Order of Business which are not allowed at present, then Standing Orders should be changed. Since I came to this Chair I have stuck rather rigidly to Standing Orders and enforced them &mdash; I am not saying this in a carping way &mdash; with one possible exception which I can remember.  On that day Deputy Haughey was the very man who was on his feet to say that that was a precedent we would remember.  I said I would stick to Standing Orders and I have never departed from that since.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that you are not addressing yourself strictly to the point I am making?  I understand that a number of questions today and on a number of other occasions were ruled out of order by you on the question of urgency.  I do not think that is a widening <Col N="754" /> of a definition; it is a matter of interpretation by yourself or your advisers.  It is very much a matter of individual judgment and an awareness of the public mind as to whether a matter is urgent or not. It is on that ground more than anything else that I am making this submission. You are interpreting the urgency aspect in a much too narrow and limited fashion. For instance, without trying to reopen this Private Notice Question, may I say that the question of whether an Irish citizen, whether a wrongdoer or not might suddenly be spirited out of this jurisdiction is a matter of urgency?  On questions of that nature it is very much a matter of individual judgment and interpretation what is and what is not urgent.  In the interests of public feeling on these matters you should err, if necessary, on the side of a lenient interpretation of urgency.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that my interpretation of Standing Orders is in accordance with the interpretation put on them by my predecessors, and I am also satisfied that that is the correct interpretation.  I repeat &mdash; and I do not think it is unreasonable &mdash; that it would be impossible for me to preserve order in this House and to give satisfaction to everybody if I were to have a lax interpretation of this urgency rule.  I invite the Members, if they want to, to change the rules and I will implement them.</P>

However, the Chair refused that and there is no Standing Order to cover that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In such cases as Deputy Wilson mentioned, and in view of the fact that the question which Deputy Wilson has in mind might not be reached for a month or two, does that not lead to a different interpretation of the question of urgency?  If it were a matter that the question which Deputy Wilson has in mind about finances of State companies could be dealt with within a week that would be one thing but we are now faced with a situation where several State companies could have gone bankrupt before <Col N="756" /> Deputy Wilson's question on the Order Paper is reached.</P>

    <Title>Dentists Bill, 1984 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I referred to the fact that the new board will comprise 19 members and a refreshing factor was that the consumers will be represented.  I appeal to the Minister to consider including a member from the auxiliary dental workers group.  I know the Minister has the right to nominate four members and that he may include one of this group in his nomination but there is no guarantee of this.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the composition of the board and to include a member of the auxiliary dental workers group.  This would have a number of advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last week, dental hygiene has become a major factor in the practice of dentistry today, with the emphasis on preserving teeth rather than extracting them, as was the practice heretofore and I am very glad the modern dentist recognises this.  While there is a section in the Bill dealing with auxiliary dental workers there is no specific reference to dental hygiene and this is a major drawback in the Bill.  Many of the dentists to whom I spoke concerning this Bill told me this is <Col N="760" /> one area where we in Ireland are lacking. This is not through any fault of Fianna Fáil, if the Chair will forgive me for being partisan for a moment.  Our Leader, Deputy Haughey, when he was Minister for Health provided free tooth brushes for school-going children but unfortunately through ignorance at that time he was ridiculed in certain quarters.  His farsightedness and vision are only being recognised today.  The Minister should reconsider the whole question of dental hygienists and provide for their recognition and training in the service as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Many fears were expressed by dentists concerning the dental technicians, or to be more specific the whole area of denturists. I am glad this has been satisfactorily resolved in the Bill.  However, a deputation of technicians earlier this week made a request that a grandfather clause be included in the Bill which would guarantee some rights to those technicians who have been in practice for a number of years.  Deputy Keating referred to this matter also.  It has been done in the past in other Bills and I see no reason why we cannot do it again.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have about 1,000 dentists and about 200 dental technicians. The WHO state there should be at least two dentists to every technician.  This suggests we may have a shortage of technicians or a surplus of dentists.  If this is so, then it is likely they could provide the services that could be provided by technicians. With reference to the grandfather clause and the other requirements I mentioned last week, the Irish Association for Dental Prosthesis make the point that they have no desire to extract teeth, to fill them, to become involved in crowning or in bridging work or to get involved in the area of orthodontics.  All they want is to take impressions and to manufacture and fit dentures direct to the public.  I ask the Minister to look at this matter again and perhaps a satisfactory solution may be arrived at.</P>
    <P>At the moment through no fault of their own technicians do not have the training to provide anything other than a dentures service.  If they are to provide a <Col N="761" /> proper service and to be of benefit and assistance to dentists they will need proper education and training.  If the Minister is serious about this matter he must be prepared to provide money for the training and education of these people.  At the moment the more sophisticated auxiliary services are provided from abroad, from England in particular. That is wrong.  We should be in a position to have these facilities here.  The majority of our technicians have no experience in the treatment of conditions such as cleft palates, facial prosthesis following cancers and many other ailments.  They have no experience or training in the area of oral pathology.  There are about 120 conditions from the simple koplik spots suggesting measles to the more sinister mole representing a malignant melanoma. Dentists contend that at the moment only they have the experience to recognise and treat these conditions.  That may be so but we must provide training for auxiliary dental workers so that they too can recognise these conditions and refer them for treatment and correction.</P>
    <P>Another area that must be considered is that of orthodontics and oral surgery. There is an attempt in the Department to provide these services but unfortunately, either through lack of funding or properly trained personnel, the services are very slow in getting off the ground.  We will have a major problem in 1985 because these facilities and services are very expensive but if the Minister is serious about these matters funds will have to be made available.  Otherwise this will be but another example of pious platitudes, talking about what must be done but doing nothing about it.  I appeal to the Minister to make the funds available if he is really serious about this problem.</P>
    <P>In comparison with most other countries the percentage we spend on dental care is about 2 per cent of total expenditure on health care.  This compares with 11 per cent in Austria, 8 per cent in Denmark, 7 per cent in Norway and 5 per cent in the United Kingdom.  If we are going to provide the services necessary <Col N="762" /> for those people whom we are committed to help we will have to provide the necessary funds.  Otherwise all of this will be a load of rubbish.  At the moment we are committed to cater for 1.5 million people, if we take into account pre-school children, primary school children, adolescents and adults who have medical cards.  Because of lack of funds fewer than half of those people are receiving the treatment to which they are entitled and which they require.  We have a duty and responsibility to cater for them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, as do the members of my party.  I shall have more to say on this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the hand of dentists lies heavily across this Bill, far too heavily in my opinion.  The situation appears to be that the protection of the position of auxiliary dental workers and also the provision of a service for the public at a price that some of them can afford has not been covered adequately in the Bill.  From information given to me it appears that the auxiliaries and the denturists who have provided a substantial service to the people for many years have been by-passed.  I am told that in the discussion period leading to the formation of this Bill the denturists and their association were not even consulted. They were not called in for discussions and this Bill has been brought in over their heads which will have the effect, if passed in its present form, of copperfastening a monopoly in the hands of the dentists' profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear from reading the Bill that the new Dental Council to be set up will have a built-in majority of members of the dental profession and they will be in a position to control the situation absolutely.  They will be able to control the question of who will practise denturism and dental hygiene as well as the question of who will practise dentistry. This is a matter which goes to the root of the financial set up of the dental profession. The provision of dentures is the most lucrative side of the dental profession and they would be given under this Bill a monopoly to secure their financial <Col N="763" /> position entirely within their own control.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that in setting up a monopoly of this nature great care would have been necessary to safeguard other interested parties, firstly those denturists who have been in practice for many years and have achieved a great degree of knowledge and expertise and, secondly, the members of the public who have been provided with this service and the opportunity of obtaining dentures for themselves and their wives at a reasonable cost which they can afford.  A large proportion of married women are not covered for dentures under our social services scheme.  Pregnant women, whose teeth are particularly at risk, have to pay dentists' prices if they are to be furnished with this most essential and basic need.</P>
    <P>I understand there are approximately 250 denturists in practice here.  This is not something that arose today or yesterday.  It goes back for half a century and more during which they have been providing a fine service to the public.  No doubt there are black sheep among them as there are in every profession and trade, but I have no reason to suppose that their degree of professionalism is any less than that of the dentists.  There are black sheep among the medical, dental and, be it said, among the legal profession.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are going to tackle people who have been practising for ten, 20 or maybe 30 years earning their livelihood and performing a service.  The enactment of this legislation will turn these people into criminals and the practice of their profession will warrant a fine of £1,000 and 12 months imprisonment. That is ludicrous.  Technically speaking, until now the practice of denturism has been an offence and there have been a few cases of prosecutions in the District Court brought about through the <i>agent provocateur</i> method initiated by the Dental Board.  The district justices are very practical people and know the conditions under which people live and what the realities are.  They have given their verdict on these prosecutions and on the <Col N="764" /> challenge to the practice of the denturists. They have indicated their views by imposing token or nominal fines only.</P>
    <P>That is the verdict of the district justices on these <i>agent provocateur</i> prosecutions which have been brought on rare occasions.  I do not know whether a prosecution under the new legislation would in any way alter the opinion of the district justices.  I do not know what the existing penalty is but only a trifling amount has been imposed until now.  The fact that the penalty is extended here does not make it likely that the district justices will increase the penalties they impose.  Why should they?  There is an increase from £100 to £1,000 plus 12 months imprisonment. I know of no case under the existing legislation where the maximum penalty was imposed.  The usual is £5 or some other nominal sum.  I find reprehensible the whole concept of the <i>agent provocateur</i> prosecutions.  There may be difficulties in securing convictions in any other way but one could not be unduly proud of the practice of the Dental Board in setting up a person to trap these people in the practice of their profession.</P>
    <P>Some sectors of the dental profession have indicated their views on denturists. There have been suggestions about the role these people should play in the scheme of things.  In selling them into the hands of the dentists one must surely look at the stated intentions of the dentists <i>vis-à-vis</i> the denturists and dental hygienists. At the annual general meeting of the Irish Dental Association in Killarney the general secretary stated:</P>
    <P>Our view is that any auxiliary should be introduced only after a study is undertaken with regard to the necessity, the viability and the long-term effectiveness of such an auxiliary, who should complement the work of the dentist and not be seen as an alternative to the dentist.</P>
    <P>That, one may assume, is the stated view of the dental profession.  The general secretary presumably would cut off these people who have been earning their living in good faith while an examination was carried out as to their necessity, viability <Col N="765" /> and long-term effectiveness.  These matters would have to be examined before these 250 people would be allowed to continue.  That is an entirely untenable proposition.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there is a clear and definite role for the professions of denturists and dental hygienists in our scheme of health services.  It may well be that we must look at the nature of the training that should be provided for them.  If the Bill was aimed at setting out the parameters of the training that would be required, the number of years, the kind of training schools, tests and examinations that would be required, that would have been a major step forward.</P>
    <P>In my view a separate school should be provided, under AnCO or one of the other agencies, or in association with the Dental Hospital or whatever.  We should have provided for a separate school in which to train them in a proper manner. The control of this, in my view, should be not in the hands of the dentists.  They may control the dental profession but this is a distinct category and there should be a separate denturists and hygienists council which would organise the scope of the training and the examinations and select the technicians who would train in the schools.  Of course dental professors and extern lecturers and so on would be involved in this as a necessary and logical purpose of the arrangements.  However, to place such arrangements under the control of the very group to whose financial interest it is contrary is an entirely untenable proposition.</P>
    <P>Is it that there are more than enough dentists in the State to cope with all the dental work in a broad sense?  Is it that there are dentists going begging without work to do of a more specialised nature that they are qualified for?  The figures available show otherwise.  The World Health Organisation have indicated that to operate a reasonably adequate dental service requires one dentist for every 2,000 of the population &mdash; that is the WHO norm.  Our ratio is one dentist to every 3,500 people.  If the WHO norm were to be accepted it would mean that we have approximately only half the <Col N="766" /> number of dentists we require.  That being so, there is an enormous scope available for dental hygienists and denturists to deal with children's teeth and matters of that nature without the necessity of having a dentist.  Taking impressions of the mouths of adults which is being done already by denturists could be adequately undertaken by them in the future.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is provision in the Bill for the Minister to direct a scheme to be set up by which a register of denturists would be provided.  This would determine the training and qualifications necessary to put those people on the register.  That is fine as far as it goes, but it does not meet the basic objection I have to that provision in the Bill because, although the Bill at present gives the Minister power to direct the Dental Council to make a scheme, it does not give him the power to direct them what scheme to make, or the parameters of the scheme, the position being that if he directs them to make a scheme they could, and in my view might well bring in a scheme that would be so harsh and so difficult as effectively to rule out any reasonable working possibilities for auxiliary dental workers and could have the effect of removing from practice people who have been doing this work for decades.  It would be an entirely unacceptable position in my view.</P>
    <P>Possibly some arrangement can be made through which denturists would have some association with the dentists to cover the possibility referred to by Deputy Ormonde, through which a prescription from a dentist would be required to ensure that there would be an inspection by a dentist, at least as an interim measure until the extent of a training scheme for denturists could be developed that would enable them to have the training that would be desirable and that would enable them on examining a mouth to see if there were conditions in it that would require more specialised investigation by the medical profession or somebody else.</P>
    <P>All in all, this Bill in my view gives too much control to the dentists.  I am afraid <Col N="767" /> it goes overboard in that direction by loading the Dental Council with members of the dental profession with no provision for membership by any auxiliary organisation.  The Bill places complete control of the denturists in the hands of the dentists which is in conflict with them from the financial point of view.  That is untenable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this measure which is designed to provide for the establishment of a Dental Council which shall provide for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of dentistry and the persons engaged in such practice and to provide for the repeal of the Dentists Act, 1928, and the Dentists (Amendment) Act, 1983, and to provide for other matters connected therewith.  It is right that we should amend the Acts referred to and provide for proper control, education and proficiency in the profession of dentistry and all associated with it.  My main concern is that we do not have enough dentists to meet our needs. We have approximately only one dentist for every 3,500 persons.  This lack is particularly evident in health boards who have very long waiting lists for dental people and whose priority is to properly look after the needs of children.  Many adults and especially older people must also wait interminably for dental treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the primary reasons for the long waiting lists and the inordinate delays involved are the embargo on recruitment to the public service and the row which has been going on for some years past between the Minister and his Department and the health boards in respect of fees for dentists.  It is nothing less than a tragedy that the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement between our health boards and the dentists in the private sector has broken down.  That arrangement was invaluable. When local clinics under the aegis of health boards were unable to cope with the work load, medical card holders could be transferred for treatment to dentists <Col N="768" /> in the private area.  This facility was much availed of.</P>
    <P>Since the breakdown in the negotiations between the dentists' organisation and the health boards, we have had a colossal increase in the number of people awaiting dental treatment.  It is a national scandal that on the one hand we have an embargo on recruitment to the public service, which includes the health boards, and a breakdown in the negotiations between the health boards and the private dentists on the other hand.  The unfortunate patient suffers, the long-suffering patient.  I want to impress upon the Minister the urgency and the importance of finalising the negotiations and getting back to the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement whereby medical card holders could go to private dentists for treatment.  This arrangement must be restored as a matter of great urgency.</P>
    <P>I know of no good grounds for applying the embargo on recruitment rigorously in this area.  It is intrinsically wrong that people should have to suffer for so long before securing an essential service of this kind because of problems of this nature.  The Minister should face up to them.  The health boards should be enabled to recruit the necessary staff. The dental profession ought to acknowledge their obligation to the public at large and come to a speedy settlement with the Department of Health.  Money alone should not be the criterion.  They have an obligation to their profession to serve the public in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In the main it is the medical card holder, a member of the most underprivileged section of our community, who is suffering most of all under these handicaps. At least people with social welfare insurance may go to the dentist of their choice.  They have some prospect of getting treatment.  The medical card holder must wait the longest and seemingly no one cares about that person.  When the Minister is replying I look forward to hearing a statement from him that he is concerned about the problem of the arrears of work accruing in the health <Col N="769" /> board areas, the need to secure the services of the private dentists and, if necessary, to provide the additional people required to service this area.</P>
    <P>I share the sentiments expressed by my colleague Deputy Taylor concerning the auxiliary dental service.  I am concerned about the position of the auxiliary as he is called, the dental hygienist, the dental mechanic and the dental technician.  I would welcome an explanation from the Minister as to how he differentiates between the various categories referred to in this Bill.  I am concerned primarily about the position of the dental mechanics or technicians.  Some of these people are resident in my constituency.  They are highly qualified people.  Many of them come from family firms, so to speak. Their fathers and their grandfathers have been engaged in this craft, this profession, for years.  They are highly qualified and they have been providing dentures for the general public and the dentists in the area down through the years.</P>
    <P>Their craftsmanship and expertise are acknowledged by all concerned.  It is disconcerting in the extreme to realise that they are not provided for in this proposed Bill.  Despite the number of years they have been operating successfully it seems that they are now expected to go back to school, as it were, to learn their trade.  Is this the position? If so, it is preposterous to suggest that a dental mechanic or technician of proven skill and ability, and with long service to the public and to the profession, should be asked to go back to school before he will be registered by this new board.</P>
    <P>One must appreciate that in the main these people are self-employed.  They may not be insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  They have to provide for their own retirement.  It is a preposterous suggestion that they should be asked to abandon their way of life for a period of time and to neglect their wives, families and homes and go back to school or college and go through the motions of proving to somebody that they are skilled dental technicians.  This is an area which has to be cleared up effectively.</P>
    <P>I should like to see enshrined in the <Col N="770" /> Bill proper conditions of employment, salary scales, superannuation.  We should provide a grant-aid for educational pursuits for all those engaged in the profession. The position of the dentists' surgery assistants has to be provided for.  There must be some 900 of these in this State and they must not be forgotten.  The role of the dental hygienist must be regarded as of vital importance and an adjunct to any dentist in carrying out tests, cleaning and polishing teeth.  In the instruction of patients in the matter of preventive care and dental hygiene, of health and education generally, the role of the dental hygienist is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>I should like to see appropriate scholarships provided so as to enable young people to engage in this profession.  Quite recently a young lady who wished to be a dental hygienist had to go to England to be suitably trained.  No scholarship or State aid of any kind was available to her here.  That is a shame.  I should like to see this Bill improved to cover that kind of situation.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister's mind is not closed when it comes to providing for recognition for the dental mechanic or technician to whom many of us have adverted in this House.  These categories are recognised in many other countries. There is no reason why they should not be recognised here.  Denmark, Australia, the USA and many other countries recognise the intrinsic work of the dental mechanic and they are provided for in legislation and given an appropriate place on the boards governing dental treatment in the countries to which I refer.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say that the auxiliaries, dental mechanics and others referred to here would be catered for adequately under certain committees which may be established under this Bill. That is not adequate for the situation. They are, as I said, highly experienced technicians, master craftsmen who are properly trained and fully appreciated by the profession in which they work.  It seems that any who have served, for, say, seven years as technicians or craftsmen should be recognised under this Bill and an appropriate amendment must be <Col N="771" /> made along those lines.  It would be the height of injustice to exclude them from this Bill or to show total disdain and disregard for their services to the dental profession and their long years of experience. This would be patently unjust.  The suggestion that they should go back again to school is an affront and an insult to these categories of workers.  That is a provision that is quite understandable in respect of future requirements, future training, future standards that should apply, but it must not be invoked against the existing technicians, of whom there are upwards of 300 in this country, three of whom I know in my constituency.  If their workmanship is acceptable to the public and the dental profession it should surely be acceptable to the Minister and his Department.  For those of us who have read the Bill and are familiar with the people in question and the work they perform, their honour and their integrity, it is a matter of astonishment that these categories are not being properly provided for under this Bill.  It was not done in the Seanad, but it must be done in this House.</P>
    <P>I observe, too, that there is no place for these auxiliary workers, these technicians on the board.  The Minister has the power to nominate some persons to that board and I am lending my support to the many other Deputies who have told the Minister that when it comes to appointing the people whom he has the right to appoint he must not forget the technicians.  They must have an honourable place on this board.  They must not be subordinate to the dentists or to any of the vested interests in the profession.  They have a right to be heard and a right to their proper place in the profession and this must be conceded under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The unfairness and disregard of these technicians has been acknowledged in recent years, especially by the Restrictive Practices Commission, who came down very definitely on the side of the technicians. The Minister has had some regard to this decision, but the essential features of the recommendation have been ignored. A monopoly has been existent in this <Col N="772" /> matter for a long number of years.  The Restrictive Practices Commission have said so.  They have made recommendations and the Minister has a bounden obligation to have regard to the salient features of that report.</P>
    <P>While the Restrictive Practices Commission recommend that any penal prohibition such as a £100 fine should be abolished, I observe that the Minister for Health, without giving any real justification, has increased that fine to £1,000 and has actually provided for a 12 month's jail sentence for anyone who deviates from the regulations laid down under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Technicians welcome the opportunity to be acknowledged and legalised under this Bill.  They want to play their proper role.  They are entitled to their proper status.  I am pleading for them in this House on that basis.  I express the hope that suitable amendments will be made to this Bill.  One of the amendments that I should like to see made is in respect of the position of the technicians.  Any of these who have served for seven years should be recognised and registered. They should be given representation on the board.  Up to now the Minister has not been inclined to do that.  He did not respond to the request in that regard in the Seanad.  However, I hope he will realise the justification for such a provision and make the necessary amendment while the Bill is going through this House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the various salient features of the Bill.  It is only right that a profession such as the dental profession be structured properly, be efficient and be operating to the highest standards possible.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by adverting again to the great need for more dentists.  We must have more dentists if we are to be able to provide the necessary dental treatment for our people and especially for the poorer sections.  I appeal to the Minister to bring about an end to the infernal row that has been going on with the dental profession for far too long. This dispute is all about money and it is in total disregard of those thousands of people who are waiting for treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> Because of it many in the older age groups will go to their eternal reward, not only without natural teeth but without dentures.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister also to have regard to his responsibility in the area of social welfare and to extend dental treatment to the wives and families of insured persons.  It is not good enough that that aspect of dental treatment be confined to the one member of the family who happens to be insured under the social welfare code.  We must have regard to the family unit and extend the services to spouses and children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which comes to us from the Seanad where it was debated extensively.  One of the points that emerged frequently during that debate was that the first dental board were established in 1928, that is 56 years ago.  After such a long time it is appropriate that we should be setting up a new Dental Council to take account of changes in our society.  One of the great hopes for the future in terms of dental care is that people should be able to retain their natural teeth instead of having to wear dentures, particularly badly fitting ones, as is so often the case now.  One of the memories of my childhood was that so many people in middle age had only few teeth in their heads, and if they were lucky, had dentures.</P>
      <P>We have moved a long way since then. The main improvements have come about by way of the flouridation of water and of increasing emphasis on dental care.</P>

    <P>I would be very concerned about people living in remote rural areas particularly, first, because of water in those areas not containing flouride and, secondly, because of the inadequacy of community dental services.  As has been pointed out, there are not enough dentists or auxiliary dental workers to allow equal opportunity of access to dental services. Those in the more remote areas are likely to be discriminated against to an even greater extent than are those in <Col N="774" /> the more populated urban areas, though even in those urban areas there are long waiting lists for dental treatment, some of which is very urgent.</P>
    <P>The other group who have been the greatest victims of the lack of dental care have been women in the home, women who give up the opportunity of economic independence and of making their own social welfare contributions.  I speak not only of those who are wives and mothers and who work in the home but also of another group who are among the least acknowledged in terms of the amount of valuable work they do.  I refer to those who stay at home to look after parents or other elderly relatives.  These women often have very little economic support and are not able to pay the high fees charged by dentists.  When we are talking about broadening and updating the dental council, we might realise the scandal it is that so many women do not have access to dental care even by way of the social welfare contributions of their husbands.  Regarding those single women to whom I have referred, the State should credit them with social welfare contributions by way of acknowledging the contribution they make by looking after their elderly parents or other relatives at home.  In that way they would be eligible in their own right for dental treatment.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a former Minister for Health commissioned a survey in regard to dental health and it was no surprise to many of us to learn from that survey that mothers had the greatest incidence of tooth decay of any other group.  During pregnancy and then as nursing mothers women are at high risk in terms of dental care.  In addition, as is well known, mothers put themselves last in the family in terms of priority for dental or any other care.  When it is a case of either buying a child a pair of shoes or paying a visit to the dentist for herself a mother always comes last.  We have taken advantage of that kind of self-sacrifice and generosity to the detriment of women.  If we want to acknowledge the value of the work of women in the house and of parenting, we had better put our money where our <Col N="775" /> mouth is and redress this grave discrimination hopefully in the next budget.</P>
    <P>This Bill attempts to establish a register to ensure the training and so on of dentists. What we should be considering is how effectively we can use the resources we have.  We do not have a high enough standard of dental care in the sense that we cannot look after everybody from childhood to elderly adulthood.  Dentists undergo a long and costly training.  Often poor families are not able to afford or allow their children to take up dentistry on account of the high cost of training.  It also costs the taxpayer a lot of money.  If we had the right kind of flexibility and acknowledgement of the skills of the members of each of the structures within dental care, we could more effectively use the investment we are making in the training of dentists at present.  There is a big problem in that when young men and women are trained as dentists they find there is no job here for them.</P>
    <P>We should look at investing more money through health boards in two ways.  One is by giving an attractive salary for dentists to work through community care and with the health boards.  At present dentists generally seek to work in totally private practice or else they emigrate.  That is a huge loss to the country. Not only do we lose the money we spent on training them but we lose their talent.  Health boards might consider subsidising students in their own areas and guarantee them employment with an attractive salary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been done in certain health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be done on a wider scale.  There is also the question of dentists being able to work permanently on a part time basis.  We have problems regarding part time workers because they are not assured of full remuneration on a part time basis and so on.  Dentists are often over burdened with work and that is because they attempt to carry out all the treatment themselves.  There are other groups of people who with proper training could take over some of the work <Col N="776" /> of dentists.  A register could be set up of people with the proper expertise and experience.  For instance, mention has already been made of auxiliary dental workers.  I will not repeat what Deputies Taylor and Treacy have said.  Denturists who have been practising here for many years have expertise and experience which cannot be overlooked or devalued. We all agree that a longer term of training for denturists would be acceptable.  We must, however, take account of those who have been operating on a level which has been acceptable to dentists and to the public.  I will not labour that point because it has already been made and I am sure that we will come back to it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There is another group, and we have not taken their role very seriously.  I have had several discussions with them.  I refer to dental assistants.  They are usually women.  They are a support service to the dentist.  They usually prepare the instruments and help with regard to the welfare of the patient particularly after dental treatment.  Through their work they have become quite expert in the area of dental hygiene and dental care.  I know that many of them would like a defined training structure to be set up so that they can move on from the limbo in which they find themselves now, in which they are not recognised or well paid, into an area where they would be trained as dental hygienists.  As Deputy Treacy said, anyone who wishes to do that now has to go abroad to be trained.  Surely training could be given immediately to people who wish to avail of it.  They already have the expertise and experience though it is not recognised.  A structure of dental hygienists could be set up which would relieve a lot of the day to day work of dentists and allow them do the work for which they were trained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such people could be employed to go to schools, particularly to primary schools, and give a course on dental hygiene and detect teeth which are in need of treatment before they get to a stage where that treatment becomes costly.  In terms of cost benefit alone this is something we should be thinking about for <Col N="777" /> sheer efficiency.  We would also instil in young people a health programme which may mean we could cut down drastically on the need for dental care.  If we concentrate on ensuring that the council when it is set up would have these as its first tasks, then we would be addressing problems which should have been addressed a long time ago.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a Dental Council and I ask, as other Deputies will ask, that we will have different levels of expertise and training &mdash; denturists, dental workers, dental technicians, hygienists and so on &mdash; represented on that council and that the council will be seen as representing the entire area of dental care and not just the area of the expertise of the dentists themselves.  Therefore on Committee Stage I hope to come back to that kind of representation on the Dental Council.  It is important that we have consumer representation on the council, that the people getting the service would have some input into how it is working.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I hope that on the Dental Council and the various committees set up under it the dentists will not set themselves up as an expert or elite group.  I would worry in case dental care would be concentrated in separate areas.  I recognise the high expertise in orthodontic treatment, but it would be a pity and could end up being incredibly costly if only certain dentists were trained to operate in the area of orthodontic treatment, bridge building and so on.  I know it is expert and that not everybody would have the talent or the wish to operate in that field, but if only a small number of dentists are doing this there would not be sufficient access on a national scale for people needing such care, it might become expensive and elitist and only people with a large amount of money could afford to avail of it.</P>
    <P>I conclude with a heartfelt cry that the whole area of orthodontics would be contemplated at an early stage.  This area concentrates very much on structural difficulties that can affect not alone the teeth <Col N="778" /> and appearance but also speech and confidence. It would worry all Deputies if that very expert, exclusive area become so restricted that people on low incomes or medical cards would need to be in a very bad way before they would be accepted for this treatment and, therefore, grow up suffering from the psychological effects of needing it, believing it to be completely outside their range.  We must face the fact that at the moment as a nation we have not really offered equality of opportunity and access to all the people of the nation that would ensure that all have the same standard of oral hygiene and dental care.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of this council and I hope that it will include the representation that I and other Deputies seek. Above all, I ask that the resources be made available for the effective use of the talent and expertise already available.  We should ensure that no person, living no matter where in Ireland, irrespective of age or circumstances&mdash;and I am thinking of the discriminatory position of women in the home in this regard &mdash; would be left without the fullest, best and most expert dental care needed, not as a matter of privilege but as a matter of right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief contribution.  The Minister in his Second Stage speech asked that the House would not comment on the services available to the public.  I will try to observe that request but it is difficult to comment on certain sections of the Bill without touching on it.  For instance, the section which allows for consumer representation on the new dentists' board seems to be very much needed, and I recall proposing this in the 1983 legislation when that was going through the House.  Married women in particular should be represented on this dental board.  The way married women are treated is nothing short of a scandal; and if the argument is that sufficient funds are not available to admit all the housewives, surely husbands and wives could take it on a rotation basis.  At least 50 per cent of the treatment could go to the housewives, or some <Col N="779" /> system could be worked out.  As things stand many mothers of young children who are struggling to make ends meet are very concerned about dental hygiene and are not in a position to pay for what to them is very expensive dental work. Their husbands in many cases because of their stamps are entitled to claim for themselves in this.  If it is proposed to include in this Bill representation for consumers, then I suggest that the sort of consumer we are talking about is the housewife.  Absolute injustice is being perpetrated against the housewife and this has been the case for a considerable time.  If we must argue that extension of the benefit would be too expensive, then let us find a solution.  Perhaps either husband or wife could opt to avail of the scheme, both could opt for 50 per cent of the cost, or 50 per cent of the State cost in this area would go to the housewives and 50 per cent to the married men.  It is unfair that the present situation should continue.  I hope that the Minister would include housewives in order that voice would be given to the injustices which many housewives quite justifiably feel.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on dental technicians and their right to manufacture dentures without the involvement of a dentist.  It seems that this would be quite justified.  We seem to have a great propensity for involving doctors in the supplying of non-medical contraceptives and so on.  Dentures have been made by dental technicians for many years and in most cases there is no reason whatsoever why the dentist need be involved.  I agree with the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission.  I tend to accept that there should be freedom in this area but I am prepared to accept the Government's decision on the second recommendation in the commission's report that it should be confined to denturists and to where living tissue is not involved.  In such areas generally where there is no medical involvement there is no need to involve either a doctor or a dentist.  I agree also with the second suggestion and I look forward to that being incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to express my concern at <Col N="780" /> the lack of availability in the Eastern Health Board area of orthodontists to treat children.  Many children have problems with the growth of teeth and need special treatment under the care of an orthodontist.  However, there is a long waiting list for such treatment.  As far as I am aware there is a vacancy for an orthodontist in the Eastern Health Board area.  The dental structure of many children will be destroyed for the rest of their lives because they cannot get attention from an orthodontist.  It is all very well for those who can afford to go privately to an orthodontist to have the teeth of their children beautified but many children of working class and middle class homes will not get such treatment because the parents of such children cannot afford that treatment.  In fact, they cannot make ends meet.  It is wrong that something that may affect the lives of those children later is not treated.  It is possible that because they cannot get that treatment they will have dental problems for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the proposed examination and regulation of the dental profession it is not forgotten that the whole purpose of this procedure is to ensure that dentistry is available for the people in a regulated way.  We are fooling ourselves if we think that by setting up boards to set standards we will be dealing with the problem when there is no follow up and no standards are being observed in regard to the teeth of many children of lower income families.</P>
    <P>In giving the board a role in the regulation of the profession of dentistry the Minister should ask them to look at regular intervals at the programme of fluoridation.  There was a protracted debate on that topic almost 20 years ago but there has not been much discussion on it since.  It would be a useful exercise for the new board to monitor fluoridation on a regular basis to ensure that the policy being pursued is the correct one.  The fact that a decision was made 20 years ago after a long court case does not mean that we should accept that it was the right one for all time.  We must ensure that those <Col N="781" /> who are professionally competent to review the whole question of dental hygiene have as part of their terms of reference the ability to examine the entire area of dental health including the question of water fluoridation to ensure that the levels are correct and that the policy being pursued is correct.  The board should be given that type of independence and authority.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it will have a speedy passage through the House.  I hope the Minister will be able to facilitate the many housewives on whose behalf I spoke some months ago.  I am delighted that there will be consumer representation and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the consumer is a housewife.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill and I agree that the changing trends in dentistry over recent years necessitates this type of legislation.  The main thrust of the Bill is the setting up of a Dental Council to replace the Dental Board and to run parallel with the recently appointed Medical Council.  It appears that it will be the duty of the Dental Council to regulate under and post-graduate education and to provide for recognition and registration of dental specialists and auxiliary dentists.  The Bill is useful.  The concept of control of a profession by the profession is good provided it is balanced by adequate community participation and that there is a process that facilitates citizens in making and getting due process in relation to serious complaints that may arise from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note with satisfaction that the council will consist of 19 members as distinct from the nine members on the existing board.  The increased role of the council in the education and training of dentists is welcome also.  As a member of the Eastern Health Board I am aware of the huge demands being made on the dental service by young people.  It is regrettable that the Minister has not seen fit to appoint a dentist who is employed by a health board to the council.  The Eastern Health Board employ the largest number of dentists but because we do not have dental <Col N="782" /> hygienists we are obliged to ask fully trained dentists to carry out duties that should be carried out by auxiliaries.  That is a waste of time and expensive expertise. I suggest that a representation of two out of the 19 members of the council is hardly adequate to reflect the public interest especially when one considers the heavy public cost in education and the big number of dentists employed by the health boards.  The Minister said that it will be his duty to nominate four members to the council and I appeal to him to include in that number a dentist to represent health board interests.  The two to be appointed to represent the interests of the public should be elected representatives who at the end of the day must account for their actions to the electorate.</P>
    <P>I agree that the primary function of the Dental Council is to regulate the profession and not deliver a dental service.  That is understandable but it would be unreasonable to suggest that there will be a balanced representation if there is not some representation of the auxiliary dental workers.  It could be argued that one person among 19 will not make much of an impact but it would be better than not having any representative at all on the council.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, before the 1928 Act dental technicians were permitted to supply dentures direct to the public.  That Act unjustly took that right from them. When this, and other facts, were presented to the Restrictive Practices Commission inquiry in 1982 the commission recommended that non-dentists should be permitted to provide dentures to persons over 18 years so long as this work did not involve work on living tissue.  It is important that we take note of that recommendation.  It should also be noted that a dental technician must spend four years in full time training while a dental student spends only 13 per cent of his training time learning the same skills. That begs the question: who is better equipped to provide dentures, a dentist or a dental technician?</P>
    <P>The commission also considered the law in relation to dental technicians who <Col N="783" /> have obtained a recognised technical qualification at advanced level and who have undergone a period of clinical training. The commission considered the possibility of such people being considered competent to provide dentures direct to the public.  The subject of denturism has been well debated and there are very few who have any doubt about the advisability of making allowances for this indentifiable category of people who have been providing a very valuable service.</P>
    <P>The commission suggested that if denturism were to be introduced to Ireland it should be under the regulations which the Minister for Health may make from time to time adding that such a flexible formula leaves open the possibility of a separate form of qualification being designed for existing illegal practitioners. When introducing the Dentists Bill in 1984 the Minister for Health indicated that he would adopt the recommendations of the Restrictive Practices Commission. I believe the Minister will do us all a service if he adheres to that commitment. This Bill says the Minister will allow at a later date future incumbents of the office of the Minister for Health, to make provision for such a category.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The commission suggested that regulations in regard to dentists should be made by the Minister for Health, but in this Bill the Minister has left these regulations to the Dental Council, the membership of which is comprised largely of dentists. One does not have to stretch one's imagination too far to see that they will not be too anxious to do away with a lucrative business.  I had a very interesting experience in this area earlier this year.  I took an 83 year old man who had broken his dentures to the representative of the Eastern Health Board and was told it would take ten days to make the dentures at a cost of £240.  Because this man could not wait so long I took him to a dental technician.  He provided the service within two days at a cost of £40.  Since the Minister is so anxious to make economies it behoves him to take a long hard look at what is happening in this area.  If <Col N="784" /> we could save £200 on a set of dentures by going to a dental technician, it would not be reasonable to believe that the Dental Council will be anxious to let the dental auxiliaries become involved in this area.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city we have been very fortunate in the service provided by the dentists and technicians.  It would be a retrograde step if the Minister introduced this Bill but neglected the wellbeing of the people who provide this auxiliary service by putting their livelihood in jeopardy. I am sure that is not the Minister's intention but I ask him to reconsider this matter, to put one of these people on the board and give those providing this auxiliary service a proper standing under this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to establish a fitness to practise committee but it does not give a member of the public who may have a complaint the right to be heard by the committee or the council.  The evidence to the council from the committee can only be presented by persons with the <i>imprimatur</i> of the fitness to practise committee and only when a decision to hold an inquiry is made has the citizen the right to be heard.  That is not good enough.  Here we have a council made up entirely of dentists, and not unnaturally they will have a bias to protect their own. A person with a just complaint but without the resources to employ counsel will be left at the mercy of the fitness to practise committee as to whether they will be heard.  That is a serious matter and I ask the Minister to look at it.  To date the Medical Council have not fulfilled the role in relation to the medical profession which was suggested in the legislation passed here.  To my knowledge that legislation has not made it any easier for the public to have their complaints heard.  They are still handicapped by the rigid constraints of the profession.  We do not want that to happen again in the Dentists Bill.</P>
    <P>A great deal of what I wanted to say has already been said and I will not repeat it.  I ask the Minister to consider the appointment of dental auxiliaries, the recognition of denturists involved in the <Col N="785" /> profession and to look at the protection the public need.  He should also consider appointing public representatives to this board.  In recent times the Minister appointed two people to represent the public on hospital and other boards, and I ask him in this instance to consider appointing a person who has a mandate from the people to represent them.  I have no doubt that the Minister will take note of all that is said by every speaker and I look forward to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I have not been able to hear all the speeches which have been made so far, except for Deputy Taylor, Deputy Ormonde and the latter part of Deputy Glenn's speech.  They referred to some of the points I wanted to make dealing with dental technicians and dental surgery assistants which this Bill does not adequately cater for.</P>
      <P>On the face of it the Bill does not seem to do what the Minister claims, that is, updating the 1928 Act and being very progressive.  The definitions section says that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;practice of dentistry&rdquo; means the performance of any operation and the giving of any treatment, advice, opinion or attendance which is usually performed or given by a dentist and includes the performance of any operation or the giving of any treatment, advice or attendance on or to any person preparatory to, for the purpose of or in connection with, the fitting, insertion, or fixing of artificial teeth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is how the practice of dentistry is described in the Bill.  It goes on to establish a council of dentists whose members will be appointed by the Minister and all except two can be dentists.  Two people are to be consumers and this could include dentists as they get treatment for their teeth also, but let us assume that they are two lay people.  The ministerial appointments could be a dentist, as on the last council, and people from the training area could be professors, etc., in dentistry colleges and they probably will <Col N="786" /> be.  There will be seven elected dentists so there could be 17 dentists on this council and two lay people.</P>
    <P>They are making all the decisions and will have power under the Bill in regard to the practice of dentistry which is explained as I outlined it.  Everything is covered, even the question of advice. Dental hygienists and anything regarding the fixing, fitting and insertion of artificial teeth is covered in the practice of dentistry. Anybody who does not conform to the council's rules and regulations can be fined £1,000 or imprisoned for 12 months. This is an extraordinary insertion in the Bill for those who practise dentistry in the broader sense but who are not dentists.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are about 200 dental technicians who are very experienced and provide artificial teeth just as opticians supply glasses.  One does not have to go to a medical doctor to get glasses and the examination of eyes is far more important than supplying artificial teeth.  The Medical Council do not attempt to control every area of medicine, including opticians, but the dentists are given overall control.  Radiographers, midwives, physiotherapists and opticians are not covered by the Medical Council. In the field of dentistry there are dental technicians, dental nurses, surgery assistants, etc., but they do not have these titles in this country.  In many cases they are simply described as clerks or receptionists but they are graded in other countries. There are dental surgery assistants, dental health education nurses, dental hygienists and therapists, etc., but the dentists here simply employ a receptionist straight from school to do little bits and pieces and eventually she is doing many of the things which in Britain would be done by a dental surgery assistant with a particular grade and salary.  They are exposed to mercury and X-rays.  They are not educated in regard to these matters and have no idea of the dangers or toxicity of the materials.  They are totally untrained but they are still called receptionists or clerks and paid a pittance.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister really think that a dental board consisting entirely of dentists or totally controlled by dentists will <Col N="787" /> alter the conditions of employment for their receptionists or clerks?  They will not give them a title although the Minister gives them power to do so under section 8 of the Bill.  The dentists have fought for 50 years to control practices in their profession.  Prior to the 1928 Act dental technicians were allowed to operate and the dentists lobbied for the 1928 Act to make that practice illegal.  This Bill ensures that only dentists can decide who will do what and they must be employed by them.  They will make all the decisions in regard to dental practice.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think that this is a progressive Bill which radically changes the 1928 Act?  The dental council should deal with professionally trained dentists. I do not have to describe what a dentist is but in the Bill it could mean only dentists and not dental auxiliary workers. That description is the first thing the Minister should alter.  He should set up a dental council for dentists.  The other area can be controlled by the Minister in the same way as areas of medicine are controlled or decontrolled as the Restrictive Practices Commission recommended. They gave two alternatives, one was that there should be no restriction on the supply of dentures direct to persons of 18 years of age and over provided it did not involve work done on living tissue.  The second alternative was that the 1928 Dentists Act should be amended to provide that the general prohibition on the carrying on of dentistry by a non-dentist should not apply to the provision of dentures by a denturist to a person of 18 years of age or over provided that it did not involve work done on living tissue.  The commission came down in favour of the first recommendation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill has been drafted in such a way as to permit the implementation of the principle of the second alternative of the Restrictive Practices Commission.  In other words the new Dental Council can do this if they so wish.  After 50 years of restrictive practices in the dental trade, which is the most notorious in the country, does anybody think that they will alter the <Col N="788" /> situation?  The Minister will have to have the guts to alter it himself and prevent dentists from having control of dental assistants.  That is the major point I want to make on the Bill and many speakers have mentioned particular cases but there are others, such as dental nurses in the Eastern Health Board who, when they work for dentists, are only clerks.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to alter the 1928 Act now is the time for him to do so. Now is the time to remove the monopoly from dentists in the whole area of trade and in matters relating to dental practice. On Committee Stage I shall ask the Minister to take certain action.  The major item will be alteration of his description of the practice of dentistry as relating to the Dental Council where they will deal only with qualified dentists. Alterations will have to be made in sections 49, 50 and 51.  These deal with the practice of dentistry and provide for a fine of £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is one we have been waiting for for a long time and I should like to pay tribute to those responsible for introducing it to this House.  The Minister deserves praise for this reforming Bill.  In the Seanad he was not adverse to accepting worthwhile amendments and the Bill before this House has been fined down considerably. I should like to praise in particular Deputy O'Brien for his work following the report of the joint commission that had been set up by Deputy Haughey.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us will deal with the situation existing in the late eighties.  The establishment of the new and broader Dental Council is a step forward even though it does not meet all the criteria of Deputies.  Deputy Glenn wanted public representatives to be on the board.  The Minister might look again at the whole question of membership and the numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dental profession must have an element of control on a council that will be responsible for the behaviour of dentists in their practice but also for the preparation and education of dentists. Sufficient attention has not been given to <Col N="789" /> the matter of oral hygiene.  Speakers in this debate have referred to the lack of dentists when one considers the large numbers of people who require their services. Some Members have said there are just enough dentists to look after two-thirds of the children who require dental care.  In that regard the use of resources must be questioned.  Since 1977 approximately £2,000 million has been given to the health boards.  They have recruited many staff and in some sections they are over-manned.  The health boards should ensure that children are cared for adequately.</P>
    <P>The Minister has set up a Dental Council that will direct the education of those who want to become dentists.  Account should also be taken of those people who run health boards.  In some areas the health boards have not been able to give adequate cover in respect of dental services. In addition to the 500,000 children requiring dental care, some 600,000 adults are eligible and there are also the elderly and the old.  The service given to this section in respect of oral hygiene is very limited and the lack of this service can have a severe effect on the personality of the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the matter of orthodontics.  Children whose teeth need attention in this regard must be looked after at an early age.  Parents are often reluctant to continue sending their children to different clinics if they consider that the officer in charge is not prepared to do the necessary extensive work.  However, the younger dentists are more adventurous.  I urge the new council to have regard to the most up-to-date practices in orthodontics and in dental care generally.  In the Mid-Western Health Board area the number of young dentists setting up practice is an indication of the confidence they have in the economy of the area.  I hear nothing but praise for these people and as a profession they can hold their heads high. Deputies receive many complaints about malpractices in other professions but I have not heard any such complaint about dentists.</P>
    <P>However, there is a conflict between <Col N="790" /> what has been known up to now as dental mechanics and the practice of dentistry exclusively by dentists.  The dental mechanic was hired by the dentist.  In this Bill the Minister makes reference to auxiliary dental workers.  He is recognising the skills of these people and that is a progressive move.  Some other speakers said that the Minister has not gone far enough but in matters dealing with health I wonder if the Minister would have been responsible if he had given wide powers to auxiliary dental workers?  I do not think the general public would accept it.  They would expect that the highest standards would prevail.  Dental mechanics are excluded from the provisions of this Bill. These people are already in practice and they have been giving a service for many years.  I ask the Minister to consider their position following the passage of this Bill. In my county there are three auxiliary dental officers.  They have been practising for some time and have worked in association with groups of dentists.  They have done their work well.  Under the new Bill they have the chance to work for the dentists but there is also the possibility that they might want to establish on their own.  I wonder whether they are being restricted under this Bill in so doing.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill. When he decided to bring it forward he recognised the work that had been done by the commission and by the former Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Fergus O'Brien.  I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Members who have contributed to the debate on the Dentists Bill.  The Bill was initiated in Seanad Éireann and it received a fairly thorough going over in that House before it came into the Dáil. Many amendments to the Bill were tabled in the Seanad and quite a number of them are now incorporated in the Bill. As a result the Bill as it now stands is largely non-controversial and this is reflected in the tone of the debate which it has generated in this House.  There have been no demands to have the Bill <Col N="791" /> altered drastically but some questions have been asked and clarification has been sought on a number of points.  I will try to deal with those points to the satisfaction of Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon asked why the Bill does not specify a particular time period within which the Dental Council must be established following the passing of the Bill.  As he himself pointed out, the provisions for establishment of the Dental Council contained in the Bill follow the normal practice &mdash; the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, and the new Nurses Bill have similar provisions in relation to the establishment of the regulatory bodies set up under them.  As the Deputy pointed out, there are many factors which could result in a specific target date for the establishment of the Dental Council not being achieved.  However, it just happens that without its being written into the Bill there is a target date to be met for the establishment of the new Dental Council.  Deputy O'Hanlon will be aware that the Dental Board had its term of office extended by two years in order to maintain continuity of office between the Dental Board and Dental Council.  One of those years has already gone by so that it is not necessary to set a date for the new Dental Council to come into existence because the two year extension expires in 1985.</P>
      <P>On the question of representation for auxiliary dental workers on the new Dental Council, the Minister has already indicated that there is nothing to prevent him from including a representative of auxiliary dental workers among his four nominees to the new council.  There have been a number of suggestions from Deputies as to whom should or should not be included.  The Minister would need more than four nominees to satisfy all the Deputies who have spoken.  Deputy Ormonde spoke about this problem. Deputy G. Mitchell said that housewives should be represented because of the problems they encounter in not being covered for dental services.  Deputy Alice Glenn indicated that there should be a public representative on the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> Deputy O'Hanlon queried the power of the Minister to alter by regulations the composition of the Dental Council.  He said he did not see why the Minister should have the power to alter something which the Houses of the Oireachtas, following full consideration, had agreed to. It is important that there should be provision in the Bill for altering the composition of the council because circumstances can change quite rapidly, particularly in this day and age.  What may appear to be perfectly reasonable in 1984 could within a very short time become totally inappropriate to meet the conditions then prevailing. On the question of the Minister's powers to vary the composition of the Dental Council, there are adequate safeguards in the Bill.  Under section 9(3) it will be noted that regulations made by the Minister to vary the composition of the council must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and resolutions approving them must be passed by each House.</P>
    <P>On the question of the function in dental education of the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board when the new Dental Council assumes responsibility for the postgraduate education of dentists, this is something that was raised and dealt with in some depth in Seanad Éireann when the Bill was at Report Stage in that House.  Basically the Dental Council will have responsibility for setting standards for postgraduate education in dentistry while the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board will promote and co-ordinate the putting into effect of those standards. As well as education towards the attaining of higher qualifications, postgraduate education also embraces the continuing education of dentists so that they may maintain their competence. This is an area also in which the Postgraduate Board will continue to have their separate function.</P>
    <P>On the question of reciprocal arrangements between this country and countries abroad for the recognition of dental qualifications and their acceptance for registration purposes, there is provision for such reciprocation under the 1928 Dentists Act.  However, no formal <Col N="793" /> reciprocal arrangements were in fact ever entered into.  Deputy O'Hanlon mentioned Australia specifically.  Australian dentists have always had access to the British Dental Register by virtue of Australia's Commonwealth status and, consequently, under the 1928 Act they would have had access to registration here.  On the other hand Irish dentists, though not having a similar entitlement to registration in Australia, generally have no problem in getting on the register there.  However, the different states that make up Australia each have their own registers and conditions can vary between one state and another.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon queried the need for section 25 (f) which permits the council to charge a fee for the issue of a certificate of registration to a dentist.  I am not entirely sure what the Deputy is querying here &mdash; the necessity for issuing such a certificate at all or whether a fee should be charged for its issue.  Section 26 (3) sets out that a certificate of registration be issued to each registered dentist.  Section 26 (4) lays down that the certificate must be displayed by the dentist at the place where he practices dentistry.  This is considered to be a necessary provision and it would obviously have no meaning if the issue of a certificate was not mandatory in the first place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of fees charged by the council &mdash; and this is something which Deputy Keating raised also &mdash; it should be noted that the Dental Council, like all regulatory bodies of this sort, is intended to be self-funding.  Its main source of income will be fees charged to dentists for registration services. The Minister has indicated that if after a period of, say, two or three years operation it became clear that the council had funding difficulties, then the question of some grant-in-aid money for the council could be considered.  However, as things stand, no allowance has been made for the provision of Exchequer funds for this purpose.  The Minister for Finance would <Col N="794" /> of course have to be consulted in such an event.</P>
      <P>On the question of notification of the erasure of a dentist's name from the register to the dentist's employer, if he is an employee, as well as to the Minister, this is unnecessary and would not be altogether practicable in many instances.  The Dental Council will not have up-to-the-minute information on the employment of all the dentists on the register and dentists do tend to move about quite a bit, particularly in the earlier part of their careers.  In any event the erasure of a dentist's name from the register in a country such as ours would scarcely go unnoticed by those connected with the profession.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon asked if it would be possible under the new legislation to establish a class of dental auxiliary workers who could extract teeth.  The short answer to that question is yes.  The Dental Council, with the consent of the Minister, may establish classes of auxiliary dental workers who may undertake such class of dental work as shall be specified by the council.  The council shall determine the type of dental work these auxiliaries may undertake and the conditions in which it may be undertaken.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon was wondering if the Bill as drafted will permit the fitting of dentures by non-dentists since it involves work on gums which he regards as living tissue and would therefore be excluded under section 54 (3).  This is a matter which has been gone into in some depth and the Minister is satisfied, following legal advice on the matter, that the fitting of false teeth does not actually involve working on the gums, which are of course living tissue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies O'Hanlon, N. Treacy and others touched on the dental services themselves and spoke about the manpower problem which we have in the public dental service, particularly in their own constituencies.  The problem in Deputy O'Hanlon's area is that dentists cannot be enticed into taking up full-time posts with the health board.  Perhaps the <Col N="795" /> recently announced pay award for dentists in the health board service will help to solve that problem in Deputy O'Hanlon's constituency as well as in other areas where a similar problem exists.</P>
    <P>The problem in Dublin is somewhat different.  No doubt additional dentists could be recruited into the health board service if the number of dentist posts could be increased.  However, the embargo on the creation of additional posts in the public service prevents any increase in dental manpower at present. The situation in Lucan, which Deputy O'Hanlon referred to specifically, and about which Deputy Durkan spoke to me, should show an improvement now that the health board have increased the number of clinic days in the local dental surgery from two per week to three per week.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies that preventive care offers the best prospects in the long term.  The value of the fluoridation of our water supplies is already pretty well established but it is expected to be proven beyond doubt when results of the national survey of children's dental health carried out earlier this year are available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating expressed his concern on the question of regulation of professions generally and, in relation to this particular Bill, at the number of instances in which functions of the Dental Council will be subject to the approval of the Minister.  He said that the tendency in some countries is towards de-regulation of professions.  I am aware of developments in some other countries to make some of the regulations governing certain professions less restrictive &mdash; for instance the restrictions on advertising have been relaxed in some instances.  However, I am not aware of any instances of the total de-regulation of a profession and certainly not dentistry.  I think the Deputy will find upon looking into the specific provisions of the Bill that in all instances when the approval of the Minister is required there is a reason for it.  It may be for the protection of the public, members of the dental profession or perhaps <Col N="796" /> auxiliary dental workers.  In fact there was one amendment carried on Report Stage in Seanad Éireann, following representations to the Minister from the Dental Board, which deleted the requirement for the Dental Council to have the approval of the Minister in the matter of how they would dispose of any surplus funds they might have.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in certain areas, particularly in relation to the disciplinary powers of the council, the wording of the Bill appears cumbersome, and is repetitive in relation to different types of offences.  However, I can assure Deputy Keating that the format is absolutely necessary if the powers of the council, in relation to discipline are not to be successfully challenged on constitutional grounds.  It is necessary that the provisions should stand up in law if the Bill is to provide adequate protection for the general public and for members of the profession.  The Bill provides in so far as possible for the profession of dentistry being self-regulatory but State involvement of necessity arises in certain areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating said that some professional associations have a reputation for protecting their members rather than giving any degree of satisfaction to members of the public who make complaints against them.  In the case of the dental profession I would imagine &mdash; though I am not aware of any such incidents personally &mdash; that there must have been occasions where members of the public felt that their complaints to the Dental Board about individual dentists did not result in any positive response.  What the general public in all probability did not know was that under the 1928 Act the only disciplinary power open to the Dental Board was erasure of a dentist's name from the register.  Obviously the great majority of complaints, even if upheld, would not warrant this drastic measure and what happened, therefore, was that no action could be taken by the board and the complainant had to be informed accordingly.</P>
    <P>This new Bill will rectify the situation by providing also for a number of lesser <Col N="797" /> penalties than erasure from the register. The new Dental Council with their additional disciplinary powers will be in a position to demonstrate to the public that they are as willing to protect their interests as they are those of the members of the profession and I have no doubt that they will not hesitate to do so.</P>
    <P>On the question of enforcement of the provisions of the Bill, Deputy Keating said that this could be difficult.  I am afraid I do not share his pessimism.  The enforcing authority in nearly all instances, backed up by the necessary legislative provisions, will be the Dental Council.  The Dental Board were quite successful in enforcing the provisions of the 1928 Act and in those areas where enforcement might have appeared to be lax this was due to the inadequacy of the legislation rather than any reluctance on the part of the board to carry out their statutory functions.  I have no doubt that the Dental Council will be quite effective in enforcing the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Though there is specific provision for only two representatives of consumer interests on the Dental Council the Minister will have four nominees and there would be nothing to prevent him increasing the consumer representation if he thought fit.</P>
    <P>I dealt with this a little earlier and referred to the various expressions of opinion by Deputies in regard to who should and who should not be members of the council.  Deputy Glenn was in favour of having public representatives on the council because of their public accountability.  I am sure that when the Minister will be making appointments he will take all these expressions into consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating said it might be desirable to have some form of rolling membership of the council rather than have a complete change of membership every five years.  While on the face of it this would appear to be the case, what is likely to happen is that on every new council there will be a number of members of the outgoing council.  This is possible by <Col N="798" /> virtue of the fact that members may serve for two periods of office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating mentioned the desirability of communication between the council and the public by way of regular reports.  In fact, there was an amendment to the Bill in Seanad Éireann as a result of which the council will be obliged to publish an annual report.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor and others thought it was necessary to clarify the situation in relation to the position of dental mechanics. Deputy Keating mentioned a figure of some 250 dental mechanics whose livelihoods may be put in jeopardy due to the powers of the new Dental Council. This is not the case.  The great majority of dental mechanics have nothing to fear. It is only the small number who are operating illegally at present in supplying dentures direct to the public who fear the increased penalties contained in the Bill for the illegal practice of dentistry.</P>
    <P>The penalties in existence at present have not been updated over the years and are totally inadequate.  Incidentally, these penalties are not aimed specifically at any particular group.  It is perfectly understandable that there should be penalties for the illegal practice of dentistry. The fitting and insertion of artifical teeth is within the definition of the practice of dentistry.  There is provision in the Bill for the establishment of a class of auxiliary dental workers who will be fully qualified and competent to supply dentures direct to persons of 18 years of age and over provided it does not involve work on living tissue.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Restrictive Practices Commission came up with a recommendation that the supply of dentures to persons of 18 years of age and over should be subject to no restrictions whatsoever. Dental mechanics would have had no more right to supply dentures under this recommendation than any other members of the public.  The fact of the matter is that the Government decided that to create a free-for-all situation in relation to the supply of dentures would not be in the interests of the general public. Instead they opted for the implementation of the alternative option put forward <Col N="799" /> by the Restrictive Practices Commission which was for the introduction of trained denturists.  This is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Dental Council will determine the training and qualifications for entry to this new class of auxiliary workers.  The council could, perhaps, make some concessions to those who are practising illegally at present and have been doing so for a number of years, but it is extremely unlikely that all those who are working as dental mechanics at present will be given automatic entry to the new class. The council will have to satisfy itself as to the competency of all persons who are permitted to supply dentures direct to the public.</P>
    <P>A number of other matters were raised.  Deputy Mac Giolla was of the opinion that the Bill did not mean very much and that the new council will have no teeth by virtue of the fact that it will be totally controlled by dentists.  That is not so.  Section 55 states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, by order, in any case where he considers the establishment of a particular class of auxiliary dental worker to be desirable, direct the Council to exercise the powers vested in it under section 53 of this Act to make a scheme for the establishment of such a class and, in any case where the Minister considers it desirable, he may, by order, direct the Council to make a scheme for the establishment of a particular class for a limited period in order that the value to the public of the existence of that class may be judged and the Council shall comply with any such direction.</P>
    <P>Section 15 states:</P>
    <P>If the Council fails, neglects or refuses to perform any function assigned to it under this Act, the Minister may, by order, direct the Council to discharge that function and for that purpose to do such other matters or things ancillary or incidental thereto as may be specified in the order.</P>
    <P>In actual fact the Minister can discharge the council.  Deputies suggested that it <Col N="800" /> was necessary to establish some class of dental hygienists.  It is most likely that this will be done by the council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred to the poor ratio of dentists to the population. Various figures for other countries were quoted.  I should like to clarify one matter.  There is no international recognised ratio of dentists to the population. The ratio of dentists to the population in an area would depend on the health status of the population which would, in turn, depend on a number of factors such as whether the water supply was flouridated, the type of diet followed and the level of oral hygiene practised by the people in the area.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Deputies for their contributions. If they are not totally satisfied with my reply or with the Bill they will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to put down amendments.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to contribute towards the better organisation and development of the potato sector primarily by improving the quality of domestic supplies of potatoes reaching the market place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potato industry in this country is not well organised.  The distribution system from the producer to the retailer is not very orderly.  Marketing tends to consist of individual efforts by producers, packers, merchants, etc.  Adequate facilities for storing, grading, packing and processing of potatoes do not exist.  A survey carried out by the Department of Agriculture last year showed that less than 50 per cent of the potato crop had adequate facilities.  This inevitably results in losses <Col N="801" /> and wastage which can be avoided.  The potato industry is also characterised by considerable fluctuations in supplies from one year to another.  A year of short supply and high prices is often followed by a year of excess supply and poor prices. Even within a season where there is a reasonable equilibrium between supply and demand there is often oversupply early in the season and a shortfall towards the end of the season.  Some of the more extreme fluctuations can be reduced considerably if the sector becomes more rationalised and orderly.</P>
    <P>The consequences of these weaknesses in the potato industry are obvious.  High quality, well-presented potatoes and potato products from other member states gain inroads into the domestic market.  In fact £25 million worth of potatoes and potato products were imported in 1982.  We can replace these imports with obvious benefits to the country but some developments in the sector are required if this is to be achieved.  It should not be forgotten that we have many advantages which can help to organise and develop the industry.  Many areas in the country have excellent soils and climatic conditions for potato production. High quality home grown certified seed is readily available and the control, research and advisory services of the Department of Agriculture, An Foras Talúntais and ACOT are readily available to producers.  The proximity of domestic markets is a major advantage. ACOT have put a man specifically in charge of the horticultural scene.</P>
    <P>The absence of international competition was a major factor for the relative under-development of the potato sector. Inter-Community free trade followed implementation of the EC plant health directive in 1980.  Before that, our producers enjoyed the protection of our own domestic market.  They now face the full rigours of EC competition and the industry must adapt to this at production, distribution, marketing and processing levels.  Failure to make the sector more efficient and competitive will inevitably <Col N="802" /> lead to further growth in the supplies of foreign potatoes and potato products.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation and development of the industry is primarily a matter for the commercial forces which operate in the sector.  But the Government can help by providing conditions and promoting a climate wherein the sector can ultimately compete more efficiently and effectively. In this connection, the State is providing financial aid towards the development of a national potato co-operative.  The task of establishing the national co-operative was undertaken by the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society (ICOS) in conjunction with the Irish Farmers' Association. I understand that 12 regional potato producer co-operatives have been set up and these form the constituent bodies of the national co-operative.  Much remains to be done by the co-operative.  It will be endeavouring to get the fullest support from the regional co-operatives by way of channelling their entire output through the co-operative.  I understand the co-operative will be looking into the local and regional needs in terms of grading, handling, packing and storing facilities.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to grant-aid available under an EC regulation on the marketing and processing of agricultural products.  Under this scheme, grant-aid may be obtained from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA) towards the cost of certain approved projects which are aimed at improving structural efficiency in the processing and marketing of agricultural products in the Community.</P>
    <P>Successful applicants must have the approval of the member state, which must contribute a minimum national grant of 8 per cent of the cost of the project and 16 per cent for projects located in the disadvantaged areas of the west of Ireland in order to attract the maximum level of EC grant which amounts to 25 per cent and 50 per cent in disadvantaged areas.  On-farm production projects involving modernisation, rationalisation or development of individual farms are not eligible for consideration under the FEOGA Projects Scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> Nowadays in the market place, product presentation is becoming increasingly important.  In this connection, I would urge producers to pay particular attention to the selection of potato varieties which have good storage quality and which look attractive to shoppers.</P>
    <P>From experiences which I have had recently this point of view is confirmed. For far too long we have been starting out in the fields growing something in the hope that the customer will purchase the product.  What we should have been doing is starting in the supermarkets, finding out why the housewife buys one product and rejects another and then taking the process from there.  It was quite clear to me that the price is not the factor in the determination of the purchases.  It is the presentation of the product, how they look.  The Heinz company proved that the housewife's decision making is 75 per cent on visual presentation. The product must be 100 per cent edible.  There must be no waste or rotting. The shops which have started offering to housewives the facility of choosing their own potatoes from the tray have proved this point.  It has been a tremendous success even though from those trays the potatoes were one and half times as expensive as the packaged potatoes.</P>
    <P>The registration requirements as proposed in the Bill together with the co-operative structure I have referred to can provide an overall framework to promote the achievement of greater development, efficiency and competitiveness which the sector requires.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House provides for a system of registration of all who grow ware potatoes for sale and of all who pack potatoes.  It will be illegal to sell potatoes other than those grown by a registered grower, or to sell packaged potatoes other than those packed by a registered packer.  A packer or a grower who packs will be required to show his or her registered number on the pack.  About 80 per cent of the trade in 25 kg packs is met by growers who are also packers.  The proposed registration system will facilitate trace back of substandard potatoes <Col N="804" /> through the sales chain, as middlemen will be required to put their names and addresses, or other approved identification on the packs.  This will make it easier to take appropriate action with those who pack poor quality potatoes.  It will also encourage the collection and dissemination of information regarding acreage planted, varieties etc.  The enactment of this legislation will not solve all the problems associated with the industry.  It will be no substitute for the action that is required by the commercial sector.  But it will help to provide a better framework and promote greater discipline in the chain from producer to retailer.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a few points, for the information of the House.  We do not regard prosecution as the ultimate.  We hope, through our ACOT advice, the setting up of the co-operatives and assimilation of literature from all Departments, to be able to advise people as to the right course of action, the standards which are needed and how to get people to do their business in a business like way. As Members are probably aware, we have had regular meetings both with packers' and growers' representatives.</P>
    <P>The significant thing about this legislation is that it is not something emanating from this Department.  It is legislation which was asked for by the growers and the packers.  That would indicate that they would like to travel down this road of discipline.  They fully realise that they are in a tough scene.  In a year in which there will be surplus potatoes in the Netherlands or elsewhere, these countries will try to put their surplus on the Irish market.  That happened in the winter of 1982-83, leading to this legislation. Farmers here were dumping potatoes into the sea at that time.</P>
    <P>We are having discussions with our colleagues in the IFA and in our own Department.  It would appear, as I said, that the presentation of the potatoes is very important.  As a matter of fact, housewives bought a very inferior Dutch potato because it was very well presented and well prepared.  We are very fortunate that we have a very thorough seed breeding <Col N="805" /> programme, resulting in some very excellent varieties, that of Cara in particular. One which is being very much promoted at the moment, especially with the processor in mind and which also looks very well on the shelves is the Pentland Dell.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, it is important that the product should look well, taste well and keep well.  This latter is probably the greatest hurdle to be faced by the growers &mdash; the question of storage.  That is the key to success.  At this time of year it is easy enough to have good potatoes but in February and March you get problems with the imports.  It is at that stage that storage is necessary.  That is why the co-operative is very important.  Groups of people will get together to do a proper job of storage.  Without proper storage, we cannot compete on an all year round basis.</P>
    <P>If there are any points which any Member would like to raise, I shall do my best to respond.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I welcome the Bill.  As the Minister points out, it will not provide the answers to all the problems of the potato industry but it should go some way towards tackling the serious problems that have arisen.  I hope in the next few moments to outline other ways and means in which improvements could be made in the potato sector.  I am not talking about this legislation in that sense.  Rather, I am thinking of improvements that could be effected through the co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we speak about the potato sector we must have regard particularly to the small farmer, because if he is to increase his income from farming it is important that he increase output.  Only yesterday the Taoiseach was very quick off the mark in referring to the deficiency of Irish dairy farmers.  Surely one must be forgiven for remarking that both he and the Minister for Agriculture are very prone to attacking the Irish farmers in terms of their efficiency while being very hesitant to do anything positive about <Col N="806" /> their plight not only at home but within the EC context.</P>
    <P>One way of increasing the income of the farming community is to increase farm efficiency and another way is to diversify into other lines of production. It is in this respect that the growing of potatoes and other vegetables might be very relevant.  As the Minister has rightly pointed out, the Irish market for potatoes and other vegetables is vulnerable because of the scale of the industry at both producer and processor levels.  We are talking of a scale that is small compared with international standards and we are competing with people at international level.</P>
    <P>Down through the years there have been difficulties in the production of products of suitable standards.  These difficulties affect adversely the competitiveness of the growers.  In recent years the market has been eroded because of the importation of vegetables.  The potato industry has been curtailed severely in its development by reason of the absence of an integrated approach as between grower and processor.  The system of contracts has not worked well except in certain circumstances.  However, we can only hope that the setting up of the potato co-operatives will overcome these difficulties. It is very important that there be the greatest co-operation possible between growers and the co-operatives and that members are loyal to their co-operatives both in the good times and in the bad times.  Great strides can be made if there is a proper approach to grading, to marketing and to presentation.  In this way we can ensure that farmers have proper incomes, especially the smaller farmers and those on marginal land. What I am saying is that we must produce a product that can compare favourably with standards elsewhere and with the imported products.  All too often growers produce what they think the consumer requires rather than concentrating on meeting the consumer's demands.</P>
    <P>This Bill can go a long way towards enabling our growers and processors to compete with the many multi-nationals who are operating both on the domestic <Col N="807" /> and export markets but any approach to the development of the industry is dependent on the establishment of an integrated structure for production and quality control.  I am glad the Minister referred to this aspect in his statement. Initially such a structure may be difficult to implement but it is necessary if we are to generate an environment that is conducive to the major expansion of the potato sector.</P>
    <P>Steps should be taken also to implement a structure of proper processing. There are many opportunities at local level for the establishment of well organised processing plants for the processing not only of potatoes but of a variety of vegetables.  To this end the participation of all interests at local level would be required.  I am talking about a fairly simple structure in which would be involved people with expertise in this whole area.  Initially steering committees would have to be set up and these could motivate the growers and the producers who need the assistance of such expertise. Above all, they need the assistance of experts in respect of the grading, packaging and marketing of products.  Then, at a later date there could be established a structure to cater for export markets.  I am convinced that we can compete successfully with the imported product and gain the greater percentage of the home market if we set up the proper structures. We must produce quality products well presented and packaged.  If we do so we will be able to export them.  Our priority should be the growing of potatoes and vegetables as a substitute for imports. The openings are enormous.  A number of small industries could be promoted in towns and villages and a supply system could be built up with local producers. ACOT could assist and encourage such industries in their formative years.</P>
    <P>That is an opening for the employment of many horticultural advisers who have been made redundant as a result of inadequate funds being given to ACOT by the Exchequer.  Sustainable jobs could be provided at little cost to the State.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a step in the <Col N="808" /> right direction but it is only a beginning. From this beginning we must build the structures I spoke about.  I should like to see projects such as the those I outlined qualify for grant assistance from the small industries section of the IDA and, as far as we are concerned in the mid-west, Shannon Development.</P>
    <P>There is also the vexed question of setting up projects to produce potato chips.  The selling of potatoes in envelopes is mentioned in the Bill.  I take it that is the sale of chips but perhaps the Minister will clarify this.  We must look at the question of producing potato chips from the point of view of export.  The vegetable and potato sections depend on new product techniques and on the identification of new market opportunities. This development, with the main emphasis on encouraging native enterprise, must be assisted by all the relevant State agencies.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly &mdash; I should like him to elaborate further on this in his reply &mdash; to some of the EC structures.  I commend him for the work he has done within the constraints under which he finds himself.  I know that they are not of his making but of the making of a Government who have totally neglected the rural scene, agricultural development and the food processing industry.  I ask him to look at the aids that may be available through EC structures such as FEOGA.  I know there are funds available within the structures to assist projects provided we are prepared to match them £ for £.  I am sure he agrees, though he cannot say it out loud, that this is where we are falling down badly.  I ask him to ensure that further moneys are made available for worthwhile projects.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to examine the idea of a floor price for potatoes.  We seem to have peaks and valleys as regards the price of potatoes.  This does not encourage production.  It places the potato producer at a grave disadvantage.  We must have a stable supply of potatoes.  Positive steps must be taken to ensure that this occurs.  Perhaps it could be done within the context of this Bill or under the regulations. I welcome the fact that the Minister <Col N="809" /> will have to bring in regulations and that the House will have an opportunity to discuss them.  No decision should be taken by the Minister without referring it to Parliament.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to elaborate more than he has on the setting up of a potato marketing board.  The Government promised this prior to the last general election and perhaps the Minister would outline the present position in the context of the minor co-operatives throughout the country and their relationship <i>vis-à-vis</i> the national potato co-operative.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how this co-operative is to be financed.  Will it be to the tune of £1 million as promised by the Government some time ago which subsequently was reduced to £100,000?  What is the present situation?  Will there be a contribution from the growers and so on? In other words, what is their composition, how will they be financed and what will be their role in the future?  Will that be determined by the co-operative themselves or by the Minister and his Department? In setting up this potato co-operative it is imperative that they be supported positively, financially and otherwise, by the Minister and the Department to ensure that they will be sustainable, that they will not fall by the wayside as other co-operatives have done in years past.</P>
    <P>The subject matter of this Bill, that is the registration of potato growers and packers, should go hand in hand with the setting up of a properly structured and representative potato and marketing co-operative as I have just outlined.  The Minister made reference to the type and variety of potatoes.  In a number of areas we can improve the yield of potatoes which in some instances is very low. There is the question of late sowing and secondary growth of potatoes, thus reducing quality.  Here the officials who will be available within the Department to implement this Bill must work very closely with the officers of ACOT.  That closeness may not have been as good as it should have been in the past and I hope there will be improvement there in the <Col N="810" /> future and that a closer working relationship between the officers who will be implementing the provisions of this Bill and the ACOT expertise will develop.  If we have a proper structure, potatoes can yield profitable margins.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about setting up a frozen chip factory involving farmer equity and production under firm contracts &mdash; that must be emphasised.  There is need also for expansion of the seed potato sector in the home market and particularly the export market for which we have some very suitable varieties available.  As the Minister indicated, it is absolutely necessary to increase yields of potatoes, and every encouragement should be given towards this end.  The reaction to potato imports has sparked off the setting up of potato co-operatives as I have indicated. That was one of the reasons behind the setting up of this potato co-operative and the encouragement thereof by interested groups, primarily the producers.  It is to be hoped that this co-operative will form a sound foundation for the marketing of horticultural products in general in the future.  Again I want to impress on the Minister that he must encourage in a positive way the setting up of this co-operative.</P>
    <P>This is only a start.  The test will be shareholding funds that must be raised to build proper storage, grading and handling facilities.  Of course, we will start from a very low base and perhaps the funds required will be large.  I ask the Minister to provide by way of a significant contribution from FEOGA grants, his Department, the small industries section of the IDA and SFADCo, funds for the purchase of machinery and so on.  I am glad to say that the IDA have already shown interest in this area.  It is important also that professionalism and expertise in agriculture be made available to give this development full support.  If this is successful for the grading and marketing of potatoes the same principle will follow for other horticultural co-operatives, and other ancillary developments will be possible.</P>
    <P>All possible advice should be made available by ACOT, and there must be <Col N="811" /> close working arrangements between the Department and ACOT advisers.  The advisory programme must focus on two major shortcomings which are evident at present at consumer level.  One is mechanical damage to potatoes and the other is disease.  Perhaps we should involve An Foras Talúntais in carrying out research into the type of machine that should be used in the grading of potatoes with the aim of obviating mechanical damage. Also we should look at the whole area of potato disease and attack it, as we can provided we have the proper motivation.</P>
    <P>As this Bill implies, the Minister will introduce regulations for the proper grading and packaging of potatoes.  I ask initially for consideration and understanding from his officials towards the farmers to ensure satisfactory progress here.  I hope that the Minister when replying will give us some indication of the type of regulations that will be introduced under section 5.  A Bill without teeth, without some substance, will not be very effective.  There may be some thinking in the Department at present with regard to the introduction of the regulations under section 5 to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas from time to time, and it is necessary to know at this stage what that thinking is.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Verolme Cork Dockyard: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government, which already owns 48 per cent, to acquire the full equity of Verolme Cork Dockyard and ensure its continuance as a shipbuilding and repair yard and provide also for heavy engineering business which will arise from the offshore oil exploration programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In proposing the motion I must express the view that it would be nothing short of a national scandal if the Government <Col N="812" /> did not ensure the continuance of Verlome Cork Dockyard, a dockyard that must be unique throughout the world inasmuch as at its closure date it will be in a position to discharge all its responsibilities to its creditors in full.  The Minister, the Government, and others must realise that that unique position in modern business terms would amount to one of the most unsatisfactory close-downs of all time.  There is not a shipyard in the world in such a favourable financial position at present.  I understand that the management of the dockyard presented to the Government last May at least five options that would allow them to continue trading.  All the options were refused by the Government.  Since then many efforts have been made to resume talks with the Department, and the Government, on the possibilities for the yard but to date those talks have not taken place.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to recap some of the historical aspects of the dockyard.  I should like to start with July 1980 when the Government announced a shipbuilding programme for the yard under which four ships were to be built, one bulk carrier, two fishery protection vessels and one research vessel.  To date only the bulk carrier and a fishery protection vessel, a P31, have been completed.  At that time trade unions, workers and management agreed that rationalisation would be inevitable but they accepted it for the purpose of ensuring a viable future for the yard and the remaining workforce.  I should like to emphasise that any amount of redundancy payment is a poor substitute for jobs and employment.</P>
    <P>On 20 April 1983 a delegation from the trade union group was informed by Minister Bruton that he hoped to have an announcement for the yard before May 6 but no such announcement was made.  On May 23 of that year the Minister promised again to have a Cabinet discussion on the following day, May 24, on the question of Verolme Cork Dockyard but as far as can be ascertained no discussion took place.</P>
    <P>Those unfilled promises, and the allowing of orders to go to Japan by a former <Col N="813" /> Minister for Transport in another Coalition Government, from 1973 to 1977 resulted in the dockyard personnel being totally frustrated, almost to the point of being annoyed.  That was the beginning of the end for the dockyard and it was initiated by a Coalition Government.  The lid is now being put on it by another Coalition Government.  The uncertainty caused by the incidents I have outlined reduced the confidence of the workforce. Their energies were sapped and they were demoralised.  The Government's intention to abandon the yard was indicated clearly during that time.  I could go back further and recall that in 1965 a person who is a Member of the House today indicated in a northern constituency in that general election that if the Coalition Government were returned to power the dockyard would be closed. That was a significant commitment.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Government to maritime affairs is indicated further by the recent liquidation of Irish Shipping. It appears that Government policy is that at the first sign of a problem the concern should be closed and the problem will disappear.  In my view, that is an unacceptable answer.  That view is held by many other people.  It would be better if the Government negotiated with people and ensured the continuation of some of these enterprises that they seem happy to close.</P>
    <P>Further significant evidence of the Government's understanding of the position of the dockyard is underlined in the terms and conditions of redundancy given to the workforce in the last year.  With the delivery of the bulk carrier in 1983 the conditions of redundancy were announced.  It was stated in those conditions that there would be an orderly delivery of the P31 and the bulk carrier and, by implication, the workforce could do what they liked after that.  It is of major importance and significance, something that is adding to the frustration of the Cork people, that the senior Minister from that area is conspicuous by his absence concerning the affairs of the Cork region.  His silence was deafening <Col N="814" /> on the problem in Dunlop, on what happened in Fords, on the provision of a ferry service between Cork and Swansea, on the liquidation of Irish Shipping and now on Verolme Cork Dockyard.  Nevertheless, even at this eleventh hour it is not too late for the Government to acquire the remaining 52 per cent of equity of the dockyard from the partner on the board, RSV, Rhein Shell Velome, the parent company already in liquidation.</P>
    <P>It does not appear to be fully realised that at full production the number employed at the dockyard in the period 1972 to 1974 was 1,400 people.  By 1983 they had been reduced to 1,100, gradually trimmed down to the recent figure of 980. Those figures do not include the many temporary staff who are taken on, often as many as 40.  The current number in employment in the dockyard is 98 and it is intended after the intended closure &mdash; I again stress intended closure because I hope that even at this stage the Government will see some light and will not allow the dockyard to close &mdash; about 20 will remain in employment.  What is to become of the highly skilled personnel of the dockyard?  What of the present apprentices at various levels of their apprenticeship who will find themselves in limbo because of the lack of any prospective employment for them to complete their apprenticeship?  This is a very serious aspect of this matter.  They will be joining their colleagues from Irish Shipping whose training is also jeopardised by the recent Government decision.</P>
    <P>This Government stand indicated for allowing Irish ships to go to Britain for repair.  Of course there was a variation in the labour charge of £5 sterling in the British yards and £7 per hour in the Verolme dockyard, but what has not been emphasised or considered is the higher energy costs in Ireland, which were discussed last week when we were dealing with the motion on electricity charges, the higher taxation, both direct and indirect, and higher telecommunications and infrastructural costs.  All these charges increase the rate per hour charged by Verolme.  What is important is that the <Col N="815" /> output per person compared with workers in other dockyards is not in question. We must recognise that fact.  Despite criticism levelled at Verolme workers by many commentators, their output per hour per person compares very favourably with that of similar dockyards to which Irish boats were sent for repairs. Let me emphasise that these extra costs in Ireland were responsible for the differential, not a lack of confidence in the work of the Verolme employees.</P>
    <P>Would it not be appropriate for the Government to subsidise the yard to maintain employment, just as every other national government subsidise their shipbuilding and repairing operations, and make up the difference in cost?  In that way the Government would maintain employment in the yard and support the spin-off industries and businesses which are dependent on places like Verolme. Let me repeat, that Government policy in this matter is seriously incorrect.</P>
    <P>I was pleased recently to read a reported statement that the Fine Gael Deputy, Deputy Coveney, supported the proposal before the House this evening. In a banner headline Deputy O'Sullivan, a member of the Labour Party, was reported as saying that the dockyard must be saved by the Government.  Those two Cork Deputies have spoken in favour of keeping the dockyard open.  All that is left for them to do tomorrow night is to vote with us and ensure that this motion is passed.</P>
    <P>At least two more protection vessels of the calibre of the P.31 could be ordered in Cork dockyard.  The Government could request the EC to provide the funds necessary to build those vessels and so keep the yard open.  It does not need a great stretch of the imagination to realise that with the advent of two more nations, one of whom has a powerful fishing fleet, we will need another P.31 boat, if not two, in our south-west waters.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the importance of the strategic location of Cork dockyard. The facilities there include the most modern sophisticated equipment and an outstanding operational machine shop. <Col N="816" /> There are immense possibilities for this yard to remain in business.  If the Government allow the dockyard to close, it will be a further indictment of their inability to understand the situation, to adopt policies, to establish commitments to keep an industry like this in operation, to leave behind the uncertainty and insecurity this Government have created over the yard. They should restructure the operation and provide a use for the skills which already exist there and safeguard employment which is so badly needed.  If they do that, I have no doubt that the workers of that dockyard will respond in a manner befitting their loyalty and commitment to themselves, their families and the country.</P>
    <P>In the case of Cork Verolme Dockyard the Government are being given a unique opportunity to show their willingness, if such willingness exists.  They will help the people of Cork by example to turn the economic tide in Cork's favour and in favour of the nation as a whole.  Cork people know that we have the ability, the tenacity, the will and the determination in the Cork area to succeed over all adversity, including the adversity of a Coalition Government, if we were given that measure of support which the Government ought to be capable of giving.</P>
    <P>We cannot criticise the Government for all the industrial failures in the Cork area, far from it.  They may not be 100 per cent to blame, but the Government have a 48 per cent stake in a company which they are allowing to cease operations, a company that will clear all their debts.  It is not too much to ask the Government to re-examine the position, to listen to the people, to Government Deputies, to Fianna Fáil Deputies and to the workers of Cork dockyard and to be prepared to keep that dockyard open and thriving on behalf of the nation.</P>
    <P>It is well to realise that in the history of the dockyard there have been times when its existence was threatened, but because of commitments by Governments at that time, particularly Fianna Fáil Governments who were always prepared to help to secure the employment of the workforce, assistance <Col N="817" /> was given and the workers responded magnificently.  The question of our neutrality must be in our minds during this debate because of recent happenings at Chequers.  Where will the naval fleet, including the sophisticated, modern, well equipped P.31, go for maintenance and overhaul?  Will they all be sent over to British docks?  It is mind-boggling to think that this will happen but I leave it to the people to judge their actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be sent to the naval dockyard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is terrifying to think that our naval fleet will go to British ports for upkeep and overhaul.  We cannot and must not allow that to happen.  The Government should seriously review the situation and they must not count the cost when it concerns our neutrality, our work-force and supporting industries and businesses.  The life blood of Cobh must not be lost because of the lack of commitment to maintain the yard.  The dockyard must be kept open as a strategic shipbuilding and repair enterprise.</P>
      <P>We must take into account the development of natural resources which must in time bring further employment to the yard.  We must also avail of the skills and professions associated with Cork dockyard. With so much endeavour in the search for natural resources off the south, south-west and east coasts, the strategic location of the dockyard is eminently suited to benefit and be part of any natural resource which we may attempt to bring ashore.  I appeal to the Government not to shamefully preside over the demise of this important national institution.  The aftermath and effects of its closure will not go away, as the Government seem to hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1983 a motion was laid before this House in the names of Deputies Fitzgerald, Wyse, Lyons, Wallace, Ahern and O'Keeffe calling on the Government as a matter of urgency to draw up proposals for the development of shipbuilding and repair at Verolme Cork dockyard <Col N="818" /> and as an interim measure, in the interests of preserving the jobs of the workforce, to place immediate orders for the building of a fishery protection vessel and a fishery research vessel.  However, that has not been done.</P>
    <P>When members of the Government were in Opposition they referred constantly to Cork harbour as a white elephant. In July 1982 a positive proposal was put forward by Fianna Fáil regarding the purchase of the Whitegate refinery. Despite desperate opposition at that time from people now in Government, one a Cabinet Minister, that decision was made and was very well received.</P>

      <P>I do not have time to quote from the Official Report.  Why, in all the circumstances, particularly with regard to the financial position of the yard, was an administrator not appointed?  Why did the Minister for Finance, at the behest of Fóir Teoranta, deem it necessary or appropriate to appoint a receiver?  Will <Col N="819" /> the Minister indicate if this is true?  I tried to find this out earlier in the day but I failed in the attempt for various reasons. I was told it would be discussed tonight and that the matter was not urgent. Would the Minister say now if this is so?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the estimated costs of the appointment of a receiver? We all recall reading recently that redundancy payments of £8 million were being made by the Government to workers in Verolme.  I should like the Minister to say who is paying the redundancy.  Are the Government paying £8 million in redundancy to the workers at Verolme? If that is so would it not be better if that £8 million, or even part of it, was used to ensure the continuance of the dockyard? What is the final cost figure of the P31? Will the redundancy payments be paid from the extra costs of the vessel?  Perhaps the Minister will let us know the facts.  In adition, will he let us know if the people interested in purchasing the dockyard are Irish or foreign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to fishery protection vessels and the aid that is available from the EC if requested, why is it that request was not followed up by the Government? Why did the Government not seek from the EC funds for the building of one or two fishery protection vessels?  In <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> of today's date there is a report that in Britain they are giving £10 million for ship building.  Has our Minister made any similar request?  In mid-1983 we asked the Government to make such a request for money to build a research vessel and a protection vessel at Verolme dockyard.  We cannot allow the Cork dockyard to close for want of a commitment and encouragement or for want of a plan or programme.  This Government have been given sufficient <Col N="820" /> time but they have sat back.  Their attitude has been that if they close the place the problem will go away.  That is not good enough; in fact, it is totally unacceptable. The Government should give all the necessary resources to ensure that the dockyard stays open and that the skills of the employees that have been acquired over the years are not lost to the area and to the nation.</P>
    <P>What are the Government's intentions with regard to the maritime institutions I mentioned already?  This Government have liquidated Irish Shipping, a 100 per cent Irish company.  Hot on the heels of that liquidation are they going to shut down the dockyard and cast to the four winds the workforce and the equipment in the dockyard?  The Government own 48 per cent of the equity of Verolme dockyard.  They should acquire the remaining equity and keep it for the nation.  This would ensure its continuance as a shipbuilding and repair yard and it would be available for the engineering business that will come as a result of the offshore exploration programme.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Government will allow the yard to close.  I do not believe there will not be support from members of the Government parties to ensure that our motion succeeds and that the Government will acquire the remaining equity.  I do not believe they will allow the opportunity to pass without doing that.  On 25 October on a question on the Adjournment the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism indicated that he and the Government would allow the yard to close on 30 November 1984. In this motion which is put down in the names of my colleagues I am appealing to the Minister at the eleventh hour to acquire the Cork dockyard wholly for the nation, to be used for the benefit of the country and to provide employment for the people who have served the area so well.  I appeal to the Minister not to let this be another episode in the litany of demoralising closures and failures in the Cork area.  The Government have a responsibility in this matter and they must accept it.  I ask them to acquire the remainder of the equity and to acquire <Col N="821" /> the dockyard.  I ask them to restructure it and if there are industrial relations problems to carry out the necessary negotiations. It is up to them to show a commitment and to give incentive and leadership.  If they do this the workers at Verolme will respond in a positive way in keeping with their previous commitment to keep their employment and to keep the dockyard open.  As a result of the debate tonight and tomorrow night I hope the Government will ensure that before Friday, which is the deadline for closure of the dockyard, they will acquire it for all of us, for the workers and for the economic needs of the Cork area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;nothing the failure of Verolme Cork Dockyard to win orders for shipbuilding contracts on the open market despite the availability of substantial subsidies from the Exchequer, calls on the Government in the context of the impending closure of the dockyard to do its utmost to ensure that a purchaser for the yard is found who would provide significant employment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The impending closure of Verolme is extremely regrettable for the workforce, their families and the Cork region.  I know that all Deputies in the House share this view.</P>
      <P>Before commenting on the various aspects of the Opposition motion, there is one thing that I feel I should clarify from the outset.  It was suggested by Deputy Lyons in the last Dáil debate on Verolme that the company could afford not to close down.  That is not the case. The company are in a position to meet their obligations solely because the State provided them with funds in order to ensure the orderly and timely completion of the patrol vessel for the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> Turning to the substance of the Opposition motion, I would point out, in relation to the suggestion that the Government should buy out the Dutch majority shareholding, that this option was offered to a predecessor of mine in 1979 who, naturally enough in my view, showed no great enthusiasm for such a prospect.  I might add that the then Government were advised of this in May 1980, but they did not wish to avail of the option.  If the offer was unattractive in what might have been regarded as a more buoyant economic period, how much more unattractive can it be considered now?  This is something the Opposition may wish to ponder further before they point an accusing finger at this Government.</P>

      <P>If we ignore the fact that the Opposition, when last in Government, chose not to adopt the line now advocated by their present colleagues and look at the rationale behind such a proposal, we see that what is in fact proposed is that the State should pay a significant sum of money to increase its holding in a company who have been in a loss-making situation for several years, who have been unable to pay interest on their borrowings from the State, and who have no realistic prospect, according to the Shipbuilding Advisory Team, of making profits in the foreseeable future.  I would like the House to be very clear on this point.  The whole thrust of <i>Building on Reality</i> is that investment by the State is regarded as being desirable where that investment can make a return to the Exchequer. What is now proposed by the Opposition is that the Exchequer should outlay some hundreds of thousands of pounds on shares that would not offer a return to the Exchequer, but whose purchase would imply, if not necessitate, the spending of several million pounds more, again with little or no prospect of a return on investment. I think the illogicality of this proposal speaks for itself in any context other than Alice's Wonderland.  That seems to be the place inhabited by those who are <Col N="823" /> framing the Opposition's economic policies.</P>
      <P>The Opposition would have us purchase the remaining equity in Verolme with a view to ensuring continuing shipbuilding work for the yard.  Unfortunately, they do not state where this work could be obtained.  They seem to forget that in the past 18 months the yard has been unable to win a single order on the open market notwithstanding the fact that it was quoting on the basis of quite substantial subsidies from the Exchequer. The bleak prospects facing the yard have been recognised by a number of commentators.  For instance, in the House in June 1983 Deputy Gene Fitzgerald said &ldquo;Like all shipyards in the Western World VCD is going through a very difficult time because of the recession&rdquo;. During the recent debate on Irish Shipping it was said that the &ldquo;whole question of shipping was in a state of flux&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the world of shipping is in oversupply&rdquo;. These remarks merely reflect what reputable international experts have been saying for years.  To be blunt, I think it naive and wrong of the Opposition to pretend that Verolme has any future in the short term as a viable shipbuilding industry.  Naivete is no basis on which to construct economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever way the Opposition wish to describe it, the thrust of their motion is that the Government should ensure that Verolme stays open no matter what the cost to the taxpayer.  I have already demonstrated conclusively that in fact the work is not available in shipbuilding terms to keep Verolme open, but I would like to remind the House of exactly what the cost of this type of policy can be.  This is most graphically illustrated in the case of the bulk carrier completed in the summer of 1983.  The commercial quote for this vessel was £14.2 million while the ultimate construction cost at Verolme was in excess of £30 million.  Thus a subsidy of £16 million from the taxpayer was necessary to provide work for some 750 man years and implies a subsidy of more than £21,000 for each job for one year. <Col N="824" /> That is almost three times what the IDA would pay for a job that would be permanent, whereas these were for one year only.  Let me repeat that this policy makes no contribution whatsoever to the subsequent viability of the firm, and exceeds substantially the average once-off payments that the IDA make to create permanent jobs.</P>
    <P>The total cost of keeping Verolme open to date cannot be stated accurately because there is no way of knowing how much the patrol vessels for the Department of Defence would have cost if built elsewhere.  Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to infer from the more than 100 per cent subsidy for the bulk carrier, and the fact that a VCD quote for a fisheries research vessel was twice that of a Norwegian firm, that there was a large element of subsidy in the construction of these vessels for the Department of Defence.  If this is considered in the context of direct production subsidies costing £26 million and credit subsidies amounting to £8 million, it is clear that the cost to the State of maintaining jobs at Verolme has been probably some £40 million, again without having achieved the slightest possibility of commerciality.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that requests for publication of the A &amp; P Appledore report on Verolme had to be turned down for reasons of confidentiality.  Nevertheless, I did give the main thrust of the recommendations to this House on 1 June 1983.  I think it is timely to elaborate on this somewhat.  These recommendations were, in summary form, as follows:</P>
    <P>Verolme could not trade successfully in the building of new ships without substantial State support.  No shipbuilder was operating without State aid in some form or another.  In spite of a general intent to reduce aid, the realistic options for the immediate future were to increase aid or close yards.</P>
    <P>VCD had none of the advantages of home market, modern facility, high productivity, technical leadership or low cost enjoyed by its competitors. It was therefore highly questionable whether VCD could win orders from <Col N="825" /> the international market even with subsidies in the 30 per cent to 50 per cent range.</P>
    <P>A market for ship repairing existed in Cork but VCD's share had dwindled to practically nil.  A fresh approach to ship repair was recommended.</P>
    <P>A change of management alone was not enough to save the yard in shipbuilding. In ship repairing a change of organisation and management was recommended if the available market was to be tapped.  VCD's productivity was very poor.  Their projected man hours for the bulk carrier were about twice those of the best competition in Denmark and Japan.  If the yard was to stay open and assuming orders could be found then a serious attempt at productivity improvement could be made. This was in common with shipyards in the UK, for example, which were acutely aware of poor productivity.  A productivity improvement programme could look at all aspects of work on the shop floor from better design for production and easier communication of technical information to organisation of shop floor work into work packages of like skill and work content.</P>
    <P>There was no meaningful strategic value of maintaining VCD in peace time.  The types of vessels required by Irish shipping companies, fisheries and the Navy were readily available at lower cost and with attractive credit terms elsewhere.  Nor was there a case, as was raised in the UK, for example, for the value of shipbuilding as a home market for steel, marine engines and ship equipment and materials and material supplies.  VCD imported all but a fraction of the material and equipment for a ship.</P>
    <P>It was highly unlikely that VCD could win suitable orders on the open market over the following five years and probably beyond.  This conclusion assumed heavy Exchequer funding of between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the cost of each ship, which was a prerequisite. There was, therefore, no commercial justification for continuing to support VCD.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> VCD had no inherent advantage in shipbuilding, so there was no justification in industry terms for continuing support to VCD.</P>
    <P>The one argument in favour of continued support to VCD was that of saving jobs.  The weight of evidence of this study had led progressively to a recommendation to close VCD.  However, the implication in terms of job losses had always been a constraint. The social impact of closing VCD would be severe and would have to be judged as a wider issue.  However, the international market was so bad and VCD's position so weak that even the most generous support was unlikely to ensure orders for the yard.</P>
    <P>With this one reservation, the recommendation of this report was to discontinue shipbuilding after the present order book was completed. Ship repairing has a future in Cork but as a separate, much smaller, more commercial enterprise.</P>
    <P>I would like to nail down another fabrication that has been bandied about in recent times.  It has been suggested that inaction or an excessively cautious political approach led the Department of Foreign Affairs to act in such a way as to lose orders for VCD.  This, I am glad to say, is another instance of fantasy, in that I am satisfied that an intensive effort was made internationally to market the P.31, with the full co-operation of the Department of Foreign Affairs, but the results were dismal.</P>
    <P>In relation to further orders for the Navy, such as the patrol vessel just completed, I would remind the House that the Department of Defence and the European Commission both accept that in the light of protection measures adopted since 1978 the present mix of ships and aircraft, including the patrol vessel just completed, will provide adequate protection in the medium term.  I remind the House merely because the negotiations that led to acceptance of this position commenced after the then Minister for Foreign Affairs had written to the then Taoiseach on 6 May 1982 advocating <Col N="827" /> that the Government proceed with only one of the two proposed patrol vessel orders in view of the likely additional cost to the Exchequer of having to build the two vessels.  I might further add that following the letter from the then Minister, Deputy Collins, to the then Taoiseach, a Government committee was established to investigate this issue.  It decided that approaches would be made to the European Commission to seek a reduction in the numbers of patrol vessels and aircraft necessary to provide adequate surveillance and control for fishery protection purposes without any subsequent reduction in aid.  The cost of providing the proposed mix of ships and aircraft had risen considerably since they were first approved by the Commission in 1979. The Commission approved the modified programme without any reduction in aid on 8 December 1982.  Again we have an interesting comparison between the actions of Fianna Fáil in Government and their proclamations in Opposition when they are in a position of diminished responsibility.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the House for going into such detail at this time, but I feel it is necessary to set the record straight once again.  The Government amendment to the Opposition motion in June 1983 referred to the absence of provision in the Estimates agreed on by the previous administration for new orders.  In other words, no provision was made by the then Fianna Fáil Government for the ordering of a second patrol vessel.</P>
    <P>At that time, Deputies Fitzgerald and Reynolds made great play of the fact that there was a contingency fund of £120 million for capital projects, and that this would have covered provision for the patrol vessel which was not specifically provided for only because the Estimates were introduced as early as October.</P>
    <P>At that time I stated that reference to a contingency fund was really not credible, and that if the then Government had been serious about the placing of a further order for a patrol vessel, they would have made specific provision for it.  I think it will be clear to the House from my <Col N="828" /> earlier reference to the Government committee that far from just not making specific provision for the second vessel, the truth is that the then Government had specifically excluded it on the basis that there was no prospect of EC reimbursement and that the likely £30 million cost was prohibitive.</P>
    <P>Turning to the ship repair aspect of the Opposition motion, proposals were made to me earlier this year by the company which covered a number of options for maintaining VCD throughout 1985, with its present structure, on the basis of ship repair and general engineering work.  In short, these proposals assumed that employment of between 165 and 250 people could be maintained in 1985 if the Exchequer were prepared to underwrite cash losses of between £1.65 million and £2.12 million.</P>
    <P>There were a number of significant risks attaching to the assumptions behind these figures, not least of which was the fact that there was no evidence that the yard would get the required level of work. Furthermore, the yard had achieved nothing like the assumed turnover figures since 1981.  More fundamentally, there was no real prospect of this action securing viability for the yard, and continued operation beyond the end of 1985 would have required the investment of almost another £1 million in terms of maintenance and dredging.  It will be seen then that what was essentially proposed was the provision of £3 million for the maintenance of possibly 200 jobs for one year only.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I did not feel I could justify the prolongation of the present structure of the company by the injection of more State funds on a drip-feed basis, especially when there was no long-term prospect of viable jobs.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the possibility of general engineering work arising from offshore exploration and exploitation. Prospects of general engineering work arising from a commercial find are essentially dependent on the exploration and development of an Irish oil or gas field, as is evidenced by the fact that it is several years since VCD won a contract in this <Col N="829" /> very competitive offshore construction business.  I am sure that until a petroleum discovery is declared commercial investors would not wish to gamble their money on a facility for which they have no immediate use.</P>
    <P>The possibility of using the yard as an offshore supply base is a separate question and a more realistic prospect.  I understand that my Department have just received an inquiry about using the yard, or at least part of it, for such purposes. I will be pursuing this matter in consultation with the receiver, the IIRS and the Department of Energy.  I would like to point out that such a project would be in direct competition with similar facilities on the south and south-west coasts.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the House that I have been assessing, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Energy, a proposal from a group of Cork and Norwegian interests which would involve the construction of an exploration rig at Verolme.  I am informing the promoters that, for a variety of reasons, I cannot accept this project as it has been presented to my Department.  The biggest problem is the level of Exchequer exposure, a figure of £35 million having been mentioned.  If this level of money were given to the IDA or SFADCo, it could result in a significantly greater number of jobs than the 1,500 temporary jobs implicit in the oil rig proposal.</P>
    <P>Because this Government do not want the skills of the workforce and the assets of the yard to disappear forever and because of our firm commitment to the Cork region, I have already taken steps to ensure that every possibility is explored of finding a replacement industry or industries for the Cork Harbour area.  I have asked the IDA to circulate all their overseas offices with details of the yard with a view to seeking groups who may be interested in putting the facility at Verolme to good use.  In addition, I have asked the IDA to submit to me as soon as possible a report about the feasibility of bringing new industries or activities into the yard.</P>
    <P>The point of departure for any new project must, however, be that the yard <Col N="830" /> has to close now, and thereafter any commercial and viable proposal will be considered in a most favourable manner.  It is appropriate at this stage to deal in general terms with the Government's commitment to the Cork area.</P>
    <P>In January 1984 the Government established a high level working group on employment in Cork to advise on all possibilities to create new jobs and to protect existing jobs in Cork.  The group comprised senior civil servants, local authority managers and senior executives of semi-state bodies.  The group was to report to the Government on: (a) the impact of the measures already being taken to provide jobs in the Cork area; (b) the action necessary to provide additional new jobs, and (c) all action possible to safeguard existing viable jobs in Cork.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Industrial Development Authority established their own internal task force to co-ordinate industrial promotion in the Cork area.  The establishment of the high level working group on employment in Cork was an important initiative by the Government for an area which undoubtedly required serious analysis if its industrial development structures were to develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1984, the working group submitted their confidential report to the Government.  Having considered the working group's report in the context of overall economic development, the Government initiated a detailed action plan for Cork which was announced by me on 11 May 1984.  The Government stressed at the time that the problems being faced by Cork were common to other areas of the country &mdash; areas which, like Cork, relied heavily on older, more traditional industries.  It was obvious that Cork's difficulties were in many ways a very real localised example of a national employment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government saw that, even considering the severe strain on public finances, the incentives already offered by State agencies to industry and the fact <Col N="831" /> that there were no instant solutions available, some measures must be taken to help Cork overcome its problems.</P>
    <P>The initiatives for Cork announced by the Government included the following major elements: Ringaskiddy port and industrial estate were to be declared and operated as a free port.  In addition, Ringaskiddy port and adjoining industrial estate and the industrial estates at Togher, Hollyhill and Churchfield were to be designated from higher maximum levels of industrial grants.  Also the Government decided that Bord Gáis Éireann would supply natural gas directly to companies on the Ringaskiddy industrial estate at oil related prices and a deepwater wharf should be constructed at Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, the Government pointed out that Ringaskiddy was possibly the most attractive site in Europe given the initiatives for the estate which I have just mentioned. Accordingly, it was decided that the IDA would intensify their worldwide marketing programme to bring the advantages of Ringaskiddy to the attention of potential industrialists.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives announced by the Government at that time included the provision of an industrial waste disposal facility at or near Ringaskiddy.  The IDA were asked to give special priority to food-processing in Cork and to examine the possibility of establishing a microelectronics design centre in Cork.</P>
    <P>In addition, the IDA would take the lead role in co-ordinating the various State services aimed at industrial development in the Cork area &mdash; with particular attention being paid to small industry development.  A number of other supportive plans were announced in that press release of 11 May 1984 which, together with the major initiatives already outlined, made up a Government package of incentives aimed at curbing the industrial employment problems of Cork.  It is worth stressing that, prior to this, no similar action plan had been drawn up for any area of the country.  This was the <Col N="832" /> first time a Government had compiled such a wide-ranging development plan for industry in any particular region.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that in so far as my Department are concerned the initiatives announced by the Government in May have now been implemented.  I announced on 30 October 1984 that the EEC Commission had approved the Government's proposal to designate the specified industrial estates in the greater Cork area.  The ministerial order was made on 5 November 1984 which gave effect to this designation.  This designation order means that Ringaskiddy port and adjoining industrial estate will be in a position to offer a maximum grant level of 50 per cent of eligible fixed assets to medium and large industry.  The Togher, Hollyhill and Churchfield industrial estates can offer small industry a maximum limit of 60 per cent of eligible fixed assets.  This order will operate for three years.  This initiative will, I am certain, increase the attractiveness of these sites as locations for industry.</P>
    <P>In connection with marketing the Ringaskiddy industrial estate special marketing programmes headed by IDA, and also involving Cork County Council and Cork Harbour Commissioners, were undertaken in Europe and North America earlier this year.  Ringaskiddy is also being promoted by IDA in the Far East. In June of this year a Ringaskiddy marketing programme was launched in Scandinavia.</P>
    <P>A special marketing programme was held between 8 and 17 October and included meetings with chemical/ pharmaceutical companies in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Chicago Houston and Dallas.  Arising from these marketing efforts a number of projects are under discussion with IDA.</P>
    <P>Another major development recently from Cork is the commencement of construction of the IDA's enterprise centre at the North Mall in Cork city.  I had the privilege of performing the sod-cutting ceremony at the site of this centre at the end of last month.  It is expected that the centre will be completed within 12 months.  It will contain 37 units ranging <Col N="833" /> in size from 250 sq. ft. to 950 sq. ft. and will be particularly suited to the needs of the typical small industry start-up project. It will offer to the small industrialist shared conference rooms, restaurant, secretarial offices and general services.</P>
    <P>This is an important development for the small industry sector in Cork.  As evidenced by the success of the enterprise centre in Dublin, small industry projects can more reliably develop in an environment where expert support and advice are available.</P>
    <P>Legislation is currently being prepared by the Minister for Communications in connection with the establishment of a free port at Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>As all Deputies know, Cork has been the location of a concentrated small industry promotion programme.  This was undertaken in June 1983 on a pilot basis for the non-designated area of County Cork.  The developments which I have outlined illustrate the Government's commitment to increasing the level of industrial development in the greater Cork area.  The infrastructure has been provided and is being further developed to ensure that the changing needs of the area and the industries located there are catered for.</P>
    <P>There has been, I am pleased to say, a significant increase in the number of first time visits by industrialists to the greater Cork area, with 76 first time site visits between January and September 1984. This compares with 64 for the whole of 1983, a very big improvement.  This is an indication of increased interest among industrialists in Cork as a possible location for industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork city has received substantial Government investment in industry over the past few years.  In 1983, for example, approximately £550,000 was invested in factories in the city.  In land and site development work approximately £1.3 million was invested in 1983 and approximately £12 million in grants was paid to companies in the greater Cork area.  The Cork region has recently <Col N="834" /> attracted a number of new projects including Statistical Softwear, Angus/Isochem, Tytex and Dennison Manufacturing which will employ approximately 300 people between them.</P>
      <P>The above developments are an illustration of the Government's commitment to assisting industry in the Cork area.  The initiatives announced by the Government in May of this year were vital to the economic wellbeing of the Cork area.  The Government have done all in their power to assist the development of industry in the area both with new initiatives from State agencies and Government Departments and financial investment in the area.</P>

      <P>Finally, to end on a very positive note, I should like to inform Members that my Department have received a serious expression of interest from a foreign concern who are already involved in the ship repair business to purchase the yard after it closes.  As negotiations are at a very early stage these talks must be treated in strictest confidence. However, the fact that there is already an active interest in the yard must be encouraging.</P>
      <P>In the light of all the foregoing, I believe the course proposed in the Government's amendment to the motion is the right one, both in the interests of the hard-pressed taxpayer and in the interest of securing self-sustaining viable jobs at Verolme.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The alternatives in regard to the system of winding up the company were a liquidator appointed by the creditors, or a receiver appointed by Fóir Teoranta.  We made the latter choice in order to have some control over the situation through Fóir Teoranta.  Clearly that is important in the light of the interest which I have just indicated has been displayed by somebody with quite a good success record in possibly acquiring the <Col N="835" /> yard after its closure for a repair operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.  The Minister of State is welcome.  The Minister says that the possibility of using the yard as an offshore supply base is a separate question and a more realistic prospect.  He has found it very convenient to single out one aspect of the work of the yard.  I would assume that any Minister would look at the overall position and the work being done in the yard, rather than singling out the offshore supply base.  Of course, it would be a very viable and valuable industry in the advent of oil.  I recall the Minister's words when we were discussing the closure of many of our traditional industries:</P>
      <P>Because this Government do not want the skills of the workforce and the assets of the yard to disappear forever and because of our Verolme commitment to the Cork region, I have already taken steps to ensure every possibility is explored at finding a replacement industry or industries for the Cork harbour area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government Cork Deputies are facing me.  We heard that statement in connection with Irish Dunlop and with the Ford Motor Company, but they are standing as a monument to neglect by the present Government.  No one will deny that.  I am trying to be as constructive as <Col N="836" /> possible, but I am afraid that at times one's patience becomes exhausted.</P>
    <P>I recall at one time reading a statement by a Fine Gael Minister for Finance that it was not the Government's business to find work for the Irish workers.  Apparently, that same tradition is now being followed.  I want to say loud and clear tonight that any worker employed in any State-sponsored body will go home this night a really worried person.  The Minister is telling us that he will not pay and the firm is to be closed, even at a time of great recession when industries are on their knees trying to survive.  I must assume that the Minister is referring to a number of our State bodies who are asking for a directive from the Government at the moment &mdash; CIE, Aer Lingus and one of our traditional industries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister forming an opinion of this yard without visiting it and sitting down with the board of management to explore all possibilities for the saving of the yard?  The Minister talks about one possibility.  There are many other possibilities for the yard.  The Minister and, I have no doubt, my colleagues opposite me know well that there are other possibilities open at the moment.  Are we waiting for some foreign investor, when all is lost and the price is just peanuts, to purchase the yard and move in?  Is it not true that there are inquiries from Great Britain, from a shipping company who recently placed their workers on redundancy?  Are we getting all the facts?  There are many questions which I would like to ask tonight but, unfortunately, this was a very lengthy brief, one page more confusing than the other, but moving in the one direction, towards closure.  God help the Irish workers where this Government are concerned.  This is another occasion for Cork Deputies to have to stand in this House pleading with the Minister and the Government to take urgent action to save some of our traditional industries, but unfortunately to no avail.  This is what happened to Fords, Dunlop and many others.</P>
      <P>Only last week there was another great blunder by the Government.  The people employed in our shipping fleet all over the world were told by radio that they were out of a job and workers walking off their ships were being arrested.  That was another panic decision by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This evening, sadly, we are again pleading on behalf of another Cork industry, Verolme Cork Dockyard, in the hope that the Minister and the Government will take the necessary steps to prevent this closure.  The Minister's role in the affairs of this industry is of great importance by reason of the fact that the Government hold 48 per cent of the shares in the yard.  To my mind, the most practical action for any Government to take now would be to purchase the Dutch interests.  I understand that the management asked the Government to do so.  I <Col N="838" /> think the Minister is running away.  So far no reply has been received by the management of the yard about the matter.  I wrote to the Minister some months ago asking him to set up a fact-finding mission and to hold the yard for at least another 12 months.  I am not accusing him, because things may become mislaid, but I had not the courtesy of a reply to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>The time is right for a fact-finding mission but, above all, the Minister and the head of the Government must go to Verolme and see for themselves the possibilities that lie there.  The Government have yet to realise the benefits derived from this industry.  They have trained the most highly skilled craftsmen in Europe, if not in the world.  In addition to building ships, they do all their own design, naval architecture and research work as there are no other facilities anywhere else in the country for this.  Surely an industry like that must be considered an asset.  The Government are sinking a ship without realising the valuable cargo it carries.</P>
    <P>How can we be so blind as not to recognise the significant part that shipbuilding and engineering play in the building of our economy and in providing necessary employment?  There are a number of questions to be answered if the air is to be cleared of the suspicion that surrounds the closing of the yard.  For instance, why was the request of management and of some Deputies for a meeting with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister refused?  We are told by senior executives of the yard that the company could pay redundancy to their workers and pay off all their creditors as well as the Government grant.  If this is true the company must be unique in industrial history.  Is it not extraordinary that they are in a position to pay these moneys and that at the same time they make a decision to close thereby depriving hundreds of workers and their families of a livelihood? The Minister must clarify this point.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we are told that the Government are paying the £8 million in redundancy to the workers.  At the same time, we read in <i>The Evening Press</i> that the £8 million is being paid by the <Col N="839" /> Government as an incentive for the delivery of the P.31 to the Department of Defence.  I have been told by senior management at the yard that the announcement to close was delayed because the company had put aside the money for redundancy payments to pay back creditors and to pay the Government grant and that if the announcement were made earlier, the calls on the company would mean that redundancies could not be paid.  That must be either verified or denied by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister as well as those of us who represent the area are well aware of the rumours that are circulating but yet the announcement of the closure was not forthcoming from management.  There seems to be something sinister in all this. Is somebody hiding something instead of letting us have the facts?  The workers are now questioning the payment of the redundancy money.  It is shameful that a company who apparently are in a position to pay redundancy money, to pay their creditors and to pay back a Government grant should make a decision to close. When I was at the yard recently I found that the ship for the Department of Defence was almost completed.  Is the £8 million being paid by the Government really for the purpose of paying redundancy money to the workers?  These would be payments additional to the statutory redundancy payments.  I understand that the cost of the P. 31 is £22 million.  There was a good deal of criticism of Verolme because of this price but we have not been told about the extra facilities which were decided on later and which caused the cost to increase.  Perhaps later we will be told that the ship cost £30 million.  Does this account for the £8 million the Government are to pay to Verolme?  The record must be put straight in this matter.  Those of us who represent the area must have an explanation to offer the workers.</P>
    <P>Another question to which I should like a reply concerns the value that is put on the yard.  One evaluation in 1982 put the figure at approximately £28 million while in 1983 a Cork company who were <Col N="840" /> asked to put a value on the yard for the purpose of insurance arrived at a figure of approximately £45 million.  That is another matter that needs to be clarified. Are there a group or groups of people on the sideline who are willing to purchase the yard at their price?  The Minister must be prepared to give us the facts in this whole matter.  Deputy Lyons has told us that four options were put before the Government last year in respect of the yard but that there was no reply from the Department to any of them.</P>
    <P>I am hoping the Minister will give us some genuine information to take back to the unfortunate workers and their families.  I have put my questions on record and I await answers to them.  We must have these answers if the suspicions surrounding the closure of the yard are to be eliminated.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Kelly has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of a Private Notice Question in his name today which was ruled out of order as a Private Notice Question.  Will he please read the question by way of introduction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Sir.  I did not anticipate that you would give me permission to raise on the Adjournment the exact words of my Private Notice Question, which I have not got with me since you ruled it out of order.  The substance of it was to ask the Minister for Justice whether he had been made aware of a report on the front page of today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> to the effect that a Gambian national is in hospital in Waterford, having been landed from a ship on which he had stowed away; whether, if the report was correct, he would not permit this alien to be deported before he had personally examined his case; and whether in any event he would assure the House that this alien would not be returned to a country in which he might <Col N="841" /> have reason to apprehend violence or death.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I have absolutely no information on this case except what I got from the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> and a telephone call I subsequently made to the gentleman who compiled this report on behalf of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He effectively confirmed, in so far as his impressions were concerned, what the report says.  The report is to the effect that a Gambian national who had been a recruit in the Gambian army had been, against his will or in circumstances which left him no option, forced to participate in an attempted coup in 1981, since which date he has apparently been a fugitive. He spent some time in the neighbouring country, Guinea-Bissau and in Jamaica and was hoping to get to France.</P>
      <P>I know nothing of the detail of this odyssey and I do not know anything about the man concerned or the bona fides or otherwise of his story.  I am only concerned about his presence in this jurisdiction, apparently in a bad state of health, although that does not concern us because it is not the responsibility of anybody in this jurisdiction.  He is here and I am only concerned that the Minister should assure the House, as I know he would wish to do, that nothing will be done to this wretched stowaway which would ultimately, if not proximately, have the effect of returning him to a country in which, as he assured the reporter, he would either be shot or sentenced to a long period in jail for his part in this attempted coup.  I understand that he repeatedly emphasised this point in the presence of the reporter and two uninvolved people from a voluntary charitable agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know nothing about Gambian politics. I do not want to comment on them and do not want to involve the House or the Minister.  I certainly would not ask the Minister to take up a position on such a matter.  In a country which is so far away from such events it would be unseemly to sit in judgment on their politics; we are so little able to influence political events much closer to home.  But at the very <Col N="842" /> least it would be disgraceful if we were to turn away an alien, whatever his provenance or however illegal the means of his immigration here, who had genuine reasons to apprehend being summarily executed or thrown into prison for participation in a political event.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that there is no potential connection here between the sort of &ldquo;political offence,&rdquo; the cover of which is sought by fugitives in this territory in extradition cases, and the kind of politics which underlie this man's story. There is no parallel between these cases. I do not believe that any kind of savagery or barbarity is excusable or entitled to defence or protection merely because it was committed with a political or quasi-political motive.  I do not believe that is so or that civilised states should acquiesce in such a proposition.</P>
    <P>The story this man has given is the only information we have, unless the Minister has additional information from immigration officials.  Apparently this man was a relatively passive and certainly unwilling participant in this coup, and he is afraid that his relative or complete lack of guilt &mdash; he says he was not involved in killing or anything of that sort &mdash; may not count for very much or weigh very heavily before the authorities in his native country, who may commit him to the kind of summary execution of which I think I read details last year when large numbers of people involved in this attempted revolution were shot on a beach.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this State has any obligation to offer political asylum to anyone who claims it.  No responsible Government could tolerate such a thing. No Minister for Justice has ever acquiesced in such a proposition.  This Minister made an excellent statement two months ago which deserves to be put into the textbooks, and when I get a chance I will put it in a textbook myself, when he outlined the State's position in regard to people claiming asylum.  This was in connection with a person who had disembarked without permission from a Russian airliner at Shannon; and he gave details of such cases.  He gave a figure which suggested that roughly half of such <Col N="843" /> people were allowed to stay &mdash; I think it was seven out of 17 or some such figure &mdash; and the rest were sent off again.  The Minister is quite right in resisting any suggestion that somebody who arrives here and claims political asylum, saying he is afraid of political persecution if he goes home, should automatically be entitled to stay.  I do not think it should be so.</P>
    <P>But there should be at least two principles guiding us.  I should like to be clear that these principles are recognised and accepted, and the Minister might take this opportunity to reassure the House, and me personally, that this is so.  Where somebody puts up a case of his own, a <i>prima facie</i> or an <i>ex parte</i> case which we are not in a position to contradict or rebut, even if we do deport him, at the very least he should not be deported into a situation which will mean his reconveyance to the country in which he is in fear of his life.</P>
    <P>I accept that to acknowledge this principle will involve us in expense and nuisance, because we must give the person concerned a chance of making inquiries as to where he might be taken in; I accept that it would be a nuisance, but that is what human rights theory is all about. We have to tolerate this nuisance, not merely for our own nationals but for people of whatever colour or condition. That is what human rights principles are all about.  It would be no harm if we lived up to what a growing number of other civilised countries now practice, namely they do not return to the other country, the source of the apprehension, somebody who claims to be a fugitive from it for political or whatever reasons.  Political reasons are what the officials in the Minister's immigration section would normally have.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to an anomaly.  We have a very elaborate extradition procedure which, with minor variations, applies both to people whose extradition is sought by the neighbouring state, and those whose extradition is sought from further away. In that extradition procedure, whichever <Col N="844" /> of those two parts of the world the request comes from, the person whose extradition is requested has a certain range of safeguards, a certain set of criteria, which will prevent his extradition, and these criteria must be applied by a court.  That person whose extradition is sought may be himself an illegal immigrant.  He may have arrived here illegally, but even if he has arrived illegally, if on the first occasion when he falls under police notice he is taken up by the police because a request for his arrest on an extradition warrant has arrived, he falls instantly within the four walls of the very solid protection based on international practice, human rights and so on, and the judicial standards of this State, which the Extradition Act, 1965, offers.  On the other hand, if his arrest has not been sought, if for all we know he is not guilty of offence whatever, and the possibility exists that he is guilty of no offence that we would recognise, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, as criminal in our law, somebody who is here in these conditions has not got that protection.</P>
    <P>This man, this alien, if I understand this story correctly, is an illegal immigrant in the sense that he has not had the consent of the Minister or of the immigration authorities to his presence here.  However, the circumstances, which at any rate have been reported, about his journey here are such that you could not call him a culpable illegal immigrant.  Apparently he did not try to smuggle himself into the country.  The Minister will know more about this case than I do, but as far as the report I am relying on goes, apparently he suffered such ill-treatment or became so physically ill on this voyage that he had to be put ashore at Waterford.  It seems that the Customs officials would not even let him on shore until they made sure that he was not suffering from some disease which would be a public danger if he were allowed to land.  He is not a deliberate, culpable illegal immigrant aiming to hoodwink the authorities here and get on to Irish soil.  This man was in need of hospitalisation.  Apparently he had been very badly beaten, he was suffering from exposure and he had had a very bad time. <Col N="845" /> In other words, human solidarity, even if one were not a Christian, let alone living under the high privilege of the Constitution and subscribing to its high philosophy, would lead one to try to help him. He is here, so to speak, in spite of himself as a result, on his own story, of a series of misadventures and misfortunes to himself and his family.  We owe it to this man at least if we deport him &mdash; I am not pleading that we allow him to stay, because I accept that the State cannot take all comers &mdash; to make sure at least that we send him somewhere from where he will not automatically be redeported to Gambia, which, he says, if he is forced to revisit now will endanger his life.  Let us at least give him breathing space to give him a chance to look around and see if some quarter of the globe will accept him.  That is the least we might do.  We are always patting ourselves on the back for our civilised standards and Christian heritage and the way we taught civilisation to barbarians in the rest of Europe, and it is time that in a small particular such as this we lived up to those pretensions.</P>
    <P>I have never been clear in my mind about whether decisions to deport aliens who are here illegally or who perhaps initially have been legally here are necessarily submitted to the Minister's scrutiny. It ought to be a matter of principle and practice here that the very drastic powers of our aliens law are operable only on the express personal authority of the Minister. Although I do not want to be taken to express any lack of confidence in immigration officials, who are as conscientious as any other public officials, in cases like this where people's liberties and perhaps life may be at stake, it is important enough to warrant that whatever Minister is there spends some few minutes considering the propriety of deporting somebody.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that it would be no bad thing and would circumvent a good deal of occasional dispute in this House, if the Minister for Justice each year were to lay before the House a simple statement detailing the names of whatever immigrants, legal or otherwise initially, <Col N="846" /> had been deported from the State in the course of the preceding 12 months, the dates on which they had arrived, the circumstances in which they had arrived, the substance of the story they had to tell, the result of the investigation which the Minister's Department had carried out and the reasons why the Department decided that the person in question could not be permitted to remain.  In other words, I am pleading for something which would be at a higher level and, in the administrative sense, a more transparent procedure for the operation of our aliens law.  I am not pleading for asylum for all comers or that aliens who arrive here illegally simply seeking asylum should be put in the same category as those whose extradition is sought to answer a charge of a criminal offence.  I am merely pleading for what I might call a humane and transparent administrative system in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department were first informed by the agents of the ship concerned on 20 November of the presence of a stowaway on a ship due to arrive in Waterford on 25 November.</P>
      <P>There is a long-standing arrangement by which stowaways who are refused leave to land under our aliens laws are disembarked at ports and sent to their country of origin by the ship's agents.  In the present case the ship's agents agreed to make the travel arrangements accordingly and the Department of Foreign Affairs were asked to make arrangements for providing the stowaway with a travel document.  For this purpose an approach was made to the Gambian High Commission in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ship arrived in Waterford on Sunday, 25 November and in the normal way was boarded by Customs and Aliens officials.  In the course of an interview with the stowaway, whose English was easily understood, no reference whatever was made to political asylum and no information provided which could reasonably be interpreted as a case for political asylum.  The stowaway expressed <Col N="847" /> a wish to remain here but this was refused on grounds which normally apply in such cases, namely, that he was not in possession of the necessary papers and was not in a position to support himself here.  However, the stowaway complained of not feeling well and the officials made arrangements for a doctor to examine him as a result of which he was admitted to hospital.  As I have said, the gentleman in question has not made a case for political asylum.  I understand that a solicitor has contacted my Department about him but neither has the solicitor made any case for political asylum. Should such a case be made, naturally I will consider it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be useful if I were to outline what &ldquo;political asylum&rdquo; means. The Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees contains a definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; which is generally taken to outline the concept of political asylum.  It refers to a person because of &ldquo;well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the event that an application for asylum is made to me I shall have to have regard to the conditions obtaining in Gambia as well as the case made by the individual.  I should, however, like to make two comments.  The first is that, on <Col N="848" /> the basis of the interview between the stowaway and the aliens officer, the former gave no indication of being in fear about returning to Gambia.  The second is that, while I do not purport to have any expertise as to conditions obtaining in that country my inquiries to date have not elicited evidence which would mark Gambia as a country which is self-evidently a place to which its law abiding citizens, or any class of them, might be afraid to return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister at least assure the House that nothing will be done to deport this man for a couple of days until some matters on which apparently there is a conflict can become clear? I spoke today to the reporter who compiled the report I referred to, and I explained that apparently there was some disagreement about the substance of what he had written, and he was absolutely positive that the man concerned said he was in fear of being shot or imprisoned for a long time if he was sent back to Gambia.  Will the Minister assure the House at least that nothing will happen for a few days until we can get this cleared up?</P>

      <P>There is a legitimate government in Cyprus, based in Nicosia, and we regard it as the sole legitimate government of Cyprus.  This follows from our longstanding commitment, which I have outlined to this House on several occasions, to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus, and our rejection of acts by the Turkish Cypriots purporting to set up a separate independent state with the aim of partitioning the island.</P>
      <P>The United Nations has played a central role in efforts to solve the Cyprus problem through resolutions of the Security Council and General Assembly, the presence of a United Nations peacekeeping force on the island, and through the Mission of Good Offices of the Secretary-General, designed to bring about constructive negotiations between the two communities with the aim of achieving a just and lasting solution to the problems of the island.</P>
      <P>In recent months, the Secretary General of the United Nations has continued his efforts to make progress on a process of negotiations involving the two communities. Since last August, three rounds of &ldquo;proximity talks&rdquo; (indirect negotiations conducted by the UN Secretary-General), two of which were at high level, have already been completed.  A third high level round started yesterday, 26 November, in New York.  While I would hesitate to be optimistic about early concrete results from the New York talks it seems clear to me that the Good Offices Mission of the UN Secretary-General currently represents the most realistic way of achieving progress towards a solution of the Cyprus problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday last, 23 November, I met the Foreign Minister of Cyprus, Mr. Iacovou, in Dublin.  In the course of a discussion of a number of topics of mutual interest, he briefed me on the political <Col N="682" /> situation in Cyprus and on his hopes for the third round of high level proximity talks in New York, which he was due to attend.  He was well aware of the support which Ireland had demonstrated for efforts to arrive at a just and lasting solution to the problems facing Cyprus; and he expressed his appreciation for our policy in this regard.  He stressed the importance he attached to achieving some measure of progress at the New York talks.  I assured him of our best wishes.</P>

      <P>I recently asked the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána for a report on this matter.  Under the Road Traffic Acts and regulations made thereunder, responsibility for the licensing of vehicles as public service vehicles rests with the Commissioner.  A clear distinction must be drawn between the number of passengers which a vehicle might be designed to carry and the number which it may be licensed to carry as a public service vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Acts distinguish between two types of public service vehicles &mdash; those with passenger accommodation for up to eight passengers, i.e. small public service vehicles and those with accommodation for more than eight passengers, i.e. large public service vehicles.  It is a matter for the Commissioner to decide on the basis of the relevant regulations as to whether a vehicle may appropriately be licensed as a small or large public service vehicle. In the latter case, he must in particular have regard to whether the vehicle complies with the special requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment <Col N="683" /> and Use of Vehicles) Regulations applicable to large public service vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The differential rent scheme for local authority dwellings has general application and it would not be practicable to vary it in relation to particular schemes.  While the scheme is designed primarily to relate the rents payable by individual applicants to their financial and family circumstances, it is also structured to ensure that the maximum rents in respect of individual schemes will not exceed levels related to the original cost of providing the schemes.  As a result, the maximum rents applicable to individual tenants normally vary in accordance with the relative standard of the scheme in which they reside.  The primary factor in determining rents is, however, the operation of the ability-to-pay principle.  Since that principle gives the fairest result overall and since it ensures that no tenant will be liable for more than he can afford I do not consider any change in the system to deal specifically with older unserviced houses to be warranted.</P>
      <P>My Department provide unsubsidised loans and operate a scheme of grants to assist authorities in the carrying out of certain improvement works to their rented dwellings.  In addition, under the new scheme provided for in the national plan, subsidised capital may be made available to housing authorities to assist them in carrying out major remedial works of a structural nature to dwellings which require such works if they are to continue to be suitable for renting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The charges referred to by the Deputy are those related to private and semiprivate accommodation in public hospitals. While these charges have been increased substantially in recent years <Col N="703" /> they are still substantially less than the average cost of services in the hospital categories to which they relate.  Furthermore, it has been possible for the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to provide cover against the increased charges while maintaining their viability.  I do not consider that the proposed increases in charges from 1 January 1985 will alter that position.</P>
    <P>I consider that it is not unreasonable to move the charges mentioned closer to actual cost in a situation where the only alternative to increasing income is to reduce expenditure.</P>

      <P>Hospital services cards provide evidence that a person is entitled to free hospital consultant services.  Some 85 per cent of the population are entitled to such services but many of these do not require the services in any particular year and consequently do not apply for hospital services cards.  An eligible person without a hospital services card can establish eligibility on receipt of services.  It is estimated that of the population aged 65 years or over who have not medical card cover, some 30,000 persons have eligibility for free hospital consultant services and are consequently entitled to a hospital service card.</P>

      <P>An application for a disabled person's maintenance allowance from the person in question was received by the SouthEastern Health Board on 14 May 1984. <Col N="710" /> The reason for the delay in processing the application is that since submitting it, the applicant has changed residence three times.  On each occasion the health board found difficulty in tracing him.  A further delay was caused by the fact that the person has attended three medical consultants and, in these circumstances, the health board have asked for a consultant's report.  A decision on the application is, however, expected shortly.</P>

He again signed as unemployed at his local office and he has been issued with an application form for completion to enable his means to be reinvestigated.

Two of the children left her care prior to that date and a revised decision was given on her claim disallowing payment in respect of these children giving rise to an overpayment of £280.  A third child left the claimant's care in March 1984 with the result that she is now entitled to payment at the rate of £48.20 a month in respect of four qualified children.

The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 22 March 1984 and payment was authorised from 26 March 1984, the fourth day of incapacity, at the weekly rate of £74.85, the maximum rate appropriate to a married man with two dependent children.  Disability benefit for the period 26 March 1984 to 21 April 1984 amounted to £299.20.  He was, however, paid £255 supplementary welfare allowance by the Midland Health Board for the same period.  This amount was withheld from his disability benefit and was refunded to the health board.</P>
      <P>It subsequently transpired that in addition to this, the person concerned was paid the sum of £63.75 in respect of supplementary welfare allowance for the period 23 April 1984 to 28 April 1984. Weekly deductions made at the rate of £9.10 from his disability benefit entitlement to the total value of £63.75 were also refunded to the health board.

It is therefore presumed that it was the Deputy's intention to refer to the period May 1982 to January 1983 in respect of which she recently applied to sign retrospectively as unemployed for the purpose of being granted credited contributions.  Her application to sign retrospectively was investigated and following the completion of inquiries her case was rejected on the grounds that she did not fulfil the condition of being available for work from May 1982 to January 1983.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for receipt of widow's contributory pension provide that where the late husband's insurance record is being used there must be a yearly average of at least 39 contributions in either the last three or five contribution years prior to his death or his reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>Alternatively an average of at least 24 contributions over the period from his entry into insurance up to the end of the year prior to his death or his reaching pension age (whichever is the earlier) also qualifies a widow for pension.</P>
      <P>In this case the insurance record of the husband yielded a yearly average of only 28 and 27 contributions in the three and five years respectively prior to his reaching pension age and his yearly average from his first entry into insurance in 1936 up to the end of the year prior to his reaching pension age, was only nine contributions. The widow's claim to a contributory pension was disallowed as these tests did not yield an adequate average.</P>
      <P>Further examination of the husband's social insurance record now shows that his re-entry into insurance in 1974 may be taken as an entry into insurance for the purposes of calculating his yearly average.  On this basis, the average is calculated at 28 contributions which entitles the claimant to a reduced rate of pension.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has been awarded a widow's contributory pension at the rate appropriate to a yearly average of 28 contributions (£41.95 per week at present), based on her late husband's insurance record, with effect from 10 December 1982, the Friday following his death.</P>
      <P>Pension books with orders payable from 21 September 1984 have been issued to the designated post office for collection by her.  She has been notified accordingly. Arrears of pension for the period from 10 December 1982 to 20 September 1984 will be sent direct to her shortly by means of a payable order.</P>

      <P>The review of the claim of the person concerned for a deserted wife's payment is at present with a local officer of the Department for reinvestigation of the person's circumstances.  It is expected that the officer will call on her shortly and when his report is received a decision will be given and she will be notified of the outcome without delay.</P>
      <P>The claimaint notified the Department on 24 May 1984 that she was changing her address and she was supplied with a pre-paid envelope in which to return her book in order to have the new address endorsed thereon.  She stated that she would return the book and give her new address within a few days.  She did not do so, however, and the book was accordingly recalled via the post office at the end of June 1984.  The last order cashed therein was dated 21 June 1984. She did not notify the Department of her new address until she called to the Phibsboro Tower office on 30 October 1984.</P>
      <P>It is considered necessary in such cases to have the claim re-investigated to confirm that the qualifying conditions continue to be satisfied and it was on this basis that a period of three months was quoted to the claimant as possibly being necessary for inquiries to be carried out and a decision to be made.</P>

Neither the Garda investigations nor a separate internal investigation provided grounds for disciplinary proceedings.  I should point out that the second Garda investigation had been formally requested (by letter to the Garda Síochána) by the Governor of the prison on 16 May 1984 before public allegations of misconduct were made at the annual conference of the Prison Officers' Association.</P>

      <P>My Department in January, 1979 sanctioned a grant towards the cost of connecting the school to a group water scheme.  I understand that it was necessary to alter the original route of the pipeline to connect via the school chairman's residence, but that there is no problem with the actual water supply at present.</P>
      <P>A play area was provided when the school was built I understand it is now in need of attention.  On receipt of a formal application from the chairman of the board of management the matter will be investigated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While most out of work apprentices notify AnCO there are some who do not and consequently are not on the register. On the other hand, some apprentices on the register fail to notify AnCO when they secure employment.  On the basis of a survey of the AnCO unemployed <Col N="751" /> apprentice register undertaken in 1982, about 40 per cent were found to be actually unemployed.</P>
    <P>Of the 358 apprentices on the AnCO register, 119 who failed to find continued employment as apprentices on completion of their first year off the job training in autumn 1984 are registered with the Cork office of the National Manpower Service.  Of the 119 registered, 114 are at present participating in the grant scheme for youth employment, in the community youth training programme or in block release or redundant apprentice courses. These courses count towards the period of apprenticeship.  Other redundant apprentices registered with the National Manpower Service are included in the general register of unemployed persons seeking employment and are not readily identifiable.</P>
