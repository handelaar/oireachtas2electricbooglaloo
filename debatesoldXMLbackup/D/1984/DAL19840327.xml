    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline the topics he discussed with President Reagan during his recent visit to the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, arising from his address to the United States Congress, he will outline the practical ways in which he envisages the United States might be of assistance in implementing any agreement that, as he stated in his address, may emerge from our present efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to my statement to the Dáil on Wednesday, 21 March 1984, in which I indicated the topics discussed at my meetings with President Reagan and other American leaders. It would not be appropriate for me to specify the practical ways in which the United States might support any agreement emerging from our present efforts. That is obviously a matter that would arise in the context of events that might follow publication of the Forum Report. I am convinced, however, from the understanding and goodwill which was so <Col N="354" /> evident everywhere in the States that any steps our friends there would take would include continued measures against the flow of money and arms to the men of violence and support for any process devised by the Governments of Britain and Ireland, in conjunction with representatives of both sides of the community in Northern Ireland, to construct a practical solution, leading to peace and stability there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 1, the topics the Taoiseach discussed with President Reagan, I should like to ask the Taoiseach if when discussing the question of disarmament, for instance, he raised the issue of the siting of Cruise and Pershing missiles in Western Europe and if he got any commitment from the President that they would be withdrawn? I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he raised the question of the trial of Fr. Niall O'Brien in the Philippines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to add to what I said on this subject in my statement to the Dáil the other day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 2, I should like to ask the Taoiseach if when he talks about the practical ways the US could help in the process which the Forum has initiated he could give us a commitment at least that the practical ways would not include any form of military involvement by the US or any political commitment which would compromise our neutrality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows me, and the Government, well enough to know that neither of those would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that President Reagan will be visiting Ireland very soon I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he would not consider it appropriate that the public be made somewhat more aware of the views expressed by the President of the United States in discussions with the Taoiseach so that they would know on what grounds they should welcome him and the benefit he can be <Col N="355" /> in the solution of the Northern Ireland question in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Irish people will welcome him as leader of a country with which we have close ties of friendship and a country from which comes half of the total foreign investment, and the employment that derives from that foreign investment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the economic facts of our position but will the Taoiseach not agree that there is considerable concern among the general public in relation to the questions of disarmament and of Central America?  The Taoiseach would need to be more forthcoming in explaining precisely what pressure he is exerting on the American administration to change their policies in Central America and also in relation to disarmament. I should like to draw his attention to the point he made in relation to Northern Ireland in the course of his Congress speech when he called for the withdrawal of moral, financial and military support to the Provisionals in Northern Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach ask the American administration to withdraw their military, moral and economic support, for instance, to the government of El Salvador that is slaughtering its own people?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that all of us in public life and, indeed, private citizens, have ample opportunity in a variety of different ways to convey any feelings we may have about American foreign policy either in this House, at international fora, through the columns of our newspapers or in countless other ways and that it would be entirely inappropriate to avail of a visit <Col N="356" /> by a head of state and head of government of a friendly nation to engage in activities of this sort?  Will the Taoiseach agree with me also that this is one occasion on which we should demonstrate to the greatest extent we possibly can the warm and beneficial relations which have always existed between this country and the United States of America?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy and I am grateful to him for his comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this is an entirely unsatisfactory situation for an agricultural country?  Perhaps he would tell the House if he or the Government have taken any steps to bring about a situation where this country would not be importing £600 million worth of foodstuffs into a country which is supposed to be an agricultural country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to apologise for the absence of the Minister for Education, who is meeting the Commissioner for Education, Social Affairs and Employment to discuss proposals related to the social fund.  She asked me to apologise to the House for her absence and to say she will be back tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of boards of management of regional technical colleges as subcommittees of the vocational education committees will be reviewed in the context of <Col N="359" /> the proposed amendment of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  I may not anticipate the outcome of that review which will be undertaken in consultation with all the interests involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see the Minister of State here today.  It makes a change.  In his reply he said this matter was to be discussed further in the context of the amendment of the 1930 Vocational Education Act.  When is such a review intended?  When will the announcement of such a review, and the implementation of any amendments, be made?  Such a move was forecast in the action plan at paragraph 2.19 but, as in many other proposals in the action plan, there is no time scale mentioned.  When will this announcement be made?</P>

      <P>The question of greater devolution of authority and responsibility directly to the RTCs was raised in the discussions with interested groups during the preparation of the <i>Programme for Action in Education, 1984-87</i>.  As was indicated in the programme for action, it is proposed to amend the Vocational Act, 1930, to provide for an enlargement of the vocational education committees and teachers' representation.  In the context of the review which is taking place to provide for these amendments, the question of the position of boards of management of RTCs and subcommittees of vocational educational committees will be examined.  I understand the examination will take place shortly but I could not give a specific time.  I hope this will be announced shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she considers it appropriate that there is no representative of the Catholic Secondary School Parent Association <Col N="360" /> on the new curriculum examination board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the Curriculum and Examinations Board have all been appointed in a personal capacity and do not represent any particular organisation as such.  In choosing the board's members I took great care to ensure that the board would be broadly representative of educational interests, including parents.  A member of a parents' representative organisation is included among the members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a parent from a particular group of parents appointed to the board and I am sure she is a most worthy person, but the point in putting down this question was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it appropriate that the Catholic Secondary School Parent Association was not included on that board?  In his reply the Minister said people were nominated without representing a particular body but the parent appointed represents a group of parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that representatives were appointed on the board not because they were involved in any organisation but on their merits &mdash; educational experience and value.  As the Deputy said, there is a member of a parents' organisation on the board but it was not possible to appoint all those suggested because there was a limit to the size of the board.  A member of the Catholic Secondary School Parent Association has been included on one of the board's curriculum committees.  The Deputy will accept that in setting up this type of board it would be impossible to include everybody suggested.  I do not want to preempt the working of the board but it is possible that at least one member would be appointed to the board's curriculum committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that a member <Col N="361" /> of the CSSPA may be appointed to a committee but I am asking why what is nationally recognised as a parents' organisation has not been appointed.  Is the Minister aware that there is extreme disquiet because such a representative has not been appointed?  Does the Minister of State agree that parents' views are very important in the formulation of educational policy?  Would the Minister bear in mind the points I have mentioned and ensure that parents' organisations are liberally represented on the subcommittees of the Curriculum and Examinations Board, bearing in mind the Minister's oft-repeated statement that she welcomes the views of parents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I will convey the latter part of the Deputy's supplementary to the Minister but I do not think it is right to say that parents' organisations have been excluded from the board because we already have a representative of a parents' organisation on the board.  In selecting the members of the board the Minister took account of suggestions received from various groups, including parents' organisations.  I can understand the difficulty of including everybody on a board of that sort.  There is already a parents' representative on the board.  I will bear in mind and convey to the Minister what the Deputy has said.</P>

      <P>There is already student representation on the governing bodies of the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland, of the National Institutes for Higher Education and of the National College of Art and Design.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 2.19 of the <i>Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987</i> I have indicated that it is my aim to have student representation on all governing bodies. This matter will be pursued in discussions with the relevant authorities on the implementation of the proposals in the Programme for Action.</P>
      <P>In this connection it is proposed, in relation to the regional technical colleges, that the question of the arrangements for student representation on the boards of management will be examined in the context of the proposal to amend the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  This proposal is referred to in paragraph 2.19 of the programme.</P>

We <Col N="363" /> were treated to a lovely document and a long debate on it here and on radio and television but no time limit was set on anything.  When can the students of the RTCs be expected to achieve full status on management boards of these colleges? I want more than just a pious hope; I want an expressed reality.</P>

I refer the Deputy to the assurance in the reply that it is the intention of the Minister to have student representation on all those bodies. I do not want to set out any blueprint at this stage but the Minister is quite willing to accede to the Deputy's request. It would be difficult to give specific dates or times for the putting into effect of specific recommendations.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she can justify a reduction in the number of teachers in an inner city school such as St. Joseph's Stanhope Street, Dublin, which caters for approximately 490 pupils; if she is aware that this reduction will lead to the elimination of some honours classes for students at higher level, and to a serious reduction in the remedial services offered by the school.</P>

Should no vacancy occur, salary will continue to be paid in 1984-85 to all existing teachers on the staff.  I have set up an advisory review committee to examine and make recommendations in cases where transitional difficulties occur.  Should vacancies occur in the staff of the school in future which the numbers on the rolls would not justify filling it would be open to the school to submit a case for consideration to the review committee and to my Department. I am assured that there is no problem in relation to the remedial teachers. No approach has been made to the Department by the school in relation to the revised staffing levels.

      <P>This college of education is financed on a different basis to the four principal colleges.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated exactly what is wrong.  They are financed on a different basis from the other teacher training colleges.  This has led to a great inequality among students attending the Froebel College of Education. Does the Minister accept that these teachers when they go into the national schools are on exactly the same level as all other primary teachers?  If so, should not the financing of their institutions be on the same level?  Is the Minister aware that there is quite a lot of disquiet amongst students of the Froebel college because they do not enjoy the catering advantages, particularly the provision of a full evening meal, which are enjoyed by students of the other training colleges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter for the Department.  It is a matter for the college authorities to deal with catering and social facilities.  The college was originally a private non-aided college.  Since 1972 the Department have contributed towards costs by way of capitation grants which in 1983-84 amounted to £800 per student.  The facilities for students are set out in a brochure issued to them before they enter the college.  I cannot give any further information to the Deputy.</P>

Does the Minister not consider that the Froebel College of Education, which is providing a very necessary facet of primary education, is being treated in an unfair fashion <i>vis-á-vis</i> the provision of meals and social facilities for students?  I wish the Minister of State to convey to the Minister the inequality of treatment accorded to the students of the Froebel college in comparison with students of other colleges of education, particularly regarding the evening meal.</P>

      <P>There appears to be a word omitted from the question but I am sure that responsibility for this rests with me and not with the General Office. The question should have referred to the raising of the parental income eligibility but I know from the Minister's answer that he understood the point of the question. The Minister has stated that a circular will issue in May to the relevant bodies but can he be more specific since we are talking of an urgent matter, a matter affecting students who are now making their plans and which of course is affecting also the parents who have to foot the bill?  It has been three years since income eligibility and grant levels were increased.  In a matter of such grave national importance, is the Minister in a position to let the young people concerned know if there is to be more money to finance them for third level education?</P>

The present means test limits and levels of maintenance grants were introduced with effect from the beginning of the 1981-82 academic year when the increased rates in maintenance represented an increase in value of 66 per cent on the preceding year.  It would not be possible for me, and I doubt if it would be possible for the Minister either, to say at this stage whether grants will be increased in the next academic year.  The question of an increase will depend on the available resources.  Therefore, any forecast at this time would be mere speculation.</P>

      <P>As stated in paragraph 5.8 of the <i>Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987</i>, a formal mechanism will be set up in consultation with interested agencies in order to draw up guidelines for schools and teachers on the provision of guidance.

      <P>This formal mechanism is presaged in paragraph 5.8 of the programme but is not detailed.  Can the Minister say when the formal mechanism is to come into operation and whether it will be different from the ordinary mechanism whereby a request for a guidance counsellor at second level is made and then considered?

How serious is the Minister about the implementation of the findings of the Commission on Adult Education?</P>

Is the Minister of State aware that at present many regional technical colleges are operating degree courses?

As stated in the <i>Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987,</i> however, proposals of the dimensions indicated in this report cannot, due to economic circumstances, be contemplated in the period covered by the four year plan. A principal recommendation of the report regarding the setting up of an independent council for the in-service education of teachers must, in my view, have to await the experience arising from the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.</P>

It will receive such consideration when it is published and when the various interested parties have had an opportunity to comment.  The report will be available within the next two months.

In the light of such a novel enterprise, will the Minister ensure that adequate consideration is given to this?

      <P>Perhaps I am not as fully aware of conditions as the Deputy obviously is but the Department's requirements in the matter were explained and it was agreed that an analysis of the utilisation of existing accommodation would be furnished by the college in the form required by the Department.  A sample form, indicating the format for the analysis, was sent to the chief executive officer on 16 September 1982.  Despite reminders issued on 26 November 1982, 27 January 1983 and 16 December 1983, no reply was received until 3 February 1984.  More information, as a result of a survey on canteen usage, was received on 29 February 1984 but an analysis of the library facilities is still awaited.  It is necessary for the Department to get a complete assessment, not just dealing with the canteeen but with accommodation generally before they come to any decision.  As soon as the information is available, the Deputy may rest assured that no undue delay will occur.  I must remind the Deputy that very often Ministers, Departments and officials are criticised unfairly as in this case when the relevant information has not been sent to them.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate that there has been an increase in the capitation grant available to these schools, the Minister will agree that that will not in any way affect my question which is the problem of accumulated debts which these schools have. The improved capitation grants will do nothing to solve that problem.  Rutland Street school in the north inner city has an accumulated debt of £42,500.  That school will have to close unless the Minister speeds up his thinking on the matter and agrees to assist the school.  In the spirit of the action plan for education announced recently, which indicated that resources would be made available specifically to primary schools in disadvantaged areas, could the Minister indicate what funds have been set aside to allow the Minister to assist schools in these areas and what criteria will be used to allocate those funds?</P>

However, I should remind the House that the biggest increase ever &mdash; over 23 per cent &mdash; was made in the capitation grant this year.

    <Title>European Assembly Elections Bill, 1984: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with revised procedures for filling casual vacancies in the European Assembly.  A number of speakers have already commented on the Bill.  I agree that a by-election held to fill a vacancy in the European Parliament would probably be an unwieldy and an expensive system. Therefore, it is essential that we devise a system which is reasonably simple and at the same time has the essence of the democratic process about it.  I am not entirely convinced that the proposed system is the right one but, as the Minister outlined in his speech introducing this Stage, pending acceptance by all the member states it is the best that we can come up with and we will have it with us for some time.</P>
      <P>The true working of democracy is that the people by their own choice have selected people to represent them by voting for them.  We all know that applies in the case of Dáil elections.  Many commentators have been suggesting that we might devise a system to eliminate by-elections for vacancies in the Dáil.  In the case of the European Assembly, in order that the people might perceive that justice is done and that they have participated in the selection of the people concerned, when further proposals are being drawn up by the various member countries consideration might be given to a system like that in America in relation to the primaries.  I do not know if it would work in our political framework but the people might feel they had a direct contribution in the selection of the candidates if we had a system like that.  I am putting forward that suggestion because there has been some criticism about the filling of vacancies in relation to Irish members of the European Parliament and also in relation to members from other countries.  The public have the right to make their input into the selection of candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be a little confusing to the public <Col N="447" /> that the names of the sub-panel candidates will not appear on the ballot paper. On polling day voters will have very little knowledge, unless they are very perceptive in taking account of the names listed at the various polling stations, of who will be on those sub-panels.  I know there will be postings which should give the public the notice required.  We have all seen various notices outside polling stations on polling day and we do not always read all of them, so there may be some slight confusion there.</P>
    <P>I am also a little worried that the procedure is almost like a co-option, although this is an improvement on the previous procedure.  We know that co-option has worked reasonably well in relation to local authorities where small constituencies are involved but we should really steer clear of that type of system in relation to replacing our representatives in the European Assembly.</P>
    <P>I hope the general public realise the importance of electing people to represent them at the European Assembly. The people who are selected on the A or B panel have a very difficult job to do for the country.  The electorate should feel at all times that they have a major role to play in the selection and election of such people.  The responsibility for making Ireland's case in the European Assembly in the future will fall on their shoulders. That task will become more difficult with the passage of time.  Recent events have clearly illustrated that.  I hope the general public in this particular election year will take full cognisance of the importance of their role in electing those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House has no objection in principle to the method proposed in the Bill for filling vacancies in the European Parliament. We strongly object, however, to limiting the number of the names on the replacement candidates list to the number of candidates plus two.  That is the only reservation we have in relation to the Bill.  If democracy is to be ensured it is vital that the Government amend the Bill to allow at least four more candidates on the replacement list over the number of <Col N="448" /> candidates for a party in a particular constituency. There is no reason why there should be any limit to the number of candidates on this list.  The Minister represents a party who have been described by some people as having played musical chairs with their European seats.  It could be said that the system has been made a mockery of since the last European election with the different changes of Government since then.  It is significant that this process was not introduced by a Labour Minister.  It should also be noted that none of the present Labour members of the European Parliament were elected to the European Assembly.</P>
      <P>We have some reservations about the way the Government are manipulating this proposal to their advantage.  As Deputy Molloy pointed out last week, if the experience of the Labour Party is anything to go on, a situation could arise in which a vacancy created by the resignation of, say, a Fianna Fáil candidate could be filled by the Government of the day with a candidate from the Fine Gael or Labour Party replacement list.  I should like clarification of this part of the Bill because it is true to say that in no other country of the EEC would such a system be tolerated.  Indeed I wonder has the Minister brought this proposal to the attention of the Credentials Committee of the European Parliament because, unless that system is amended, it will be rejected by the European Parliament. Speaking as a candidate in the forthcoming elections in June I would appreciate clarification of the matter of whether substitutes are to be identified with a particular candidate.  For example, one wonders whether a replacement candidate should represent the same area or part of a constituency, say, the north of Leinster or the south of Leinster.  Many people would contend that if a candidate was elected for, say, north Leinster and resigned or died he should be replaced by somebody else representing that area. That is not very clear from the provisions as they stand and some clarification is certainly desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Parliament must be treated seriously.  It is my view that this proposal has not been given sufficient <Col N="449" /> thought or, if it has, represents a cynical manipulation of democracy.  It must be remembered that the European Parliament will be faced with many serious issues in ensuing years.  Unemployment constitutes our biggest social evil and also represents probably the largest social evil of many of our European counterparts. For example, in the Leinster constituency it has reached a figure of almost 46,000, young and old.  The failure of the Government to tackle this problem will be a fundamental issue in the forthcoming elections.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament will be anxious to devise ways of getting the European economy moving, of developing new policies to deal with the technological and scientific era in which we live and of deploying our natural resources.  In this connection, as I pointed out in the course of an Adjournment Debate some time ago, the situation in Bula Mines in my home town of Navan is that almost ten years ago the then Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; a candidate in the European elections &mdash; gave £9,500,000 of our taxpayers' money for a 24 or 25 per cent share of those mines.  Now, with another Coalition Government in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer that the Deputy adhered to the provisions of the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely pointing out the importance of arresting the unemployment situation across the board in Europe and of the usage of our natural resources in so doing.  In that connection it is desirable that the Government should do something about the issue of Bula Mines which has continued now for ten years and where investment must be of the order of approximately £25 million. However, I shall not dwell on the subject if the Chair does not wish me to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Parliament will not want to be placed in the position that it will have to call its Credentials Committee to unravel any of the provisions of this Bill.  Obviously it would be preferable <Col N="450" /> that a correct presentation would go to the Credentials Committee.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure I appreciate the Minister's argument that a long ballot paper would be too sophisticated for the Irish electorate.  I do not need to remind the House that, in the first European elections in 1979, local elections were held simultaneously.  Unfortunately we are denied that opportunity this year.  The method employed then did not prove too sophisticated for our electorate.  I contend that our electorate are perfectly capable of examining and understanding a detailed ballot paper.  In those first European elections there was an urban ballot paper, a county council ballot paper and a European ballot paper, when there was a very extensive poll and when it did not seem to present any great problem to the electorate.  There were certainly a certain amount of spoiled ballot papers.  I would not agree with the Minister that a long, detailed ballot paper, or an extension of the provisions of the Bill in regard to the two-plus-two proposal would present any difficulty to the ordinary Irish elector.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the performance of the Government since the last election there is no doubt that the electorate will welcome the opportunity to show them exactly what they think of that performance. There has been sufficient said in the House about the postponement of the local elections in recent weeks.  It is true that the electorate feel somewhat cheated that they were denied an opportunity of judging the Government on their performance or of, perhaps, giving them a rap on the knuckles in those local elections.  The Government may have misjudged the electorate.  Hopefully the electorate will turn out in force, giving the Government the rap ont he knuckles they would have received had the local elections taken place.  I hope the opinion held in some areas that it will be difficult to mobilise the electorate on the day of the European elections &mdash; because of the postponement of the local elections &mdash; will not be vindicated.  In some countries it is difficult to mobilise people to vote in a normal election and it would be somewhat <Col N="451" /> sad if, on 14 June next, there was a rather low poll.  One hopes that will not happen because we have here a good track record in the turn-out of the electorate. In the last general election we had a turn-out of 73 per cent and that was after three general elections had been called in quick succession.  While it is fair to assume that the turn-out will not match that of a general election it is hoped it will not drop substantially.  They do well in the United States to get a 50 per cent turn-out.  I hope the turn-out here will be above that figure and that the election will be seen as a serious exercise in democracy.</P>
    <P>Where will the lists of replacement candidates be sited in the polling booths. Will they be on the wall or on the table? This is another nebulous area of the Bill which needs to be clarified.  The explanatory memorandum states that in voting for a particular candidate the electorate will also indicate approval of the appropriate list of replacements.  What happens if a voter does not wish to indicate his or her preference for a person on the list?  Will that vote be spoiled?  How does one ensure that an elector approves of a candidate on the replacement list? When voting for an official candidate will an elector write down the name of the candidate on the ballot paper and also the names of the candidates on the list? That needs to be clarified.  Whether it is a political or personal preference will also have to be clarified.</P>
    <P>There is confusion over the counting of votes and where the counting will be completed.  From reading the explanatory memorandum I understand that the votes in each constituency will be sorted out.  Will the ballot papers be turned up so that tallying can be proceeded with or will they be turned down before being transferred to a central counting station? That is what appears to be in the explanatory memorandum.  People were under the impression that all the votes would be transferred to a central counting station. That would be very difficult to do and I assume that what I have said is correct.</P>
    <P>Some people take the view that we would be better off having by-elections <Col N="452" /> rather than the list system.  I have an open mind on that.  There is for and against it but whatever the faults of a by-election, it is the best democratic way of replacing a Deputy on his demise.  It can be argued that we should have by-elections in the event of the resignation of a European member or on his demise.  It would be difficult to hold by-elections because of the size of our constituencies.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to put in a plug for myself but it is important that we send the right people to Europe.  It is a forum where we need people of the highest calibre to get the best deal possible and the best slice of the cake.  We know from our experience in dealing with our European colleagues in relation to the present dilemma of the super-levy, that they are hard nuts to crack.  The people going to Europe need to be formidable operators to get the best they can for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government should amend the Bill in such a way that the minimum number of names on the replacement list would be four.  That is the opinion of this side of the House and we request that the Minister take it seriously.  Having analysed the position and discussed it fully with members of the parliamentary party we are convinced that this is just.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the spirit behind the Bill.  The system which was in operation up to now was not satisfactory. The first European elections were held in 1979 and certain problems have now come to light which were probably not realised then.  Some of them are being dealt with in this Bill.</P>
      <P>What happened in the past regarding replacements was not satisfactory in that people could be replaced literally on the decision of one or two people.  While their names were theoretically put before the House anyone could be named as a replacement.  In all cases where people were replaced, the replacements were people of ability and were fitting to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had many elections and certain people found themselves in conflicting jobs or bestowed with office.  We must look at the question of whether a person should serve two parliaments.  In real terms a dual mandate is not on from a <Col N="453" /> practical point of view, with due respect to the previous speaker who has his hat in the ring.  In the long term it is difficult enough to serve one parliament not to mention serving two.  It involves a certain amount of flying time and the practical indications are that people cannot be effective members of both parliaments or do the two jobs properly.  We will have to decide whether people are members of one parliament or the other.</P>
    <P>There are people in all parties who, if they are elected, hope they will have a dual mandate.  Good luck to them in running and being elected.  In the long term if people are to perform and to represent their constituents locally here or this country at European level, they cannot be fully effective in doing the two jobs. From time to time there should be some local tie-up between people representing the country or certain areas of it and representing also the Irish point of view. From the point of view of the effectiveness or otherwise of the European Parliament, the Irish block of 15 acting on many issues if they are representing Ireland should be at one.  They may be within other groupings there, but they should be representing Ireland.  While obviously they represent their own party's point of view, if Ireland is to benefit or be affected by a decision, the 15 there should act with regard to that.</P>
    <P>Up to now people were proposed from time to time for vacancies which occurred.  What is proposed in the Bill, due to certain criticisms from the credentials committee over what has been happening in this country, is to be welcomed. The electorate will have available to them a list of candidates who, depending on the party or view they support, will be on the substitute list.  I suppose when the Government were considering this there were two ways of looking at it.  There is the replacement by by-election which is used when a Dáil seat becomes vacant, or there is the co-option which at the moment is used in relation to local authority seats.  Either, at one time or another, might be fully appropriate.  What has been happening in recent times in relation to by-elections when the work of this House could cease for two or three <Col N="454" /> weeks is not totally satisfactory and it would not be satisfactory if for, say, three weeks or a month everyone was heading into Connacht-Ulster, Leinster, Munster or the greater Dublin area fighting a by-election because of the retirement or the death of a MEP.  A by-election system for the replacement of MEPs would not be totally satisfactory especially when only one seat is to be filled.  Also when in a four-or five-seat constituency people elect a certain number of candidates from each party I suppose those candidates are expected to represent those people in Europe for the five-year term, and that electorate will also be indicating their preference for the substitute list for that period of time.</P>
    <P>Up to this we have had a so-called co-option system without influence or direction from the electorate in relation to the people who were put forward.  I repeat that any of the individuals were more than capable of performing well on behalf of this country in Europe, but comments and criticism have been levelled at this system even within Europe.  If a list of the official candidates is displayed prior to the election or some reference to it is made on the ballot paper, the public will be able to express their preference and support both for candidates, no matter how many they elect, and the substitute list.</P>
    <P>We must opt for either a by-election system in total or a co-option system in total and thus eliminate freakish events if several people had to resign for one reason or another or perhaps an MEP died or for some reason was unable to fulfil his duties in the five-year term.  The list of substitutes could meet this situation. There is a case to be made for extending the number of people on the substitute list.  In some areas several candidates may be on the election ticket and in theory that will mean that within a party there may be one or two defeated candidates plus the two substitutes.  In some constituencies a party may put up, say, two candidates who might both be elected and then if in the ensuing five years either of those elected members cannot fulfil his duties, there are only two substitutes from whom to choose.  Difficulties <Col N="455" /> could arise then if other people had to be selected.</P>
    <P>Either we must have a by-election system under which the public decide who shall fill a vacancy, or else the public decide at the general election from a number of suitable people available.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the numbers in the light of what has happened and, considering the number of candidates and substitutes, to extend the number to possibly four or six.  Each party goes through the process of selecting people, whether they be defeated candidates at a convention or other people who feel that they can contribute something to Europe and who are supported by the party's delegates who know probably better even than public representatives who are fit to be MEPs.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made for extending the number of substitutes.  The by-election system leaves the possibility of the seat being switched from one party to another while under the co-option method the seat will stay with the party who secured it at the election.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider the number. It is only a matter of changing two to four or six.  Obviously we do not want a list of 20 or 30 names.  Four or six names is an adequate number.  A party who have two candidates elected and then four or six substitutes are covered for five years until the next election.  The revised procedure will go some way towards meeting possible criticisms about the way seats have been filled in the past.  The response from the public in the forthcoming election will reveal what interest there is in the European system.</P>
    <P>There will certainly be criticism of the lack of relevancy in the meetings of the Council of Ministers.  However, with the development of the European Parliament, there will be greater relevancy over the coming years.  I hope that there will be a good poll in June and that all parties will put up candidates who are worthy of the position.  Some candidates, if elected, will serve under a dual mandate.  This is a short-term decision made for various reasons but, in the long term, serving under a dual mandate will not continue. <Col N="456" /> A decision will have to be made in the Oireachtas and in the European Parliament preventing people from serving in both parliaments.  If people are to do themselves justice in one parliament or the other, they can only serve in one.</P>
    <P>There is, however, room for certain co-operation, where MEPs would have a voice in the Dáil from time to time to discuss various directives, reports or legislation passed at European level, so that our Members can voice their views on these.  The physical demands of having to be, in theory, in two places at once while on a dual mandate &mdash; looking after one's constituents and trying to be in Strasbourg, Luxembourg or Brussels &mdash; are too much.  The parliamentarians must opt for one parliament or the other and the European Parliament will have to come to some decision in this regard.  However, the MEPs will have to be given an opportunity of showing this House that what they are doing in Europe is effective and is relative to the wishes of the Irish electorate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill before the House. It will go some way towards improving the situation.  I ask the Minister to reexamine the numbers which can be included on the substitute list.  The experience of by-elections, with TDs tripping off to one corner or other of the country, resulting in the disruption of the work of the House, has not been satisfactory. When people elect a candidate in any election they expect that candidate to be there for five years to work on their behalf.  They have voted for that candidate and the party he or she represents. They will consider, if for one reason or other the candidate must give up the seat, that that party should have the right to the replacement seat.  I favour co-option and would expect the public to be given an ample opportunity to look at all the individuals, defeated or selected by the various parties.  The fact that the people have made the decision at the previous election should be taken into account. The substitute list could possibly be extended a little to cater for a few extra candidates, because five years can be a long time in politics.  That would ensure <Col N="457" /> that the selected party would have a representative in Europe.</P>

      <P>The present discussion about European election procedure should provide us with an opportunity for discussing other reforms in the area of voting.  It is a pity that so far the opportunity has not been grasped to extend, for instance, the facility of postal voting. The European Parliament have suggested that Irish citizens living abroad, or British or French or other citizens living in Ireland, should have the right to opt to vote for candidates in their home country. No attempt has been made by this Government to deal with that proposal from the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>Postal voting should also be extended to Irish citizens who have to work in our embassies abroad.  In particular, the sick and disabled here should have a postal vote.  Other areas of reform could also be dealt with.  For instance, why could the European elections not be held on a Sunday, as is often the case in other European countries?  Voting in all elections, European, by-elections or general elections, should be rendered as easy and convenient as possible.  None of us can be too happy with rarely more than a 70 per cent turn-out for general elections.  In the recent Dublin Central by-election the poll was as low as 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the most glaring defect in the present Bill is the failure to tackle the question of the dual mandate.  Various speakers have dealt with the list system proposed and I intend to speak on that shortly.  The dual mandate at this time and in this country is an affront to very many outside this House who have no jobs at all and must live on very small incomes.  So far, out of the 15 seats being contested, 11 sitting TDs have been selected to stand and Deputy Frank Cluskey has made it quite clear that he intends to hold on to his Dáil seat if elected to Europe.  When discussing the question of the mandate, it is important to take account of the views of MEPs who have been elected previously.  I understand that Deputy Seán Treacy has said that it is impossible to be an MEP and a TD and do either job properly.  It is also interesting <Col N="458" /> to note what Mr. Richie Ryan, who is an MEP said in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 5 March, 1984.  Mr. Ryan pointed out that Fine Gael candidates are standing solely for the European Parliament and that they are not Members of the Oireachtas. Obviously he had a slight lapse of memory there, because he did not remember Deputy Tom O'Donnell or Deputy McCartin, or his colleague in the Labour Party, Deputy Cluskey.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>None of the candidates before you will be a double-jobber or a part-timer and that is more than can be said for the Fianna Fáil men.  They are seeking votes for candidates who will have two jobs, two salaries, when they can do neither job correctly.</P>
    <P>That is from a man who has served in the European Parliament and who did not stand for the Dáil because he was a member of the European Parliament.  He said quite categorically that it is impossible to serve both parliaments.</P>
    <P>From that point of view the Dáil on this occasion, with this Bill, should deal with the question of the dual mandate. The other question is the double salary. A Dáil Member who becomes an MEP gets double salary, in the region of £33,000 a year.  In the words of people already in the European Parliament, it is not possible for them to do the two jobs. Therefore, it is disgraceful that we should allow persons elected to have two salaries.</P>
    <P>Along with having a double salary, dual Members also have double pensions. There are thousands of people in the country living below the bread line and it is disgraceful that those who are offering to lead the Irish people and who are every day demanding sacrifices from the man in the street, that we tighten our belts, at the same time are putting their hands out for double salaries and double pensions.  It is cynical to say the least and the House, on Committee Stage, should ensure that those elected to the European Parliament will automatically resign from this House and that in future MEPs who are elected to the Oireachtas should automatically resign from the European <Col N="459" /> Parliament.  If we are to stop the flood of cynicism sweeping the country in relation to public representatives that is the kind of approach we must adopt to show that people in this House who demand sacrifices are themselves prepared to make sacrifices.</P>
    <P>In relation to selecting substitutes, the system proposed, though better than the existing one, is still not the best.  In terms of the democratic process, the only acceptable system would be by by-election, and in the absence of that the person selected should be the next in line, the person who had come next in line to the candidate elected.  The present system ensures only that the electorate will know the list of substitutes from whom the person will be selected on the death or resignation of the sitting MEP, but even that is watered down because the list of substitutes will not be on the ballot paper but presumably put on the walls of polling stations.  The first priority should be to make it simple and easy to understand what is going on and the best way to operate the system would be to have the substitutes listed on the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the system now being proposed.  It is a slight improvement but no one could have expected when the original system was being introduced that it would be abused to the extent that it has been.  The new system will not have any benefit other than to ensure that the party from which the original MEP was elected will have the right to nominate the substitute automatically and that the electorate will be able to know beforehand who that substitute is likely to be.</P>
    <P>I support the points made by Deputies Liam Cosgrave and Molloy who said that even the list system proposed is inadequate, that the number of substitutes is not enough.  The Bill does not preclude any party from shifting their MEPs every year if they choose.  There could be as many games of musical chairs in relation to the coming European Parliament as the last one.  There is no restriction whatever in regard to changing MEPs.  The only significant advance in this system, as proposed, is that the electorate will know <Col N="460" /> that the first three changes at least will be known when voting takes place.  Thereafter, it will be blind man's buff all over again.</P>
    <P>There are the two basic points I wanted to put.  The one I press most strongly and in relation to which I intend to put down amendments is that this House should set about eliminating the dual mandate.  It is not good enough to say that we hope in the future good sense will prevail and that Members of the Dáil who are also MEPs will decide themselves that it cannot be done.  The Oireachtas must legislate for it to be done.  My information is that the dual mandate already has been outlawed in Belgium and Greece.  In West Germany two of the major parties do not allow any Members of their Parliament to have seats in the European Parliament.  If we were to do that we would increase the standing of the House a hundredfold and arrest the decline in the attitudes of our people to elected representatives.</P>

      <P>Obviously it would be much easier for the Minister to deal with the problem which the Credentials Committee of the European Assembly have indicated must be dealt with in order to get rid of the situation that has been arising here in the last few years when people have been nominated to fill vacancies without ever having gone before an electorate except their parties, which represent only a limited electorate.  It would be easier for the Minister if there was a uniform method of election in all EEC states.  That is not the situation.  We have the PR system, in other countries it is first past the post and other countries <Col N="461" /> have a list system.  We should be careful here when referring to this Bill as providing a list system.  Of course, there are differences in the provisions from those that exist in some continental countries with regard to a list system.  We would need to be careful not to use a misnomer when describing the terms of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill goes a long way towards trying to find some democratic way of making the electorate aware of who is likely to take a seat in the European Parliament in the event of an MEP dying during his or her term of office or who for personal or family reasons finds he or she cannot continue to hold a seat.  I recognise the difficulties the Minister had in trying to find such a method but I would have welcomed a decision to insert on the ballot papers the names of those who would be appearing on the list.</P>
      <P>In that event the electorate would be fully aware of the people they are voting for.  During the election campaign there is an onus on us to acquaint the public of those named with the candidates on the ballot paper.  An additional onus rests with the political parties, and the Independents, to make the electorate aware of the people who will replace the successful candidates if they decide to leave the European Parliament.  Voters, before they cast their vote, would like to know who is likely to take the seat in the event of the candidate they vote for leaving. They would like to be sure that the seat will be taken by a person of the same calibre and ability as the person they are giving their preference vote to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise the restrictions placed on the Minister but I wish there was some way to include such names on the ballot paper.  I hope every effort will be made to alert the public by way of public notices of the necessity before casting their vote to inspect the list on display at the polling stations.  People should be encouraged to do that rather than casting their votes blindly.  I have some reservations about the limitation on the number of people for the B lists.  In recent years due to the work of the strategy committees that work with political parties and the examinations that take place of how votes are spread among candidates, the number <Col N="462" /> of candidates appearing on ballot papers has been reducing.  At one time five or six candidates was the norm but now in many instances there are only two candidates.  What is the Minister's view on the suggestion that the number of people on the B list be increased by at least one?  That might be relevant in view of the fact that in most instances the number over and above the number of candidates will be two only.  Experience has shown that in the period of five years there could be two changes on a party ticket and they would wipe out the B list. I am sure the public, having voted for a candidate and for that candidate's party, would not be pleased, because of an inadequacy in the Bill, to have to accept a replacement MEP from another party. Under the provisions of the Bill when the B list is exhausted a candidate who has appeared on the special lists at polling stations on the day of the election will be substituted.  I hope the Minister gives consideration to my reservations about that.  I realise that it is not possible to have an ideal number.  It could be said that we should have from four to six more names on the list but we could have an argument for and against each number. It is our duty to try to foresee the problems that may arise in the next five years if the figure is left as suggested in the Bill. I hope the Minister considers an amendment to this provision.</P>
    <P>I have similar reservations to those expressed by Deputy De Rossa about one aspect of the Bill.  The job of public representatives at national and European level in recent years has become such an onerous and demanding one requiring an enormous amount of time and dedication that physically a person cannot do the two.  The time has come for us to have a serious look at that element.  There is no provision in the Bill to deal with that and it is up to the political parties to decide whether they wish to continue with the dual mandate or not.  The public are disillusioned by what they see &mdash; unfairly in my view &mdash; as people try holding on to a number of jobs for the sake of what they can get out of them.  Sometimes we tend to forget the demands made on such people.  There may be monetary gain in <Col N="463" /> having jobs as a TD and a MEP but that gain is far outweighed by the stress, strain and demands of the two jobs.  In recent years because of the tight voting position here many MEPs must have come to the conclusion that they could not continue to hold down the two jobs.  They must have felt they were doing one of the jobs less adequately than they should have been.  We have reached the stage where people can deal only with one job and the electorate deserve that.</P>
    <P>A recognition of the importance of Europe, and the fact that we are part and parcel of Europe, has been underlined by the fact that those with a dual mandate have not been able to give the same amount of time and effort to their task that they might be able to give if they were not caught by the stress involved in having to attend constituency functions and deal with other local matters.  That is another important reason for getting rid of the dual mandate.</P>
    <P>Most of the provisions in the Bill deal with the technicality of displaying the B list and putting the onus on parties to make up their minds as to how they choose the people for that list.  I am sure many Members agree that this is not the ideal way of dealing with this because the candidates whose names are put on the B list are selectively chosen by parties. That is not as perfect as it could be.  The public should as far as possible be given an opportunity to indicate the people they want on that list and their preference. I accept that by reason of the fact that we do not have a full list system like continental countries it would be impossible to draft legislation to allow for that.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise two matters that have not been referred to in the Bill and the Minister may indicate later why it was not possible to include them.  Our election to the European Parliament will be held on Thursday, June 14, but the count will not take place until the following Monday.  The reason is that voting in other European countries is spread over a number of days.  It would be desirable if the voting in this election took place on the same day in the nine countries so that the count could take place simultaneously. <Col N="464" /> After voting takes place on the Thursday the ballot papers will be sorted and stored away until the following Monday. That is bad enough for the electorate but it will be a greater ordeal for the candidates who will have gone through a difficult campaign.</P>
    <P>I would have welcomed a provision in the Bill to allow for voting to take place in the European elections on a Sunday. There may be reasons why this cannot be done but the Minister could have used this Bill to bring about such a change. Particularly in the last three years the disruption in the day-to-day life of schools has been horrendous because it is left to individual boards of management to decide how many days each election should take.  Some schools have four days off, others three and others two.  I can foresee this happening again in the next European elections.  Polling day will be Thursdays but schools may close from Tuesday to Friday, and even Monday depending where the counts take place.</P>
    <P>Some working people find great difficulty in casting their votes.  We are all concerned about apathy among the electorate and the fact that there will be a very poor turnout for the European election. If we had polling on Sunday this would help people who had to travel to work and who could not get time off to vote.  It may seem strange that not everyone can vote between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. but if a person does not have his own means of transport it can be difficult for him to get to the polling station if he works some distance away.  I can see that there might be problems with regard to church services.  The costs involved in employing caretakers in schools during these periods would be outweighed by the advantages to the electorate.  We are a democracy trying to extend the voting facility to as many people as possible.  I regret it was not possible to include Sunday voting for European elections in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill could have been used to include another item which will be discussed later.  You might stop me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if I mention it because it is unfortunate that every time I speak you are in the Chair and unfortunately <Col N="465" /> I have drawn your wrath when you stopped me from wandering into areas that were not always directly relevant. Perhaps you will allow me say something about a subject which will be raised later.</P>

      <P>It behoves us, as legislators, to capitalise on any legislation going through this House.  This Bill could have been used to extend voting rights to certain categories through the postal system. Perhaps the Minister will tell us if any consideration was given to allowing postal votes in the European Assembly elections to handicapped people.  Preparing and drafting legislation is a time-consuming and costly operation and takes a great deal of effort by draftsmen, Ministers and staffs, and it behoves us to cover as many areas as possible.  That is an area I would like to have seen covered in this Bill.  Election Bills are not introduced for the good of the candidates; this Bill is being introduced to ensure that democracy survives, that our electoral system is fair and just and that as many people as possible can exercise the franchise &mdash; male, female, handicapped and ablebodied. The Minister had an opportunity here today to introduce the postal voting facility for the handicapped.  Section 4 (3) says:</P>
      <P>Where a registered political party or a non-party candidate at an Assembly election nominates more than one replacement candidate, the order in which the names of such replacement candidates appear on the relevant replacement candidates' list shall be determined by that party, or, as may be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no idea how we can tighten up that area.  In some European countries the parties have the right to say where somebody should appear on a list, but I am not sure that that is the best way.  The people who cast their vote should decide how many votes each candidate gets.  In this case they are being presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> here because the parties will <Col N="466" /> make the decision.  Like it or lump it, we are stuck with this B List, and if candidate A, who is elected as an MEP, resigns or gives up his seat, the electorate do not say that candidate B will get the job &mdash; unless he was a candidate in the elections but did not get elected.  I imagine there would be some difficulty with the Credential Committee of the Assembly, but I am sure the Minister has ensured that what is in this Bill will cover us when the time comes to substitute candidates.</P>
    <P>This is very necessary legislation but because of our election system it is not possible to tighten up the nomination, election or appointment of substitutes. The Bill goes a long way but I still have some reservations.  The Minister should have made provision for postal voting for the handicapped and voting on Sunday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The House agrees that this very important Bill is not controversial and there is an eagerness to have it put through as expeditiously as possible. I do not propose to delay the House.</P>
      <P>We must accept that we are dealing with a very new and evolving situation. It should be remembered that the first European elections were held in 1979.  It is easy for us to be wise after the event but we should not be too critical of a situation which was revolutionary at the time.  Bearing in mind the diversity of democracies with which we were dealing, it was inevitable that there would be a lack of agreement after one full session of the Parliament and I am happy that there has been some progress.  This Bill is a step forward.  I do not want to appear to be sticking the knife into the Minister who is piloting this legislation but he will agree that the absence of any precise formula or any specific mechanism led to a situation where his party appeared to be acting not in accord with what might be regarded as the true spirit of parliament, whether in Europe or at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just as well for any speaker to get rid of any critical observations he might have.  Having given expression to that short one in respect of the Minister and his party and the manner in which they abused the parliamentary system that <Col N="467" /> existed, I would couple with it my amazement and disgust at listening to a member of the European Parliament, Richie Ryan, addressing Young Fine Gael.  I presume he was imposing on their youth and innocence.  He castigated the dual mandate system and gave people to understand that he and his party had been opposed to that system.  Our party in respect of the European Parliament did not practise the dual mandate.  We did not have members in Europe who were also Members here.  The Minister shakes his head but that was a fact.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party and Fine Gael had such people and ended the five year period with members enjoying dual membership.  Deputy De Rossa referred to the dual mandate.  I have always practised in my lifestyle, inside and outside this House, the principle of one man or one lady, one job.  I do not agree that any person should be endeavouring to discharge simultaneously the duties of two onerous appointments. Apart from the fact that there are many thousands of people who are intelligent, efficient and qualified enough to take either job, I do not think it is the correct approach to any assignment that one person should be carrying out two sets of duties.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> In respect of my candidature for the European Parliament, if the situation occurs I will demonstrate that I practise what I preach.  One has to bear in mind that there are times when one's own opinions have to take, temporarily at least, a secondary position to the political requirements of the moment.  It is quite possible that we could have a general election before the European election but it is also quite likely that the general election will not be too long after the European election.  If we insist on there being no dual mandate for any period of time, a Member of this House elected to the European Parliament on 14 June might resign his seat overnight, thus leading to a by-election.  Are we to have a by-election within a certain number of weeks following the European election?</P>
    <P>A number of people here have been critical of having a referendum and I have heard Deputy De Rossa and his party say how unnecessary it was to have a referendum on a very important matter affecting our Constitution, that we should not be bothering the people with it.

      <P>What I am talking of is not all that far removed from the issue we are discussing.  However, it is not my intention to offer any defence to this House for my not being prepared to support Deputy De Rossa in anything he might propose.  There is no obligation on me at any time to support Deputy De Rossa or to make any apology for not supporting him.  Our party have expressed their view on the dual mandate question.  Unlike the other two parties we did not have any member who during a period of five years in Europe carried the dual mandate.  Even to the extent that the Minister might have offered the name of Miss Síle de Valera, our party had decided already that they would hold the dual mandate only until the general election following the elections to Europe. That is how it was and that is how it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Owen that it is unfortunate that because of the approach of people to the European Parliament, because of the fact that they have not been very enamoured of the lack of respect that parties may have shown in their approach to membership of that parliament, they will not be very enthusiastic on June 14.  As has been indicated, the people will be asked to vote also on a specific issue on that day. It is unfortunate that we are not to have the additional encouragement of the local elections.  I appreciate that the question <Col N="472" /> of local elections is not embodied in the Bill we are discussing but it is accepted by all parties that there has been some difficulty in the matter of attracting the voters.  Undoubtedly, if the local elections were to be held on the same day as the European elections there would be a bigger and a better poll than will be the case otherwise.  Perhaps it was the view of the Government that one setback on one day would be enough.  They are not looking forward to the results of the European elections nor are they anticipating a favourable outcome from their point of view of the local elections but that is not the point.  The people are entitled to the opportunity at prescribed times of indicating their views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the matter of the alternates.  The legislation proposes that the number of replacement candidates will be two more than the number of candidates standing for each party, while the proposal is for a total of three in the case of an Independent.  It is well known that every candidate will be regarded as an alternative, though it is a foregone conclusion that at least one and possibly two will be elected.  In so far as it is impossible to indicate beforehand which candidate might not be chosen, <Col N="473" /> every party, I expect, will nominate their three candidates as the first three alternatives. Technically one could argue that that will not happen but it is the reality. That would mean that, say, in respect of our party in Dublin there would be only two more candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why one Independent is being allowed nominate two more candidates.  On that basis one would take it that where there are three candidates standing for a party, there should be at least six candidates proposed. Therefore, I do not know what the thinking is in regard to the situation of an Independent.  I suppose we may take it that in the sense of political reality, one elected as an Independent is more likely to remain for the duration.  There is always the danger of him or her being called to the higher Parliament above, but ordinarily an Independent will not be called on to take part in government. Perhaps when replying the Minister will indicate why it is considered necessary to allow two alternatives in the case of an Independent candidate.  In other words, in the case of an Independent there will be three alternatives whereas in respect of three party candidates there may be a total of only five.  Would it not be advisable to embody in the legislation a provision which would guarantee that any candidate would automatically be an alternative and then proceed to provide for the additions?  That would be a basic element of the whole matter for each party.  In regard to Dublin, for instance, it would be our hope that our three candidates would be elected.  That would give us only two alternatives.  Earlier I had a more optimistic view about that but I have reconsidered it since.  It was on the basis of the provision that the maximum number of replacement candidates on any list be two more than the number of candidates that our spokesman, Deputy Molloy, was asking the Government to extend the number to four.  I have listened with interest to Deputy Owen pursuing the same point and suggesting some middle ground proposition to the Minister that it should be three.  I am not too sure that there would be any great satisfaction on this side of the House with <Col N="474" /> three.  We think the minimum should be four.  I do not see that it makes any tremendous difference.</P>
    <P>It is better to guarantee the position of all candidates and all parties by increasing the maximum number to four.  You can never find yourself in any difficulty if you accommodate a number which you feel is greater than that required.  You can find yourself in difficulty if the number is too small.  Is there a provision in the legislation where three candidates of a party are elected and for one reason or another they are not available?  Is it the position that you only have two replacements? I do not know.  I have not studied the Bill sufficiently to know where the third or fourth come from.  Suppose the two replacements are obliged to opt out, what happens?  Will it not be a very involved system?  Is it not far better to extend the number initially to the point where you can safely presume that you have covered all eventualities, rather than getting involved in the intricacies of what might be an unlikely happening?</P>
    <P>I do not want to confuse the issue.  Our position was expressed adequately and eloquently by Bobby Molloy.  We do not want to make this legislation controversial. We are anxious to co-operate with the Minister in getting it through the House as expeditiously as possible.  There should be no great difficulty for the Minister in agreeing to the proposition made by our spokesman, Bobby Molloy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is greater than the friendship which exists between some members of the Deputy's party and himself. <Col N="475" /> I do not know whether they tell him that to his face, but they have told me. However, that is by the way.  There is an unfortunate tradition in the House to resist propositions coming from the other side.  This tendency is disappearing, thankfully.  I hope the Minister will see the merit in our proposition that the number should be four instead of two &mdash; the number of candidates plus four.  That would accommodate the wishes of all the major parties.  I cannot speak for Deputy De Rossa's party.  I do not know whether they are interested in that aspect.  It can be demonstrated that it is a safer and a wiser proposition than the present proposal.</P>
      <P>To return to the note on which I started, I believe membership of one parliament should be and is sufficiently demanding on anybody.  The political realities are such that I see that as being desirable.  I might change my mind if there was a guarantee that this Parliament would last for a period in excess of some years.  Then I would advocate that there should be no question of a dual mandate even in the short term.  One point should be mentioned in defence of a partial dual mandate.  The European Parliament is a very important forum. People who go there after a period in this House are in a better position to advance the cause of Ireland than people who have not been involved in home politics at local or parliamentary level.  I know this from my own experience at different conferences on the Continent and elsewhere. I would hate to have been thrust into any of those conferences straight from my headmastership in a school. People in other professions would feel the same disability if called upon to speak for the voters in any constituency.  They would find it more difficult than those of us who have enjoyed membership of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the dual mandate is unattractive to me, until such time as we can devise a formula to cover the eventualities we will go along with it.  Suppose a Member of this House were elected and he or she relinquished the seat at home, the writ would have to be moved.  There is no <Col N="476" /> guarantee that the motion would be carried. I do not think at that stage the highest democratic considerations would obtain in the matter of whether or not there should be a by-election.  All in all, I am happy to stay with the position as it is, providing that, after the first general election following the European elections, people who have been elected to Europe and are still Members of this House will be required to opt for one or the other.</P>

      <P>The Bill before us provides a new procedure for filling casual vacancies in our representation in the European Assembly.  Considerable thought has gone into devising a method suitable for our own electoral system and for our colleagues in Europe.  I commend the Government for bringing in this Bill. It is no secret that for some time members of the Credentials Committee of the Assembly have made known their dissatisfaction with our system of filling vacancies, that of Dáil nomination.</P>
      <P>The legislation before us is, relatively speaking, non-controversial, as Deputy Tunney pointed out.  However, I suggest it bears particular relevance to the Fianna Fáil Party because it has not gone unnoticed that the policy which that party appears to be pursuing in European Assembly elections is of putting their political heavyweights in the front line in most constituencies to ensure the capture of seats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea seems to be that in the not too distant future they could abdicate the seat and allow others in the line up who may not have made it in their own right, perhaps through inexperience or other good reasons, to hold down the seat and come back to Leinster House to continue as if nothing had happened. I suppose there is nothing wrong with that but perhaps it is a little mischievous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time my party did not believe in the dual mandate.  We have no monopoly in wisdom regarding this or <Col N="477" /> any other matter and we do not pretend to have.  However, experience has shown us that it is not practical to hold down two seats in two different parliaments and give of your best to both.  In our position here naturally first preference would be given to what is going on in this House.  If you are continually watching legislation, the voting situation, party strengths and jetting back to Dublin, obviously issues in Europe must be neglected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney and others pointed out that, in principle, they are not in favour of the dual mandate either but they have no option, that is the general tenor of their arguments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In one breath Deputy Tunney mentioned political realities and in the next he said we might have a general election at any time.  He is around this House long enough to know what the political realities are and there is no need for that sort of nonsense.  He also referred to Mr. Richie Ryan's castigation of the dual mandate when he addressed Young Fine Gael.  As I pointed out, our party have changed their view on this matter. We have decided that to treat Europe with due seriousness and to ensure our representation in the best way possible, the ideal situation is to have people among our workforce in Europe who are not constantly keeping an eye on what is happening at home.  Mr. Richie Ryan put the case extremely well to Young Fine Gael; he was not taking advantage of their youth as was suggested.  He was speaking to politically aware young people who were looking for the benefit of his wisdom after so many years in different political careers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Those two gentlemen, who are very politically experienced, will be making their decisions before the next <Col N="478" /> Dáil election.  That is well known and is no secret.  Our party have been quite clear on that matter and those Deputies understand the basis of the decision, the principle involved and, I venture to suggest, would not disagree.  We could quite easily have played the game to our own advantage if it had been politically opportune and allowed our party's view on the dual mandate to stand if we did not look first to the best interest of our representation in the European Assembly.  We could have lined up our political heavyweights, we have a tremendous list of candidates in the constituencies, but we could have topped it off with a few exMinisters and long standing members of our party to ensure that we maximised our position and seats.  We could have had an unwritten rule that they would opt out and allow the second or third in line to take the seat as Fianna Fáil intend doing.  However, we accepted the situation as it stands and have opted for what I believe is the best of the two possible worlds involved.  We have before us what the Government consider the best method of filling any casual vacancy which may occur.  I agree, in principle, with the different sections which preserve the true philosophy of PR.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, we could have considered other systems where the single transferable vote is used directly.  We could have considered &mdash; I suppose we still can &mdash; the possibility of looking back at the number two candidate in the event of a vacancy occuring, going through all the ballot papers again and redistributing them on a strict PR basis.  I suppose this would be the purest and most democratic way of doing it but, although it is done in other countries, it would be totally impracticable here.  Our Euro constituencies are extremely large and the prospect of holding ballot papers for anything up to five years, sifting through them all and having a recount whenever a vacancy occurred, would not be very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The selection of replacement candidates will be left to individual political parties and non-party candidates.  I agree fully with Deputy Tunney on his questioning of the <i>rationale</i> behind an Independent being allowed to nominate two <Col N="479" /> more candidates in the event of his vacating the seat in Europe.  How can a true Independent nominate two other people?  If there are three of them they are a party or group of some sort and they are no longer independent in that sense.  They may be independent of party politics but a true Independent is independent of other individuals also.  He stands for his own viewpoint.  I find it hard to appreciate how this system might work even if we felt that an Independent merited two substitutes as it were, which I do not quite understand and I should like the Minister to elaborate on this.  I also agree with the many speakers who felt that the two extra names which political parties can add to their list of candidates as substitutes should be stretched to four.  There can be many reasons, apart from those which are deliberate or contrived, why people might be vacating seats in Europe which could cause casual vacancies &mdash; job opportunities at home, promotion, a seat in the Cabinet, death and many more.  To limit the number of substitutes to only two more than the number of candidates is unnecessarily restrictive.  I hope we will never need to use more than two or, indeed, not even to use two but in the event of it happening there would be great difficulty in resolving the situation and perhaps unnecessary legislation would be introduced in this House.  At present the suggestion that we extend the number to four seems to get around all the objections with regard to this legislation.</P>
    <P>The political composition of the Assembly as established by the people at a general election is regarded as being of considerable importance and I agree fully with this.  Perhaps we could even discuss whether the system we are talking about at present should be considered at local and even Dáil elections.  There is no doubt that perhaps members of political parties would be least likely to favour this but perhaps the electorate would welcome such a list if it came to filling any political vacancy in either House.  Perhaps we can discuss this in the future.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out, there would be no obligation on either the Independents or <Col N="480" /> the political parties to present this list. The number of names on the list will be limited to two.  I trust the Minister will have another look at this in the light of what Deputies on different sides of the House have pointed out.  Subject to this limit, the number of replacements to be nominated is a matter for the party or the candidate concerned.  They will also decide whether some or all of the candidates nominated in the constituency should be named on the list of replacements. The order of names on the list will be decided by the party or Independent candidate concerned.  If candidates are included on the list, it would be a matter for the party to decide their placing on this list.  I find myself in disagreement with that suggestion.  I think preference on the substitute list should be given to anyone who puts himself or herself before the electorate as compared with those who have not tested their situation directly.  I wonder if there is any way we could tighten up on this?</P>
    <P>I should like to see some system evolve whereby we could reflect in the list of names on the panel the way each candidate performed at the polls.  In other words, if a candidate is elected to Europe and the next candidate from that party is placed No. 4 on the list, it would be difficult to justify this to the public when we are presenting this legislation to uphold our philosophy of PR generally. The list of candidates should be in order of their showing at the polls.  This will present some difficulties, as the closing date for submission of the lists will be before polling day but perhaps we could see if there was any way to resolve that difficulty and so reflect as near as possible the wishes of the electorate when it comes to electing candidates and filling any vacancies that may occur subsequently.</P>
    <P>According to the legislation before us, once the replacement list is presented to the returning officer the order of names on it cannot be changed.  I am asking the Minister to look at that point to see if he can accommodate the direct reflection of our PR system.  Provision is also made that where two candidates are included in a replacement list and the one placed lower on the list receives more votes in <Col N="481" /> the election the order on the list will not be affected.  I do not agree with that.  We are told that a list may be withdrawn and replaced by a new list within the period for receiving nominations.  However, this will not get over my objection as it will be prior to the polling day.  We are told that subject to this, all the replacement candidates of a party in a constituency must be included in a single list and the eligibility requirement for the replacement candidate will be the same as for any candidate.  A person may not be nominated as a replacement candidate in more than one constituency.</P>
    <P>The two points I question and on which I should like the Minister to expand are the number of extra names we can add to the list as far as political parties are concerned in addition to the actual candidates. I should like to see the two proposed extended to four for the reasons I have outlined.  Once the count is over and we know how our candidates have fared, I should like us to be in a position to reflect that fact in the pecking order on our substitutes list.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate. There have been a number of useful and constructive suggestions and I should like to express my appreciation.  I shall deal with a few points that arose before I deal with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzsimons referred to the musical chairs engaged in by my party and I should like to deal with that point. He spoke in rather harsh terms about substitutions carried out by the Labour Party in respect of the European Parliament. However, for those people who have not heard the other side of the story it is only fair that the matter be clarified. When we fought in that election &mdash; I was a candidate then &mdash; we fought under the slogan of putting our best people forward for Europe.  As it turned out, four out of six of our candidates were elected to the European Parliament, to the surprise of many people including our opponents. Shortly afterwards after a general election and when a Coalition Government was formed, Deputy Michael O'Leary <Col N="482" /> who was a member of the European Parliament was made Tánaiste, Deputy Eileen Desmond who was also an MEP was made Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy John O'Connell was elected Ceann Comhairle and I was made Minister for Labour.  The slogan under which we fought turned out to have some truth, that we had sent some of our best people to Europe.  We had to get them back and they had to be replaced.</P>
    <P>There is nothing unusual about this. The same thing happened with the change of government in France when quite a number of the people there who were elected to the European Parliament were named Ministers in the present Socialist Government.  I should like to assure everyone who is running for the European Parliament that after they get some experience in Europe they may be required for the front bench of their party.  In our case Deputy Cluskey was brought back from Europe to become Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism and Deputy Pattison became Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare.  European experience is an advantage when the call comes to Members of the European Parliament to return home.</P>
    <P>In one way it is an argument for the dual mandate.  We deal with Europe every day and it is an advantage for a Minister to have been a member of the European Parliament.  Commissioner Dalsager who visited Dublin recently was a Danish member of the European Parliament when I was there.  Many members from France, Italy and Germany have gone back to their own Parliaments and have taken up senior positions in their Governments and in that respect at least it has proved a very useful exercise. I think it was a little unfair of Deputy Fitzsimons and Deputy Tunney to be so hard on the Labour Party.  Our party were not engaging in musical chairs but we were providing the Dáil and the Government with Ministers who had valuable experience on the European front.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa and others spoke about voting on Sunday and Deputy Owen asked me specifically to deal with this point.  She said that all the European <Col N="483" /> countries should vote on the same day but we cannot control what others do.  In this country it is traditional to vote on a Wednesday or Thursday even though on rare occasions there have been elections on a Tuesday.  We asked the opinion of one section who deserve to be considered because they have a certain influence over making polling stations available.  I am referring to the religious groupings who have their own opinion with regard to Sunday observance.  We asked for the opinion of all religious groupings about this matter and a few of the minor religious groupings in this part of the island were not in favour of voting on Sunday and when we found that out we considered it better to leave that position over at least for the moment.  We considered it better not to have Sunday voting when there were certain groupings who considered it was not in line with their beliefs. Because of those beliefs they would find it difficult to put at our disposal some of the schools they would normally have made available to us for weekday elections so we returned to the Thursday voting.  It is something we can look at in the future.  Sunday voting might not be to everybody's advantage.</P>

      <P>I made the point during the debate on the Minister's Estimate that we should have elections on a Sunday.  I did not know the situation had been investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We investigated it.  I am sure the Deputy would agree with me that we would not want to see any particular grouping having a strong opinion against it and people staying away from voting for that particular reason or any other reason.  We will be dealing with the rights of other people to vote later on in the evening.  We will also be dealing with voting for the handicapped and disabled later and I will leave it over until then.  I will deal with the dual mandate shortly. <Col N="484" /> A point was made about spoiled votes and Deputy Fitzsimons said I suggested Irish people were not sophisticated in their voting habits.  I would like to point out that on the last occasion when the European elections were held local elections were held on the same day.  It meant three ballot papers in some urban city areas.  This resulted in an increase in the number of spoiled votes.  This was three times the number we find in Dáil elections. I do not accept that this had to do completely with confusion.  I know that anybody who looked at the votes being counted found various suggestions written on them about the candidates which disqualified those votes.  A lot of the increase in the number of spoiled votes could be put down to the fact of trying to vote for 27 candidates or more in an urban area, 19 in a county council area and 12 to 15 in a European election which was a bit cumbersome.  When so many people leave their voting to the last hour or one and-a-half hours of the closure time it means a type of EI Salvadorean election where everybody rushes in at the last minute demanding voting papers while other people take up to ten minutes to fill out their voting papers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the turn-out being low because the local elections are not being held.  I hold the view that if the European elections are to be seen as totally European they should not need the crutch of some other elections to bring out the electorate.  It is up to candidates in the forthcoming European elections and those supporting candidates to ensure that people are motivated by the campaign and that people are got out to vote. The issues in Europe are very important to us.  This week we had the super-levy issue.  This means we must have representation in Europe of the highest calibre and it is important not only for farmers but for people in every part of the country to see that the Irish representation sent to Europe has a very strong mandate.  I believe we will see a satisfactory turn-out so that the members who are sent out to Europe know that they have the backing of the vast majority of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa said that only 50 per cent of the people turned out to vote in <Col N="485" /> a recent by-election.  That does not take in any way from the qualification of the person elected but it is satisfactory if we see a good turn-out.  I would not like to feel that the turn-out for the European elections depended on some other election issue which brought people out and then they voted for the European candidates. It is quite likely this election will stand on its own feet and people will decide on Irish issues which have a European dimension.  I hope there will be a very large turn-out on the day.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in opening the debate, it is necessary for us to review our existing arrangement for filling casual vacancies in the Assembly because of the reservations expressed about it by the Credentials Committee of the Assembly.  There are particular difficulties in devising a method of filling casual vacancies which will be compatible with our unique electoral system and at the same time will be seen to be fully in keeping with the requirement that representatives to the Assembly be elected by direct universal suffrage.</P>
    <P>The two methods of filling vacancies which we are familiar with in this country are by-elections in the case of Dáil vacancies and co-option in the case of vacancies in local authority membership.  Neither of them is really suitable in the context of Assembly elections.  For this reason we had to look elsewhere for a solution.  I make no extravagant claims about the arrangement proposed in the Bill but I think it does represent a reasonable solution in the particular circumstances in which we are placed.  It is a fair system, it will preserve the proportional representation of the parties as established by the democratic vote of the people at the elections.  It will be simple to operate and allows a fair degree of flexibility.  On these grounds I can be confident in recommending it to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney raised the question of whether the proposed method will be acceptable to the appropriate European authorities.  He hinted fairly strongly that there was a possibility that the Credentials Committee might take the view that the arrangements we are not proposing might not meet in full the committee's <Col N="486" /> original reservations.  He pointed out that one of the factors in the situation is that, by the time any vacancy falls to be filled under the arrangements we are now proposing, a new Credentials Committee and, indeed, a new Parliament will be in office.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House that in the preparation of the present proposals appropriate soundings were taken at European level.  Arising from these approaches I have no reason to anticipate that our arrangements will not be acceptable. Indeed, there is reason to believe that our proposals will be welcomed as a genuine and conscientious response to the reservations originally expressed by the committee.</P>
    <P>Looking at our proposals objectively it is difficult to see how fault could be found with them from the democratic viewpoint. They are clearly in line with the concept of direct elections.  The replacement candidates will be formally nominated. The lists will be formally published so that the names of the replacement candidates will be known to the electorate. Electors will be aware that in voting for a particular candidate they will also be expressing approval for the relevant list of replacements.  The concept of replacement candidates is not new.  It has been used in one form or another in individual member states of the EEC.  It is therefore a method with which many of our European colleagues will be familiar and is without doubt compatible with the concept of direct elections.</P>
    <P>The question of having the names of the replacement candidates on the ballot papers was raised by Deputy Manning and others.  What is involved here is not just a technical problem.  Basically it is the practical consideration of keeping the ballot paper as simple as possible from the elector's point of view. Already our electors are required to indicate fairly sophisticated choices.  The elector's role is acknowledged to be far more substantial under our system than under other electoral methods.  Deputy Manning has a wide knowledge of electoral systems and I am sure he is aware that in some instances not even the names <Col N="487" /> of all the candidates, let alone any substitute candidates, appear on the ballot paper.  I am thinking particularly of the German parliamentary elections.  Even in that situation, of the first names on the list &mdash; and about five names appear on the whole list &mdash; some rarely take up their seats in the European Parliament but rather pass them on to somebody lower down on the list.  Therefore in my view our system is much fairer than that.  I do not see that our proposed arrangements can be faulted on this ground.  It is important that we preserve a sense of proportion: we are, after all, dealing, not with the election itself but with arrangements for filling casual vacancies which may or may not arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy and other Deputies have drawn attention to the proposals in relation to the number of replacement candidates allowed in each constituency. The Bill provides that the upper limit for any replacement candidates' list will be two names more than the number of candidates of the party in the constituency, or a total of three in the case of a non-party candidate.  The question of deciding the number of replacement candidates is a matter of judgment.  If we set too high an upper-limit we risk creating the possibility of a high turnover of Irish representatives in the Assembly.  The House will be aware that individual parties in some of the other member states made it a matter of deliberate policy to rotate their seats in the Assembly.  There is no suggestion that any of the parties here would wish to adopt that practice.  Nonetheless the practice is undesirable and we should be careful not to create the conditions for it in our legislative provisions. On the other hand, if the limit on the number of replacement candidates were set too low we could be faced with a situation where replacement candidates' lists might be exhausted.  This situation, too, would be obviously undesirable.  In arriving at a figure for use as a limit we have attempted to reach a compromise between these two extremes.  However, there is nothing sacrosanct about the particular limit specified in the Bill.  Having regard to what was said here last week <Col N="488" /> and today, I have had another look at the matter and propose to move an amendment on Committee Stage designed to increase the limit from two to four more than the number of candidates of the party in the constituency.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the fall-back situation described at Section 6 (c).  Under this provision, where a list is exhausted or no list has been presented by the party or candidate concerned, the Dáil may select a replacement from another list presented for the constituency.  I must emphasise that this situation will arise only if there is an actual vacancy and the party concerned either did not present a list or the list presented by the party is exhausted.  Clearly we are talking about a very remote possibility, particularly if the proposal to raise the limit is accepted. Nonetheless it is considered prudent that the law should recognise the possibility and make provision for it.  In these particular circumstances &mdash; and in these circumstances only &mdash; the Dáil may select a replacement candidate from another list for the constituency.  I would emphasise that the word used is &ldquo;may&rdquo; not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. The Dáil will not be obliged to make a selection.  It will be open to them to leave the seat vacant.  One could visualise a situation where it might be undesirable that our representation in Europe should be weakened because of a vacancy.  For this reason it is thought proper to have a fall-back position to meet what is admittedly a rather remote possibility.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked for further information on particular aspects of the proposed arrangement for filling vacancies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy asked if a candidate may contest more than one constituency at an election to the European Assembly. Section 9 (2) of the 1977 Act provides that a candidate may contest only one constituency.  He also inquired about local returning officers.  This is covered by Section 14 of the 1977 Act.  There is a local returning officer for each county and county borough, that is the appropriate county registrar or sheriff.  In effect Euro elections are conducted on the basis of counties and not on Dáil constituencies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy also inquired about <Col N="489" /> how the lists would be referred to on ballot papers and what publicity would be given to the lists.  In the case of each list, the returning officer will assign an identifying letter or letters to it.  The list will be referred to on ballot papers and notices by reference to these letters.  It may be expected that the letters assigned to a list will be the initials or abbreviations by which the party is known.  In the case of a non-party list the identifying letters are likely to be the initials of the candidate.  It must be emphasised that the letters to be assigned will be a matter for the returning officer.</P>
    <P>The replacement candidates lists will be published in the Statutory Notice of poll issued by the returning officer in advance of the election.  The method of publishing this notice is a matter for the returning officer.  In 1979 it was published in the daily newspapers.  It is likely that this method will be used again on this occasion.  Returning officers will be advised, in addition, to publish it by way of posters displayed throughout the constituency and at the polling stations on polling day.</P>
    <P>Questions have also been raised concerning the way in which a replacement candidate is, on the occurrence of a vacancy in the Assembly, deemed elected.  On the occurrence of a vacancy the Clerk of the Dáil will write to the party to ascertain who is first on the appropriate list of replacements.  This places on the party the onus of certifying that the replacement candidate is eligible and ready to serve in the Assembly.  In the case of a non-party vacancy &mdash; where no party structure would exist &mdash; the Clerk of the Dáil will communicate with the returning officer for the constituency concerned.  The returning officer in turn, will contact one or more of the persons named on the appropriate replacement list with a view to ascertaining who, of those eligible and available to serve, is highest on the list.  In effect, the onus of giving a certificate to this effect will rest on the replacement candidate in question.</P>
    <P>With regard to the verification of ballot paper accounts, the arrangements proposed in the Bill are being provided on <Col N="490" /> the advice of returning officers.  They assure me that it would be more convenient if verification were carried out at county or county borough level rather than at Euro constituency level.</P>
    <P>The 1977 Act provided that the verification of ballot paper accounts would be carried out at one centre in each of the Euro constituencies.  However, as the House will recall, the European elections in 1979 were held on the same day as the local elections and the same ballot boxes were used at the two elections.  It was necessary, therefore, to open the ballot boxes in each county and county borough. Provision for this was made in regulations made by the Minister under section 91 of the Electoral Act, 1963 which gives the Minister special powers to enable two or more polls to be taken together.  The regulations also provided that in verifying the European ballot paper accounts, the papers were kept face downwards.  This represents the net difference between what was done in 1979 and what is proposed now.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the time for carrying out the verification will be fixed by the local returning officer.  I would anticipate that the process will take place on Friday morning after the Thursday election.  It is proposed that the verification will be carried out in the normal way, in particular, that the ballot papers will be kept face upwards, and the agents of candidates will, of course, be entitled to attend.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that this arrangement will enable the agents of the candidates, who will have the right to be present, to make informal assessments as regards the possible outcome of the election. The question has been asked whether there may be a possible conflict between this arrangement and the requirement in the European statute that counting of votes must not commence until voting everywhere is concluded.  I must stress that in verifying ballot paper accounts only the numbers of ballot papers found in each ballot box are counted.  There is no question of sorting these papers in accordance with the first preferences shown on each of them or of counting the votes marked on the ballot <Col N="491" /> paper for any candidate.  I am assured that there is no conflict between the arrangement proposed and the requirement of the European statute which provides that the counting of votes shall not commence until the voting in all member states is completed.</P>

The returning officer could, of course, begin to do this as soon as the ballot boxes are sealed on the night of the count but it would be more appropriate that he start the next morning.  I would see the verifying of the ballot papers in each county and county borough taking place on the Friday morning.</P>

      <P>Yes.  As regards the dual mandate, article 5 of the European Act of 20 September 1976 concerning direct elections to the Assembly states that the office of representative in the Assembly shall be compatible with membership of the parliament of a member state.  On a straightforward reading of this provision it would seem that it would not be open to a member in its national law either to forbid the dual mandate or make it obligatory.  That is how this provision is interpreted here and that was the line taken by the Minister in reply to a parliamentary question on 20 January 1984 in arguing that to forbid the dual mandate would conflict with this provision and that it is not open to a member state to do so in its national law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are differing views as to the desirability of the dual mandate.  Some hold that the preservation of the link, development and collaboration between national parliaments and the Assembly are important and that the dual mandate helps in this regard.  In the early days <Col N="492" /> some countries, particularly Denmark, considered that their dual mandate should be obligatory.  Most hold the view that it should be left to the voter in each member state to decide whether the dual mandate could be accepted in individual cases.  In this country it is a matter for individual political parties to decide on. It is generally agreed that the elimination of the dual mandate would only come about progressively after a transitional period.  The incidence of casual vacancies in Ireland's representation in the Assembly would be greatly reduced if all political parties decided that their members should seek to discharge the dual mandate. A procedure would still be necessary for the filling of casual vacancies.</P>
    <P>It can be seen that there would be some conflict between the passing of a Bill here to forbid the dual mandate and what is regarded as European law.  It is left to each party to decide whether they wish to continue the dual mandate.  That will be the position in the coming elections. If one party wish to take some advantage out of that it is up to them to do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House provides us with a simple and effective means of filling vacancies in Ireland's representation in the Assembly.  It also provides for certain desirable amendments of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977.  I thank Deputies for their reception of the measure and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 4, to delete all words after &ldquo;regarded,&rdquo; to the end of the section, and substitute:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" />&ldquo;(a)  a member of Dáil Éireann, or</P>
    <P>(b)  holds the office of Chairman or Deputy Chairman of Seanad Éireann, shall on such election, or, in case he is to be so regarded, on the day on which he commences to be so regarded, cease to hold that office.</P>
    <P>(3)  If while he is a representative in the Assembly a person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  becomes subject to any of the disqualifications applicable to membership of Dáil Éireann, or</P>
    <P>(b)  becomes a member of Dáil Éireann, or</P>
    <P>(c)  becomes the holder of any office mentioned in subsections (1) or (2) of this section,</P>
    <P>he shall thereupon cease to be a representative in the Assembly.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section deals with the dual mandate and our amendment proposes to amend it.  In his reply, the Minister said that The Workers' Party, or whatever party oppose the dual mandate, were trying to draw some advantage from that.  I have already dealt with our attitude to the dual mandate on the basis that, one MEP who is active in the European Parliament is opposed to the dual mandate and has said it is impossible to carry out the duties of the European Parliament and those of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The debate today relating to the dual mandate also brought out the point made by Deputy Tunney that he felt the abolition of the dual mandate on election could lead to a number of by-elections. That would be true only if the candidates were also Members of the Dáil.  If our amendment is passed, parties who have already selected Deputies would have second thoughts.  I have no doubt that if there was a system of substitution for the Dáil rather than by-elections there might be a higher turn-over of Deputies.  The fact that an individual has to face re-election in a by-election if a Deputy retires or dies is a break from the musical chair approach adopted in the last European Parliament by one party.</P>
    <P>In his reaction to criticism of the dual mandate, the Minister implied that to <Col N="494" /> outlaw it would be in conflict with the 1976 European legislation.  I have referred to the fact that two members of the EEC, Belgium and Greece, already have outlawed the dual mandate and I have not heard of any effort in the EEC to bring either Belgium or Greece before the European Parliament, the Commission or the European courts because they are in breach of the EEC law or EEC rules and regulations.  Any reasonable reading of the quotation that the Minister read that the dual mandate is not incompatible will reveal that it is simply a statement saying that one or the other, either a single or dual mandate process, is compatible with EEC laws.  To draw from that an argument that we would be in breach in some way of EEC regulations if we abolish the dual mandate is stretching things a bit far.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to accept the amendment which The Workers' Party are putting down.  If, as may be the case, the amendment in the Minister's view is not technically as tight as it ought to be, perhaps he will bring in an amendment which would achieve the aim of our amendment.  I argue strongly that no Member of this House should adopt the attitude of Deputy Tunney who argues theoretically on the one hand that he disagrees with the dual mandate and on the other hand that he must face political realities.  It gives rise to the kind of cynicism that I have already spoken about when public representatives in this House bear theoretical positions and then proceed to act contrary to their expressed opinions and views.  I ask the Minister to give sincere consideration to accepting the amendment and to ensure not only that Deputies who would be elected to the European Parliament would automatically resign from the Dáil but if in future MEPs stand for the Dáil and are elected to the Dáil that they in turn resign from the European Parliament.  It is the only logical and sane approach to the question of the dual mandate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment would be to forbid the dual mandate for Dáil Members but not for Members <Col N="495" /> of Seanad Éireann.  I repeat that article 5 of the European Act of 20 September 1976 concerning direct elections to the Assembly states: &ldquo;The office of representative in the Assembly shall be compatible with membership of the Parliament of a member state&rdquo;.  On a straightforward reading this provision would seem to mean that it would not be open to a member state in its national law either to forbid the dual mandate or to make it obligatory.  That is how the provision is interpreted here.</P>
      <P>In our view, to forbid the dual mandate would be to conflict with this provision and it would not be open to a member state to do so in its national law.  In this country it is regarded as a matter for individual political parties to decide, and I think this is the answer to the Deputy. Political parties if they so decide can do this.  I do not intend any slight, but in the election campaign I am sure this will be made quite an issue.  Some parts of it that are regarded by Deputy De Rossa as not being fair or honest, putting in what is acceptable to many Irish people, that one should have two jobs, two salaries, two pensions or something like that, will be made an argument during the election and will perhaps bring about a decision for this matter to be changed by individual parties.  A transitional period is required for this to be adopted in.  Deputy Tunney was right in one respect in saying that the last European election was rather a new experience for us all.  A Bill was brought up to run that election.  We found some shortcomings in it and it is likely that this is the last time that a European election will be run on that basis.  I expect changes will be made in Europe.  I expected them to be made for this election but they were not brought about by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that in the next European election we will have a uniform system, that things will be different in that election and that this will be the only occasion on which we must consider the various items not only under this dual mandate but under the whole casual vacancy situation. At any rate, it is the duty of the political parties to make a policy decision in this <Col N="496" /> area and to hold to that.  When we in the Labour Party proceeded to hold seats both in Europe and here in the Dáil the Opposition Members made great play about this and were making it a virtue that they should not have dual member candidates.  Now they are faced with the situation where an election is coming up and it is in their interest to make sure that they have the best candidates, perhaps better-known candidates who are in the House.  It would be interesting to see if these candidates are elected and if so whether they will do what as I understood Deputy Tunney to say, that in the next election he will opt for Europe and he will hold only one mandate.  If other candidates of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Fitzsimons, Deputy MacSharry and other Deputies on that side are elected, I hope they will give the assurance too, and then people will know where they stand.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with realities.  Some member states have taken a different view on the dual mandate.  I understand that Greece has forbidden the dual mandate in its national law and that a Bill recently approved by Parliament in Belgium proposes to do something similar.  It is not known whether European authorities propose to do anything about this apparent conflict between European and national law.  I would imagine that we will have to wait for some consideration at Commission or Council of Ministers level.  I have given the interpretation that this country makes of the law and I am asking the Dáil to reject this amendment.</P>

My information is that at the moment something like 11 Deputies in this House have been selected apart from other candidates to contest the 15 seats for this State, there are something like 434 Members in the European Parliament and in the region of 20 of those have the dual mandate at the moment.  Does the Minister <Col N="497" /> think that the European Parliament itself has decided by an overwhelming majority that the dual mandate is not on?  Does he also agree that the Belgians and the Greeks are just as likely to be right in their interpretation of the 1976 Act of the European Parliament and that to date there has been no challenge to Greece or Belgium on their law outlawing the dual mandate?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that Members, if not from his own party certainly from the Government side, have admitted that it is impossible to do the two jobs effectively?  An examination of the number of days on which some Deputies attend who have a dual mandate shows that, in practice, they cannot serve both parliaments.  The European Parliament sits for something like 200 days a year and it is physically impossible adequately to serve a Dáil constituency, attending here and participating in the business of legislating and at the same time attend adequately to the business of the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>The advice is that it is not open to us to forbid the dual mandate. To do so would be in conflict with the European statute.  We must, therefore, reject this amendment.

I have considered these proposals and I feel that such an increase can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>Our object in placing a limit on the number of replacement candidates is to prevent a rapid turnover of Irish representation in the European Assembly.

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The five minutes I have do not give me time to go into all the reasons for the Bill.  The most immediate one is the failure of the Government to introduce a Bill of their own to extend postal voting to the disabled.  It would be an important electoral reform, and it has <Col N="500" /> been recognised for many years.  In March last year the working party report suggested that postal voting should be extended to the disabled and to those who could prove they were sick and unable to attend at polling stations.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that the Bill is too broad in its scope because it includes persons on disability benefit.  I argue that that is a minor point.  The Bill could be amended easily on Committee Stage.  There is no reason whatsoever for the Government to oppose the Bill.  On previous occasions they have allowed Private Members' Bills to go through and at a particular Stage have opposed them or have allowed them to go into Select Committee.</P>
      <P>It has been argued there would be administrative difficulties in implementing postal voting for the disabled between now and 14 June, the date for the European elections.  I do not accept that argument, because quite a number of complicated Bills have gone through the House in a matter of hours.  For instance, a Bill dealing with the PMPA was introduced one morning and went through all Stages in this House and in the Seanad and was law before the night was out.  Therefore there is no reason why this Bill could not be dealt with quickly.  There are always administrative difficulties when the Government do not want to get up off their backsides and do something.  If the Department of the Environment has the political will, and if the political head of the Department has the will, to see the Bill implemented, it could be law in time for the EEC elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been argued that there could be abuses, that on previous occasions there was widespread abuse of postal voting. The last time it was introduced for the disabled was for the local elections in 1974.  The working party on the register of elections have been quite clear that there is no evidence there was widespread abuse at that time.  During debates here a number of Deputies complained there had been abuse, but that did not take the form of prosecutions before the courts.  There is no evidence that there was abuse of postal voting.  Postal voting is an important right which would give <Col N="501" /> the dignity to the disabled to which they are entitled.  Many of them, even if they had postal voting rights, would still want to go to the polling stations to cast their votes, and they would still be entitled to do that.  I appeal to the Government not to oppose the Bill.  They could introduce amendments to make the Bill more effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the House on 28 February that the question of postal voting was being examined by the Government and I hoped to bring forward proposals in the near future.  I would like to make it clear that this remains the position. Comprehensive proposals on postal voting are being prepared which will strike a sensible balance between the requirements of those who seek postal voting and the necessity to provide adequate safeguards against abuse.</P>
      <P>However, the time constraint is such that it will not be possible to have fully developed proposals in operation in time for the European Elections.  It will be recalled that the Taoiseach informed the House to this effect on the 1 March.</P>
      <P>An effective approach to postal voting demands that it be considered on a comprehensive basis.  Disabled persons obviously deserve sympathetic consideration, but we must bear in mind that they are only one of the categories seeking postal voting.  Requests for special voting facilities have been made on behalf of many other categories, for example, persons such as commercial travellers, seamen and transport workers who are unable to vote in person because of the nature of their employment.  Special facilities have also been sought on behalf of persons required to live abroad for the purposes of their occupation, diplomats and their families, employees of State enterprises and many others.  A serious examination of postal voting must take account of the position of each of these categories.  A piecemeal approach dealing with a single category could hardly be said to address the problem seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Postal voting is particularly susceptible to abuse.  We recall our own experience at the 1974 local elections.  Reports vary <Col N="502" /> as to the extent of the abuse which took place on that occasion, but I think all agree that the abuse was serious and fairly extensive.  We are all familiar with reports of problems in this area in Northern Ireland.  It would be wrong, however, to assume that the tendency to abuse the system is an exclusively Irish characteristic.  I understand that in recent years both France and Belgium have moved away from postal voting because of the abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>There is a particular responsibility on us as Members of the Oireachtas to ensure that the procedures laid down for election to this House and to the European Assembly are free from abuse and that the democratic choice of the people is not distorted by irregularities.  We would be failing in our duty as legislators if we did not build into the postal voting system adequate safeguards against abuse.</P>
    <P>I wish to state clearly that any abuse anticipated will not be on the part of the disabled.  Quite the contrary, the fear is that they may become the innocent victims. The disabled, the old, the sick are a vulnerable section of society and, in voting by post without the safeguards that apply at polling stations, some of them may be subjected to unfair pressure and interference by unscrupulous persons. That is an example of the kind of abuse that must be guarded against.</P>
    <P>In case it may be thought that I exaggerate the danger of abuse, let us recall that the possibility of abuse, the danger of intimidation and the threat to the secrecy of the ballot were referred to by the Supreme Court in the course of the recent constituional action by Mrs. Norah Draper.  The working party which reported last year on certain aspects of the electoral procedure drew attention to the danger of abuse associated with postal voting as, indeed, did the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law which reported almost 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have been good enough to send me a copy of their proposed Bill.  Having read the text carefully, it is clear that the measure falls down on each of the aspects I have mentioned. It is not comprehensive, it deals <Col N="503" /> with one category only, ignoring the legitimate requests of all others.  It is a stop-gap measure.  It provides no safeguards against abuse.  It makes no attempt to spell out how the system would operate.  Apparently, all this is to be left to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to question the motivation behind the measure or to speculate whether it has anything to do with publicity in the run up to the elections. I have to say, however, that it does <Col N="504" /> not represent a serious attempt to come to grips with the real problems of postal voting.  I propose to produce the heads of a Bill to be placed before the Committee on legislation shortly.  In my view this will meet the needs of a complex piece of legislation.  This will give an opportunity to all parties in the House to consider it at committee level and give it the attention such a Bill deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann solemnly declares that the imposition of the proposed super-levy on Irish milk producers is a matter affecting Ireland's vital national interest and calls on the European Commission to submit a proposal to the Agricultural Council granting an exemption for Ireland from the super-levy for the natural increase in Irish milk production until average European standards are reached.</P>
      <P>It is my pleasure to move this motion. Farming and agriculture at the present time are in a climate of economic turbulence. This has come about because of the down-grading of agriculture by this Government over the past 18 months and policies pursued particularly by the European Economic Community.  This proposed super-levy has no place in Ireland, and the proposals are no longer, and never were, a farmer issue.  They strike at everyone in the country &mdash; those in towns and cities as much as those on the land.  This is a national issue and calls for a resolute stand by the Government, and particularly by the Minister.</P>
      <P>This proposal of a super-levy bodes nothing less than disaster.  The huge reduction in family farm income will have consequential damage for the economy, lower everybody's standard of living and add to the already massive unemployment. The dairying industry is the bedrock of Ireland's national income, through the exports of dairy products and the supply of three-quarters of the calves which form the raw material in the beef industry, and it has a significant influence on the standard of living of every home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The iniquity of this imposition on the dairy farmers is bordering on the criminal. <Col N="507" /> They have responded magnificently to the call for increased output, and now they will have to pay a harsh penalty for that response.  Ireland's dependence on dairying is unique in the Community, and this must be recognised.  The magnitude of the present issue is far too serious for any compromise.  This is no time for weakness.  The fibre of our people is being put to the test and the nation expects leadership at this crucial time. Perhaps the key words in the motion are &ldquo;vital national interest&rdquo; and &ldquo;until average European standards are reached&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat the factors which to us make it incontrovertible that the issue is one affecting Ireland's national interest. The dairying industry represents 33 per cent of the total agricultural output.  Its contribution to the national cattle and beef industry is immense as it provides 80 per cent of the raw material for that important industry.  The overwhelming degree to which the beef industry is dependent on the continuing progress of the dairying sector has not been sufficiently brought to public attention. Dairying and the related cattle industry and beef exports account for 70 per cent of total agricultural exports and upwards of 50 per cent of total exports, when one considers the small import content.</P>
    <P>Significant changes have been taking place within the dairying industry in recent years.  Our creameries have been rationalised and there is a growing trend towards specialisation and greater efficiency on milk producing farms.  This augurs well for the future of this most important branch of our economy, provided of course that the pricing conditions remain attractive and no artificial boundaries or barriers are placed in the way of normal progress.  For reasons well known to this House, our dairying industry, in contrast to our continental neighbours, has been denied for centuries the opportunity to realise optimum potential.</P>
    <P>Other member states have a distinct advantage over our dairy farmers at present. The representatives of the other member states do not deny this.  Not to allow Ireland normal growth in milk output <Col N="508" /> to no more than European levels is inequitable and would create a situation where we would be permanently disadvantaged <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other states, apart altogether from the overwhelming importance of our industry to the national economy.</P>
    <P>Statutorily the Council of Ministers act on proposals from the European Commission. The Commission have publicly voiced their acceptance of the justification of Ireland's case.  I hold that they have a responsibility to translate that acceptance into a formal proposal to the Agricultural Council.  The only form that proposal should take must be to grant an exemption for Ireland from the super-levy for the natural increase in Irish milk production until average European standards are reached.  Any questioning about the years after 1984-85 is not acceptable.  What we are asking is that what the Commission propose is no more than reasonable and just.  Our production is well below that in other European countries, and we are asking the Commission to recognise this.</P>
    <P>The most appalling feature of the Government's handling of this matter was the Taoiseach's acceptance at the recent summit of a 5 per cent increase for 1984 with no guarantee beyond that.  As if that was not bad enough, he accepted what was a disastrous situation for Ireland without knowing in advance that it was going to be rejected by the summit. One would at least have expected that before he voiced his acceptance of a downright bad deal he would have ensured beforehand that, bad and all as it was, it would not be refused by his colleagues.  He has since admitted in public that his colleagues' reactions were not tested out beforehand.  As our Leader said last week in this House, the Taoiseach was humiliated, as was the Minister for Agriculture at this week's meeting.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil were in Government today there would be no question of the super-levy being imposed on our farmers. In the past these proposals were on the table and were resisted by both Deputy MacSharry and Deputy Lenihan as Ministers for Agriculture representing this country.  These proposals were withdrawn, <Col N="509" /> and the negotiating hand of this Government must now be weakened by the approach and the lack of ability to deal with our European partners.  The Government certainly have not pointed out to our partners that the milk surplus in Europe is not being caused by our farmers, and, furthermore, they have not pointed out that the super-levy proposal would unfairly penalise the smaller and less well-off Irish industry for the problems that I have already indicated are directly caused by the larger, stronger and better-off Europeans.  It is worth also pointing out that the gallonage of milk per cow produced in these countries is already so high and the financial returns so large that the financial loss in their case resulting from the levy would be relatively much lighter than in the case of the Irish supplier.</P>
    <P>The limitation of 5 per cent increase would be a disaster for Irish agriculture and our farmers could not plan ahead.  In farming planning is fundamental.  There is also the question of our young farmers with no programme of expansion.  Many of our farmers are heavily in debt, and this would ruin the whole agricultural industry.  Our plans for the future would be shattered if there were no guarantees beyond 1984.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated last autumn that these were the most important EEC negotiations we would ever undertake.  I say that these negotiations have been badly bungled and Irish farmers have been let down.  They expected better from a man with great EEC experience and, as he has stated himself, many contacts in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has again let down our farmers very badly.  He promised at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis last year that he would accept nothing less than complete derogation.  As so many times in the past, he has broken this promise.  This, together with the total neglect of agriculture by this Government and a hasty retreat from rural Ireland, is the hallmark of this Government both at home and in Europe.</P>
    <P>A solution in keeping with the ideal and spirit of the Common Market as outlined in this motion would be an agreement <Col N="510" /> that no super-levy would be imposed on Irish farmers until we reach the European average of production.  The Government must not yield to pressure in their opposition to such a levy, which would cause the stagnation of Irish milk production and make our farmers the poor relation of Europe.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, this issue is under negotiation.  Therefore, this is a very delicate time to be speaking on the subject.  Obviously, it is not a time when one should tell the whole world what his negotiating position is.  At such time one must adopt a prudent attitude to the whole question.  Therefore, while the negotiations are in progress it will be necessary to adopt a very careful approach publicly to the whole problem.</P>
      <P>We have discussed this issue here on a number of occasions in the past seven or eight months.  At all times I have made it clear that we have been looking for an exemption for Ireland until we reached levels of development similar to those in other member states which have had the possibility of developing their production over the years in contrast to the restrictive situation in which we had to operate. That has remained our position throughout the negotiations, and it is in the light of that position that we must look at the present state of the negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies will have a copy of my speech.  I should like first to put the current position in perspective. The present oversupplied state of the milk market and the cost of the Community's milk support arrangements are such that action to control the situation has become inevitable.  We may disagree with our fellow member states on the methods of control to be employed, but nobody can maintain that no action should be taken.  Indeed the main solution put forward as an alternative to the super-levy would have resulted in a price cut of more than 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>When the Commission first and afterwards the British proposed a price reduction as an alternative they mentioned a figure in the region of 12 per cent.  Certainly it would have been more than 10 per cent.  This would have been more damaging to the Irish industry without necessarily solving the problem in the Community.  The crisis has been building up for many years and failure to take remedial steps in time has brought us to where we find ourselves now.  All involved, including this country, share the responsibility for what has occurred but this does not make it any easier to solve the problem now or to make the solutions more palatable.</P>
      <P>It has been evident for many years that the production of milk would cause a serious problem and it is regrettable that the matter was not attended to four or five years ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission originally proposed that all member states should pay a super-levy on milk deliveries in excess of 1981 deliveries plus 1 per cent. That would have meant a cut in production in Ireland of about 13.5 per cent at a cost to the economy of more than £100 million.  This would have been a disaster for the dairy industry, and indeed for the whole economy.  Furthermore, it would have closed off all possibilities of future expansion in the industry.</P>
      <P>Conscious of the vital importance of the issue to Ireland, the Government, in an unprecedented political and diplomatic campaign, explained our case to our partners and pressed for solutions to the milk problem, which would not damage our essential interests.  This campaign was waged against a background of a Community gravely short of money and with huge and costly surpluses in the milk sector.</P>
      <P>Milk production is running almost 20 per cent above current disposal possibilities within the Community and indeed some of these disposal outlets exist only because of the extent to which the Community has been prepared to subsidise them.  For a substantial quantity of milk, the subsidy has to be so high as to be almost as much as the value of the milk itself to the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the negotiations it became clear that virtually all our partners believed that these problems were so pronounced and so serious that the super-levy was the only possible way of dealing effectively with them and bringing the situation under control.  Other solutions were not acceptable.  Indeed, so seriously did they view the situation in the Community that in general they were prepared to peg their deliveries at the 1981 level plus 1 per cent even though most of them had experienced substantial growth since then.  With the exception of Italy and Luxembourg, for whom special concessions are to be made from a Community reserve, the other member states were prepared to accept immediately cuts in production ranging from 3 per cent to <Col N="514" /> 8 per cent.  This is a most important factor to be borne in mind in considering our situation.</P>
    <P>We were therefore, facing the position in which a solution to the milk problem could meet with a general consensus but it would involve the application of the super-levy.  In these circumstances the Government renewed their efforts to ensure that, if the super-levy were agreed, Ireland would in practice be exempt.  This would require not just the avoidance of a cutback in Irish production but the scope for further expansion. Obviously, the considerable extent to which other member states were prepared to accept reductions in their own production was a major stumbling block to our efforts in this regard.  The other member states accepted that we were in a special position, but because of the sacrifices which the outline agreement involved for dairy farmers in their own countries, many of them were not prepared to accept that these concessions should take the form of an exemption from the levy.</P>
    <P>The concept of production controls, from which the super-levy system derives, was really brought in in 1980 and formalised back in 1982 when a Community production threshold for milk production was accepted by all countries including Ireland.</P>

That is where the seeds of the super-levy proposal were sown.  At the time Fianna Fáil sought no exemption and as a result got no exemption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil made no attempt to stop factory type farming in Europe.  It is a bit late in the day now to be complaining about it, when it should have been stopped four or five years ago, when the seeds of the destruction of the dairying industry were being sown.  Furthermore, the situation now is much different from the position in 1980 when the super-levy was first mooted.  At that time other member states were prepared to agree to a freeze on further expansion. Now they are prepared to accept a major cutback for themselves.  This makes our task immeasurably more difficult.  At the same time the Community's financial and stock situation has worsened greatly, and the Community is on the point of bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>In 1980 the stock of butter in intervention was some 280,000 tonnes.  At present it is over 800,000 tonnes.  In 1980 there were 165,000 tonnes of skim milk powder in intervention.  The stock now is over 900,000 tonnes &mdash; getting close to a million tonnes.  Taking butter and skim milk together, the increase in stocks over 1980 is equivalent to about 10 million tonnes of milk or over 2,000 million gallons, that is, nearly double Ireland's annual production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community consumption of milk and milk products is about 87 million tonnes. This includes some substantial quantities which are disposed of for animal feed at high cost to FEOGA.  A further 10 million to 12 million tonnes are sold to third countries at very heavy cost to Community <Col N="517" /> funds.  Any production in excess of this is really surplus to requirements. Total production in 1983 was about 104 million tonnes, while the estimate for 1984, if no action is taken to restrain production, is 106 million tonnes or more.  The cost to the Community budget of supporting the milk sector has increased by about 60 per cent over the last three years.  These figures illustrate clearly the magnitude of the problem and the seriousness of the milk market situation.</P>
    <P>We must bear those figures in mind. Anything in excess of 86 million tonnes of milk costs the Community a considerable amount of money.  When we get to somewhere in the region of 97 million tonnes we are in very serious difficulties, because 10 million tonnes or 12 million tonnes in excess of 86 million tonnes can be sold to third countries at a substantial loss, but anything in excess of 97 million tonnes or 98 million tonnes is not capable of being sold.  In 1983 milk production in the Community was 103.7 million tonnes, and obviously we are producing millions of tonnes of milk which cannot be sold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Major steps have already been taken by the Commission to secure savings in agricultural expenditure, and the effect of these is being felt by Irish farmers.  If the current crisis is not overcome, further cuts in support arrangements by the Commission are inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Government remain satisfied that our case is a justified one and that it can be met only by arrangements to allow further expansion. Obviously, given present circumstances, exemption without any formal limit is not attainable.  Therefore, what we have been seeking is an arrangement which would exempt us up to the level of the <Col N="518" /> likely increase in deliveries in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>How many years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the past evidence, that is, our actual performance between 1972 and 1983, we could expect to expand at about 5 per cent a year.  Our average expansion in milk production since we became a member of the EEC has been 5 per cent a year.</P>
      <P>The French Presidency suggested exemption for 1984-85 up to about 5 per cent above our 1983 level, with the position in future years to be decided on the basis of annual reviews.  A number of other countries are adamant that this goes too far and are seeking lower increases, and there has been a suggestion that some additional co-responsibility levy should be paid by Irish farmers to offset some of the cost involved.  The negotiations remain at this delicate stage, with the Agriculture Council due to resume its discussions on Friday next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another relevant matter that is involved in the negotiations is the future of imports of New Zealand butter into the UK.  We have made it clear from the outset that agreement on the future level of imports of New Zealand butter into the Community will depend on the outcome of the negotiations on the super-levy issue.  The quota for imports of New Zealand butter into the UK has been reduced from 166,000 tonnes in 1973 to 87,000 tonnes in 1983.  There has been a drop in the consumption of butter in the UK and a very sharp rise in domestic production of butter in that country.  The drop in consumption has been enormous. It dropped from 440,000 tonnes to 280,000 tonnes.  That means that New Zealand's relative share of imports into Britain has increased substantially while other members of the Community have seen their share of the market drop considerably. We certainly object to that state of affairs.  Overall, New Zealand's share of the UK butter market has gone up from 25 per cent in the middle seventies to over 30 per cent in 1983.  At the same time the share of the UK market held by imports from Community countries <Col N="519" /> has fallen from close to 70 per cent in the mid-seventies to less than 30 per cent now.  Some Community countries, notably Denmark, agree that if there are to be imports from New Zealand they should be spread around the Community and not channelled into the UK market only.  That would seem to be a fairer system and would give us an opportunity to recover our share of the UK market as well as giving Denmark an opportunity to recover their share.</P>
    <P>The Commission has proposed a new five year regime for New Zealand butter under which imports would come down to 83,000 tonnes in 1984 and by a further 8,000 tonnes over the subsequent four years, bringing the proposed level down to 75,000 tonnes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> Obviously I cannot say too much at this stage about the overall negotiations. We are still seeking arrangements that will ensure that the Irish dairy industry continues to have the possibility of expansion.  We have left our partners under no illusion as to our determination to ensure a satisfactory outcome.  They are all very much aware of our position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>They know that the whole agricultural package could collapse unless we get the type of derogation which we are seeking.  We have told them that our milk situation must be satisfactorily sorted out before any final agreement is reached.  As well as securing the position of our dairy industry, a whole range of reforms and improvements depend on agreements.  These will involve increased financial resources for the Community which at present is primarily financed by the proceeds of 1 per cent from VAT in each of the member states.  Last July, the Commission suggested that the level of the VAT contribution from each country should be increased to 1.4 per cent.  The Greek Presidency proposed about five months ago that that level should be increased to 1.8 per cent.  More recently the Commission suggested that the level should be 2 per cent.  It is essential that the resources of the Community should be boosted considerably, because they have run out of money.  Unless the contribution is greatly increased we will have a recurring problem year after year, and it may be that the 1.4 per cent originally proposed will not be sufficient for many more years.</P>
      <P>A more realistic figure would obviously be in excess of 1.4 per cent.  The countries who mainly finance the Community, West Germany and Britain, have stated repeatedly that they will not agree to any increase until such time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Another problem which must be resolved is that of MCAs, and there has been considerable agreement on that matter.  The Germans are willing to agree to a formula for getting rid of these MCAs, which considerably distort trade between countries.  There are positive proposals regarding the possibility of stabilising imports of cereal substitutes which were one of the primary reasons why we have had over-production of milk in the Community in the past five or six years.  The import of these cereal substitutes has increased from 6 million tonnes in the middle-seventies to something like 16 million tonnes in 1982, a huge increase.  You could prove a direct relationship between the over-production of milk in the Community and the scale of the importation of these cereal substitutes into the Community.  It is a pity action was not taken five or six years ago to at least stabilise imports of cereal substitutes.</P>

      <P>At present, mainly at our instigation, the Commission is proposing that the imports of these cereal substitutes should be stabilised.  That is the strongest move made against cereal substitutes since they first came into the Community.  If action had been taken we would probably not be confronting our present problems regarding vast surpluses of milk and milk products. Another outcome of the discussions will be the adoption of price proposals which I hope will include a 3.4 green £ adjustment which will bring definite increases in prices to farmers in this country.  These issues, either separately or collectively, do not justify settling the milk issue on an unsatisfactory basis, but they do underline the need for an overall early settlement.</P>

      <P>I think that the main reason why I was asked to speak on this resolution is that I come from a predominantly dairying constituency.  I had indicated to my party the anger of farmers regarding the way the super-levy has been handled.  My telephone line was red with calls at the time the news came through that the Taoiseach had agreed to negotiate, mentioning an increase of 5 per cent for Irish dairy farmers.  Young people who are involved in developing their dairy farms were absolutely appalled.  One person indicated to me on the telephone that 1984 would mean for him a 14 per cent increase in his small dairy farm as compared with 1983.  He had followed a development plan but now in the spring of 1984 he is told he is on the wrong lines.  Does anyone in the Government realise there is a nine-month gestation period for a dairy cow? I do not believe they know anything about it.  If a cow is put in calf in April 1984 we are then dealing with a 1985 calf. It is utterly stupid to talk about production levels in 1984 when the level of development in 1983 determines the production for 1984.  Children would know more than this Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach, judging by their performance with regard to the dairy industry. There may be some theoretical knowledge there now but the Minister or the Taoiseach have no practical knowledge of dairy farming.  If they had that knowledge we would not be in our present sorry state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister who made such a pig's dinner of these negotiations should resign from the job at once.  That is the attitude of the farmers in my area. The Minister and the Taoiseach were dealing with an area that is extremely important for the economic development of the country.  Day and night we talk about employment.  I have here in an ESRI report an account of employment in the dairying industry.  There is direct employment, there are processing jobs <Col N="523" /> and as our spokesman, Deputy Noonan said, there is a strong link between the dairying and the beef industries.  There are also jobs with regard to supplying the materials used on dairy farms.  The report stated that in 1983 some 9,300 were involved in milk processing.  That includes employment in the assembly, pasteurisation and delivery of liquid milk as well as the other areas.  A similar number is involved directly in employment in the slaughtering and preserving of beef.</P>
      <P>The way the negotiations were conducted one would think that the employment content and the development of employment in this area was of no concern to the Government.  We had a pathetic performance tonight from the Minister for Agriculture, who appears to have assumed the role of defender of the people in Europe who are trying to impose a super-levy on us.  One could not dispute many of the arguments made here by the Minister, but I think he should have addressed himself to a different situation.  He should not have been addressing himself to the problems of the agricultural policy of the EEC, but he should have been devoting himself to the specific problems of Irish agriculture. The Minister spent his time making excuses and making an apologia for the EEC and their attitude towards dairy farming.</P>

      <P>In the report of the ESRI to which I referred there is a section on milk processing and on employment policy. I would read the entire paragraph but I have not the time.  Therefore, I shall confine myself to a few relevant sentences in the paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our main milk products are butter, butter oil, dried whole milk, cheese and skimmed milk powder, the first four of which account for over 90 per cent of whole milk utilisation.  Despite <Col N="524" /> increased capitalisation, the numbers employed in the industry rose until 1979 in line with increased milk supplies but they have been declining.</P>
    <P>They have been declining in a situation where we are producing more milk, but what will happen if the super-levy is imposed?  The report continues:</P>
    <P>The IDA estimates that growth in the supply of milk with current processing patterns could result in about six to eight extra jobs for each additional million gallons of milk available.  Thus, an increase of 180 million gallons projected by Bord Bainne for 1986 could result in a further 1,300 jobs.  This projection depends, however, on a satisfactory outcome to the super-levy negotiations.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister tonight we fear there may not be a satisfactory outcome to the negotiations, particularly in view of the Taoiseach allowing 5 per cent to be thrown on the table at the recent summit.</P>
    <P>What is happening now to all the grand plans for agriculture in the past few years?  We were talking about increasing production of milk per cow, about regularising the system of land tenure, about leasing land and about a bright future for agriculture.  All of this has been blighted by the talk of a super-levy and by acceptance of that levy, in effect, by the Taoiseach and his Minister.  When the Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Papandreou, spoke about an increase of 10 per cent the Taoiseach would have nothing to do with it.  Yet, in the recent negotiations he threw half that percentage increase on the table for negotiation.</P>
    <P>Let us recall what happened at the Stuttgart meeting.  Fianna Fáil and the thinking members of Fine Gael are convinced that the Taoiseach was fooled at the Stuttgart conference.  He accepted that future financing and budgetary imbalances were to be put on the table as were adaptation of the CAP, a review of the structural funds and the development of new policies.  The job was to be completed at the meeting of the European Council in December 1983 but that was <Col N="525" /> a total disaster.  We had the suggestion of 10 per cent from Papandreou which was rejected.  A figure of 5 per cent was thrown on the table, which put the farmers of this country into a flurry when it was announced on radio and television.</P>

      <P>Without a doubt it has shaken people.  The people I am talking about had plans and they had borrowed money.  Judging by the attitude of financial institutions to farmers over the last few years, as soon as they have to cut production they will be told by their local bank managers, acting on orders from their overlords, that they made the plans and borrowed the money on the basis of so much production year by year for a certain number of years and that the pay back would come over that period.  They are scared.  The people responsible for this are the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>The Federal Republic of Germany have gained very substantially from the working of the MCAs.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The termination of the UK variable premium is a desirable objective of reform.  The whole area of Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal has been distorted because of the pressures <Col N="526" /> of the variable premium.  The idea of imposing a fine of 70p per gallon on farmers, who, a few short years ago, were being encouraged and practically dragooned to develop five year plans, to invest money in buildings and the improvement of their land and to increase production, cannot be tolerated. These are the people who have now been asked to pay a fine of 70p a gallon for doing what they were encouraged to do by every agricultural economist and non-agricultural economist in the country a short time ago.  It is a disgraceful situation, and it will damage some of the best young people in our community over the next few years.</P>

      <P>I have a lot of wisdom to put before the Minister and I would like to be allowed to do so.  This matter was considered by the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities in a report on the adaptation of the CAP.  One of the points made &mdash;I am making it again now &mdash; was:</P>
      <P>We should insist that expenditure in other sectors, which is in fact growing more rapidly than in the milk sector, is also dealt with in regard to the milk sector.  We must insist that whatever action is eventually taken is fair, that it takes account&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>This is incorporated in our motion.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the level of development of the dairy industry in the different regions of the Community and that it takes account especially of the special importance of milk to the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>What has the Minister been doing since this was first mooted? We only had a very low key approach, as if the seriousness of it was not realised in <Col N="527" /> Merrion Street or in Aras Talmhaíochta. This is the only impression one can get, and the lackadaisical <i>laissez faire</i> approach to the negotiations indicates that that is the truth.  This is a savage approach to these people who were encouraged to develop.  The young farmer I mentioned a few minutes ago is on an average of 1,200 gallons per cow. That is out of land he had to drain and develop.  It was poor quality land.  He also had to breed selectively to reach that stage.  He is producing 500 gallons more per cow than the average for this country. He is about the European average of 1,100 to 1,200 gallons.  As a result of doing what he was advised to do he may be fined 70p per gallon on his excess production.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how anybody could sit in this House, or face any person, and justify yielding on that.  His production will be 14 per cent up on 1983.  What good is 5 per cent to him when he goes into his bank manager with one arm as long as the other and says: &ldquo;The EEC are cutting me down&rdquo;?  They do not want to hear him and do not know him.  They will say simply: &ldquo;Sell off your cows and give us the money.&rdquo;  That has happened already.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there was a serious problem and it was a pity it was not attended to some time ago.  When precisely did he want it attended to?  When we were producing 300, 400 or 500 gallons per cow?  We are now on an average of 700 gallons.  We were told the thing to do was increase productivity in Irish agriculture.  In fairness to our farmers, they increased productivity more than was done in any other sector of the Community. The thanks they are getting for it now is that they are being let down by the man who should be standing four square in their defence in the Council of Europe.</P>

The Minister said the Community subsidy <Col N="528" /> is high, and he outlined some of the reasons why productivity increased in some of the countries, including the importation of cereals.  It is high, but we have not reached the European average and we have not reached our potential at all.  As it accounts for 9 per cent of our GNP &mdash; the point was made by our spokesman, Deputy Noonan &mdash; we have an unanswerable case for special treatment and a special exemption from the super-levy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to request the Minister and his <Col N="529" /> Department to have all possible steps taken to safeguard our poultry industry. I have received various representations in regard to this most recent outbreak of fowl pest in recent days which I understand is now very serious in England, its most serious aspect being the uncertainty surrounding it and the fact that it is spread over such a wide area.  At the end of last year we had an outbreak of Avian influenza which had serious consequences in my constituency but which was then confined to a restricted area. The significance of the most recent outbreak is that it extends from Devon to Scotland, right across the neighbouring island from Wales and East Anglia to the east coast.  The British Department of Agriculture cannot put their finger on the reason for this most recent outbreak. Rather there is a lot of speculation as to its cause.</P>
    <P>I am most concerned about the danger to our poultry industry through transportation there being a considerable amount of vehicular transport between here and the English mainland.  Sixty per cent of Northern Ireland's production is disposed of in England.  The very same trucks and containers come here with 16 per cent of our market requirements. Indeed could we ensure that that 16 per cent was produced here it would provide approximately 200 additional jobs and 500 indirectly in spin-off benefits.</P>
    <P>I might emphasise the importance to our economy of the poultry industry &mdash; and that includes the duck industry which encountered serious problems.  Hopefully this will be revived through the production of broilers and turkeys.  This industry is important nationally and locally.  Indeed the poultry industry in my constituency is a monument to the men of initiative and commitment who had sufficient belief in themselves over the years and who set about achieving their goals.</P>
    <P>There must be close scrutiny and monitoring of trucks entering this country at ports and Border posts to ensure that every possible avenue is sealed off in order to prevent an outbreak of the disease here.  I might congratulate the Department of Agriculture on the way <Col N="530" /> they dealt with that earlier outbreak of Avian influenza.  We may have been critical of them at the time but, with hindsight, it can be said that they handled the position well, disposing of affected carcases, containing the disease within a small area and ensuring that producers who lost were compensated.  It must be said that overall the industry emerged well from that outbreak.  At present there is a prohibition on the importation of poultry from England at our ports but not on those emanating from Northern Ireland.  I suggested earlier that there be one entry point where there would be a very close scrutiny of all vehicles.  Before Christmas the export of poultry from this country was prohibited over the Border. While that might appear to have been a very stringent measure I would have no hesitation in recommending it, because the end justifies the means, in that it will ensure our poultry industry likewise remains free of disease.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that in 1973 we had no importation of poultry whatsoever. In 1983 we had approximately 8,000 tonnes of poultry meat imported. Our production, especially of broilers, over the last five years, has remained static at approximately 24 million.  As I said earlier the elimination of all poultry imports would provide many additional jobs, particularly when one bears in mind that those 8,000 tonnes are valued at approximately £10,500,000.</P>
    <P>When one examines our poultry industry, what it provides in terms of spin-offs, one finds that there is involved a meal usage of approximately 350,000 tonnes valued at approximately £45 million.  If one were to consider the cereal content alone one would be talking of approximately 160,000 acres of cereals.  When one relates our poultry industry, to that in the Six Counties one discovers that, from 1973 onwards, there was a dramatic increase in the Six Counties production which rose from approximately £23 million &mdash; our production now amounts to approximately £24 million &mdash; to £35 million at present.  Fifty per cent of their increased production represents the market they secured here, which is due to the hidden incentive inherent in the MCAs. <Col N="531" /> One realises the competition our industry must face when one equally realises that it is not a matter of production, of food conversion, of the type of housing, or the quality of the birds produced, how they are processed or the price they receive for their produce but rather the MCAs with which they must compete and to which our producers have no redress. This means our producers are playing against the wind most of the time.  Hopefully there will be a change effected in this respect within the EEC.  Should that change come about, we have the nucleus of an industry which could make a great contribution towards job creation and the Balance of Payments.  This industry was built up after the war and was developed in small units.  On our entry to the EEC the people in the constituency I represent believed there would be a great opportunity for marketing.  However, as it turned out poultry was nobody's child. There is no stated policy as far as production and marketing is concerned. Admittedly, substantial sums of money have been provided by way of FEOGA grants to the processing plants but this was done after local initiative had built up the industry into a strong concern. The people were left to stand on their own feet.  I notice from recent reports that FEOGA aid has not been taken up to the extent it should have been.  One of our commissioners has commented on that.  Should the CEAs be modified we could be major exporters.  The opportunity is there for us.</P>
    <P>The poultry and turkey industry in my area has expanded from packing frozen birds to producing a wide range of cooked and uncooked food.  This generates much needed employment.  No stone should be left unturned to ensure that this disease is controlled.  There must be strict control. There must be the minimum of access points through which vehicles can come here.  I would consider a complete closure if there was a danger of the disease spreading.</P>
    <P>In their report on the poultry industry, the IDA saw a great opportunity for value added products.  If we want to be a reckonable force in international markets <Col N="532" /> and develop the agricultural industry we will have to concentrate on down-stream value added products.</P>
    <P>The contribution the poultry industry has made over the last number of years to the provision of jobs is probably small compared to the contribution it has made as far as labour relations are concerned. There are many processing plants scattered over a wide area.  When the processing plants were set up they were located as near as possible to the site of the produce.  In Cavan and Monaghan we have some of the best industries as regards giving employment.  If people are satisfied with their job and see that there is a chance to develop and progress, that makes for good working relations which spills over into many other fields.</P>
    <P>We do not know how this disease has developed.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's reply and hope he can assure me about the work being done to secure the future of the industry.</P>

      <P>I commend the Deputy for bringing this matter before the House.  It is a very serious matter especially for the people in his constituency.  This disease is a form of Newcastle disease which was first confirmed in three commercial egg laying units in Shropshire on 27 February last. Since then there have been nine outbreaks of the disease in various parts of Britain.  The outbreaks are unduly scattered geographically and there is no obvious pattern or source to the outbreaks at present.  There has been concern there about a disease in racing pigeons which is a particular strain of Newcastle disease and this is causing the British authorities some concern.  As a precaution against the introduction of disease here we have not been allowing the import of pigeons or indeed any live birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also banned the racing of pigeons out of the country.  Because of the concern in Britain with the disease found in pigeons &mdash; a disease known as paramyxovirus &mdash; the authorities in Northern Ireland have adopted a policy of vaccination of pigeons there as a protection. <Col N="533" /> We will have a meeting tomorrow morning at which we will consider whether we should resort to vaccination also.  However, the position up to the present is that we have no sign whatsoever of the presence of paramyxovirus in pigeon flocks here.</P>

      <P>Pigeons are not migratory. They stay around all day.  In the case of racing pigeons it was the custom to take pigeons over to the UK or Holland and race them back home.</P>
      <P>As soon as the outbreaks of Newcastle disease in Britain were notified to us my Department took immediate measures to minimise the risk of the virus being imported into this country.  All my Department's veterinary staff at airports and ports were alerted and asked to step up the usual disinfection procedures for containers, trucks etc. and personnel coming from Britain.  In association with the customs authorities, official staff at entry points were put on increased surveillance and vigilance.  My Department also issued a press release advising persons travelling to England to avoid visiting restricted areas and requesting that any person who was on farmland there to report to the Department's portal or airport staff.  Airline and shipping companies were reminded about the issue of the usual warnings to passengers not to bring meat or meat products into the country.</P>
      <P>On the question of imports of poultry from Britain, we have introduced a total ban on the import of live poultry, including all cage birds.  We are continuing, of course, with the usual policy of prohibiting all imports of fresh poultry meat with the exception of poultry which has undergone heat teatment to a temperature adequate to kill Avian disease viruses.</P>

This country has been free of the disease since 1956 and, despite outbreaks in many other countries of the European Community, our import control arrangements and the vigilance of our portal staff have enabled this country retain its freedom from the disease.</P>
      <P>As the House will know we here maintain the closest possible liaison with Northern Ireland on all veterinary matters. Indeed, for all practical purposes in terms of control and care against the introduction of any exotic disease the country operates as a single geographical unit.  The Northern authorities are, therefore, maintaining the same vigilance as we are in the present situation.

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the steps that he has taken to get the commercial petroleum distributors to reduce the cost to the consumer of diesel oil, domestic fuel oil and heating oil as the reasons given for reducing the price of petrol must also be relevant in reducing the cost of these products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the voluntary reductions in petrol prices announced by the oil companies recently may have been attributed initially to an improvement in exchange rates, marketing considerations were also a major factor.  The reductions effected were much greater than that merited by exchange rate movements on the cost of petrol alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maximum prices for the major petroleum products are fixed by maximum prices order but this order does not prevent oil companies from selling at prices <Col N="385" /> below the levels set out in the order.  In fact, the allowance of discounts and rebates on sales of gas oil and fuel oil has been quite commonplace for many years and the petrol price reductions introduced are welcome evidence of price competition in the petrol market also.</P>
    <P>Petroleum product prices are kept continually under review in the light of the movements of the various cost factors that make up the maximum price. Included in these factors are currency exchange movements as the oil companies, who purchase imported product in US dollar terms, have to be compensated in IR£ terms for the dollar costs incurred. The value of the IR£ relative to the US dollar fluctuates daily and to achieve some consistency in Irish prices, it is necessary to average out these fluctuations over time.  This has in the past been achieved by fixing an exchange rate at the time of each product price adjustment and making allowance for gains and losses in the interim at the time of the next price change.  In recent times, adjustments have been made generally on a quarterly basis.  When the latest product price adjustment was made in early January 1984 an exchange rate of $1.14 was used and this is still reflected in the maximum price.  The selection of this rate for the current quarter has proven to be reasonably fair to all parties as the actual daily exchange rate since then has averaged $1.10 in January when exchange losses were incurred by the oil companies, $1.14 in February and at slightly less than $1.14 for the 11 week period to date.  In these circumstances, there was no equitable basis for making an adjustment in the maximum prices order until the oil companies had been given an opportunity to recoup exchange losses incurred by them during January 1984.</P>
    <P>The question of an adjustment of the prices set under the maximum prices order for all controlled petroleum products is currently under examination in the light of all the relevant factors which will include product and other cost increases and relative price movements <Col N="386" /> of various types of petroleum products in markets abroad.  In fixing the appropriate exchange rate, account will be taken of the more recent movements in the value of the IR£ relative to the US dollar.</P>

The following tabular statement outlines details of the 1983 and 1984 allocations to Cork County Council. Comparative percentages are provided for road grants, local improvements schemes and the grants in relief of domestic rates and in lieu of rates on agricultural land.  It would not be appropriate to give percentage increases for other services since the present 1984 allocations are subject to review to take account, <i>inter alia,</i> of further allocations for these services from the overall funds provided in the Public Capital Programme and the Estimates for the Public Services.</P>

In making these changes I took into account the various interests involved as well as the need to conserve our salmon stocks.  Since making the announcement I have received representations on the point raised in the question and I am looking into the matter.</P>

      <P>The rules for the taxation of married couples in the year of marriage were changed by the Finance Act, 1983.  That Act provides that, for the year 1983-84 and subsequent years of assessment, a married couple are to be taxed as single persons throughout the year of assessment in which marriage takes place.  A measure of relief is provided by way of repayment where the total tax due and paid by the couple under that arrangement exceeds the total tax for which they would have been liable if they had been married throughout the year of assessment concerned.  The relief is the amount which bears the same proportion to the excess as the period of marriage in the year bears to the full year.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as the wife had no earnings before or after the date of marriage, a non-cumulative certificate of tax-free allowances incorporating the married allowance and double rate bands was issued on a concessional basis to the taxpayer on 21 November 1983.  A similar certificate to include child allowance was issued on 11 January 1984.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 490 to 498, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Capital expenditure of £1.6 million was incurred by the Commissioners of Public Works in respect of the provision of car ferry facilites at Dún Laoghaire Harbour. The expenditure was met from the Vote for Public Works and Buildings out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. There are no plans at present to undertake further capital projects.</P>
      <P>The rates charged to Sealink UK Ltd. provide for the recovery of the capital expenditure incurred by the Commissioners of Public Works in providing the car ferry facilities.</P>
      <P>St. Michael's Wharf was constructed on foot of a Government decision for the purpose of providing facilities for the new car ferry service introduced in 1965.  Following the introduction by Sealink UK Ltd. of the new and much larger multipurpose vessel in 1977, the facilities available at St. Michael's Wharf were unsuitable for the new service.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the type and volume of traffic at Dún Laoghaire Harbour, the current rates charged by the Commissioners of Public Works raise more income than would the application at Dún Laoghaire of the corresponding charges in force at Dublin Port.  Details of the rates in force at Holyhead are matters for the port authorities there and the shipping operators concerned.  The rates at Dún Laoghaire Harbour are set by the Commissioners following consultation with the Minister for Communications; regard is had as to the rates levels at Dublin Port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates at Dún Laoghaire Harbour are reviewed as and when necessary, the current rates coming into force on 1 <Col N="407" /> January 1984, the previous review having been on 1 March 1983.  No increase was effected in the years 1975 to 1979 during which a comprehensive review was undertaken of the basis for assessment of the rates.  The rates set in 1980 took account of the period from 1975.</P>
    <P>Policy in relation to commercial operations at the harbour is determined by the Commissioners of Public Works in consultation with the Minister for Communications. The facilities at the harbour are not for the exclusive use of Sealink UK Ltd.</P>
    <P>Until a decision as to the future of the spur line, which formerly served the mailboat pier, is made by the Departent of Communications, it is not possible to consider what arrangements, if any, would be appropriate in the context of the new electrified urban transport system.</P>

The screening of school children for dental defects is generally carried out on a rotation basis so that a similar period of time would elapse between screenings of pupils of schools in urban areas and those in rural locations within the same health board area.  Neither group is afforded preference over the other in the delivery of dental treatment by health board dentists.  Children attending schools in rural areas may have to travel further than their counterparts in urban schools to avail of dental treatment but this is unavoidable.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has claimed retirement pension which has been awarded to him at the rate of £45.10 per week from 19 January 1984.

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have contributions paid in respect of at <Col N="421" /> least 156 weeks of insurable employment since his entry into insurance.  The Department's records show that the person concerned had 47 paid contributions since the beginning of the 1953 contribution year and 15 paid contributions prior to 1953.  Under the regulations the 15 contributions paid prior to 1953 may be regarded as being equal to 22 thus bringing his total number of paid contributions up to the equivalent of only 69. He does not, therefore, qualify for a retirement pension.  Neither will he qualify for an old age contributory pension at age 66 as a similar condition applies in respect of this latter pension.  He should apply for a non-contributory old age pension approximately four months before he reaches age 66.  He is in receipt of unemployment assistance at present.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 15 July 1983 following exhaustion of his entitlement to unemployment benefit. He was assessed with means of £27.30 per week derived from board and lodging on his parents' holding.  This entitled him to £0.70 per week from 15 July 1983 increasing to £2.10 from 5 October 1983. <Col N="429" /> He appealed against the assessment of his means but an appeals officer also assessed his means at £27.30 per week. He has received all unemployment assistance to which he is entitled since 15 July 1983 and continues to be paid at the rate of £2.10 per week.  He has applied for a review of his means and the case has been referred to a social welfare officer.  When the investigations are completed the assessment of his means will be reviewed and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of unemployed apprentices currently stands at 2,453 according to information held by AnCO.  It should be pointed out this figure would be a maximum as frequently apprentices report themselves as redundant but do not inform AnCO when they have regained employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AnCO are continuing to recruit first-year apprentices in order to meet requirements for skilled craftsmen in the next three to four years.  Economic recovery might well be jeopardised or restricted by skill shortages in the years ahead if provision is not now made for future needs.  Each year AnCO review the first-year apprentices intake numbers and set the number of AnCO sponsored <Col N="441" /> first-year apprentices at a level designed to maintain a reasonable balance between supply and demand, taking into account the recession, the likely rate of economic recovery and the level of unemployed apprentices.</P>
    <P>However, AnCO are continuing to allocate facilities for the continuing training of redundant apprentices.  For the present year AnCO have planned such short training inputs of three to four months for some 3,600 redundant apprentices.</P>

      <P>All applications from golf clubs or other groups are considered on the merits of the project proposed in relation to the scope of the scheme.  An important consideration is whether or not the project could be carried out by the organisation concerned from its own resources.</P>
