      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2, 9, 3 and 10.  By agreement, the proceedings on Committee, Fourth and Fifth Stages of the Social Welfare Bill, 1984, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. today by putting from the Chair one question which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Social Welfare. Private Members' Business will be No. 18.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I wish to raise on the Adjournment a question which I asked for yesterday, but was not then lucky enough to succeed in having on the Adjournment?  Would the Chair consider favourably for this evening my asking the Minister for the Environment the reason for his request to Dublin County Council to accept asbestos waste which is listed by the EEC as being toxic and dangerous, when the same waste was refused entry into the United Kingdom which is the traditional area for disposal?  Also, does <Col N="536" /> he intend to take immediate action to prevent Dublin County Council from implementing their decision to dump approximately 500 tonnes at Baleally tiphead, Lusk, in view of the serious threat to health?</P>

It is in connection with a large section of Dublin north-side having radio listenership interfered with, allegedly as a result of the activities of RTE?  Is the Minister willing to make a statement on this matter, particularly in view of the fact that by this action the decision of this House is being brought into disrepute and shown scant regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to refer to the contents of a letter I received from you, Sir, stating that a number of the amendments I had tabled are out of order because they involve a potential charge on Revenue.  I fail to understand why you should have ruled in this way because, if you look at the first amendment, which asks the Minister to make these increases payable from the beginning of April rather than July, there is not any reason why it should create a new charge on the Exchequer: the Minister could pay 5¼ per cent over 12 months rather than 7 per cent.  Before this Government came to office it had been the custom to have these increases payable from 1 April, and I fail to see how my amendment can be ruled out of order on the basis that it would involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking that statement as a submission regarding admissability of these amendments.  I have given the amendments very full consideration, and having done so I have ruled them out of order for the reasons stated.  It would not be in order to have a discussion in the House about them.  It is clear that they involve a potential charge on the revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In these circumstances we have no option but to oppose the section to which amendment No. 1 relates.  We are not opposing the giving of increases to social welfare recipients <Col N="540" />&mdash; indeed we believe they are not receiving sufficient to keep abreast of the cost of living &mdash; but this year alone inflation is running at more than 10 per cent yet the Minister is offering 7 per cent to those who depend on social welfare benefits for their livelihood.  They are the most under-privileged people in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy, but section 1 deals merely with the Short Title to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 have been ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing the section for the reasons I have stated.  We believe that a 7 per cent increase is completely insufficient at a time when inflation is running at more than 10½ per cent. Last year these beneficiaries received only 12 per cent, and if we add the 12 per cent of last year to the 7 per cent of this year we get only 19 per cent.  That increase over two years is far less than the annual 25 per cent they had been receiving in the previous three years when Fianna Fáil were in power.  If society is to be judged by the way the under-privileged are treated &mdash; the old, the ill, the handicapped, the unemployed, the widows and many others &mdash; this Government will be harshly judged by the people for the manner in which they are treating those depending on social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare came into the House to defend their actions in this respect.  The Minister for Finance told us that the Government came to office with a commitment to keep short-term social welfare benefits in line with increases in the take-home pay of workers, and to maintain the living standards of other weekly welfare recipients. In his budget speech the Minister told us <Col N="541" /> that the Government had more than met that commitment.  Of course the Government have not met that commitment, because there is no doubt that those depending on social welfare benefits had a serious reduction in their living standards last year as a result of the very low award given to them, only for nine months, not 12 as previously had been the case.  Because of the 7 per cent this year their standard of living will drop even further.  It is appreciated by all authorities that in times of recession the levels of support for the needy must be maintained.  That was pointed out very clearly in Report No. 61 of the NESC. The 7 per cent increase this year will not in any way meet the commitments of the social welfare classes.  They are subject to increases in the cost of living like everybody else, to VAT on clothes, and some of them are subject to the drug refund charge of £28, an increase of £12 since this Government came to office only 14 months ago.</P>
    <P>They are just examples of the commitments those people have to meet.  At present, as the Minister well knows, we have a new poor in our society, those who find themselves unemployed through no fault of their own.  I am very critical of the Government's economic policies because I believe that this high unemployment has come about as a result of their policies.  For example, last year they reduced the original allocation for capital expenditure &mdash; the original Fianna Fáil estimate &mdash; by £220 million.  Not alone that but they did not spend £180 million of their own allocation on capital expenditure, making a total of £400 million. I have no doubt that the reason we have so many unemployed at present is as a result of the Government's economic policy, particularly the decision not to spend that £400 million which had been allocated for capital expenditure.  That would have given employment to many people and would have maintained and created many jobs in peripheral industries.</P>
    <P>We will be opposing this section.  In view of the figures published recently which indicate inflation running at 10½ per cent I appeal to the Minister to reconsider <Col N="542" /> his allocation of 7½ per cent.  He should give a higher award to social welfare beneficiaries and pay it from the beginning of April, as has been done in previous years, and not from the beginning of July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware the Bill provides for an increase of 8 per cent in the rates of unemployment assistance for the long term unemployed and 7 per cent in other social assistance payments, including the children's allowances, social insurance benefits and occupational injuries payments.  Those increases will take effect from the beginning of July next for the weekly payments and from August in the case of children's allowances. The overall cost of what is proposed will amount to almost £70 million this year, a substantial sum of money, and in a full year it will be of major importance in terms of the carry-over effect.  The social insurance increases, leaving aside the social assistance side of the cost, will amount to £36.26 million in 1984.  The cost of the increases in occupational injuries benefits will be about £1 million.  That benefit is borne by the occupational injuries fund, which is financed in full by employers' contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of persons on social insurance benefit is about 400,000 and they have about 320,000 dependants.  About 760,000 people will benefit from these increases.  I would wish that we had more Exchequer resources available to give larger increases, but a consideration we have to bear in mind for this year is that there has not been any increase in the rate of pay-related social insurance. Those rates are in operation at the 1982 levels.  There has been no actual increase in PRSI rates as such.  We have the full effect of the £13,000 limit which was increased last year and there was not an increase in that limit this year.  A difficult choice has to be made.  There is hardly an insured worker, or an employer, who is not acutely aware of the level of pay-related social insurance contributions. We need those contributions to pay for the increases in benefits.  What has happened <Col N="543" /> this year is that the £70 million will be paid out of Exchequer contributions, it will be paid by the taxpayer in a form other than through PRSI.  The House may remember that in the early part of 1983 there was a major sense of grievance on the part of many insured workers because of the extent of the pay-related social insurance contributions they were obliged to pay.  Members will be aware that employers must pay about twice as much again.  I do not have the exact figure, but we are talking about a total contribution of about 21 per cent of payroll now between employer and employee contributions.</P>
    <P>They are the strict and rigid limitations within which the budget was framed. There has not been any reduction in food subsidies.  The effect of the budget on the underlying inflation rate, the effect of it on the CPI, this year is less than half of 1 per cent, roughly about .48 per cent. We have retained the food subsidies although the Opposition confidently predicted we would abolish or almost wholly withdraw them.  Unquestionably those on social insurance and assistance draw proportionately from the benefit of food subsidies although they are indiscrimate and across the board.  One must bear in mind that there was a marginal increase in tax free allowances, that there was an income levy exemption which benefited the vulnerable low income groups, that we have to provide for 227,000 people who are unemployed in the form of social insurance and assistance, and the Government came down in favour of increases of the order of 8 per cent and 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would wish that the increase could have been higher, but the important criteria in many respects is the rate of inflation. Previous administrations gave an increase of 25 per cent at a time when inflation was running at 25 per cent.  Later an increase of 20 per cent was granted when inflation was running at 22 per cent. If we can get down the rate of inflation then the real value of the increases will be maintained.  There should be some method in Government, and in the Houses of the Oireachtas in particular, of insisting on those who put forward <Col N="544" /> proposals to increase the rates by 10 per cent or 15 per cent specifying where the Exchequer resources will come from to pay for those increases.  The parallel exercise is to propose an increase in the PRSI rates or propose other forms of taxation.  Next year, in order to continue the increase in payments of this year, we will have to have another £70 million for openers.  The Government will have to consider finding that amount of money in October or November when the Estimates are prepared.  It is clear that in 1985 the further additional increment will be another £75 million or £80 million for a full year payment, including a full year payment of children's allowances.  That is the situation.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by giving the precise increases in 1984.  On the social insurance side we are providing £36.3 million extra, on the social assistance side we are providing £24.2 million extra and on children's allowances we are providing £5 million.  The total budget provision for 1984 is £65.5 million.  In a full year social insurance will be £73.6 million, social assistance £49.4 million and children's allowances £12 million, a total of £135 million, which will be reflected in the 1985 Estimate which I will prepare in a few months time.</P>
    <P>As I said, there is no increase in social insurance contributions.  It is the old story: if you do something all hell breaks loose; if you do not do something it passes over even though it is a real gain.  The level of social insurance contributions by an employer is 11.3 per cent, excluding the levies, and for an employee it is 5.5 per cent.  The employers pay occupational injuries and redundancy levies of .8 per cent.  If tomorrow morning I take on a worker, as an employer I must immediately set aside 12.1 per cent of gross earnings for social insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>I have fought in this House for 15 years to have that system brought in and maintained and to ensure that employers do, and should, pay it.  With a few other Labour Deputies I pioneered the abolition of the flat rate social insurance contribution. It was a long standing policy of <Col N="545" /> the trade union and Labour movement that we needed a contributory pay related system as being the more equitable system. In the process, employees pay a 5.5 per cent contribution and the other 3 per cent levies &mdash; 1 per cent health contribution, 1 per cent of income and the 1 per cent youth employment levy.  This means the employees' contribution stands at 8.5 per cent.  The total contribution to the Exchequer is 20.6 per cent. That is a substantial amount of money.</P>
    <P>The moneys accruing to the Exchequer are diminishing because the number of insured employees and employers, by virtue of the severity of the recession in 1981, 1982 and 1983, and the number of employees being made redundant, have fallen.  As a parallel development, although the growth in social insurance contributions and PRSI returns to my Department has increased, the rate of increase has been substantially diminished. I have to take on board a severe double barrelled impact of a rise in the number of unemployed, a diminution in the income of pay related contributions, and a backlash from many people who feel that paying 20 per cent of the total pay roll for social insurance and social assistance is the most they wish to pay.</P>
    <P>It is facile for a large number of politicians, particularly those in Opposition, to exploit the preoccupation of many people with their own affairs.  Most employers are preoccupied about their employment and their level of returns on their capital investment while most employees are preoccupied about their income, their family income, their prospects of employment and the level of social insurance they pay.  That is the kind of society we live in.  Very few people have a preoccupation about the national contributions.  People personalise their roles in life and are intentionally preoccupied about their own prospects and their own contributions.  Hence, we as politicians with a social awareness have a fundamental obligation to combat and oppose resolutely that kind of social culture which is rampant in our community. We must try to convince people that if they pay one shilling in social insurance contributions another less fortunate citizen <Col N="546" /> will unquestionably benefit from it. I try to convince people of that every day, but I find that those who profess to be most preoccupied about social deprivation frequently cut the ground from under me by getting back to the particular rather than the general and availing of it to party political advantage.  Fortunately, Deputy O'Hanlon has never succumbed to that type of argument, but it is rampant in the political parties to the extent that it is so easily exploited.  It was very nearly exploited to the full early in 1983 when we had campaigns not to pay PRSI contributions, and not send that money to the Exchequer.  Some employers nearly fell for that kind of argument advanced by some people.  I had to strenuously oppose that.  Fortunately, commonsense and the conscience of many trade unionists prevailed over that kind of intense self-preoccupation about one's own job, where people showed little concern for those who are unemployed and tried to help them maintain their income in their personal tragedy.</P>
    <P>The limits of contributions I have to make are contained in this Bill.  The cost of the improvements in 1984 are being met in full by the Exchequer because there is no change in the rates of social insurance contributions or in the earnings ceiling for contributions.  I make this point &mdash; it is a rather narrow party political point and I do not want to give it any more credence than that &mdash; that the £13,000 limit was set by the previous Administration when they were framing the 1983 Estimates.  I have not touched that £13,000 limit.  It is high enough.  Only one in ten earn more than that figure. Ninety per cent of insured workers earn under £13,000 a year and it is arguable that the limit should be abolished.  If it were abolished, it would bring in comparatively little in the first year &mdash; £10 million or £14 million.  Those earning £13,000 and over are paying very high rates of income tax.  We will have a problem in regard to middle management people and skilled tradesmen in the event of the recession easing because the level of income tax and PRSI here is 15 per cent or 18 per cent higher than in the UK. There has been substantial easing of tax <Col N="547" /> rates, of which I do not necessarily approve, in the higher tax bands in Britain and it is noticeable that middle management people here relative to their colleagues in Britain are paying very much higher rates of tax.  All of this affects the provision for social welfare and is of critical importance.</P>
    <P>I would have wished to give much more.  I do not regard our current flat rates as being in any way generous.  I regard them as being in many respects the bare subsistence level and if the recession eases and we have more people at work paying PRSI then we can make major changes in raising the real level of benefits in the near future.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 which Deputy Mac Giolla and I put down to section 3 have been ruled out of order.  The amendments sought to bring forward the date of the increases from July to April.  In his response the Minister has attempted to imply that such a proposal is in some way an expression of selfishness, the Opposition parties playing up to an element of society who think only of themselves.  He is losing sight of the fact that this section relates to increases for people on social welfare and does not relate to people who are paying PRSI.  Obviously the more people at work the more tax and PRSI is available to pay benefits.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise that the Government agreed to maintain the income of social welfare recipients.  They gave that undertaking only eight months after losing office and they cannot claim to have been unaware of the financial situation or the trends in the economy.  The Joint Programme for Government agreed by Fine Gael and Labour states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment and disability benefits will be kept in line with take home wages and salaries.  Expenditure on other social benefits will be maintained in the light of inflation so that, even if a drop occurs in the immediate future in the purchasing power of better off groups in the community, the living standards of the section of the community <Col N="548" /> dependent on social welfare payments will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not attempted to argue that the increases he is introducing will maintain the living standards of those on social welfare, as promised in the joint programme.  The increases are at least 2 per cent and in some cases 3 per cent below the inflation level.  Deputy O'Hanlon has indicated that if these increases were spread over the full year they would amount to little more than 5 per cent.  There is no point in the Minister trying to claim that there is an attempt by the Government to maintain the living standards of those on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that any politician looking for better social welfare benefits should also indicate where the resources to pay for increased benefits are to be found.  The Government are in power to govern and it is their responsibility to manage the finances of the State as best they can.  The recently published Finance Bill contains concessions to various sectors of society who are engaged in business of one kind or another and when one considers the loss in revenue to the Exchequer which will result from these concessions one is bound to conclude that the Minister is probably speaking with tongue in cheek when asking us to come up with ideas as to where he should find additional resources.</P>
    <P>A substantial amount of resources could be found through the taxation of the banks.  The section 74 lending concession enjoyed by the banks would, if eliminated, produce up to £55 million for the Exchequer.  These financial institutions pay virtually no tax.  One of them, the Bank of Ireland, announced late last year that they had decided to increase their tax contribution to the Exchequer in the coming year.  It seems extraordinary that large financial institutions have the power, with the connivance of the Government, to decide what tax they will pay and can use the tax system to deprive the Exchequer of resources that could be used to pay social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance indicated when introducing the budget that social welfare increases of 7 per cent and 8 per <Col N="549" /> cent were being offered on the basis that the Government expected the rate of inflation to be no more than 7 per cent or 8 per cent at the end of the year.  Recent forecasts indicate that the inflation rate will probably stand around 10 per cent, depending on whether present trends continue on the world scene in relation to the dollar and so forth.</P>
    <P>The Government's expectation that the increases offered to social welfare recipients would be in line with the inflation rate for the year is now proving to be false.  Rather than arguing, as Deputy O'Hanlon seems to be doing, that the proposed rates should be applied from April of this year right across the board giving a 5 per cent increase for the full year, we argue very strongly that, if the Government are to honour their commitment on taking office, there should be a substantial increase in the rates proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to respond to some of the remarks made by the Minister.  He said that the PRSI rates were at the 1982 level, but the workers are paying a much larger amount by way of various contributions than they were in 1982.  The Minister said the ceiling for contributions had been raised from £9,500 to £13,000 and gave the impression to the House that Fianna Fáil were responsible for that.  That increase in the ceiling was introduced by the Minister in section 4 of the Social Welfare Bill last year.  This Government increased the ceiling for PRSI contributions to £13,000. In effect, the workers have been paying more since this Government took office. It does not matter to the workers whether there is an increase in the rate or in the ceiling.  It is more money out of their pockets.  The same applies to the 1 per cent levy introduced by the Government last year.  That is another 1 per cent out of the workers' pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a small increase of ½ per cent in the rate of contributions towards the occupational injuries fund and the redundancy fund.  While the employer is paying that, nevertheless it is an increase in the contributions to the State from the workforce. I cannot accept the Minister's <Col N="550" /> reason that one half of 1 per cent will be the inflationary effect of this year's budget.  The increase in the cost of petrol and the effect that that will have on the cost of the distribution of goods, and the very marginal change in income tax, mean that the workers will not benefit. VAT on clothes and so on must contribute to increasing the inflation rate by more than one half of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if the Opposition wanted an increase in benefits they should point out where the money would come from.  The obligation is on the Government of the day to discharge their responsibilities.  This Government promised to keep social welfare benefits abreast of the cost of living.  They failed to do that.  Because the Opposition call for justice for the less privileged in our society, that is not a reason for the Minister to say that the Opposition should indicate where the money would come from.</P>
    <P>Earlier this morning I gave an example of where money could be provided if the Government had taken the right economic decisions on the creation of employment.  Last year the Government allocated £180 million for capital expenditure which they did not spend.  Obviously they had that money, or presumably they would not have allocated it.  Still they did not spend it.  If that money had been put into the construction industry, it would have created numerous jobs directly in that industry and numerous peripheral jobs.  It costs the Exchequer £1 million for every 2,500 people unemployed.  The cost of unemployment to the Exchequer this year is £580 million.  If the Government got their economic policies right they could create jobs for the 65,000 young people who are unemployed and the other 216,000 people who are unemployed. We should try to keep more people at work instead of having all the closures we have had over the past 12 months.  Then the Minister would have sufficient money to give a realistic increase to recipients of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Last year the Opposition pressurised the Minister to give a double payment to social welfare recipients at Christmas. <Col N="551" /> The Minister resisted that on the basis that he did not have the funds available. He resisted it right up to the weeks before Christmas.  Then he was able to produce £18 million to pay those double benefits. I know the Minister recognised that it was necessary to give those double payments to enable social welfare recipients to get through the Christmas period.  The Opposition highlighted that payment all through last year because it did not appear in the Social Welfare Bill.  But for that, the Minister might have let Christmas go by without accepting his responsibility. It is unreasonable to suggest that when the Opposition call for justice for the less privileged in our society they are being in some way irresponsible.</P>
    <P>Last year when the Minister gave 12 per cent to those in receipt of social welfare benefits he said he fully appreciated that many persons dependent on social welfare incomes, the sick, the unemployed, the widowed and the retired, were finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet in the severe and prolonged recession.  That was at a time when he gave 12 per cent which was less than half of what they had received in the previous three years.  This year the Minister offers them 7 per cent.  How could the Minister have made a statement like that last year and offer social welfare recipients 7 per cent this year?</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa may not have been here when I started my contribution this morning.  I pointed out that our objection to this section was to the low rate of increase and the fact that it was not being paid until July.  We do not accept that an increase of 7 per cent is sufficient.  It should be double that to ensure that those who are dependent on social welfare benefits will be able to survive on minimum living standards throughout the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question.  Last year's budget included a provision for a family income supplement for the lower paid workers. The scheme was scheduled to be introduced in October 1983.  It was then postponed until December but, in fact, it was never implemented.  Money was provided <Col N="552" /> in the budget for the scheme, I should like to know what happened to that money.  It could be used to implement this increase next month.  This was a very important aspect of last year's budget.  Every Member of the House applauded its introduction.  What happened since?  When the Minister is replying he might give the House some indication as to what happened to that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a number of points.  We have to appreciate that there has been a quite dramatic reduction in the rate of inflation.  Understandably that has to be taken into account by the Government in setting the level of the increase.  The Government issued a statement on 22 March saying that the increase in consumer prices this year, to November 1984, should be around 7 per cent.  The quarterly price increase up to February 1984 of 2.4 per cent includes the budgetary impact of about half of 1 per cent.  It is estimated that the year-on-year increase at February, excluding the budgetary factors, was about 7¼ per cent.</P>
      <P>We are endeavouring to estimate at present the outlook for the end of 1984. If we can contain the impact of wage increases on consumer prices, we have made a projection &mdash; admittedly slightly optimistic but not beyond the bounds of economic policy &mdash; of a consumer price increase of below 5 per cent in the year to February 1985.  We are correct in trying to achieve this target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the years ahead Deputies may find themselves in the position in which I am now, and I wish very strongly to remind them that a 1 per cent increase in social welfare benefits in one year costs £17.3 million, which is a great deal of money. I have provided for 227,000 unemployed people on the live register.  I did not fiddle that figure.  If I had knocked 1,000 off the figure it would have been £2 million less in the Estimate, because for every 1,000 on the live register approximately £2 million in liquid cash has to be provided.  I do not accept the view of Deputy De Rossa that all we had to do was to take more from the banks.  They would just <Col N="553" /> pass it on to ordinary customers, especially those obtaining credit.  It sounds impressive but it is a facile argument, just as it is to say that we could have provided the money under section 85.  The provision in the budget under section 85 is £3 million in 1984, £7 million in a full year, that is a quarter of 1 per cent increase in social welfare.  A sum of £3 million would not pay for two days social welfare benefits. There are about 6,000 jobs riding on section 84, people who had a particular tax benefit.  It became quite evident to the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very simple option facing the Government on that issue, and I will explain it to the Deputy. There are about 6,000 jobs here in firms which have availed of section 84 in manufacturing, and these jobs were hanging by a thread.  There was about £3 million available to the Exchequer, and the choice was very simple.  Does one want to make another 6,000 people redundant or to continue a particular tax concession? A figure of 6,000 people on the live register means that it costs £12 million per annum in social welfare and a further reduction in PRSI.  That does not in any way diminish the established argument that we would be better off without those concessions, but in a recession one has to be extremely careful not to exacerbate the level of redundancies, which is running <Col N="554" /> at the rate of 30,000 per year.</P>
      <P>I challenge the Opposition to state where the money would come from.  This is something we must face up to.  This year the Government have provided for a current budget deficit of over £1 billion. Every single pound of that deficit will have to be borrowed, either domestically or abroad.  It does not matter what political party are in power, if you want to have a current budget deficit you have to go to a bank either at home or abroad to ask for money to run the country.  You get the money at a rate which has to be negotiated, and this year, as I said, the deficit is over £1 billion.  That is a very substantial deficit, which was not envisaged in <i>The Way Forward</i>.  If we had now been following the rigours of <i>The Way Forward</i> we would have a current budget deficit of about £500 million.  To bring us through the recession, the Government have eased any form of deflationary budgeting and we have kept the deficit on a plateau.  We have tried to contain it but we certainly have not slashed it.  It is now running on 7½ per cent of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Simultaneously, we have endeavoured to maintain the level of social welfare payments.  The 12 per cent last year and the 10 per cent for short-term benefits in retrospect does not look as bad as I thought it would considering the rate of inflation.  Of course I should like to have a lot more money available to me, but there has been a major increase in social welfare requirements.  Social welfare spending will increase by 13 per cent this year relative to 1983 in spite of the weekly payment increases of 7 per cent generally. The actual increase was 13 per cent. The additional increase in expenditure would have to be provided for in any event this year due to the growth in the number of recipients, particularly with regard to unemployment payment, and the need to meet the cost for a full year of the 10 per cent and the 12 per cent increases granted in 1983.  All of that must be provided in full in 1984.  The proportion of social welfare expenditure to be met this year by the Exchequer will be nearly 15 per cent or £161 million more than in 1983.  That shows the recognition by the Government that the <Col N="555" /> capacity of the workforce and employers to make further direct contributions to social insurance through PRSI contributions is extremely limited.</P>
    <P>In deference to Deputy O'Hanlon &mdash; although I address this more to Deputy Woods &mdash; I would point out that I introduced the Social Welfare Bill last year. When I took office in December 1982 the first question I asked was whether there were any changes in the rates of PRSI. Although the then Government did not say anything about it during the election campaign, in the Estimates they had prepared and which we accepted as the basis on which the election would be fought, the PRSI ceiling had been increased from £9,500 to £13,000.  We took on board that very substantial increase and I put it into the Social Welfare Bill in 1983.  I do not cavil at the fact that it was done.  It is history now.  It was necessary to do it because the other option was to increase the rates of PRSI and leave the ceiling at £9,500.  However, that would have been manifestly unjust and it was better to increase the ceiling.</P>
    <P>This year earnings have increased by 10 per cent to 12 per cent and in many cases the percentage has been greater.  I would have been justified in putting into this Bill a new ceiling of £14,000.  However, we decided not to do so in order to give people a break with regard to paying more through social insurance.  The only increase this year has been in the health contribution limit where the ceiling has increased from £11,000 to £12,000 in accordance with the long-established practice of keeping the health contribution increase relative to increases in earnings in the transportable goods industries. Strictly speaking, the £13,000 limit should have been £14,000 but if we did that the Opposition would maintain we were putting a further burden on workers.  In effect, the Minister for Social Welfare is in a no-win situation, although I do not complain about that.</P>
    <P>In times of recession we have a major problem.  Recently I have been meeting colleagues in other European countries and I shall meet more of them next Wednesday at an informal meeting of <Col N="556" /> Ministers for Social Security.  In those countries there has been no increase in disability and other benefits.  In England they have abolished PRB completely.  In France under a socialist government, in Belgium and in Italy all social insurance benefits and pensions have been reduced in real terms, with no question of maintaining them to keep in line with inflation. In a number of countries their social insurance funds have run out of money. That has been a measure of the impact of inflation in those countries which profess to have very sophisticated systems of social insurance and social assistance. Relatively speaking, we are more than holding our own on the European scene but it is at a high cost in payment of PRSI and general income taxation.  What we are endeavouring to do in this Bill &mdash; minimal as it inevitably must be &mdash; is to strike that best balance.</P>

Last year there was a reduction in pay-related social insurance contributions and we dropped about £30 million. It all balanced out in the end.  There was also a decision by the Government to pay the long-term unemployed an increase of 5 per cent from October and this was a new budget decision.  The money was absorbed into that area.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 have been ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this section for the same reasons we opposed the previous one, namely that we believe 7 per cent is totally insufficient to meet the commitments of those people on social welfare assistance.  We believe also that it should have been paid from the beginning of April rather than from the first week in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why my amendments to this section have been ruled out of order because they would not entail any additional charge on the Exchequer but rather that the money would be spread over 12 rather than nine months. To offer 7 per cent to those on the lowest incomes, at a time when inflation is running at over 10 per cent, demonstrates that the Minister and the Government are totally out of touch with the reality of how these people will survive in the ensuing year.  The main group of people in receipt of social welfare assistance are those on unemployment assistance, many of whom are now on long-term unemployment assistance.  The Minister stated here this morning that he is giving them an extra 1 per cent, namely, 8 per cent, but that is still totally insufficient for them.  Many such unemployed people are <Col N="561" /> those who lost their jobs through no fault of theirs, who may have been in secure employment and who became redundant as a result of factories where they worked closing down.  In many such instances that was the result of the Government's economic policies about which we spoke here earlier this morning.</P>
    <P>The Minister in speaking about the proposed increases referred to <i>The Way Forward</i>.  What was significant about <i>The Way Forward</i> and the allocation of the Fianna Fáil Government for capital expenditure was that, when the present Government came to power, they reduced that allocation by £220 million. Additionally £180 million of what they had themselves allocated was not spent making a total of £400 million for capital expenditure last year that was not expended.  We know that had that money been spent, particularly in the construction industry, we would not now have our present unemployment figures.  Unemployment rose by 28,000 last year.  The projected figure of the Government themselves for this year is that another 30,000 will become unemployed.  I regard that as a defeatist attitude on the part of the Government.  Had they got their economic policies correct it would not then be necessary to provide so much money for unemployment &mdash; because many of these people would be working &mdash; and the Government would be in a position to pay a realistic increase to those dependent on social welfare for their existence.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the other groups, I might say that to offer a single woman £35 a week or a widow a personal rate of £40.50 a week and expect them to live on such amounts in this day and age is totally unrealistic.  The Minister should review his allocation and offer these people a realistic increase so that they will be able to maintain at least a minimum standard of living.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister effected a change in the administration of the national fuel scheme.  In the letter he issued to the various health boards there was a paragraph stating that those in receipt of unemployment assistance were <Col N="562" /> to be excluded from the provisions of that scheme.  That is the first time this happened and it created further hardship for these people.  I ask the Minister to have another look at it.  Small farmers on the notional system receive no increase irrespective of their means.  The Minister promised they would be factually assessed within three years but this year small farmers living on poor land on the west coast who have a supplementary income will not get any increase as a result of the Minister's decision.</P>
    <P>We are opposing this section.  The rates are far too low to keep pace with the cost of living and with inflation which is now running at 10½ per cent.  If one takes a 7 per cent increase and spreads it out over the whole year it is 5¼ per cent which is half of the current inflation rate.  We cannot accept this derisory increase to those who depend on social welfare assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>Many workers over the age of 50 years who are made redundant will never work again.  I know of a case in Limerick where a man was made redundant 16 months ago.  He got a lump sum of £10,000 in a redundancy settlement. His daughter was getting married and he decided to give that to her to help her to set up home.  He decided that was the best thing he could do as he had no other way of helping her.  His unemployment benefit has ceased and he will be receiving unemployment assistance.  He started signing-on on 29 January.  He has not received a penny since because officers from the Department of Social Welfare are trying to find out what he did with his redundancy settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a trade unionist I negotiated settlements which were the best of their kind. We have a peculiar position here in that the level of redundancy payments are much lower than they are in other countries because the laws governing redundancy there are far more stringent.  When Pan-American Airlines pulled out of Shannon in 1974 we negotiated an excellent settlement.  When there were similar redundancies in Italy involving the same airline, some of the pilots retired to the Algarve for the rest of their lives on the settlements they received.  Our rates were <Col N="563" /> kept deliberately low as an incentive to foreign companies to come here.</P>
    <P>A redundant worker is entitled to severance payments of up to £6,000 before paying tax.  It goes up to £10,000 for what is called top slice relief if the person was not made redundant before.  The Department seem to be penalising people who are made redundant.  People who are made redundant have nothing else to live on but their redundancy payments.  It is given to them as a form of compensation. They are now being hounded by officers in the Department of Social Welfare.  I ask the Minister to look at this.  It rings very badly to the people I represent.  We are nodding very generously in the direction of the banks and companies, and yet we are telling workers who are kicked out of their jobs without any compassion that they are to be penalised for being made redundant.  It is difficult to persuade workers that there is an element of justice in all this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I question the Minister on this aspect of the Bill.  When a person is made redundant and receives redundancy payment they are entitled to contributory social welfare.  The fact that they are questioned about their redundancy payment automatically makes them non-contributory.  We are talking about the Act itself.  They are entitled to all the services because they are contributory but if officers from the Department are calling to doors and asking what has been done with redundancy payments, the people automatically become non-contributory. Is that true?  We must clarify that.  Some of these people would have had 40 years' service.  Why are they now being questioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the points raised by Deputies Prendergast and Wyse, we must accept the fact that, under unemployment assistance legislation, when a person is assessed for unemployment assistance all income is taken into account.  That arises where people, for one reason or another, may decide to divest themselves of their present means in order to qualify for unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="564" />
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about redundant workers.  They are not claiming unemployment assistance but unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the issue raised by Deputy Prendergast first. In many respects, the point raised by Deputy Wyse is parallel to that.  The social welfare officer is obliged to take into account all income and means available to a person applying for unemployment assistance.  Every case is assessed on its merits.  The amount of £10,000 mentioned by Deputy Prendergast would not necessarily be assessed against him. It would be taken into account and would depend on his circumstances.  People are not questioned in relation to unemployment benefit.  The only question asked is about their eligibility and the extent to which they are available for work.  They are not questioned about the amount of redundancy payments for benefit purposes. To that extent the issue does not arise.</P>
      <P>If one gets a substantial amount of money from an employer and then decides to give it away or spend it, social welfare officers are entitled to inquire what has happened to it and take it into account in assessing the social assistance which is means tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the overall point raised by Deputy O'Hanlon, section 4 of the Bill provides for a 7 per cent increase in short-term weekly assistance payments and similar increases are being made in the monthly rates of children's allowances. The rates of unemployment assistance for long duration recipients were increased by 5 per cent last October and they are being increased by 8 per cent now.  The proposed new rates for this category are shown in Schedule B, Part I. 1 A (1).  The effect of this is to link the means test for the purposes of entitlement to a qualification certificate as provided for in section 136 (3) of the Consolidation Act to the higher long duration rates.  This change is being made to avoid anomalies which might arise if the means of living continued to be linked to the <Col N="565" /> standard rates of unemployment assistance. I make that general technical point.</P>
    <P>Finally, the estimated average weekly number of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance rates is 287,000 and they have 273,000 dependants, a total of about 560,700 people benefiting from the social assistance increases.  Together with the social insurance benefit increases which we have just dealt with in section 3 with 683,300 recipients and 593,900 dependants, we have a grand total of 1,277,200 persons benefiting from the overall increases.  Finally, an estimated 1.2 million children will benefit from the children's allowance increases.  As Deputies know, there is no change in the overall structure of children's allowances this year.</P>
    <P>Regarding the notionally assessed smallholders, the system of means assessment by reference to the rateable valuation is being phased out due to the unconstitutionality of the rateable valuation base.  Notionally assessed rates of UA payments are not being increased, but smallholders can opt for factual assessment at any time.  Factually assessed smallholders are eligible for the appropriate increase in unemployment assistance, namely 7 or 8 per cent, from July 1984.  Rates of unemployment assistance payable to such persons were last increased in 1982 and about 12,800 persons are in receipt of these rates of payment at present.  That in brief is the position regarding the notionally assessed smallholders.  I am precluded under the High Court decision from giving them any increase but I am not precluded if they opt for factual assessment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 (2) (d) of the Bill deals with children's allowances. I reject totally the 7 per cent increase that the Minister is giving.  In 1983 there was no increase at all and we had not the normal double allowance that we had become accustomed to over the past number of years.  There was no double allowance in the autumn or at Christmas 1983.  Children's allowance is the only direct payment there is at the moment to those women who work full-time in the home.  At every budget time <Col N="566" /> it comes up for discussion and there was a great deal of discussion this year in relation to possibly the withdrawal altogether or some kind of control of children's allowances.  As a result of that speculation the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights sent the Minister a letter, as he knows, with a recommendation in it from the committee to ask the Department of Social Welfare to leave the children's allowances as they were until we could have a full look at the position of women in the home and direct payments to those women who work in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of things have happened over the past year and a half that would affect in particular those women who work in the home fulltime and their children. Charges have been introduced in relation to school transport.  The 8 per cent VAT on clothes, of course, is not relevant to children under ten years of age, but at the same time, as was proven here in the House by a number of mothers including myself, you cannot categorise children.  The fact that they are under ten years of age does not necessarily mean that they take size eight or nine in clothes.  Children vary in size, therefore it is wrong to categorise children according to the sizing on clothes regardless of the size of the child.  The new family income supplement covers only the first five children and after that makes no provision.  The 7 per cent that the Minister is planning to give this year means 20p per week for the eight-month period involved and if you take that over a 12-month period it means 14p per week which is in effect 2p per day per child.  No Government, particularly a Government who claim to be caring of people most in need &mdash; obviously this category of people are very much in need of support from the Government and Department of Social Welfare &mdash; can expect that 20p a week or, worse still, 14p a week or 2p a day, will be acceptable in this day and age when one considers the litany of increases that have affected and brought tremendous hardship to this category of people.  Has the Minister made provision this year for double payments in relation <Col N="567" /> to children's allowances?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment which Deputy Mac Giolla and I put down on this section and which has been ruled out of order was an attempt to bring the payment dates for the increases from July back to April.  The case for doing that stands in relation to social assistance benefits as it does for the previous section. The position at present is that while the Government have not increased the PRSI contributions, pay-related benefit itself is being reduced in this Bill, again from 2 April, not from July when the benefits are to be paid to social welfare recipients.  The benefits, generally speaking, would be paid in July, children's allowances in August, and we are told that the family income supplement will be introduced in November, although that date is not included in the Bill.  The scheme will be introduced by regulation by the Minister, but again, given the fact that we were promised this family income supplement last year and money was set aside for it then and it never materialised, it is quite on the cards that it may not materialise this year either.  Therefore, generally the benefits are being put on the long finger while the cuts in the benefits are being implemented from April or even earlier in some cases.</P>
      <P>A point worth raising is the manner in which the cuts apply to young people between the ages of 16 and 25.  We have the extraordinary situation that young people up to 25 years can be forced to be totally dependent on their parents should both parents or either parent be working. Some weeks ago I raised a particular case where a 19 year old had his unemployment reduced from £19 a week to £3 a week because his father got an increase in his salary.  In this day and age of independent young people that seems to me to be totally unsatisfactory.  It is, in fact, leading to many young people leaving their homes or being forced to lie about where they are living in order to get some kind of half adequate income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does the Minister expect a young unemployed person getting £3 a week unemployment to travel around looking <Col N="568" /> for a job?  This pittance would not even pay for the young person to go in to the exchange and collect his unemployment money.  Bus fares would eat up the £3. The increases proposed here are totally inadequate but, apart from that, young people are being treated very badly in regard to unemployment assistance. Does the Minister propose either this year or next year, or at any time during the lifetime of this Dáil, to introduce changes in that unsatisfactory system?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to unemployment assistance, a young boy or a young girl entitled to unemployment assistance with no hope of employment who decides to take up an educational course is automatically disallowed unemployment assistance.  They inform the social welfare officer they are available for work at any time but while waiting for employment they are taking up an educational course, whereupon they are disallowed unemployment assistance.  I think the Minister said he would have another look at this. It is vitally important that a young person who wants to continue his or her education should be allowed to do so and should be entitled to unemployment assistance.  There are hundreds of young people more than anxious to continue their education but because they would lose this income they are deprived of that facility.  Would the Minister address himself to that aspect of unemployment assistance and give these young people a chance?  If the time of these young people is occupied, be it with education or something else, there is bound to be a decrease in vandalism and associated anti-social acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn asked if there was any provision for double payment of increases in benefit for children next September.  There is no such provision.  The only reason why it was provided at the particular time was that it was a particular deal done by the Leader of the Deputy's party when he met Deputy Gregory who asked him for a double payment that September.  That <Col N="569" /> was the first time ever such a payment was made.  We have not provided for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is double payment at Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision for that double payment.  There never has been any provision for that in any of the Estimates.  In any of the Estimates over the past four years there has never been a provision for double payment. The situation is considered each year. That has been the practice of successive Governments.  When I inherited the Estimates for 1983 there was no provision for double payment.  It was a Government decision.  Having gone through the Estimates again we came up with the provision.  It was about £19.8 million.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon asked why not spend the money on environmental works or the construction industry.  This approach is becoming quite alarmingly fashionable.  Now Deputy De Rossa has a considerable awareness of the issues and I really despair when I hear him succumbing to that kind of argument.  I am now about to deny the argument advanced by Deputy De Rossa's own party that I should take a couple of hundred million out of social welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  The situation was that at the end of the year there may have been £15 million or £20 million which was not spent.  I can assure you that was not the fault of the Government. Allocations are made but the money is not always spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an argument made by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Labour is well able to fight his own corner. Naturally he would wish to have money for his particular schemes.  It is important to point out here that this additional Exchequer cost would represent about 35 per cent to 50 per cent for each employee in the event of such work being done.  I keep saying to local authorities and various other Government Departments that if you take even the highest payment of unemployment and pay-related benefits and the differential between them and ordinary trade union basic rates of pay for, say, an environmental or local authority worker and take into account the tax tables and return to the Exchequer by way of PRSI, income tax and so on, there is still a gap to be filled of between 35 per cent and 50 per cent.  That data has been available in the Department of Finance.  I hold the view that it should be more widely available, to stop the nonsensical view which is rampant that all one need do is take £400 million or £500 million of social welfare money and set people to work. One could do that, provided there is another £400 million or £500 million of Exchequer expenditure and that we increase our current budget deficit from £1,100 million up to £1,700 million or £1,800 million.  At that point we are told <Col N="571" /> to take a running jump into the nearest river because no bank, domestic or international, will fund that self-perpetuating slide into total bankruptcy.  It cannot be done and the sooner that observation is made, the better.</P>
      <P>Educational courses have been mentioned. I point out very strongly that the availing of an educational course does not necessarily lead to automatic disallowance of unemployment assistance. It will depend, again, on the circumstances and there is a multiplicity of educational courses.  I am concerned to encourage more use by unemployed persons of their own time, either in courses or in voluntary work, providing these do not interfere with their normal availability for work.  That is perfectly acceptable to me and I have issued directions to the employment exchanges throughout the country that if people want to do voluntary work for the community, they should not lose benefit.  As I understand it, they do not lose entitlement to unemployment assistance.  It is of critical importance that we act in a constructive and sensitive way towards the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the point raised by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn about children's allowances.  Ultimately, the community will have to face up to the fact that we are spending this year £174 million on childrens' allowances to 460,000 families for 1.2 million children, without any reference whatsoever to any income of the family.  I put it to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn that it is questionable that she and I, in terms of our separate or joint incomes, should receive childrens' allowances irrespective of our marital status, as we do receive them, tax free and without reference to income, apart from the fact that these are payable to the mother.  That, apparently, is the only criterion, but there should be other criteria.  I believe in equity and that people who are in poverty and mothers who are purely dependent on the small extent of childrens' allowances should be helped.  I believe that the 10 or 15 per cent of families who would not suffer greatly by a reallocation of that £174 million should be considered.  However, it is <Col N="572" /> almost impossible to talk politically about a rational, social policy on this issue. Automatically, every politician outside of those who wish to talk rationally takes immediate advantage and accuses one of being anti-mothers, anti-children, antifamily and anti-childrens' allowances. Time and time again I have spoken to Members on all sides of the House who privately agree wholly with me that the system is not equitable or fair, or the best use of resources, but it is virtually impossible rationally to discuss the matter on the basis of a reallocation of resources to those in greatest need in the community. One or other political party will immediately take narrow, party-political advantage of a perceived deprivation of particular families.</P>
    <P>I do not see any justification in very wealthy people across the board, without any reference to their income receiving childrens' allowances in that way.  No account is taken in taxation measures, or in respect of any other income allocation to them.  I do not know of that happening in any other European country in that setting.  I throw the matter out for discussion and for consideration by the House. Every time I have raised the matter the hare has been chased unmercifully to death around the House, with no effort to assess the degree of equity on this issue as between one family and another.</P>
    <P>Those who are most vociferous about the levels of income tax here and who scream about levels of PAYE and PRSI should reflect on the fact that that £174 million comes from them and is redistributed back across the board to all families. I made no proposals whatsoever in this Social Welfare Bill in relation to that matter.  There was a great deal of speculation that that might have been done. Frankly, I would be amazed, in the light of the extent to which opportunism resides within the Irish political system &mdash; a most blatantly opportunistic system &mdash; if that opportunism did not immediately raise its head, even though I have brought up this matter merely by way of observation and not as a proposal.</P>
    <P>I come to a far more serious matter in relation to unemployment assistance.  It was raised by Deputy De Rossa.  As I <Col N="573" /> pointed out to him, if we excluded all board and lodging assessments when arriving at the means of young people, we would require another estimated £25 million per year.  The latest figure I have, which is for 1980, is about £21.5 million a year.  The figure must be much higher now.  Automatically it would add another 25,000 to the live register.  Deputy De Rossa gave an instance.  I do not know the case but I have been trying to work out on the basis of the information given what the circumstances in that case are likely to be.</P>
    <P>Subject to correction, I have estimated that if the means assessed against that applicant derived from the value of board and lodgings only, the parents' net income, calculated on the information available, is at least £207 per week, that is double the average weekly industrial net earnings.  The calculation in the case of wage earning families is to deduct from the gross income the income tax, PRSI contributions, rent and mortgage repayments, with a parental allowance which is £90 for a two-parent family and £80 for a one-parent family, and to divide the remainder among the non-earning members of the household.  The assessment of means is limited to 12½ per cent of the net parent income.  As I have said, in the case cited by Deputy De Rossa, those parents would be in receipt of £207 per week net.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to include in our assessments any benefit or income enjoyed by the applicant, including board and lodgings if he is residing in the home with parents or relatives.  The purpose is to achieve some degree of equity as between applicants enjoying relatively easy circumstances and those who are particularly poor.  These matters are kept under constant review and are revised in relation to wage and cost of living increases.</P>
    <P>I do not regard the level of social assistance as being adequate.  I know that many families living on assistance are well below the poverty thresholds, particularly those on long-term unemployment assistance, those who have been on unemployment assistance for 15 months or more.  At least 50,000 such families are on the poverty line.  Many of those families <Col N="574" /> would want to be super-human managers of the money they receive if they are not to be hungry each week.  I believe that the political system we have must be transformed radically if we are to ensure that such families do not suffer from poverty. I do not make any apology for stressing that view, but I deplore the fact that political parties are prepared to use obsessional opportunism.  Their sole rationale is to obtain personal political power, to be driven around in State cars and to regard the fulfilling of that ambition as a contribution towards national social development.  I regard that as an irrelevant substandard form of democracy. Successive groups of politicians become involved in a power struggle rather than in a struggle to rid the country of poverty and deprivation.  The country has been plagued by this obsession with power and it has become an endemic part of the Opposition ethos&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I exclude Deputy O'Hanlon but I do not exclude the Opposition leaders, some of the front <Col N="575" /> bench Members with whom the leader of the party is surrounding himself.  The increases are barely enough.  I would have wished that they would have been substantially more but I was faced with a situation of having to provide for 227,000 unemployed people, many on unemployment assistance.  A 5 per cent increase was granted last October and there is an 8 per cent increase now.  That will just about maintain the level of low payments in this area.  It refutes the widespread argument that the rates might be a type of disincentive to work.  I must stress that the most important incentive to work is to have a job and not to be dependent on unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>No.  I am aware that it is not customary to discuss internal Cabinet matters but the Government as a whole frequently, and more extensively than ever before, even in the time of previous Coalition Governments, consider major social policy issues.  It is better that such matters should be considered by the Government as a whole. Cabinet sub-committees, like all sub-committees, have a habit of developing a life of their own.  All the points I mentioned this morning were raised by me at Cabinet level.  We act as a collective unit <Col N="576" /> and bring forward a collective consensus.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>For two reasons, we are opposed to this section which provides for an increase from £36 to £43 in the amount of weekly earnings disregarded in calculating the rates of pay-related benefit.  The first reason is that it will reduce further the amount that those on unemployment, disability and maternity benefits will receive.  People who become unemployed for any period of time, particularly people on disability benefit who may take ill suddenly and find themselves in hospital, will not be able to meet their commitments.  The Minister expects to save £2.8 million as a result of this provision and one must add to that the fact that by regulation the Minister intends to reduce to 75 per cent the amount a person on disability benefit can receive this year and to reduce from 80 per cent to 70 per cent the amount a person on maternity allowance can receive.</P>
      <P>We are concerned that such people will find their incomes so reduced that they will be unable to meet their commitments. I do not intend to deal with the section in detail because there are other matters I wish to raise before we conclude the debate on the Bill at 1.30 p.m.  We believe this provision will create serious hardship for workers when they find themselves ill or unemployed through no fault of their own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this section because we are reaching a situation where, in spite of the fact that workers are paying PRSI and are insuring themselves against unemployment and disability, there is a constant attack on the level of benefit they are paying for. The Minister is making a great case out of the fact that he has not increased the PRSI contributions this year but the fact that he is reducing the benefit a person receives is an attack on the whole pay-related benefit system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="578" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When the pay-related benefit scheme was introduced in 1974 a proportion of the reckonable weekly earnings used in calculating the rate of benefit was disregarded.  This disregard, or the floor as we call it, was set at more than twice the prevailing rate of flat rate benefit at £14.  It remained unchanged until 1981 even though the flat rate benefit was significantly increased in the meantime.  If the floor had been increased in line with the formula used in 1974 it would now stand at £74 per week instead of £43 as is proposed. Under the 1981 amendment Act the floor was automatically linked to the maximum rate of flat rate of either DB or UB at the beginning of January of each year.  This provision was removed under the Social Welfare Act, 1983 when the floor was set at £36.  It is being increased now to £43 in order to keep the overall level of benefit in proportion to the earnings they are now intended to replace. The change will apply to periods of interruption of employment commencing on or after 2 April of this year.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that pay-related benefit has continued to increase. We had a provision of £75.1 million for PRB in 1983.  This year the provision is £88 million, an increase of £13 million. This year pay-related benefit will be paid to 70,000 people on disability benefit and to 111,000 people on unemployment benefit. The saving is very small, about £2.8 million per annum, but the overall increase in PRB has jumped considerably from £75 million last year to £88 million this year.  Between unemployment benefit and disability benefit 118,000 people will benefit from that extra money used to pay pay-related benefit.  While every European country has dramatically reduced the amounts paid under this type of scheme we have maintained it.  In Northern Ireland pay-related benefits are no longer paid but in this country we will pay £88 million to 118,000 people.</P>

      <P>While disability benefit is being reduced from 80 per cent to 75 per cent, maternity allowance is being reduced from 80 per cent to 70 <Col N="579" /> per cent.  Why the extra 5 per cent reduction in the case of maternity allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It was to maintain the maternity allowance at 100 per cent replacement.  I can readily understand why Deputies say maternity allowances are being reduced from 80 per cent to 70 per cent, but with the increase in earnings and the changes in the tax rates what has happened is that there was a 110 per cent replacement of earnings in the period 1983-84.  Under the Maternity Protection Act there is a specific provision that in accordance with changes in tax rates and pay-related social insurance, there will be a 100 per cent replacement.  To achieve a 100 per cent replacement the 80 per cent figure had to be reduced to 70 per cent.  This gives full replacement.</P>
      <P>I have been accused, quite wrongly, by people who should know better, of reducing maternity allowance.  I am not.  I am maintaining the allowance at a 100 per cent replacement.  I met a woman the other day who had been giving her employer her maternity allowance payment, which, on average was 10 per cent higher than her net take home pay.  I would have been very loath to reduce maternity allowances in any way.  I question if I would have had legal entitlement to reduce it, but under the Act the payment is slightly more than 100 per cent. If I wanted to be absolutely accurate I should have reduced it to 68 per cent.</P>

      <P>At Question Time one day we had a discussion on the extension of the maternity allowance scheme and again on the Estimate some weeks ago.  We raised the question of the problems facing a mother with a new baby who takes a conscious decision to nurse her baby.  When her maternity allowance runs out she is still nursing the baby and she is technically available for employment but cannot be employed because nursing facilities are not available in most places of employment. Therefore she has to stay at home.  I asked the Minister to look at the possibility of extending the maternity allowance over a longer period in the case of nursing mothers or make them eligible to <Col N="580" /> receive payment of unemployment benefit. The Minister refused.  As late as this morning I got the final reply from the Department saying this could not be done and that they would not consider doing it.  As a move in the right direction to encourage mothers to nurse their babies &mdash; from a health point of view this is the best way &mdash; would the Minister consider doing for these mothers what is done in the case of an insurable person who stays at home to look after an elderly person entitled to a prescribed relative allowance? In that case credited contributions are made for the insurable person.  Could that work for these mothers?  I know the Minister cannot give a direct answer now but I would like him to consider it seriously because it could be done at some time in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the leasing of lands will be taken into account where a person leases the land over a long period.  Formerly the capital value of the land was taken into account.  The purpose of this amendment is to leave that option with the claimant &mdash; to have the capital value <Col N="581" /> of the land taken into account or the profit from the leasing of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, assessment on the basis of capital value is appropriate where assets are invested or capable of being invested on a long-term basis. What we are dealing with in this Bill is the case where land is leased on a short or medium term basis &mdash; three, five or seven year leases.  At present even where land is leased for a shorter term than three years the legal advice is that it must be assessed on the capital value basis.  In principle, however, it appears to be more equitable that in such cases the person should be assessed on the actual income from the lease, and not on the capital value of the land.</P>
      <P>It would be totally inappropriate in assessing means for social assistance purposes to offer a choice in regard to the method of assessment to be used.  The social assistance scheme is not intended to be used as a pick and choose system. We have been in close contact with the Department of Agriculture on the matter.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the family income supplement.  We are very disappointed that there is insufficient time to have a proper and rational discussion on this new scheme.  We are not opposed to the introduction of such a supplement and support it in principle but we are concerned about the detail of the scheme proposed.  We believe the administration will be difficult and cumbersome and that the scheme should be extended to cover not only those in full-time employment but also part-time employees and the self-employed whose income is within the limits laid down by the Minister.  Payment should be made to the spouse rather than direct to the employee where the employee wishes <Col N="583" /> that to be done.</P>
      <P>The principal problem relates to the method of calculation.  There is an arbitrary income figure of £95 for a husband, wife and one child, to which figure £15 may be added for each child up to a total of five children.  The difference is then established between this figure and the wages received by the person and 25 per cent of that amount is payable by way of family income supplement.  The maximum weekly supplement is £8 for a family with one child and £15 for a family with more than five children.  These figures are too low and there is something seriously wrong if 35,000 employees will qualify for this scheme because their wages are so low.  The level of family income below which the maximum supplement will be payable for a family with one child is £63. These figures are unbelievably low.</P>
      <P>Rather than introduce this cumbersome method of calculating the amount a person should receive, it would be simpler to remove all contributions payable by employees whose reckonable earnings are less than £5,000 per annum and then give a dependant's allowance.  There should be a dependant's allowance for all children and it should not be limited to five.  We are speaking about the poorest people who are working for wages which in some instances are below subsistence level.  The Minister might consider removing all contributions payable by employees whose reckonable earnings are less than £5,000 and then giving an allowance for their dependants.</P>
      <P>Is it possible that Government time could be made available between now and the drawing up of this scheme to allow a full and rational debate on the family income supplement?  There is not time today for a full debate on this new scheme but it is not to be introduced until November.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that there is not enough time left to debate this aspect of the Bill because it is an important initiative in the area of social welfare.  It is not one to which I have any specific objection in principle, except that it will encourage the payment of low <Col N="584" /> wages by certain employers, particularly where work places are not unionised.  It is of doubtful benefit in the broader sense but certainly there is a need to assist people on low incomes.  I would prefer to see the family income supplement tied in with legislation for a statutory minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The proposal is confined to families. The Minister is aware of a considerable number of households which would not in the general sense be described as families. There are single adults and elderly people without children who are also receiving very low pay and are on the breadline.  The scheme is confined to full-time workers.  Is it to be confined to workers working in excess of 40 hours per week?  This would be an indirect discrimination on the grounds of sex because about 90 per cent of part-time workers are women.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this scheme points to the fact that there is a need for a total restructuring of the social welfare system and the Minister has set up the Commission on Social Welfare to examine that. The Workers' Party have made a detailed submission to them containing proposals which would eliminate many of the anomalies in the code and provide for a basic income for all people whether in employment or in receipt of social welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation made available to me by the Government in 1984 in respect of areas of educational disadvantage affords me the opportunity to take various initiatives in certain sectors of perceived need.  These include handicapped pupils, children of travellers and pupils in disadvantaged urban areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  In all cases, my aim is to ensure that the standard of educational facilities available for the children concerned is brought into consistency with generally accepted norms and that the curriculum can be appropriately interpreted and implemented in accordance with their requirements.</P>
      <P>Approximately £30,000 has been allocated from the fund to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that one of the main problems of schools in disadvantaged areas is that the local communities are unable to supplement the capitation grants given by the Department and they inevitably accumulate debts.  There are some areas in Dublin's inner city where primary schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if any of the funds will be allocated to allow these schools offset their accumulated debts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the criteria for the allocation of available resources will be those areas where boards of management find it most difficult to raise the appropriate contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am specifically concerned about the very substantial debts that a number of schools in disadvantaged areas have accumulated. I am trying to find out if the Minister will <Col N="589" /> help such schools by way of financial assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an area where we will give some assistance but the extent will depend on the resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question but I will give some specifics on the present criteria.  The available resources will be concentrated in areas where boards of management find it most difficult to raise appropriate local contributions, where unemployment is highest and where, generally speaking, the links between community and schools are weakest.  That is as far as I can go.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for Public Services, 1983, provided for the phasing out of the scheme for the provision of caretakers in national schools through a policy of not creating any further posts and not filling vacancies as they occurred.  The decision is of general application and is still in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances it is not open to <Col N="591" /> me to sanction the appointment of caretakers for the schools in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in a school where the enrolment exceeds 600 with a staff of 23 a caretaker is an indispensable member of the staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that his party made this decision in the first place and I am sure they were aware of the difficulties for big schools. The management authorities of national and secondary schools are responsible for the day-to-day running of the schools including making arrangements for the carrying out of any caretaking work that arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The reappointment of a caretaker will not require the Minister to spend any extra money this year as it is simply a replacement of an existing caretaker and in view of the size of the school and the number of teachers involved does the Minister not agree that a caretaker should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided under the 1983 Estimates for Public Services to phase out caretakers.  The Government decision was to phase them out and included not filling vacancies as they arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dublin North West) Mr. Barrett (Dublin North West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North West):</i> The board of management of a school recently refurbished it at a cost of a £¼ million.  There is a staff of 23 and over 600 pupils in the school.  The school had the service of a caretaker since 1972.  Now that facility will be taken away from them.  How does the Minister envisage that caretaking duties, including maintenance, will be carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the fact that it was his party who made the decision.  Perhaps he should refer his question to whoever was Minister at the time.  I am aware of the difficulties of schools as regards caretaking arrangements. I would draw attention to paragraph 3.11 of the Programme for Action in Education which states that when it is <Col N="592" /> possible to consider the re-establishment of these schemes, a higher priority will be attached to caretaker appointments in schools in disadvantaged areas.  I am not in a position to say when it will be possible to reconsider a particular scheme but when it is possible schools in those areas will get priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify if we are dealing with the Estimates for 1983 or for 1984?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is when the decision was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Please wait until I finish asking my question.  Not only did the Minister implement the Estimates for 1983 but we are now dealing with the Estimates for 1984.  Does the Minister consider it a correct social policy that in an area where there is a high incidence of vandalism a school should not have the services of a caretaker?  Does she think that a school principal, in addition to his other duties, should carry out the duties of a caretaker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only reply to the Deputy by asking if she is repudiating a decision made by a Fianna Fáil Government and considers it to be very bad social policy.  I should repeat that I am aware of the difficulties these decisions cause.  We all wish that decisions like these did not have to be made.  However, I must repeat that the management authorities of the school are responsible for making arrangements for the carrying out of the caretaking duties that arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister propose &mdash; in the case of the provision of caretakers for schools &mdash; to implement the aspirations expressed in her Programme for Action in Education for the years 1984 to 1987 so that there would be <Col N="593" /> a renewal of this desirable objective? When can this school expect to receive the services of a caretaker particularly as the board of management have no way whatsoever of paying a caretaker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to the Deputy earlier, when it is possible, or when financial circumstances permit &mdash; and, as the Deputy knows, financial circumstances are difficult to predict in advance &mdash; these schemes will be reconsidered and a higher priority given to schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is avoiding the question I put to her, which was that the retention of a caretaker in this school would not cost the Department one extra penny than has been already provided for in the Estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said simply that Fianna Fáil had taken a decision to rule out caretakers and that she had decided to continue that policy.  I would ask the Minister to consider the reappointment of a caretaker for this school in which there are 652 students and 23 staff bearing in mind that it is essential that a caretaker be provided for this school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am very glad to say <Col N="594" /> that I do not see myself, and I am glad to say that neither do Fianna Fáil see themselves, as having slavish adherence to their policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister then accept that, apart from other considerations, there is tremendous diseconomy in having the school principal carry out the duties of the school caretaker?  Would she not apply her own good judgment to the situation, asking her Government to give her the necessary money so that a school of this size may have what is indispensable to the good running of the school, that being a caretaker?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the pupil-teacher ratio in our schools is regarded as the worst in the EEC while there are, at the same time, approximately 600 primary teachers out of work?  Does the Minister realise that, even to bring us into line with the position obtaining in Northern Ireland, we would need an extra 4,000 new teachers?  Does the Minister intend to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in phases by increasing the number of teachers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact the Deputy points out.  Perhaps it is necessary to remind the House that most other countries in the EEC achieved a lower pupil-teacher ratio because of a dramatically falling birth rate, without having to employ extra teachers which is different from the situation in Ireland; in other words, to improve the pupil-teacher ratio in this country it is necessary to greatly increase the number of teachers as opposed to what happened in other EEC countries.  As is stated in the Programme for Action at several points, the Government are committed to reducing the pupil-teacher ratio as soon as financial circumstances permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <P>In view of the pattern there, is the Minister saying to us that there has been a decrease in the school-going population or that projections over the next few years would so indicate?  Does she not agree that this reflects an increase in the appropriate pupil-teacher ratio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in the intake to the colleges does not reflect an increase in the student-teacher ratio which Deputy Mac Giolla appeared afraid of.  The bulge of those of schoolgoing age at each of the different levels has passed through primary and the primary sector is stable and probably will fall in the next few years whereas in the post-primary sector it is growing considerably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While perhaps I agree with the stability in the numbers, I could not agree with decreases as presented to me, therefore I could not agree with the Minister's interpretation.  In view of the pattern here, is it envisaged that the position should be improved regarding teacher intake in the coming year and the subsequent year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not envisaged. The important thing is that we would be able to find employment for as many of the qualified teachers as there are in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a final short question.  The Minister made the point that the numbers at primary school are stabilised and will not increase.  Could she give us some idea of where she got that projection?  I have seen projections that there are 500,000 primary school students at the moment and that is expected to increase to 600,000 within a decade.  Could the Minister explain where she got her figures?</P>

      <P>I am sorry, that was in answer to a supplementary question and I have not positive information on it in <Col N="599" /> front of me.  The Deputy's dual figures strike me also as not being very accurate, but perhaps I could answer a separate question on that on another occasion.</P>

      <P>I thought I had mentioned that several other factors governed the number of teachers available as well as the numbers coming out of the training colleges.

      <P>Would the Minister explain the clear conflict between nearly a 50 per cent reduction over the last few years in the number of trained teachers <Col N="600" /> coming out of the training colleges and the desirable objective as outlined in her paragraphs in the action plan for education? There is a clear conflict between the two statements.  Statistical information is given on the teachers available and the desirable objectives in the book.  Further, the Minister said that the Government must deal with a financial situation each year as they find it.  Is that not also in clear conflict with an earlier answer in which she harked back to 1983?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the second part of the question, I do not accept that there is a conflict.  I was pointing out the history of a decision in the first instance. As regards the number of pupil-teachers leaving the teacher training colleges, I have tried to make it clear that the Department make every effort to tailor the number of students going into the training colleges to their estimates of the number of teaching jobs available, taking into account various factors such as the numbers in the primary schools, projected increases, stability or decreases, and how many retirements will be coming on stream.  It is very difficult to forecast precisely the number of teachers who will decide to retire in any year.  We can forecast slightly more accurately the number of intake into primary schools.  Very many other factors apart from the intake into teacher training colleges govern the number of teachers available.</P>

The proposed review of the system of posts of responsibility outlined in paragraph 2.20 is also relevant in this regard, as are the proposals to increase participation in management as envisaged in paragraph 2.19.

Finally, is she herself committed to the role of the manager in the primary school and therefore to the necessity in the world today to have special courses a principal could undergo so that he or she will be able to cope with the various issues and inspire and motivate the staff and students for life?</P>

      <P>The inclusion of the question of management in the action programme was precisely the priority in helping managers to run their schools better.  I do not have the exact figure with me but, as the Deputy is probably aware, the in-service provision in the Estimate this year was more than doubled and the actual proposals for the deployment of that will be given to me in the Department's proposals as to how the in-service <Col N="604" /> training should be conducted.  I can assure the Deputy that when we have had the discussions with the proper authority there will be in-service courses for managers and people with appropriate responsibilities as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>The interim Curriculum and Examinations Board have been asked in their terms of reference to have particular regard to the need to ensure that school curricula make adequate provision for the personal development of the individual student.  In pursuance of that aim the board will be asked to encourage the development of health education in the <Col N="605" /> school curriculum in conjunction with the Health Education Bureau.</P>
    <P>As referred to in paragraph 2.14 of the Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987, there is an amount of work under way in the schools in the general area of health-sex education.

That will be in the very short term.  I do not know how long the course will take to design.  I think that is a matter for the person doing the work. I cannot answer that question but all the facilities and all the finance available to implement the course will be made available. As the Deputy knows, there are a great many other very good developments and, as the Deputy also knows, in convent schools in particular a great deal of good work is being done so, with all these advances going on, we would hope <Col N="606" /> to achieve a situation where every school will have a first class programme.</P>

It is quite clear from the report that the midland regional art organiser employed by the County Westmeath VEC is facing an insurmountable task and finding her work practically inoperable and the good work which should derive from her work is diminished because of the lack of assistance and the conditions under which she has to operate.

There is no question of any disagreement or any difference in that particular respect.  I then said that a considerable degree of resourcefulness is necessary in all areas of the public service at present.  That really is the extent of the difference between the Deputy and myself.

      <P>I announced on 20 February 1984 my decision to raise the capitation grant rate in respect of pupils in special classes in ordinary national schools to the level applicable in the case of pupils in special schools.  The improved rates involve an increase from £21 to £48.50 per pupil.</P>
      <P>Supplementary payments were made to the majority of schools on 20 March. Payments will be made to the remaining schools as soon as verification of enrolment figures has been received from the school authorities concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be necessary that educational and economic factors as well as population trends be considered in relation to the amalgamation or reorganisation of national schools in urban areas and each case would have to be examined on its merits.  Accordingly it would not be practical to set down limits on the sizes of schools which could be considered in the context of the proposals in the Programme for Action in Education. However, I can assure the Deputy that full consultation on all proposals would take place with the interests concerned before decisions were made in relation to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">

      <P>There may be some constraints on the Minister in regard to decisions like this and that each case would be taken on its merits, but I am sure that in making her proposal the Minister considered information on the effects of this.  I hope she can give an assurance that schools of four teachers or more will not be considered appropriate for amalgamation.  I am sure that has been considered by the Department. There may be a number of schools with fewer than four teachers which would require amalgamation, but has the Minister considered schools of four teachers or more?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be helpful to the Deputy because I appreciate that he wishes to be helpful to those schools. It would be unnecessarily restrictive on school managements and the Department to have to make a hard and fast rule about four-teacher schools.  There might be educational and economic advantages in amalgamating two, three, four or five teacher schools that are reasonably adjacent. For instance, you could have large <Col N="619" /> schools for boys or girls in which the numbers were reduced to the extent that neither schools had a teacher per class or the benefit of a working principal.  There might be cases, for example in Ballyfermot where the Dominican Sisters operated five primary schools which were reorganised into three schools in 1979 with between nine and 12 teachers per school at the time of the reorganisation. The Deputy can be assured that there will not be decisions made without full consultation, taking into account the educational advantages of amalgamation.  I could not give a definite statement on the number of teachers.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following regulations in draft&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health Contributions (Yearly <Col N="653" /> Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1984</P>
    <P>a copy of which regulations in draft was laid before the House on 14 March 1984.</P>
    <P>It is provided in subsection (3) of section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, that the Minister for Health may, by regulations, vary the rate at which health contributions are payable and also the income ceiling up to which contributions are payable.  It is also provided in subsection (5) of section 9 of that Act that a draft of any such proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.  The draft regulations now before the House deal with the income ceiling.  It is not proposed to vary the rate figure which has stood at 1 per cent since 6 April 1979.</P>
    <P>The income ceiling is at present £11,000.  It is proposed to raise this to £12,000 with effect from the commencement of the next contribution year, viz. 6 April 1984.  This will result in an increase of £10 a year in the maximum contribution payable.  This increase will be collected from most contributors towards the end of the 1984-85 contribution year, that is, in the first quarter of 1985.  The estimated additional yield is £2 million a year but in the current financial year ending 31 December 1984, only about £200,000 extra will be realised.  The balance of £1.8 million will come in the first quarter of 1985.</P>
    <P>The Health Contributions Act, 1979, provides that when setting a new ceiling figure the Minister shall take into account any changes in the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries as recorded by the Central Statistics Office since the date by reference to which the ceiling figure was last determined. The latest recorded information on average weekly earnings in those industries relates to June 1983.  The average weekly earning figure increased from £129.33 per week in June 1982 to £141.39 by June 1983.  This represents an increase of 9.3 per cent and when this is applied <Col N="654" /> to the current ceiling of £11,000, a new ceiling of £12,023 or say £12,000 per annum emerges.</P>
    <P>I should mention the new arrangements applying to the collection of health contributions from farmers.  At present, health boards are responsible for the collection of these contributions from approximately 100,000 farmers and it had been the practice to use a notional system, rv and a multiplier, to determine farm income for this purpose.  In July 1982, the High Court ruled that the use of farm rv and a multiplier to determine farm income was contrary to the Constitution. To deal with this situation, and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the Minister made regulations which provide for the assessment of farmers' income on a factual basis as in the case of other self-employed persons.  In effect this means that farm income is assessed on the basis of the profits or gains from farming activities less any expenses incurred in earning these profits and less any superannuation contributions which may have been paid. Demands based upon factual assessments, including any arrears outstanding, have recently been issued by the health boards to all farmers liable for health contributions.</P>
    <P>With regard to collection arrangements in the case of farmers' health contributions the general opinion held was that health boards were not an appropriate agency to collect health contributions, or indeed, the youth employment levy and the 1 per cent income levy, from the farming sector.  The situation has now been corrected by the transfer of responsibility for collecting health contributions and levies from farmers to the Revenue Commissioners with effect from 6 April next.  Regulations giving effect to this decision have been made.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned about the large scale evasion of liability for health contributions by the farming community and other self-employed persons.  These contributions form a very important element of the finances available to fund health services expenditure.  Any failure to achieve targets for health contribution receipts in these times of financial stringency <Col N="655" /> could only result in a reduction in the extent or quality of the services provided. It is manifestly unfair that a situation should exist whereby persons who have reneged on their obligations in this regard should be able to obtain health services without penalty.  Accordingly, I have advised health boards to make full use of every enforcement procedure available to them in the collection of amounts outstanding.</P>
    <P>As an added means of ensuring that all persons liable for contributions do in fact discharge their liabilities fully and promptly I propose to introduce regulations in the near future providing for a hospital admission charge of £100 in the case of persons seeking in-patient services in public hospitals who have not discharged their liabilities for health contributions. This charge will be additional to any payments for private or semi-private accommodation.  These regulations will come into effect from 1 June 1984 and will apply in respect of arrears as at the end of the previous contribution year, in effect 5 April 1984.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the motion today is simply to raise the ceiling level for health contributions from the current figure of £11,000 to a new figure of £12,000.  I now ask the House to approve of the regulations before it in draft form.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said the motion seeks to raise the level for health contributions from the current figure of £11,000 to £12,000.  I should like to know if the level of eligibility for services will be raised also from £11,000 to £12,000. There is nothing in the Minister's statement about that.  The Minister referred to the methods of collection and assessment for the farming community.  We believe that everybody should pay their health contributions but, because of the position that existed last year, in fairness many farmers would have paid had they known what the contribution was.  Following the decision of the High Court, and of the Government, on the abolition of the PLV system as a method of assessment, farmers did not know how much they owed to their health board.  Many of them who in previous years had paid their <Col N="656" /> contributions did not pay them last year because they did not have any idea how to calculate what was due.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate on the Social Welfare Bill I raised a few points that are probably more relevant to this motion.  One dealt with the methods of assessing farmers' incomes.  The Department of Health use two different definitions of &ldquo;farm income&rdquo;.  When assessing a farmer's entitlement to a medical card, the expenses taken into account are feed and fertilisers but they do not take into account deductible outlays on capital expenditure, machinery depreciation, bank interest on development loans. When they are calculating farm income for the purpose of the health contribution they allow interest for farming purposes but exclude all forms of depreciation, including capital allowances for machinery and plant, roadways and buildings.  I would ask the Minister, in conjunction with his colleagues the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance to get together to find a uniform system of assessing farmers' income for the various State benefits and schemes to which they might be entitled.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to take from the health boards the responsibility for collecting health contributions, the 1 per cent levy and the employment levy.  It should never have been a function of the health board to be acting as revenue collectors for the State.  It is only right that this responsibility should be taken from the health boards and transferred to the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The hospital admission charges need to be seriously considered &mdash; this £100 charge for those who have not paid their health contributions.  I am concerned to ensure that when a person comes to the doors of the hospital he will not have to pay £100 before he is admitted.  This would be a retrograde step.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to ensure that nobody will be denied admission to hospital simply because he did not have £100 with him.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy O'Hanlon, particularly with regard to the <Col N="657" /> £100 charge on farmers who did not pay their health contributions.  It is very important that the Minister makes it quite clear that if a person is brought to hospital following a serious accident he will not be refused admission because he has not paid his health contribution.  He should not be required to pay £100 before receiving treatment for his injuries.  I do not think anyone would like to see that situation develop.</P>
      <P>There are established traditional procedures for the collection of outstanding debts.  Surely the Minister like any other businessman, has to comply with the law of the land.  It would be a retrograde step if the Minister's suggestion was to be applied in an arbitrary manner at the outpatient departments of our major hospitals. I hope he will make it very clear in his reply that that situation will never arise and that people will never be denied medical treatment, whether urgent or otherwise, because of an outstanding debt.</P>

      <P>This £100 charge does not affect the outpatient departments. Nobody will be refused admission to hospital because he has not made his health contribution.  Both Deputies are aware that the response from farmers in relation to the contributions has not been good and the idea is to get these contributions to the health board because this forms a big part of income.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Hanlon said, we are dealing with the ceiling today, not eligibility. The Minister will make an order in relation to eligibility shortly and then it will be laid before the House.  The Deputies mentioned capital expenditure.  As a farmer I know that if one was allowed to write off capital expenditure against expenses it would be many years before farmers would have to pay any contribution. I would like to thank the Deputies for their contributions.</P>

What proposals has the Minister to raise the levels of contributions from farmers and the self-employed to the average level of £64 a year paid by PAYE workers, in order to avoid health board cutbacks because of shortage of funds arising from the non-payment of these contributions?  Could the Minister tell the House what he proposes to do in order to ensure that health contributions are paid by these people at the same level as paid by PAYE workers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide a new statutory basis for the making and administration of building regulations. At present the power to make building regulations is contained in section 86 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  The purposes for which regulations may be made under that Act are those set out in the Public Health Acts, 1878 and 1890, and relate only to matters of public health and safety.  However, since the enactment of the 1963 Act a number of factors, such as the need to provide for energy conservation and for a more flexible system of building control as well as developments in the EEC, have rendered the power available under the Act inadequate to deal with the range of purposes for which building regulations are now considered necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 (2) of the Bill, therefore, expands the purposes for which regulations may be made to include not just public health and safety but also the welfare and convenience of persons in or about buildings.  The regulations may also provide for the special needs of the disabled, for energy conservation, for the efficient use of resources and for the encouragement of good building practice. Section 6 contains the provisions relating to the procedures for the administration of building regulations and for a more flexible system of control.  I will deal with these matters in greater detail later on.  However, before going into detail on the different provisions of the Bill I would like to talk briefly about the background to building regulations and <Col N="661" /> the delay in bringing this legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made by the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Stardust disaster that there had been a 20-year delay in making building regulations because the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 authorising the Minister to make such regulations was passed almost 20 years ago.  It is no part of my purpose here to defend what did happen &mdash; or did not happen &mdash; over the years but I feel that I should point out that the power conferred on the Minister in the 1963 Act was an enabling one and that it did not impose an obligation on the Minister to make building regulations by any particular date, or indeed at all.  Deputies will be familiar with many similar enabling powers scattered throughout different legislative codes.</P>
    <P>These provisions do not confer obligations on Ministers but are intended by the Oireachtas to be a means by which a Minister can decide at his discretion whether and when he should make use of the powers conferred on him.  The implication that a period of time which elapses between the enactment of an enabling provision and the subsequent making of the relevant regulations constitutes &ldquo;delay&rdquo; on the part of the Minister seems to me to run counter to this intention and, if accepted, would undermine the basic thinking underlying the enactment in the first place of enabling as distinct from mandatory provisions.  In such circumstances, Ministers might reasonably be slow to seek enabling powers of the kind referred to and might understandably tend to make provision in the legislation itself for matters that could more conveniently be included in regulations or, alternatively, postpone the seeking of the necessary statutory authority until the details of the regulations had been finalised. In either event, the outcome would be increased delays, inflexibility and loss of efficiency.</P>
    <P>In the particular case of building regulations, it is necessary to look at the background to the enactment of section 86 of the 1963 Act.  The thinking behind the enactment of this section was that it <Col N="662" /> would be convenient and more efficient to replace the old building by-laws, which were made under the Public Health Acts and which were considered to be too rigid and not conducive to change in building methods and technology.  It was decided to provide for a new regulatory code under the legislation dealing with planning, the administration of which could thus be merged with the administration of planning control.  There was no public pressure at the time &mdash; or indeed subsequently &mdash; for the early introduction of building regulations and little or no perception, either publicly or among the many interests concerned with the building industry, that the replacement of the old by-laws was a matter of urgency, whether for reasons of public safety or otherwise.  It is also relevant to bear in mind that during the years following the 1963 Act the main impetus in securing the effective implementation of that Act had to be directed towards the comprehensive new system of planning control and development.  This involved serious problems of organisation and administration for local authorities and it would have been unreasonable &mdash; and probably pointless &mdash; to have expected them to take on board at the same time a radically new system of building control.</P>
    <P>During the sixties and well into the seventies different views were expressed as to the need for, and merits of, introducing a new building code.  One of the main arguments made in favour of such a code related to the desirability of facilitating innovation in building by way of new methods and materials.  Another argument related to the question of laying down standards centrally for the sake of uniformity rather than having different standards in local by-laws made by individual authorities.  The main argument against the introduction of a new building code related to the extra costs likely to arise from operating it.  This situation continued for a number of years and it is only in the last few years that anything approaching strong general support for the making of building regulations has emerged.</P>
    <P>The Department, with the assistance of An Foras Forbartha, actually completed <Col N="663" /> the drafting of the regulations in 1976.  It was decided, however, not to proceed with the formal making of the regulations at that stage because it was felt that prior consultation with interested bodies in the building industry was essential to secure their general acceptance. For what reason the draft regulations were issued for comments to the various bodies in the industry representing builders and other professions, with a suggestion that the draft should afford a valuable guide to those engaged in the design and construction of buildings. There is little doubt that if regulations had been made at that stage they would have posed serious difficulties not only for the industry but also for local authorities.</P>
    <P>Over 500 different comments were received on the 1976 draft and these were considered and, where appropriate, accepted.  In addition to the technical comments a more fundamental issue was raised by the building industry.  They expressed concern that the proposed system of control as provided for in the 1963 Act would create inhibitory and costly delays in getting construction projects under way and seriously affect efficiency and employment in the industry.  The system provided for under the 1963 Act is effectively the same as that applying in areas where building by-laws operate at present and involves the submission of plans for approval to the local authority. It was also clear that the system proposed would involve the recruitment and training of a substantial number of suitably qualified staff in each local authority area, particularly those without existing building by-law controls; that is, all except seven local authorities.</P>
    <P>This would have imposed a substantial financial burden on local authorities at a time when, in common with other elements of the public service, they were having to face unavoidable limits on resources.  Also, the availability of adequately qualified staff in the numbers required was doubtful.  Again, in looking back now at arguments and discussions that were current at the time, it is interesting to note that the primary considerations <Col N="664" /> were matters of efficiency, innovation and costs and that there was little or no perception that considerations of public safety were such as to require the early introduction of the building regulations.</P>
    <P>Late in 1980 the evaluation of the technical comments on the draft regulations was completed and an alternative system of control, based on certification by the industry itself, was being developed in consultation with the industry.  An amended draft of the regulations was published in March 1981 taking account of the comments received.  At about the same time, a draft of a control system based on certification by the industry was circulated to all interested parties for comment.  Comments were received and following discussions with interested bodies further drafts of the proposed control system were circulated, the latest being in April 1982.  The publication of the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry on the Stardust fire in July 1982 necessitated a further review of the content of the draft regulations and indeed another look at the proposed certification system.</P>
    <P>The tribunal's recommendation that some form of approval by local or central authority would be required in relation to the fire parts of the regulations was particularly relevant in this regard.  The tribunal considered that it would be undesirable to rely solely on a certification system where fire safety is concerned. The provision in section 6 of the Bill for the issue of fire certificates by local authorities takes account of the tribunal's recommendation in this respect. The building regulations themselves have also been revised to take account of other recommendations made by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeals the relevant sections of the Planning Acts dealing with building regulations and sets out in one piece of legislation the statutory provisions which will apply to the control of the construction of buildings.  Section 2 of the Bill designates as building control authorities those local authorities which are fire authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1981.  This arrangement recognises the importance of the regulations in relation to fire safety generally and should facilitate <Col N="665" /> close co-ordination and co-operation at local level in dealing with matters relating to the regulations on the one hand and fire safety on the other.</P>
    <P>Section 3 contains the power to make building regulations and specifies the buildings to which they will apply and the purposes for which they can be made. Subject to the provisions of section 20 (2), under which existing building by-laws will continue to apply as a transitional provision to certain plans and works, the regulations will apply to all new buildings, including State buildings other than prisons and places of detention, provided the construction work begins on or after the date on which they come into operation.</P>
    <P>Provision is made, however, in subsection (10) for the exemption of certain buildings from the provisions of the regulations. It is envisaged that under this subsection, certain specialised buildings such as power stations, temporary buildings, detached domestic garages, small outhouses and like buildings will be exempted from the regulations.  The regulations will only apply to existing buildings where they are affected by structural alterations or extensions, by the provision of new services, fittings or equipment or where a material change in the use of a building occurs.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the regulations will continue to be, as in the case of existing by-laws, to secure the health and safety of persons.  However, section 3 extends the purposes for which regulations may be made to provide for the welfare and convenience of persons in or about buildings, the needs of the disabled, energy conservation, the efficient use of resources and the encouragement of good building practice.  The matters for which the regulations may prescribe standards are set out in the First Schedule to the Bill and different standards and provisions of the regulations may be prescribed in relation to different classes of buildings or buildings in different areas.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides the power for building control authorities to dispense with or relax particular provisions of building regulations in individual cases.  It is difficult <Col N="666" /> to say at this stage whether many cases of this type will arise but it is desirable in any event that there should be a means for permitting a relaxation or dispensation from the mandatory requirements of the regulations where compliance with such requirements could be considered unreasonable in a particular case having regard to the use to which the building might be put.  A building control authority will have two months in which to deal with an application for dispensation or relaxation and if they make no decision within that time the application will be taken as being granted.</P>
    <P>Certain provisions of the regulations will not be capable of being dispensed with or relaxed and these provisions will be specified in building regulations.  It is intended at this stage that the provisions to be so specified will cover only Part A of the regulations which deals with such matters as interpretation, rules, exemptions, application of the regulations and the designation of purpose groups.  The section also provides for a reference to independent arbitration where a building control authority refused to grant a relaxation or dispensation or imposes conditions unacceptable to the applicant.</P>
    <P>Power is also taken in section 5 for the Minister to dispense with or relax generally any requirement of building regulations where he considers that compliance with the requirement would be unreasonable in relation to any particular class of building operation, works or material.  This power is necessary to cater for the development of new methods of construction and materials which do not strictly comply with the regulations but are otherwise acceptable.  Its use will probably be required only in isolated cases.  Similarly, if a situation arises where it becomes apparent that certain materials or methods of construction are not up to the required standard or constitute a danger to public health and safety, section 12 confers power on the Minister to prohibit the use of that material or method of construction whether generally or in relation to particular buildings or works.  This power is considered necessary to ensure that the use of substandard materials or methods can be prohibited <Col N="667" /> where their use is brought to the notice of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would like now to talk about section 6 of the Bill which provides for the making of building control regulations which will deal with the control arrangements necessary to ensure compliance with building regulations.  The section provides a flexible power which will enable different systems of control to be applied to different kinds of buildings or to buildings in different areas, or in relation to different provisions of building regulations.</P>
    <P>The present system of control which obtains in those areas where building by-laws are in operation is a full approval system involving the submission of plans and specifications to the local authority and their approval by the local authority before work can commence.  This system has been criticised by the industry; it is considered to be too cumbersome in that it causes delays and increases cost.  From a local authority point of view it is a costly system &mdash; and also a system that could not be introduced and operated without significant additions to the staff of many of the local authorities concerned.  Section 86 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 provided for an approval-type system only. The need to provide for a more flexible system is one of the major reasons for the Bill before the House today.  Much time, work and consultation with the industry has already gone into devising a new system which will, on the one hand, give the necessary degree of assurance that the requirements of the regulations will be complied with and, on the other, will eliminate as far as possible the kinds of delays that impose costs on the whole community.  Such delays can also have a disincentive effect on builders and developers and tend to slow down the whole pace of much-needed investment and development.  As I see matters at this stage, if we want a comprehensive system of building control, the only way in which we can achieve it, without embarking on the establishment of an elaborate, costly and time-consuming apparatus of administrative <Col N="668" /> and technical control, is to go for a system of certification by appropriate people.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am strongly of the opinion that the most expeditious system of administering building regulations is by way of a certification system of control. Under such a system designers and builders of individual projects will, on their own responsibility, provide certificates of compliance with the requirements of the regulations.  Apart from reducing delays and costs and allowing simpler administration, such a system can obviously be more easily introduced into areas of the country where systems of building control have not been operated up to now.</P>
    <P>Briefly a certification system would work generally along the following lines&mdash;</P>
    <P>At a specified time before construction work commences, a certificate that the work has been designed in accordance with the regulations will be lodged with the building control authority. The authority will register the certificate and keep it available for reference and inspection by interested persons. Any subsequent variation in the original design will be the subject of a separate certificate which will also be lodged with the building control authority.  On completion of the work, a certificate that the work has been completed in accordance with building regulations will be lodged with the authority.</P>
    <P>What I have said obviously amounts only to a generalised description of the proposed system which I have given for illustrative purposes only.  It is important to realise that the essence of the system is that it will not involve building control authorities in a scrutiny of, or in giving approval for, individual projects.  The authorities will have the power to carry out random checks and inspections of buildings but the Bill provides, in section 6 (4), that they will not be under a duty to ensure that buildings erected comply with the requirements of the regulations and that the facts stated in certificates are true and accurate.  These responsibilities will instead fall on persons giving the certificates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> The certification system has been the subject of discussion documents which have been circulated to the professions and the industry for comment.  Reaction to the general concept of certification has been generally favourable but there are still some important and difficult issues that up to now have not been finally resolved; these relate particularly to questions such as the way in which certificates should be worded and who should be allowed or required to give the certificates.  Concern has also been expressed by the professions and the industry generally about the general issue of liability.  It is my intention to discuss these matters with the industry and for that purpose I see the Building Regulations Advisory Body as providing a forum through which the consensus views of the industry as a whole on these and other matters can be articulated.</P>
    <P>While I regard the certification system of control as the most appropriate system of enforcement, I accept that some further safeguard is needed for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the fire provisions of the regulations, particularly in the case of buildings presenting a high life risk in the case of fire.  In this regard the Stardust Tribunal indicated that, while the merits of a certification system as a method of building control in areas other than fire was clear, its adoption in the area of fire safety was undesirable. At the same time the tribunal recognised that sufficient persons with the experience necessary for the operation of an approval-type system were not available, and further, that existing third-level courses were not geared to produce such persons.  It also accepted that owners, architects and engineers involved with new buildings should not be relieved of their duty to take care of the safety of other persons.</P>
    <P>I fully accept the tribunal's view in these matters.  I have therefore provided in section 6 (2) (c) for a procedure whereby the control regulations will incorporate a provision requiring applications to be made to building control authorities for &ldquo;fire safety certificates&rdquo; in respect of particular types of buildings. The fire safety certificate will certify in <Col N="670" /> each case that the building concerned will, in the authority's opinion, comply with specified fire parts of the regulations if constructed in accordance with the plans submitted.  It is intended on grounds of life safety and practicality to apply this procedure to high-risk premises. Further consideration needs to be given to the range of buildings which will be covered by this procedure but it is likely to apply for example to certain places of public assembly.  The range of buildings will be kept under close and continuing review.</P>
    <P>It follows from what I have said about the proposed arrangements for certification by designers and builders that while building control authorities will not be required to carry out inspections to ensure compliance with the regulations, they may do so if they consider it necessary in any particular case.  It will, therefore, be a matter for the designers and builders to ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with the regulations and, where fire safety certificates are involved, in accordance with the plans which were the basis for the issue of such certificates.  Once work is completed, inspections may also be carried out by the local authority, as fire authority, under the Fire Services Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out, the requirements of building regulations will apply to buildings belonging to or in the occupation of the State other than prisons and places of detention.  However, at present it is not considered necessary or appropriate that State, semi-State and local authority buildings generally should be subject to the control system.  This exemption will be subject to review in the light of experience of its operation.</P>
    <P>It was also proposed in the discussion document circulated by the Department in April 1982 that low-rise housing and small extensions and alterations should be excluded from the scope of the control system for an initial period.  The reasoning behind the proposed exclusion in this instance was that it was important to minimise disruption and dislocation of existing practices and procedures in areas where building by-laws had not operated before and that there was already a range <Col N="671" /> of inspections and requirements applicable to housing developments.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of low-rise housing and other small works from the control system will significantly reduce the amount of work which will have to be dealt with initially by the building control authorities. However, I would again emphasise that exclusions from the control procedures will not affect the designer's or builder's obligation to comply with the technical requirements of building regulations in relation to the works concerned. In any event, consideration will be given to widening the scope of the control regulations as soon as circumstances seem to make such an expansion practicable.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied that such exclusions are appropriate at present I am also aware that there is a need for up to date statistical information on construction work about to start and in progress and that the exclusions from the control system will leave a gap in the flow of such information that otherwise could be expected from a comprehensive control system.  It is important to realise that it is not simply a bureaucratic desire for more and more statistics that is involved in this problem &mdash; the reality is that a better and more timely flow of information on construction activity would contribute significantly to the better planning of output and employment trends in the building industry.  It may be that a simple form of notification of building starts and completions can be devised that will be sufficient to meet our information needs in the short term.  This is something that I will be considering in connection with the organisation of the control arrangements.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, there are still some detailed matters to be worked out in relation to the control arrangements.  I am satisfied that it would not be right to proceed with decisions on these matters without first consulting the interests involved and this is something I propose to arrange as soon as practicable through the medium of the proposed Building Regulations Advisory Body.</P>
    <P>The provisions of sections 7, 8 and 9 <Col N="672" /> enable building control authorities to serve a notice requiring action to be taken to ensure compliance with building regulations. The provisions of those sections are necessary if building control authorities are to be in a position to deal with breaches of the regulations that come to their notice.  The powers taken are similar to those contained in the Planning and Fire Services Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for inspections of buildings by a person authorised for the purpose by a building control authority. The section does not specifically impose any obligations on building control authorities but, nonetheless, it will be incumbent on them to consider objectively, in what way and to what extent they should ensure the exercise of the powers conferred by the section, taking account of their financial and other resources and of any other relevant factors.</P>
    <P>The power in section 11 for a building control authority to seek an order from the High Court is additional to that contained in the sections dealing with the enforcement notice.  This power is necessary to deal with an emergency situation where a building control authority may consider that, because of the risk to health or safety arising from construction work, it would not be prudent to go through the procedures necessary for the service of an enforcement notice under section 7.  The High Court order may require that a building be made safe and prohibit its use until this is done.  A similar provision is contained in the Fire Services Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>The Building Regulations Advisory Body, which is provided for in section 13, will be a body broadly representative of the building industry.  Proposed amendments to the regulations may be referred to the advisory body for its comments and it will also be open to it to initiate amendments.  Deputies will note that the section is drafted in fairly broad terms; this is deliberate as there is a wide range of issues on which the advisory body might be asked to advise.  Secretarial services for the advisory body will be provided by the Department.</P>
    <P>Penalties for offences under the Act <Col N="673" /> are generally similar to those under the Fire Services Act, 1981 and will depend on whether an offence is of a summary or indictable nature which in turn will depend on the different circumstances of each particular case.  Offences such as non-compliance with building regulations or with the terms of an enforcement notice under section 7 or particular offences which may be specified accordingly in building control regulations may be indictable offences and will carry severe penalties &mdash; a maximum fine of £10,000 and or two years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The types of offences which may be specified in building control regulations as being liable to conviction on indictment would be of a serious nature such as submitting a certificate of compliance with building regulations to a building control authority knowing it to be false. Summary offences will be liable to a maximum fine of £800 and/or six months imprisonment and in the case of a continuing offence, to a fine of not more than £150 for each day on which the offence is continued after conviction.  There is also provision that summary proceedings may not be instituted more than five years after the building is completed.  This provision is in response to the industry's concern that they would otherwise be open to prosecution for an unlimited period in respect of even small breaches of the regulations.</P>
    <P>In addition to any penalties which may be imposed by the courts, the Bill also provides that any person found guilty of an offence under the Act will not be entitled to sign certificates of compliance with building regulations nor have such certificates accepted by building control authorities for a period of two years where the offence is summarily tried and for ten years where it is an indictable offence.</P>
    <P>Because of the existence of building by-laws in some areas, it is necessary as a transitional measure to provide in certain circumstances for the continued operation of building by-laws after the date on which building regulations come into operation.  The particular cases involved are those set out in subsection (2) of section 20.  Section 20 is the general <Col N="674" /> transition section but there is one provision, subsection (7), to which I should like to refer.  Deputies are probably aware that, in areas where building by-laws are operated, small building works, particularly house extensions, have often been carried out in the past without by-law approval.  The fact that by-law approval has not been obtained and cannot be obtained in retrospect under existing law has caused problems in house sales as evidence of compliance with by-laws may have to be shown to intending purchasers.  Delays in the completion of house sales have occurred, very often through no fault of the vendor who may have bought the house when evidence of by-law approval was not required and this has caused hardship in a number of cases.  I consider that it is reasonable, therefore, to use this opportunity to provide that, where work carried out prior to 9 February 1984 did not comply with by-laws or any relevant statutory requirement, no proceedings shall be taken in respect of such non-compliance unless a building control authority consider the work to be a danger to public health or safety and serve a notice to this effect on the owners within six months of the date the building regulations come ito operation. Deputies will note that this &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; operates only in respect of work carried out prior to the date of circulation of the Bill, 9 February 1984.</P>
    <P>Before my final remarks there are just two other points I should mention.  First, some sections of the industry felt that the legal terminology used in the proposed building regulations, which is necessary to ensure their enforceability in law, made them difficult to interpret.  To assist the industry in this matter, An Foras Forbartha were asked to provide a guidance manual that would explain the different requirements, by way of diagrams, sketches, etc., in a way that would be familiar to the industry.  I understand that the manual is nearing completion.  As soon as it is available, I propose to publish the final draft of the proposed regulations so that the industry will have both documents available to them for study.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to refer to the educational programme, the purpose of <Col N="675" /> which is to familiarise the building industry with the technical provisions of building regulations.  This programme has been on-going for some time now and is being co-ordinated by An Foras Forbartha through the regional technical colleges and through other agencies.  I understand that the reaction to courses dealing with the regulations has been favourable and that many of the anxieties formerly expressed by the industry have been largely dispelled.  When the guidance manual and the proposed building regulations are available, the educational programme will be further expanded.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this Bill provides a suitable framework for the introduction of a comprehensive and flexible system of building regulations and building control.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of the House and I commend the Bill to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil recognise the need for a set of national building regulations which would include fire regulations, and we also recognise the need for regulations to ensure adequate enforcement of whatever regulations are adopted.  That does not lead me on to automatic approval of all that the Minister is doing in this Bill.  I am very concerned at the obvious lack of consultation between the Minister's Department and representatives of the construction industry prior to the introduction of this Bill here in Dáil Éireann.  It is inappropriate that we proceed to enact this legislation until such time as the Minister completes full and adequate negotiations with every sector of the construction industry and in particular the professions involved in that industry and those who will be charged with the implementation of these regulations which will introduce a rigid statutory regime which will have to be complied with by people in the construction industry and which it is obvious will place a very heavy responsibility on them individually to ensure that buildings which they certify comply with the statutory building regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I want to make it clear at the very outset that we recognise <Col N="676" /> fully the need for a uniform set of building regulations which will apply equally throughout the country, which will introduce uniformity which is not there at present, and which when fully operational will be a guarantee to the public that from the health, fire and construction or building points of view the buildings will be safe for them to use.  The present position is very unsatisfactory.  I understand that Dublin and Cork are the only cities that have building by-laws and these are based on the Public Health Acts of 1878 and 1890 and the Dublin Corporation Act, 1890.  In the rest of the country different counties have their own by-laws or, more correctly, in many cases they have their own practices and the operation of these depends on the attitudes, approaches and experiences of local government officials in different local authority areas.  We are all aware that over the past hundred years views have changed and a practice of using say, timber-framed buildings might be acceptable in Limerick city but it may not be acceptable in the Limerick county area. Therefore, the present situation contains anomalies which would be removed through the introduction of a uniform set of building regulations applying throughout each of the 26 counties.</P>
    <P>The work that has gone into the preparation of these building regulations has been played down by the Minister in his introductory speech, as I understand they have been under consideration for the past 15 odd years.  Certainly every Minister for the Environment over the past 11 or 12 years has been urging his officials to proceed with the preparation of national building regulations, but from what the Minister has indicated in his speech, very little was done until the tragic Stardust fire, and the Minister seems to indicate that, following the tribunal which was set up to investigate that awful happening, only since then have the Department been really active in coming forward with the regulations.</P>
    <P>Draft regulations were published and then a revised version of the draft regulations was published.  These have caused great concern to people in the industry and, as has been indicated by the Minister <Col N="677" /> in his speech, over 500 opinions on those regulations were expressed by interested bodies, principally those involved in the construction industry.  I am not aware to what extent the Minister has responded to the 500 odd representations which he received.  Though it is clear now that a new set of draft regulations has been prepared and printed, it seems that the Minister wishes to proceed with the introduction of legislation here making the regulations statutory without making them public.  I find that very strange.  I do not have to repeat continuously that we all recognise the need for regulations of this kind.  We should also be careful to ensure that in our haste we do not impose something on the construction industry which is unworkable.  Some of the criticisms that have been made of the building regulations seem to indicate that serious difficulties will be created for the building industry if the regulations as we have known them were to become statutory regulations and to be rigidly enforced.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a clear indication and justification of the fears of the industry when he said in his introductory speech that he had asked An Foras Forbartha to draw up a guidance manual to the regulations to be accompanied by drawings and maps and a layman's language interpretation of the regulations themselves, as anybody who glances through the building regulations will see that they are couched in very complex legalistic language and are not open to easy interpretation and will present a massive problem for the industry in the period of implementation which, I suggest, will have to be gradual.  Extensive educational programmes will have to be established to enable everybody involved in this industry whose livelihood depends on it to become fully aware of the meaning of the regulations as laid down in the booklet.</P>
    <P>However, it is very difficult to pass any comment on that when the regulations which the Minister is now talking about have not been printed.  We find it very hard to understand why the Minister sought to proceed with the Bill prior to the publication of the proposed building regulations which, I understand, are even <Col N="678" /> printed in his Department.  It seems that he is holding them back.  Therefore, he is asking the House to give him legislation to give statutory effect to proposed building regulations which he is not prepared to make public until the legislation is passed.  In view of the effect that that will have immediately on the construction industry I suggest that the Minister should postpone proceeding to Committee Stage of this Bill until such time as he publishes the proposed building regulations.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to hear that, I do not think that that was mentioned in the Minister's 22-page speech, and that I consider the most important information he has given the House.  It will relieve some of our anxiety if that is the Minister's intention.  I want to get that clearly on the record now: the Minister will not proceed to Committee Stage until he publishes the proposed draft regulations and the control regulations &mdash; both sets of regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the text An Foras Forbartha have put together.  That would relieve a great many of our anxieties.  I am pleased to hear the Minister say that, but I would have thought it would have been appropriate for him to have said it in his introductory speech.  What matters is that we take the correct steps and I think that is the correct step.  It would be very foolish to ask this House to adopt a Bill introducing these very rigid statutory regulations affecting the construction industry in a very traumatic way without taking all the necessary steps initially so that everyone knows what is intended, knows what is proposed and knows how these proposals will be enforced.  The Minister has taken a good deal of ground out of the argument I intended to develop.  The complexity of the proposals are not suited to detailed debate on Second Stage.  They are more appropriate <Col N="679" /> for teasing out on Committee Stage when we deal with the Bill section by section.</P>
      <P>The Minister gives recognition to the need for further consultation and he says that he is satisfied it would not be right to proceed with the decisions on these matters without first consulting the interests involved and that is something he proposes to arrange as soon as practicable through the medium of the proposed Building Regulations Advisory Body. Obviously the Minister has now changed his mind since reading his speech.  We were urging consultations with the respective representative bodies, the Construction Industry Federation and the professional bodies.  They have expressed very serious concern about the proposals to proceed with the implementation of the regulations without further changes and it would seem the Department in their haste to bring forward building regulations had adopted the old ploy of adopting a great many of the British building regulations and sought to co-opt them into the Irish situation.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the British regulations are causing a great deal of controversy.  They are the subject of a royal inquiry and it would be foolish for us to adopt the British standards on the assumption that they were suitable when the British themselves are seriously concerned about their implementation.  They are actually being reviewed at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Royal Institute of Architects called for urgent intensive collaboration to secure an equitable and effective system. It is important the Minister should consult with all interested representative bodies.  There are two methods of actually controlling the work according to the Bill.  One is the suggestion that inspectors from local authorities would be the certifying bodies.  An individual would be appointed in each local authority who would inspect each building at different stages and certify it.  That is the current British practice which, I understand, is under discussion and is likely to be changed to the certification system which the Minister himself says is the one he adopted.  I think we would all agree that of the two options the less cumbersome <Col N="680" /> and the one most likely to succeed without giving rise to the growth of a whole new bureaucracy and extra expense would be the certification system. It, of course, presents many problems for those charged with its implementation, those who will actually have to sign a certificate.</P>
    <P>In that area there certainly has not been adequate discussion about the implications and a whole new area of offence is being created for individuals who have been working in the industry and doing their best from the point of view of their professional expertise. Some feel that they are unavoidably being placed in a semi-criminal position, having to prove their innocence in signing these documents certifying everything they do.  If anything goes wrong it will be they who will bear full responsibility.  The Minister has taken every precaution to avoid any responsibility falling on any public body.  The local authorities, as the controlling body, will be excluded from any liability under the present provisions of the Bill but some responsibility should fall on them.</P>
    <P>Public buildings also appear to be excluded from the building control regulations, which is a retrograde step.  We have experienced this in the Planning Acts, where construction work undertaken on public buildings by various Government Departments is exempt from planning permission.  This has caused difficulties time and time again. The public are unaware of the intentions of the local authorities and State Departments with regard to these buildings and have no way of being notified in advance. Amendments put forward by this side of the House with regard to the Planning Acts have been rejected by the Coalition Government on two occasions that I can recall.  I again urge the Minister to reconsider Government policy in that area. There should be an obligation on Government Departments and local authorities to publicise their intentions with regard to the construction of new buildings, so that the ordinary member of the public can be made aware in advance of what is proposed.</P>
    <P>This exemption has caused difficulty in <Col N="681" /> the past and resulted on a number of occasions in very ugly buildings being erected in areas where private development requiring planning permission had already been refused.  The State are seen to contravene county development plans adopted by local councillors in various counties.  Generally, this brings the entire planning law into disrepute.  It questions, in the eyes of the public, the intent of Government Departments and local authorities in seeking to apply a certain set of standards to the public and failing to comply with them themselves in certain cases.  The Minister should ensure that some provision is made which would give local authorities, who are the controlling body, the right to supervise any building being erected by a Government Department.  Perhaps the exemption is reasonable in the case of prisons, but I do not think other buildings should be exempt.</P>
    <P>The biggest difficulty confronting our construction industry, as far as the adoption of statutory building regulations is concerned, will be in the whole question of certification.  Who exactly will certify the work?  The position of many people working in the industry, such as architects, engineers and builders will have to be clearly defined.  Some architects are members of their institute but others, many of whom are the best, are not.  No formal registration of architects is required here.  I understand that anybody can call himself or herself an architect.  If the Minister's control regulations lay down that an architect may certify a building, to whom is he referring?  The whole area of architects, engineers and builders is so vague that the range of problems which will be presented will be vast indeed.</P>
    <P>The building industry are looking at this Bill with great apprehension.  It will have serious and far-reaching implications for that industry and I shall try to give some of my reasons for saying that. I understand that it has been widely accepted by the professions that the building regulations as presently drafted are riddled with anomalies, legalistic and complicated language and are in part virtually impossible to interpret, either technically <Col N="682" /> or legally.  I am putting this much more strongly than did the Minister in his introductory speech.  However, he hinted that the regulations are couched in complex, legalistic language.  A well-known expert on contract law is supposed to have described the type of drafting in the building regulations as a hangover from the excesses of the Johnsonian literary style which believed that statements gain authority by being expressed in portentous language.</P>
    <P>If it is proposed to operate the control of the administration of the building regulations through this system of self-certification by architects, engineers and builders, it should be noted that the certificates of compliance would be required to be submitted prior to commencement, during building and after completion of the construction &mdash; in other words, the certifier, whether an architect, engineer or builder, who certifies a building as being designed and constructed in accordance with the building regulations would be liable in law to a subsequent purchaser who suffers loss because it is not.  By its nature, the potential liability in a document such as the certification document is much wider than liability for defective goods.  The documents may continue in existence for a long time and copies may be passed from hand to hand.  There is in the courts a continuing extension of the application of the law of negligence.</P>
    <P>It is significant that in section 16 (4) of this Bill the responsibility in the case of an offence under the Act by a corporate body can be extended to individual members such as directors, managers or secretaries who would be subjected to fines of up to £10,000 and two years imprisonment. We have already had criticism from the construction industry on the basis that massive fines are provided for in the Bill without their knowing exactly what the crime is to be.  The building regulations have not yet been published, nor have the control regulations.  If this House is to gauge whether £10,000 is an appropriate figure for a particular offence, it is imperative that we know what the offence is.  This is the situation into which we have been led in being asked to <Col N="683" /> discuss this Bill without seeing the actual regulations.  The question arises as to who in a building company will accept the responsibility of certifying that a building is both designed and constructed in accordance with the building regulations. This question is being asked in many large construction companies at present throughout the country.  If the individual &mdash; director, manager or secretary &mdash; is going to carry the responsibility &mdash; and the faults may not appear in the building for 20 years &mdash; he will carry that responsibility over a very long period.  This is a very serious proposal which cannot just be adopted without being fully debated and negotiated between the Minister's Department and all those involved in implementing it prior to its adoption.</P>
    <P>The Bill would have the effect of increasing building costs considerably &mdash; that is fairly obvious, but the Minister did not refer at length to it.  At present the industry is in the depths of severe recession, with about 50,000 unemployed building workers and hundreds of companies already bankrupt due to the state of the construction industry and the general economy.  If we are to impose statutory building regulations with the requirement of certification and the liabilities attached thereto, a major burden is being added to an industry already on its knees.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not have control over the timing of the introduction of the Bill but it is unfortunate it should have been brought forward at this stage when the industry is so poorly prepared to accept further responsibilities and costs. It is obvious that costs will be increased as a result of the application of higher standards.  There will be an indirect increase in costs as a result of the introduction of an educational programme in regard to the new regulations which will have to be undertaken at all levels in the industry, not just involving the engineers, architects and surveyors but the tradesmen and unskilled operatives, all of whom will have to be educated in the new requirements.  That will involve costs to cover administration expenses.  Probably <Col N="684" /> the biggest expense of all will be from increased insurance charges.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to whether it will be possible for construction companies and individuals in charge of certifying buildings to obtain satisfactory insurance to cover these new liabilities.  This legislation, therefore, could result in a situation in which badly drafted and vague building regulations could be interpreted only by the courts, and I am sure the Minister will agree that such a system would be unworkable leading to legislative and administrative impossibility.</P>
    <P>I cannot comment further on the building regulations, whether they are well drafted or vague.  I can only comment on the regulations already published, to be superseded by the proposed regulations which the Minister has ready for issue. The new set have not been available for public inspection and I have had no expert opinion on them.  I have no knowledge of whether the Minister took into consideration any of the 500-odd representations which he received on the previous regulations which were deemed to be full of anomalies and legal loopholes, with impossible sentences which presented great difficulty in regard to interpretation. Unless the new regulations are capable of easy interpretation, unless they can be understood easily by the industry and its operatives, we could be imposing an unworkable system on a vital industry when it is in great difficulty.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Bill in its present form should be enacted.  I suggest it should be postponed until the method of control has been decided by the Minister and until the new regulations have been published and the manual made available for inspection.  If certification is to be used &mdash; the Minister today said that he proposes to do so &mdash; agreement of professional bodies and the building federation will be necessary because any refusal to operate the system would cause an immediate clash with the industry which is under pressure due to the economic recession.  The regulations should be introduced on a phased basis to allow the industry and the local authorities to agree on interpretation without causing a complete log jam in the system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> I am pleased that the Minister has made an exception of what he called low rise housing.  That would apply to nearly 99 per cent of the houses constructed here.  That move will reduce the extent of the difficulties which might arise in applying the provisions of the Bill because it will eliminate a very substantial percentage of construction work from the effects of the control regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have said that the National Housing Guarantee Scheme, which covers a high percentage of the houses built, involves a certification system similar to that to be recommended for other buildings.  Certifiers and the managements of construction companies should be protected from inadvertently placing themselves in disastrous personal financial situations.  It is essential that certifiers should have professional indemnity and that construction management should be insured against claims. That would operate as an effective control administered by the insurance companies and would be in line with the French system which one section of the Bill proposes to emulate, without having the primitive effect of section 16.  The structure of the industry here is similar to that in Britain but unlike that in France &mdash; likewise, our constitutional law and regulations.</P>
    <P>This Bill would be completely alien to normal practice in Ireland.  For instance, the onus will be on contractors to check construction details by designers and to refuse to conform to these when the details are in error or impossible to interpret. In such cases it would be preferable for the contractor to prepare details, as occurs in France.  That is open for discussion between the industry, the professions and the Minister.  Some people feel that the Bill is drafted in such a manner as to suggest that anyone involved in the industry is a member of the criminal class and that therefore draconian measures were required to control and regulate the industry.  I do not think any of us view members of the building industry in that light.  Therefore, it is wrong to appear to imply that they have not been giving a good service and that they have not been seeking to apply the best standards until <Col N="686" /> now.  We are introducing a uniform set of regulations and we must remember there have been different regulations in operation for many years in each local planning authority area.</P>
    <P>I believe the constitutionality of some of the provisions in the Bill may be questionable, especially that in which directors, managers and secretaries of companies can be held personally liable for defects.  This is by-passing the protection for limited liability companies.  The defects referred to in the Bill will, I understand, fall into two categories.  For minor defects there will be up to five years liability and for major defects there will be unlimited liability.  If that is so the dangers for individuals certifying can be very extensive and continue over a long period.  In England in a recent court decision it was held that liability extended even up to 22 years from completion of a building where there was some deviation from the original plans.</P>
    <P>It is implied in the Bill that major defects will relate generally to public health and safety matters and I hope the Minister will clear that up.  If the legislation is passed in its present form it will be left open to all purchasers to sue for deviations and breaches of the regulations many of which are considered absurd and could not be complied with. I do not know what is in the new building regulations but that is the opinion of some well informed people on the draft regulations published previously.</P>
    <P>It seems that the regulations which are before us are largely a copy of the English regulations.  I should like to point out to the Minister that the Royal Commission over there are studying the adverse effects of their regulations.  I warn the Minister to tread warily in that area. Another example of this extended liability is where proprietors of a company who may have long retired from business can be sued and, indeed, held liable under the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Generally, while we consider it necessary to have a set of standard national building and fire regulations the proposals as published have been deemed unsatisfactory. It seemed to us that the Minister was proceeding to introduce them <Col N="687" /> without adequate and constructive consultation with the construction industry. In the talks which the Minister has indicated he is prepared to have.  I hope representatives of the construction industry, the Royal Institute of Architects, the Quantity Surveyors Institute and any other professional body that has a legitimate role to play in the construction industry will be concluded.</P>
    <P>In view of what the Minister has said we will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage but we would like to inform the Minister that we await with great interest the outcome of the discussions he has agreed to hold.  We hope the Minister will find just cause to change some aspects of the Bill as presented and to relieve some of the anxieties of those involved in the industry because of the manner in which he has proceeded to date.  When the Bill comes back for discussion on Committee Stage we hope the Minister will have had the benefit of the experience and wisdom of those who have spent their lifetime working in the industry and studying developments in it.  The existing by-laws have proved very restrictive in many cases to the introduction of new building materials and techniques.  The anomalies they have created are things we should not continue to tolerate for much longer.</P>
    <P>There is an urgency about the introduction of uniform regulations but there is a need to proceed with caution so that we do not impose something on the industry that will cause it major problems. The overriding consideration in our discussions must at all times be the well-being of the members of the community who will use buildings to be constructed in the future.  It is our responsibility to ensure as best we can through the application of the highest standards that those buildings are safe for people to use.  The previous method of controlling the use of materials was more akin to the naming of individual products and approving them as such rather than approving the performance of the product and laying down standards of performance.  For the standards to be specified would require scientific and legal language and then there would be no inhibition on the introduction <Col N="688" /> of the most up-to-date materials into buildings here.  We would not have different authorities applying different standards and laws.</P>
    <P>I accept it was necessary for the Minister in his introductory speech to go into some detail to explain that the reason for the delay in bringing forward these regulations was not any dilatoriness on the part of any of his predecessors or himself. I was pleased that he explained to the House that the planning Acts did not place a mandatory obligation on him to introduce building regulations but merely provided him with the opportunity to do so if and when it was considered they were necessary.  Any difficulties that may have arisen in the intervening period cannot be blamed on the non-production of building regulations at an earlier date.  At the same time one would hope that when the new standards are being applied that some of the difficulties &mdash; that is putting it mildly &mdash; that have arisen in the past will not arise in the future.  That will be possible provided the correct decisions are made on the standards to be adopted and on their application.</P>
    <P>In the event of the regulations recommending bad construction methods and in view of the fact that the Bill provides for certification of compliance with the building regulations and exempts the building control authority from any liability, who will be liable?  In the event of the building regulations containing bad construction methods which result in faults developing in the future who will be responsible?  Surely the person who has certified that the building complied with the requirements of the building regulations cannot be held responsible if it is shown subsequently that his certification was correct but that the fault lay with the person responsible for including in the building regulations faulty construction methods.  There is not any reference in the Bill to what will happen in those circumstances.  I hope the Minister will give some indication of what will happen if that occurs.</P>
    <P>There is always a great eagerness on the part of Departments to place responsibility on other individuals and exempt themselves.  I do not subscribe to that <Col N="689" /> principle.  If we consider that a regulation is necessary and that people should comply with it then everybody should comply with it, particularly those who draw up the regulations and lay down the law for everybody to follow.  The convenient exemptions written into the Bill, brought before the House and readily accepted have resulted in this principle being applied right across legislation in different areas.  I do not subscribe to that. Government Departments undertaking construction work should face up to their responsibilities in the same way that private individuals will be asked to face up to their responsibilities when these regulations are finally adopted in a revised form, I hope.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for indicating that he is putting on the brakes and that he is not proceeding full speed ahead with enforcing this.  I am pleased he has agreed to go back to the industry to have the necessary talks, to sort out the anomolies, and to obtain the definitions of difficult passages in the regulations as published which have baffled the best legal minds.  When the regulations are fully understood and capable of implementation, then he will let us proceed to make them the law of the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The building industry is the second largest industry in this country and plays a vital role in the economy.  It makes a significant contribution to the overall economic activity both in terms of output and employment.  Output in the industry accounts for 11 per cent of gross domestic product and employment accounts for 30 per cent of the total labour force.  This industry has suffered from lack of investment in recent years, not a lack of public investment, I am glad to say, because public capital investment in the industry has been maintained at a very high level.  However, private investment, which depends so much on confidence, has fallen dramatically in recent years to such an extent that it would be impossible for the Public Capital Programme to make up the leeway.  Indeed, it would have been unrealistic, particularly in present recessionary times, to <Col N="690" /> expect this to happen.</P>
      <P>There are many problems confronting the industry at present, the major one being to get private investment going again with a view to taking its share of total investment as it had some years ago. At present public investment comprises 70 per cent of total investment.  For that reason I welcome the Government's policy with regard to the economy generally but in particular as it will affect this vital industry.  Politics are geared to restore confidence and boost investment generally, particularly from the private sector, with a view to stabilising employment as far as possible.  The building industry has always been an avenue for investment of private moneys and I have no doubt it will benefit greatly from the Government's economic policies.  I understand there is a cautious optimism in the industry given the favourable economic trends which have been emerging recently.  I am hopeful that 1984 will be the beginning of the end of the recession in this industry.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the subject of this Bill.  The long-term development of such a major industry is of extreme importance both to those employed in the industry and to the economy.  We will require a building industry in the future which will be efficient, up-to-date and adaptable.  For that reason I am happy to endorse fully the proposals in the Bill as outlined by the Minister of State.  In particular I am glad to see that building regulations will not be confined to considerations of public health and safety and the needs of the handicapped as heretofore, but will be able to promote energy conservation, efficient use of resources in building and good practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anyone will disagree that there is a need for modern regulations. The existing by-laws, operating in only seven local authorities, are too rigid and inflexible to cater for modern developments in building materials and method of construction.  I did not understand Deputy Molloy when he spoke about the Minister's proposals being rigid because we could not have anything more rigid than the present by-laws.  As I understand them, the by-laws set out precise methods <Col N="691" /> of construction which must be adhered to.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with certification.  This is very important.  There are two views held on this by architects' associations. Some feel concern about the legal liability that certification would impose.  Anyone who has a statutory duty and does not fulfil it may be sued for compensation as well as for criminal liability.  Anyone injured may sue for breach of statutory duty, even if there was not negligence.  If you place a duty on the builder or architect to design in accordance with statutory regulations and certify that he has done so, then it becomes extremely important to make it clear that any liability for failing to do so is absolute.  If it is, an injured party has the right to compensation without proving negligence. He merely has to prove that the regulations have been breached.</P>
    <P>Another problem which self-certification gives rise to is the length of liability. A builder can build in accordance with the regulations and the house passed to somebody else, but the first purchaser may find the house defective and sue the builder.  Suppose the defect does not appear for ten years and the house has changed hands several times.  The original builder cannot be sued under the terms of the original contract because the ultimate purchaser was not a party to that contract.  The ultimate purchaser will then look for somebody else to sue outside the contract.  He may find the purchaser but he has a difficulty because the builder's certificate may go from hand to hand with the solicitor changing with each sale of the house.  The ultimate purchaser may try to sue the original builder but often a builder only forms a company for a particular job and as soon as it is completed the firm ceases to exist.  If the architect's name is on the certificate the purchaser could have a case against the architect.  The Minister should consider some kind of limit to the extension of liability.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the interpretation of the regulations.  They are very hard to understand.  A Mr. Abrahamson, a building expert, addressing a <Col N="692" /> conference of architects said that from walking around Dublin he had come to the conclusion that a proportion of architects could be certified.  In this Bill we are dealing with certification by architects, not certification of architects or other professional bodies.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with communication because good communication is very necessary.  Addressing the IIRS conference on new building regulations Mr. Abrahamson said:</P>
    <P>The type of drafting which permeates the draft regulations is nothing better than a hangover from the excesses of the Johnsonian literary style, which believed that statements gain authority by being expressed in portentous language.  There is nothing in legal science that makes it clever to continue to employ the excesses of 18th century style without having the ability also to include its virtues, without realising that language that then was merely high sounding is now also archaic, and steadfastly ignoring the long history in which that style of drafting has time and again produced failures of communication and with the help of incompetent or hostile judges has frustrated important social legislation.</P>
    <P>Good communication is essential and it really does not help communications intended to lead to safe building, without complicating and obstructing the building, process to use sentences of 187 words as at present in the regulations.  There is no reason why building regulations should not appear in the language and form which will serve the purposes for which they are intended.  The crucial question is how best information can be communicated to those who wish to build in the form they are likely to understand, absorb and act upon.  The best method of communication is by the use of diagrams, charts, and sensible everyday language. There should be a comprehensive and thorough educational programme with the object of making the content of the regulations available to all sections of industry.  The requirements should not only apply at the level of building contractors, architects, engineers, surveyors, <Col N="693" /> estate agents and foremen but at the level of all tradesmen and semi-skilled and unskilled operatives.  I welcome the Minister's initiative in asking An Foras Forbartha to provide a guidance manual to facilitate the understanding of the regulations.</P>
    <P>To return to the matter of certification, one set of architects feel there is a question concerning liability about which they are unhappy but another section feel there are benefits in the Bill.  Mr. John O'Reilly, addressing the IIRS conference on 2 March 1982, stated:</P>
    <P>(1)  The idea of the Architect having authority to certify that a building was designed in accordance with Building Regulations and that such certificate would be accepted as adequate proof that the building was so designed has a very strong appeal.  It also has benefits both for the Architect and his client in terms of time-saving, and in terms of &ldquo;certainty&rdquo;.  All doubt as to whether the Local Authority inspector will grant an approval or will disapprove in respect of submitted drawings is removed.  This element of &ldquo;certainty&rdquo; is worth buying even at a high price, but it is not worth having at all if there is still to be imposed a control by the Local Authority whereby it would be empowered to reject certificates or disqualify certifiers at its own discretion. This implication can therefore not be fully assessed until the terms of the proposed legislation are known.</P>
    <P>(2)  The concept of a new responsibility is not attractive to a profession which already carries a burden incalculable in terms of cost and time. Nevertheless this additional burden would appear not to be an unreasonable price for the kind of absolute &ldquo;certainty&rdquo; to which I have alluded.</P>
    <P>(3)  Manifestly any certificate must be limited to those matters about which the certifier can be certain.  In this context the Architect:</P>
    <P>(a)  Can certify that his own work...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> (b)  cannot certify with regard to the work of others...</P>
    <P>(c)  can only certify in respect of regulations about which he can be reasonably certain.</P>
    <P>It would appear that a large number of people in the building industry would find it time-saving and profitable to have this kind of self-certification introduced.  I am pleased to note the Minister's statement that the building industry has accepted in principle the idea of a self-certification system of control, subject to certain points of detail which I am confident can be resolved in the course of consultation with the industry.</P>
    <P>The building industry has served this country well and achieved high standards. They have given a good service.  I welcome the suggestion of an amnesty on small building works and house extensions carried out prior to the circulation of this Bill.  This would be of great assistance to many people who have had difficulty in selling property where by-law permission has not been granted.  This Bill will contribute significantly to better building design and construction and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill in that it is an effort to give to the country an overall common set of regulations for the control of building.  I notice that the Minister reserves to himself and retains the power to grant exemptions in certain areas and to certain buildings.  There has been an understandable concern in the public mind at the lack of consistency of standards, not only from county to county but even from site to site.</P>
      <P>It is of some interest that such matters as energy conservation are placed side by side with the encouragement of good building practice.  However, discussion on the Bill without the regulations is somewhat akin to a production of <i>Hamlet</i> without the prince.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that before Committee Stage he will publish the latest set of regulations so that they can be studied by the industry, by trade unions and by other concerned bodies while the Bill is going through the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that these regulations will be in <Col N="695" /> layman's language as far as possible so that they can be easily understood, not only by those involved in the industry, architects, engineers, contractors and tradesmen but also by the clients for whom the buildings are being constructed. The public are entitled to understand the regulations.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he intends to have a manual published by An Foras Forbartha which will give the ABC of the regulations.</P>
    <P>It is generally acknowledged, not least by the construction industry, that there is an urgent need for these regulations but care must be taken to ensure that there is not over-kill.  The building industry does not need another set of complicated regulations which would not be capable of implementation and which would only exacerbate the haemorrhage affecting this industry.  I would have to disagree with the view expressed by Deputy Doyle because the building industry in County Mayo, particularly in Ballina, has been decimated.</P>
    <P>It would appear from section 2 that the local authorities are to have the power to appoint an authorised person under section 10 of the Bill to monitor and check that the building regulations are being implemented.  The task of this person or persons will be very arduous.  His or her say-so will make or break this legislation. There is an urgent need to clarify the role of this individual.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister feel the IIRS will have a major role to play in the implementation of the Bill?  Does he envisage the Institute changing the existing general specifications in line with the new building regulations?  It appears to me that if each item had a standard equivalent to or greater than the standard required in the building regulations, at least in regard to the question of the materials involved, the compiling of specifications would be greatly simplified. This would also help to simplify the certification system at least in so far as building materials are concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a composite application form available so that when a builder applied for planning permission <Col N="696" /> the form would cover the application he would need to submit later on to the local authority as the controlling authority.  A certificate of fire compliance could also be issued with the planning permission. This would have to be backed up by inspections as the building progressed.  It would cut down on some of the delays which appear to be inevitable when these regulations come into force.</P>
    <P>The Minister was not consistent.  Buildings being constructed as State, semi-State and local authority buildings should be subject to the control system.  Deputy Molloy voiced this concern of people who see projects going ahead in local authority areas for which normally planning permission would not be given.  It is incumbent on the Minister, and all of us, to make certain that the regulations which apply to any private person who is building also apply to State and semi-State bodies, and apply more particularly to State and semi-State bodies particularly in the matter of control.  They should also apply to the Garda and the Defence Forces.  While one can see the reason why an authorised person on a local authority might not be given access to the prisons, he should be given access to any place where people are billeted to make certain that their conditions comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to exclude low rise buildings from the control system.  In relation to an application for a local authority housing scheme, the Minister should see to it that these schemes are designed and built according to the specifications. There should be some control in relation to local authority housing schemes.  Whatever can be said for having low rise housing on an individual basis excluded from the control, schemes of houses which are being built should not be excluded from control.  I know this will cause some trouble for the local authorities but, if regulations are there, and particularly where a large number of houses are being built, they should be subject to the control envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A problem of certification was referred to by the Minister.  Quite obviously he has had discussions and he realises the <Col N="697" /> problems that are there, and which were mentioned by Deputy Molloy and Deputy Doyle.  As one who has had to certify and who, if the political winds turn, may have to certify again, may I say that I have grave reservations?  Who will certify?  Is it the managing director of a firm, the site management or the architect who designed the building?  What will happen in a case where, inadvertently or without the certifier's knowledge, material A has been substituted for material B and does not come up to the proper standards and does not conform with the regulations?  What is the position of a surveyor for a building society who has to certify whether planning permission conditions were complied with?  In future under these regulations he will probably have to certify that the building complies with the regulations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to a case in England recently which caused considerable concern to the professional bodies there, and is causing much concern here also.  I welcome the Minister's decision not to go ahead until we tease out all these problems between now and Committee Stage.  This will give all of us a chance to see and examine the regulations and compare them with the manual which An Foras Forbartha are to produce.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the Building Regulations Advisory Body. Obviously this will be a very important body.  It will be related to this Bill in the same way that the planning appeals body is related to the Planning Acts.  I cannot but comment on the difference of emphasis between this body and the planning appeals body.  While it would appear that the Minister is holding to himself the right to appoint whoever he likes, he should follow the example set by the planning appeals board and take into account the interests of the building industry and the professional bodies, engineers and architects, and also of the trade unions.  If necessary he should go to the same lengths as his predecessor went when reappointing the planning appeals board. In relation to a building for which planning permission has been obtained subject <Col N="698" /> to certain conditions, and which has not been started and will not start until such time as these regulations come into force, will the developer have to re-apply for planning permission?  I take it he will not have to &mdash; I see the Minister shaking his head &mdash; but I presume that he must then submit a certificate to the local authority.  If that certificate means there are changes being made will he not then have to resubmit the whole lot to the local authority?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The authorised person acting on behalf of the building authority to inspect buildings will be in somewhat of a limbo in that it would appear the Minister is not asking him to accept any responsibility. That person must accept responsibility in that he or she will be saying to the developer, &ldquo;I feel that your building is not up to standard&rdquo;.  Or does the person merely go out to inspect for the sake of inspecting? In this respect I cannot understand the Minister's comments when he said:</P>
    <P>The section does not specifically impose any obligations on building control authorities...</P>
    <P>What exactly does that mean?  Does that mean that a person can carry out an inspection and then do nothing?  Probably the Minister will have allayed some of the fears of the industry in relation to the type of offence that may be specified as being liable to conviction when he gave an example of submitting a certificate of compliance to a building authority knowing it to be false.  Nobody could quibble about that.  But there will be situations in which, in all honesty, a person may sign a certificate on site, when the materials originally specified may have been changed for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the Bill.  I welcome particularly the Minister's willingness to have consultations which can only have good results.  In consultation with the industry and the various other professional bodies the Minister should be able to reach agreement in relation to the whole problem of certification.  This is one matter about which I am very worried as one who might possibly in the future be in a position of having to certify. <Col N="699" /> Until this had been clarified to my satisfaction probably, like a lot of architects and engineers, I would refuse to sign without knowing what lay ahead.  It is all right to sign for the immediate future but, when one is signing for something that could last a lifetime and indeed beyond, which could have repercussions not alone on oneself but on one's family, then there is need for urgent clarification.  Therefore the whole question of responsibility of certification must be teased out.  The Minister has gone a long way today, in what he told the House, in allaying a number of the fears we had.  I look forward to seeing the regulations published along with the manual so that consultations can take place with the various interested parties within the industry &mdash; an industry normally regarded as the barometer of our economy &mdash; so that it may be allowed prosper.  Such consultations can only lead to a more efficient Bill and I have no doubt that that is what will happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want first of all to refer to the Minister's comments dealing with the delay in bringing in building regulations and pointing out that there has been a 20 year delay notwithstanding the powers taken in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  The Minister then continued to point out that there are many examples scattered throughout the Statute Book where there were powers taken by Ministers to bring in rules and regulations which were left lying there, unavailed of for very long periods of time.  It seems to me that the thrust of the Minister's speech there is an apologia for that.  I do not accept that.  It is entirely wrong that the Oireachtas should be asked to give substantial powers to Ministers to bring in rules and regulations who then leave them unavailed of and unused for perhaps five, ten, 15 or 20 years.  As the Minister correctly pointed out, there are many examples of that situation having occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite frankly it is an abuse of the power of the Executive to seek powers from this House, accumulate them, take them away from this House, vest them in the Executive, that is to say, a Minister <Col N="700" /> of one kind or another, who then becomes the repository of the power.  He then decides, in consultation with the Executive &mdash; the senior civil servants of his Department &mdash; if and when they will be implemented.  That is entirely wrong, it constitutes an abuse and is not something that should be tolerated or accepted.  As time goes on it builds up an increase in powers in Ministers and in the Executive, having taken away those powers from the Oireachtas where they should rightly reside.  It could well be that, with the passage of time, circumstances would change and powers bestowed on a Minister to bring in rules and regulations at one period of time, might, having regard to changing circumstances, no longer apply.  Ministers, in consultation with their civil servants, should ensure that they do not come into this House and seek substantive powers from this House unless they intend to and are in a position to implement them within a reasonable time.  What is a reasonable time would vary from case to case.  But to take these powers in the off-chance that at some stage they might get around to using them, that they might become appropriate at some stage &mdash; and I will put it as strongly as this &mdash; constitutes an abuse of the intended constitutional position of the administration of this country.</P>
    <P>I might turn now to the Bill itself which, in some respects, I find a disappointment. The intent and purpose that ought be behind a building control Bill and a building regulations system is to devise a procedure to secure that a member of the public who buys a house, or a businessman who acquires or has built for him a factory, is thereby guaranteed that he gets what he paid for, that is to say, a properly built house on the one hand or, in the case of business premises, a factory that is usable and suitable for its purpose.</P>
    <P>This whole building, regulations, by-laws process is being made by the Executive branch of Government as complex as can be.  It is now beginning to rival the complexities of the tax code, the VAT code and of the social welfare code. There is now developing the kind of situation <Col N="701" /> in which a developer or a person who wants to build a house, shop or factory must conform, obtain consents and permissions &mdash; to mention just a few I noted.  There may be others &mdash; outline planning permission, final planning permission, by-law approval, certificates of compliance, as there will now be, dispensation applications, fire safety certificate, certificates of reasonable value and National Housebuilding Guarantee certificates.  It seems to me that that kind of complexity is unwarranted.  It ought be possible to devise simpler, cleaner, more speedy and efficient procedures for getting permissions, for ensuring that buildings will be constructed in a proper manner, that will provide a reasonable and proper degree of protection for the man in the street, the person who ends up in the house, shop or factory as the case may be.  Will these regulations improve the position?  I suppose they will to some extent but by no means satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of the Bill and the intent behind it is not directed towards increasing any rights, powers or remedies to a person who buys a new house or factory and finds that it is defective in some way.  What it does is provide that a builder who does not comply with the regulations may be liable to a penalty. He can be prosecuted and fined or imprisoned. However, our experience has shown that prosecutions for breaches of planning regulations and by-law approvals in the past have not resulted in imprisonment or in substantial fines being imposed, although there have been some pretty appalling things done as regards bad planning, development and breaches of by-laws and regulations.  The sole remedy provided is that a prosecution can be brought for a breach of the regulations. A builder or developer can be brought to court with the expertise of the legal and architectural professions behind him.  He will be fined £100 or £50 and that will be the end of a lengthy and complicated procedure.</P>
    <P>I had an example of this recently in my own area in one of the estates in Dublin South-West.  A developer committed an offence under the regulations and was <Col N="702" /> brought before the District Court.  This happened in the last few weeks.  After the county council struggle in bringing him to court he was fined £5 and that was that.</P>
    <P>The Bill ought to go further than having it an offence not to comply.  It ought to provide, if it is to have any teeth or be directed towards achieving its objective, that the failure of anyone involved in the enforcement of the building regulations or failure to comply with them not alone is amenable to prosecution in court, which is what the Bill provides, but amenable to compensate any person who suffers as a result of a breach of the regulations and is landed with a house, factory, shop or whatever which is defective.  If that had been done it would have been a good day's work.  However, it was not.  I do not see any provision that a breach of the regulations to be brought in means that a person who suffers financial loss as a result of finding their house to be damp or defective may claim damages.</P>
    <P>I also wish to lodge a strong protest about the fact that the building control authorities are excluded from liability for failure to enforce the regulations in a proper manner.  That is an outrageous proposal to bring in.  The general proposition which ought to apply is that when a public or local authority of any kind takes on itself, by way of legislation passed in the Oireachtas, the power to do certain things, such as in this case the power to acquire certificates and send inspectors on to anybody's land and lay down standards to say something has been done and carry out inspections, it must take on responsibility.  That is the other side of the coin of power.  If they take upon themselves the power to do those things then they should have the responsibility to compensate any person who suffers damages as a result of their failure to exercise properly the power they have taken.  Why should an architect who signs a certificate saying that all is well with a house not be liable if it turns out to be damp?  The man in the street would have relied on his report.  Why should the Minister ask us to allow an evasion of responsibility on the part of the authorities for not exercising properly <Col N="703" /> the powers they have been given?  That kind of thing should have gone out with the last century.  It is something the courts have been trying to get away from.  The trend of legal decisions have tried to impose, where possible, responsibility as part and parcel of powers which are given.</P>
    <P>In their report on defective premises, Law Reform Commission &mdash; Report No. 3 of 1982 &mdash; examined this and made recommendations.  They appended a suggested draft Bill to their report dealing with the question of the building of premises. The title of section 3 of their draft Bill gives an indication of what they propose: &ldquo;duty to build premises properly&rdquo;. It would provide, if enacted, that a person who undertakes or executes any work in connection with the provision of premises owes a duty to the person who commissioned the work and to every person who acquires an estate or interest in the premises.  In other words, the person who undertakes the work is responsible for damages if he fails to do the work properly. They are responsible not only to the person they built it for but to any unfortunate person who is unlucky enough to acquire or buy it if the defect does not show up for many years.  Very often defects do not arise for many years.  Any person connected in a professional manner with the building or with supplying materials for it should be liable to be prosecuted and fined what usually turns out to be a relatively small amount of money.  That person should also be fully responsible to compensate the unfortunate citizen because that is who suffers at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>How will the people view this Bill? Take a young married couple going out to a new housing estate and trying to raise a mortgage with difficulty, what will they see?  They will see inspectors coming out and certificates of compliance, fire certificates and so on and will think it is being done for their protection.  That is a reasonable assumption.  When they get a loan through a building society and the building society's architect inspects the premises they will think it is all right because he came out and looked at it but <Col N="704" /> we know that the building society architect is coming out for a different purpose and that is to vet the premises for the loan being given by the society.  A young couple buying a house will see all this procedure being gone through, all these inspections being carried out, and they will figure, reasonably enough, that their interests are being taken care of by the building control authority and the architects or others who will sign these certificates and certify that all is well, and they will feel that all that procedure and documentation set up at great complexity will give them protection when they buy.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands, it seems that they will be sorely disappointed if, after going into their new house and putting the rope of a long-term mortgage or Housing Finance Agency loan around their necks, they find they are confined to the very minimum that the builder or developer selling the house can give them.  The builder or developer selling the house insists in his contract on keeping his responsibilities down to a minimum, and all building contracts provide that the builder's responsibility is kept down to the absolute minimum that the law insists on.  That is why the law should insist on more than it insists on at present.  It is true that the National Housebuilding Guarantee Scheme is insisted on, but that is very limited in its field of operation.  It covers major structural defects, but the overwhelming bulk of cases are not major structural defects that involve the house falling down, walls being dangerous or whatever.  They are things such as dampness percolation, a host and myriad of what may be to a builder minor defects but to the person coming into the house and not knowing the score they are an incessant nuisance.  They may be teething troubles and a nuisance, but the builder who takes the money ought to be responsible for putting them right.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate house buyer who is unlucky enough to find himself in that situation will turn then to see if he is getting his protection from the Building Control Bill.  No doubt he will kick up a row about that and approach his local representatives, and if he gets anything out of the Bill, all he will get will be <Col N="705" /> perhaps a prosecution brought against the builder or developer which, as in the case I referred to, might end up with a fine of £5, £10 or £20, something irrelevant to the trouble being caused to him as a house purchaser.  He should be able to say that he relied on the fact that this building control authority laid down a whole range of standards and provided for a whole range of inspectors to go out and check.  He will be surprised when he turns to the appropriate section of the Bill to find that, notwithstanding all those provisions and powers of inspecting insulation standards and so on, he comes to seek compensation from the building control authority &mdash; who did not control it properly &mdash; or from the architects or whoever signed the certificate that all was well, he cannot bring any claim for damages against them and that all he can do is seek a prosecution against the builder or developer who by then may very well have gone into liquidation.  In that respect the Bill is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider two major alterations in the main thrust of this Bill.  The first is that it be not only an offence not to comply with the building regulations when they are made but that any person who suffers as a result of the failure may bring an action for damages to compensate him for getting his house put right.  Secondly, having regard to the extensive powers being vested here in the building control authority, if they fail to fulfil their obligations in a proper manner and it turns out that, notwithstanding their inspections and controls, the thing still is not right, then they, the building control authority, and all signatories of the certificates, should be liable for damages to compensate a member of the public who has bought a house in good faith based on their permissions, inspections and so on.  Then, and only then, will a major day's work have been done to improve the lot of the man in the street who goes out to buy a new house or the person who has a shop, factory or whatever built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many others, I welcome the Bill.  However, we must ask ourselves how far the Bill goes or if in the <Col N="706" /> end it will go too far.  I was pleased to hear the Minister announcing that he does not intend to proceed with Committee Stage of the Bill until he publishes the draft regulations and also meets with all the people concerned.  I hope that when these draft regulations are produced and published they will be in a simplified form so that the building worker, operative or apprentice, carpenter, all tradesmen and all people involved will understand them properly.  I understand that the building regulations at present are very technical and very detailed and are beyond the understanding of many of the people engaged in the building industry.  It is well known that architects and the construction industry have had to publish a very simplified document relating to these regulations to enable many builders and operatives concerned to understand them, and for that reason I make this appeal to the Minister. I know that on Committee Stage we will be able to discuss these matters.  I hope when the regulations appear they will be, as I said, in a very simplified form.  The Bill is designed to control and I am sure we all welcome that but the question inevitably arises has it gone far enough? On the other hand, the question arises has it gone too far?  I welcome many of the provisions but there are some with which I am disappointed.</P>
      <P>The building industry is in a very depressed state and this Bill may have a good effect on the industry, but there is no doubt it will add to the costs of the industry.  The professional people, the architects, the engineers and so on, will look for increased fees and that will add to the costs.  There is no doubt about that. Some sections reduce the responsibilities of local authorities.  No doubt when an improvement comes, building will advance again at a very rapid rate and I am, therefore, a little concerned about the reduction in the responsibilities of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that building, such as small extensions, etc., which had not been granted by-law approval and the work was carried out before 9 February 1984 will now be exempt.  I welcome this but there are a few questions that arise. <Col N="707" /> Up to this occupiers of houses who carried out small extensions without approval experienced difficulty when it came to selling their houses.  When the Minister comes to reply I would ask him to clarify the position a little further. These extensions will in future be exempt.  Up to this an intending purchaser of such a property experienced considerable difficulty when applying to the relevant local authority or building society for a loan.  An unauthorised extension meant that the local authority or the building society would not grant a loan until the matter was put right.  The relevant certificate had to be obtained. Under this Bill that will no longer be the situation since these small extensions will be exempt.  Does that mean that in future there will be no difficulty and no delay? I hope the Minister will clarify the point when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the exclusion of low-rise housing and other small works from the control system will significantly reduce the amount of work to be dealt with initially by the building control authorities.  Last week when speaking on the Estimate for the Environment I referred to the problems which exist in Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council at the moment.  We operate the by-law system.  There are difficulties in getting planning permission for a single house, particularly in the hills because of the very strict regulations laid down.  I shall deal with this in greater detail on Committee Stage.  I shall have many questions to ask.  The regulations are very strict and, as I said last week, I am not asking for a reduction in standards but merely a simplification of the system and the regulations.  The exclusion of low-rise housing and other small works from the control system gives rise to questions. Will this mean that a person will have no difficulty in so far as a septic tank may be involved.  This is a very important matter and I will ask for clarification on this.  I want to place on the record the difficulties experienced by people trying to get planning permission for a single house where a septic tank is involved.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to me a replacement of the <Col N="708" /> existing control system which operates in Dublin and Cork.  Every planning authority, of course, has some guidelines laid down but the control system applies only to Dublin and Cork.  This Bill extends some control throughout the country generally and I welcome that.  As I said, it is very difficult to have a planning permission granted for a single house in particular areas.  I referred to the increase in costs from the point of view of the architect and engineer.  I believe the fees will inevitably increase considerably.</P>
    <P>I have not fully studied the Minister's memorandum but I was somewhat surprised, perhaps disappointed, at hearing nothing from the Minister about the taking in charge of unfinished estates.  The Minister may say that is strictly a planning matter but it is one of the biggest problems we have.  Deputy Taylor referred to lost court cases and so on.  A number of court cases had to be taken in relation to some developers in an effort to have these estates taken in charge.  I agree with Deputy Taylor that, when we are speaking of a Bill to control building, there are bound to be people who will come to the conclusion that their problems are now being catered for and they will have no further worries.  But that is not the position and perhaps during Committee Stage the Minister may widen the scope or enlighten us further on some of the matters that have been raised.</P>
    <P>These are matters which concern the house builder and are the real problems facing those who have purchased new houses in the past number of years, particularly in the Dublin city and Dublin County Council areas.  No matter what residents' association meeting one is invited to, or where one goes, one hears about these problems.  We are debating the introduction of a new building control Bill and this is the time to discuss these matters, before the Bill is passed.  On Committee Stage I hope for greater clarification on the points made.</P>
    <P>Any legislation which will help to improve the building industry must be welcomed.  That industry is going through a great depression at the moment, particularly in Dublin.  I have no doubt that the Bill will add some costs on the professional <Col N="709" /> side, but nevertheless, I welcome the Bill which will have my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of the Bill.  Everyone is now only too painfully aware of the need to ensure that the highest possible fire and general safety standards are incorporated in the building of all types of structures, whether public housing in the form of local authority houses, or public buildings where large numbers of the public congregate.  The &ldquo;Stardust&rdquo; disaster made all of us recognise that in future we must take extreme care that the materials used in the construction of such buildings conform to the required standard.  I am thinking, for example, of concrete which will stand up to the required acute tests, timbers which will be properly seasoned to stand up to the weight of roofs, etc., and materials used in internal construction which will be sufficiently fire-resistant to ensure the safety of the lives of those who frequent such buildings.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment also, as a number of other speakers have, on the recession period through which the building industry is going.  There is no doubt that that is true about this sector, as about many other sectors of industry.  It would be wrong, on the one hand, if there is a recession in a particular area, to accept second rate standards, or ones which are less than those required to protect the public interest.  On the other hand, one must accept that the introduction of this Bill will bring extra administrative costs and create some problems.  However, these will be created mostly for maverick builders rather than conscientious builders who have conformed in the past and are conforming to regulations.  The Bill will probably protect such conscientious builders who have, down through the years, gone about their work in a businesslike and forthright fashion, providing structures which will stand the test of time from the point of view of general safety precautions, and avoiding any structural defects.  They can proudly say that the buildings which they have constructed are a testimony to their industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would emphasise that many builders <Col N="710" /> go to great trouble and take a particular pride in providing a first class product. Unfortunately, the maverick builders bring the industry into disrepute, causing great problems, by way of competition in the pricing market and difficulties for the unfortunate purchasers and those who use the buildings, in the case of public buildings.</P>
    <P>My next point is important in relation to many other Bills, but particularly so to the construction industry.  No matter what legislation or what regulations are introduced, unless these are enforced they are totally and absolutely useless. Many times in the past regulations and conditions encompassed in the legislation were not rigidly enforced, with the result that the public in general are the sufferers. I can think of numerous cases &mdash; even given the house guarantee scheme and other schemes to protect the interests of the purchasers &mdash; where local authority houses have had serious defects which were not obvious for the first couple of years.  The State has thus been forced to spend large sums of money in ensuring that tenants' or tenant purchasers' rights are protected.  That is very sad.  I know that major structural defects can be remedied under the guarantee scheme. However, many other defects have no guarantee.  One example mentioned by Deputy Taylor was dampness.  There are many others, such as woodwork which sags because it was not of sufficiently high quality and should not have been used in the structure; foundation subsidence, flue liners which appear to become damaged at a very early stage so that one can practically remove the whole flue lining in some houses by removing the bottom one.  We as public representatives have come up against this difficulty time and again, with particular reference to local authority houses.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the private building sector, in very many cases the standards applied by them in private housing schemes are very often far higher than those applied in relation to the construction of local authority houses.  That is a criticism of the system which we ourselves created.  It should be the reverse. Builders will say quite openly that if they <Col N="711" /> tender for, say, a local authority housing scheme, they could not comply with all the conditions and continue to stay in business.  They could not produce a house at the price requested of them.  It appears in those cases that somebody takes on a contract and decides to remain in business, with the result that the unfortunate house tenant or purchaser pays in the long run, getting a substandard product.</P>
    <P>These are not isolated instances.  There are numerous cases where considerable amounts of public finance have to be spent by local authorities to carry out work which should have been done in the first place had there been proper inspection. This brings me to the question of the issue of certificates in relation to this Bill.  That is all very well, provided that at some stage somebody can say that the development was carried out in accordance, firstly, with planning and by-law approval and in compliance with this Bill, but also that it has been completed satisfactorily under that heading.  The logical progression of the argument would be that if not, as Deputy Taylor suggested, it would be open to the purchaser or householder to seek compensation.  We would have a welter of cases in the courts with people seeking compensation in regard to faults, many of which would be genuine but many others purely imaginary.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will discourage those who cut corners, particularly in regard to buildings frequented by the public such as hotels, discos, guesthouses, restaurants, theatres and cinemas.  When this Bill has been passed legislators will have a great responsibility to see that the regulations to be drawn up will be adhered to strictly in such cases.</P>
    <P>As a local authority member I have experience of the disincentives to individuals wishing to extend their premises because of bureaucracy and red tape, even before they get to the development stage.  It would be a good idea to incorporate a by-law by which approval would be given for grants and other requirements when planning approval is being granted.  An inspection could be carried out at the end of the development to see <Col N="712" /> if the work was in accordance with the plan, and this would avoid repeated applications to planning authorities. Everything possible should be done to streamline administration.  Individuals looking for planning permission have their interests militated against <i>vis-à-vis</i> large scale developers.  An individual applying for planning permission for a single house or an extension plus, perhaps, a loan from the local authority, would need two brief cases to carry all the documentation.  Gradually this is getting worse because every week we pass legislation imposing extra responsibilities and giving extra powers to local authorities who are becoming more and more the agents of the Department of the Environment.  It is sad that there is so little recognition of the extra burdens being put on local authorities.  Therefore the system is breaking down, but extra finance is not being made available to local authorities commensurate with their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Earlier I failed to refer to the building of hospitals and various health board institutions <i>vis-à-vis</i> these regulations.  It is most important that they be applied very stringently in regard to the construction of hospitals, geriatric institutions or any premises in which large numbers of people are housed or incarcerated.  We have been fortunate here, with one or two exceptions, because we have not had disasters in that area but we should take note of what has happened elsewhere and of how these tragedies might have been averted if regulations such as those proposed in the Bill had been applied rigidly.</P>
    <P>People living outside towns wishing to apply for small extensions, simple developments, will be faced with these regulations as well as those incorporated in the Planning Acts and various other laws. Such people are being discriminated against because they do not have available to them the professional expertise, the consultants and the high-powered advice available to general developers. Therefore it often happens that such individual applications are not processed as quickly as those of big developers.  Such people are inclined to throw their hands up in horror and forget the whole thing. <Col N="713" /> That is the way legislation of this kind affects ordinary people.  When we are passing such legislation I often wonder do we realise how such laws will be interpreted by individuals and local authorities. We should take careful cognisance of that in relation to this Bill which may put individuals at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I repeat that we should ensure that any work being carried out by builders, whether extensions or improvements to dwelling houses, particularly affecting elderly or socially deprived persons, will be carried out with care and in accordance with regulations so that such people may be protected.  I can think of cases where people might employ builders who are inclined to cut corners, and who might propose to incorporate in the building either substandard timber or concrete.  The unfortunate individual in that case is the victim of sharp practices. As matters stand I see very little we can do to protect individuals and ensure that such fly-by-night developers are kept, as far as possible, out of operations.  I am not certain if anything further will follow in the wake of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated for bringing the legislation before the House. I hope it will not clog up the system with extra red tape and will not involve local authorities or other agencies in a monitoring system which will place an extra financial burden on them at a time when they are finding it difficult to get along. I hope the legislation will have the effect of improving the general standard of construction, whether it is private or local authority house construction.  I hope it will mean that the interests of the individual who buys or rents such houses will be kept to the fore.</P>
    <P>This debate brings to mind a local authority housing development that took place in a certain county some years ago. The scheme was carried out by a private developer and it was discovered later that in a terrace of houses it was possible for a person to walk from one end of the block to the other through attics.  There was no fire break or other protection. That happened in the seventies and I am sure it occurred in the sixties also.  I hope <Col N="714" /> that in the eighties this legislation will deter such cost and corner cutting by developers.</P>
    <P>In my contribution I have been anxious to emphasise the importance of the legislation from the point of view of local authority development because I receive more complaints from tenants of local authority houses in regard to problems that have arisen in their homes than from other constituents.  Those problems arose because there was no proper supervisory body when the houses were being built. I may be criticised for making that statement but the fact is that while the structure exists to provide supervisory personnel, supervision does not take place. Private developers always say that when they have to carry out work for a local authority or a central Government agency they have to comply with extraordinary conditions and must go to great lengths to comply with the regulations that are laid down.  It is amazing that there are many discrepancies in the operation of the inspection system for houses erected by builders who have a history of working for local authorities.</P>
    <P>If we do not come to grips with the fact that previous legislation was not being rigidly enforced and that provisions in the Bill under discussion could die a similar death unless a tougher attitude is adopted by those supervising on behalf of the planning authority, we will not solve the problem.  I hope the Bill achieves its objective, to protect the interests of the general public and seek to eliminate from the arena the maverick type builder who has given the industry a bad name and, at the same time, enhance and protect builders who go about their task in a conscientious fashion. Such builders have always endeavoured to meet the requirements laid down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entering the debate with two minutes to go before its adjournment and I faced a similar predicament when I rose to speak on the budget.  I am glad the Bill has been introduced because we have been hearing about the need for building regulations for many years.  With <Col N="715" /> the advent of modern building equipment, the use of plastic and reinforced materials and the need to examine the cost efficiency of projects, there has been a need for such regulations.  I am glad the Bill contains enabling regulations to deal with the needs of disabled people.  The additional regulatory controls being introduced into building should be viewed from a cost point of view.  Building construction here can be broken down into three main categories, commercial and institutional construction, civil engineering and water supply schemes and houses provided for sale by private companies and built on contract for local authorities.  It is important from a private house building point of view to get accurate statistics and to look at the effect of any additional controls being brought in.  Figures from the Department of the Environment show that 26,000 houses were constructed in the last 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC proposal to impose a super-levy on milk is probably potentially the most dangerous proposal for agriculture in the history of this State. The Government's handling of this situation has been appallingly inept, extremely nervous, totally lacking in confidence, haphazard and a total shambles. The problem is that the super-levy was not taken seriously enough by the Taoiseach and the Government from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When my colleagues, Deputy MacSharry and Deputy Lenihan, were Ministers for Agriculture, they fought this issue and ensured that it was withdrawn. It was because of the conviction and negotiating skills of those two men that the problem of the super-levy did not arise in their time.  This time last year the super-levy began to raise its head.  That was the time for the Government and the Minister for Agriculture to act.  That was the time for the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture to go out shooting with all guns to the heads of state and say that this super-levy was not on for Ireland because the country could not afford it.  Alas, it was left until as late as last November for the Taoiseach and the Government to act. There is no doubt that the Taoiseach moved too late.  The balloon had already taken flight and there was nobody in the Government capable of bursting it.  They should have acted this time last year and said to their fellow heads of state that <Col N="717" /> Ireland has a genuine case.  However, this Government, through ineptitude, failed to point out this fact.  Our EEC partners are not convinced that we are a special case.  They must be made aware that all the farming organisations, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the people are opposed to this super-levy.  This is a national question jeopardising not alone the agricultural industry but the economy.  All are unanimous in their total rejection of this proposal.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that Ireland has been one of the most under-developed dairy sectors in the Community and is the country most dependent on the milk sector. Over 53 per cent of Irish farm families are dependent on milk production.  The EEC average farm holding with dairy cows is 35 per cent.  Over 85 per cent of Irish dairy farmers have fewer than 30 cows compared with 46 per cent in the Netherlands and 35 per cent in the United Kingdom.  A most important statistic to remember is that 80 per cent of all beef produced in Ireland comes from the dairy herd.  These facts point out that because of the structure of the Irish dairy industry, it is the small dairy farmer who will be hit most and who will find it very difficult to survive under this super-levy. Employment in the agricultural industry will be affected in a disastrous way.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that if the super-levy were introduced it would put 14 per cent to 15 per cent of our milk producers out of business with serious consequences for employment.  In 1960 there were 390,000 full-time farmers in Ireland; in 1970 there were 283,000; in 1980 there were 220,000. The figures for 1983 have not yet been released but Deputies can be assured that they will be considerably below the 1980 figures.</P>
    <P>In Ireland 18.9 per cent of the entire workforce are employed on the land; the Community average is 8.2 per cent.  In Ireland 26 per cent of those employed in agriculture are under 25 years of age. There are 11,000 people employed in the dairy processing industry while 6,000 people are employed in the beef processing industry.  There are thousands of Irish men and women employed in the food <Col N="718" /> processing industry and agriculturerelated business.  In a nutshell, up to 45 per cent of our entire workforce are employed either directly or indirectly in agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that our dairy farmers face very unfair competition. The importation of feedstuffs into the EEC creates difficulties for our farmers. No less than 10 million tonnes are unnecessarily imported into the Community. These are used as dairy feed and this in turn is responsible for producing an extra 20 million tonnes of milk.  Our dairy farmer has to compete with EEC farmers because our feedstuffs are much more expensive than the cheap goods imported into the Community.</P>
    <P>When we talk about imports we must take into account the New Zealand situation in relation to Britain.  Britain got concessions from her European partners to import products under special arrangements from New Zealand and other former colonies.  The New Zealand share of the British butter market has risen from 25 per cent in 1974 to 34 per cent in 1983. Who is affected most by this?  The Irish dairy farmer who traditionally had Britain as his biggest market.  Now, because of the importation of New Zealand butter our market is being affected, as is the livelihood of our dairy farmers, their families and employees.</P>
    <P>We had a very strong case to present to Europe but this Government failed to present it.  They are trying to close the door when the horse has bolted.  Negotiations are going on this week but we still have not convinced our partners in Europe that we should be treated as a special case.  Our dairy farmers are not as sophisticated as the average EEC dairy farmer.  This Government should, and will, stand indicted by the electorate when the opportunity presents itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been struck by a feature of this debate in that much of what has been said simply restates the case the Government have been making for many months in the context of these negotiations. Opposition speakers have spoken about the importance of the dairy sector to our <Col N="719" /> economy, about its contribution to GNP, about our difficulties in the past and about comparisions between ourselves and other EEC countries.  All of these points have been brought into play and pressed; all of them have in one way or another been brought home to our partners in the Community.  Members of the Opposition need have no doubt that all these features of our situation and more have been properly brought home to our partners.</P>
      <P>We are involved in a very difficult negotiation.  It covers a number of things outside the dairy sector but I have not had a great deal of evidence to show that Members of the Opposition are in any way conscious of that or of the wider issues.  We have had to undertake this difficult negotiation against a background where there had already been acceptance at Community level of the idea of production thresholds, the idea of a limitation on the amount of milk that could be produced in the Community.</P>
      <P>I should like to give some of the history because it is very instructive and puts the present negotiations in context.  It has been largely ignored by Members opposite. In 1980 in the farm price agreement the Council agreed that if milk deliveries increased by more than 1.5 per cent an additional levy would be imposed.  That provision is enshrined in Regulation No. 1364 of 5 June 1980.  Article 2, paragraph 3, of that regulation makes the point and states:</P>
      <P>If, by comparing the quantity sold during the 1980 calendar year with that sold during the 1979 calendar year, it is established that the quantity of milk sold by Community producers in the form of milk and certain milk products has increased by 1.5 per cent or more, an additional levy shall be fixed for the 1981-82 milk year in accordance with rules to be determined, so as to cover the costs incurred by the Community for the disposal of the additional quantities of the milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was on 5 June 1980 when it was first established as Community policy that there would be limitations on overall production of milk in the Community.  That <Col N="720" /> was agreed to as part of the final price package of 1980.</P>
    <P>Matters went on from there and in 1981 the Council, dealing with the overall difficulty in the milk sector, agreed that if extra costs arose due to an increase in deliveries of more than 1 per cent measures would be taken to offset those costs, for example, by way of a super-levy, by price reductions, by a progressive levy or by a partial suspension of intervention. That was expressed in a regulation of 18 May 1982 which formally established production thresholds and set 1981 production plus 0.5 per cent as being the first year of the operation of the thresholds. The Commission also indicated that year that further production would be penalised by decreased prices.  That was the regulation published on 18 May 1982 following a rather interesting price negotiation. It had a couple of features which were rather new and it was the first price agreement arrived at by means of a majority vote in the Council.  The regulation contains the following provision:</P>
    <P>Each year, when the prices referred to in Article 5 (1) are fixed, the Council shall, under the same procedure, fix a guarantee threshold for milk.</P>
    <P>That is very explicit.  It means that in 1982 the principle was accepted, enshrined and further elaborated that there was to be a limit on Community milk production. In a more detailed regulation of the same date, 18 May 1982, we have the specification of what that meant for the calendar year 1982.  Article 2 of Regulation No. 1184-82 states:</P>
    <P>In calendar year 1982, the guarantee threshold referred to in Article 5b of Regulation (EEC) No. 804-68 shall be fixed at the level of the quantity of milk supplied to undertakings treating or processing milk in the calendar year 1981, increased by 0.5%.</P>
    <P>That was a fairly formal and unambiguous acceptance and adoption of the limit to the overall production of milk in the Community.</P>
    <P>Those are parts of history, the background to the present negotiation.  It seems to be flying in the face of history <Col N="721" /> and of what was done by some of the gentlemen opposite in previous years to come here and try to pretend during this debate that this history does not exist, that we should ignore those kinds of factors and expect that decisions will be made that will not take account of the fact that we have already had in operation in the Community a system of production thresholds in the dairy sector.</P>
    <P>I did not hear during the debate any repetition of the claims made during the past couple of years that the super-levy had been killed.  I remember hearing that the super-levy had been killed once and for all in 1980.  I remember hearing the same thing in 1981 and I remember hearing in 1982 that the same well dead beast has once again been killed once and for all.  To conduct a debate ignoring all that history seems to be not particularly helpful, more than a bit naive and not the kind of thing in which Members should engage.  We are supposed to deal with realities and those are the realities behind the situation which we are in today.</P>
    <P>It is useful to reflect on what exactly we are playing for.  We are involved in an negotiation in a Community having increasing difficulties in disposing of the amount of milk produced.  Not to put a tooth in it, what we are playing for in this negotiation is room for ourselves to increase our production against a background and in a market where the total amount of production that will be guaranteed and paid for by the Community is actually declining.  We are negotiating in order to arrive at a point where we can continue to increase our production and the other parties to that negotiation are accepting that their production must decline, and it must necessarily decline.</P>
    <P>To give an example of the kind of declines being talked about on the basis of the proposals as they now exist, taking only four examples, we have Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom all facing reductions in their volumes of production guaranteed under Community rules of 7 per cent to 8 per cent immediately.  We will do ourselves a great service and we will have gained something very substantial if we <Col N="722" /> have and continue to have headroom for expansion against that background.</P>
    <P>What would be the alternative to all of this?  I have not heard a great deal from the Opposition about the alternative, not just to the proposals which are being made now, but to a system which has been there and accepted as part of previous price packages since 1980 by the gentlemen opposite when they were in Government.  The alternative is the probability of a straight cut in prices right across the board of somewhere in the region of 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>The alternative to the kind of protests which have been building up in the Community since 1980 is a straight-forward reduction in prices of somewhere in the region of 10 per cent.  In my view that would be far more damaging to our country and to our farmers than any of the schemes which have been talked about since.</P>
      <P>There is a much wider dimension to the problem we are talking about.  Before I go on to that, I want to refer to some of the cases mentioned here last night during the course of the debate.  Last night Deputy Wilson talked about a particular farmer who has been developing his farm over a period of years and expanding his output.  We all want to see a continuation of that.  We all want to see people making progress to the limit of what is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite confident that we will get to our objective, but the situation we are facing is one that allows flexibility for the kind of producer Deputy Wilson talked about here last night.  In very broad <Col N="724" /> terms, in our dairy sector one-third of our producers are expanding, one-third are staying static and one-third are declining.  When we add on to that the kind of headroom for which we are negotiating, we see that within the system there is quite a deal of leeway for those who want to expand and who can expand to continue to expand, particularly if we engineer the overall quantities at creamery level rather than at farm level.  That is a factor to which Deputy Wilson did not refer last night because it did not suit the kind of case he wanted to make.  It is a factor which is real and offers a margin of leeway to the kind of producer he was talking about.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the wider aspects of the negotiation which is going on.  We spent quite a deal of time in the latter part of last year following a particular formula for these discussions which, in retrospect, does not seem to have worked all that well.  We followed this formula of having special Council meetings where Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Agriculture and Finance of all the member states got together and thrashed out all the issues.</P>
    <P>The first point we were determined to establish during those discussions was the fact that there is a link between all of the different aspects of the overall problems which are now on the table.  There are four main problems facing us at the moment.  We have the agricultural problem which is wider than the dairy sector. Our main concern is with the dairy sector. There is the problem which has come to be described as the problem of budgetary imbalances or the UK problem.  There is a problem of overall budgetary discipline in the Community.</P>
    <P>Lastly, and in my view one of the most important of the four, there is the whole problem of the level of resources available to the Community to finance the agricultural policy, the regional policy, the social policy and all the other areas. We would like to see the Community in a position to make a greater contribution to the basic aim of redistributing economic activity throughout the member states and favouring the less well off.</P>
    <P>We have been very careful to keep on <Col N="725" /> making the point that these four problems are interlinked and that there can be no question of agreement on any one part of the overall package without the overall package itself being acceptable. That is an important point which tends to get lost in a concentrated discussion of the kind we are having here on a particular part of the problem.</P>
    <P>In my view it would make no sense at all for us to pursue single-mindedly any one aspect of the problem, whether it was the dairy sector or the budgetary imbalance or any one of them.  We need overall agreement on the level of total resources to be made available to the Community.  In this country and right through the Community we have seen the effects of the fact that the Community have about reached the limit of the resources available to them.  Of course that is an area in which probably we would be a great deal more sensitive than some other member states because we see, perhaps more clearly than do they, the extra contribution that a financially stronger Community can make to the development of a country like ours.  We need agreement on that.  We have the trade-offs that we ourselves make between different pieces of the package. Of course, in a negotiation, the other partners have trade-offs they make between the different pieces of the package. I am sure it will not take any great stretch of the imagination for Deputies opposite to see that there are some other member states, for example, who would say that they will not agree to an increase in the total level of the Community's resources without getting what they would regard as a satisfactory solution on the agricultural side, to give just one example of the kinds of trade-off they make.</P>
    <P>We have a general reserve on all of these points because we do not accept that different pieces of this overall problem should be split up and settled one by one.  We have been quite deliberate in our assertion that the four must go together, that no one can be finally accepted as being solved until we have a satisfactory solution to all of them.  In this <Col N="726" /> kind of negotiation that is by far the best way for us to ensure that we protect our overall interests.  That is the way we can best ensure that we protect our agricultural interests.  It is also the way in which we can best ensure that we protect the interests we have in further developing the Community's regional policy, in ensuring that the Community's social policy continues to support the kinds of activities from which we draw substantial amounts of money through the Social Fund and from which we want to continue to draw substantial amounts.</P>
    <P>It would do a great deal for the clarity of a debate of this kind if members of the Opposition would really sit back a little and not spend quite so much time restating the case we have been making for months in relation to agriculture but rather look at the wider problem in perspective. For example, what will happen in the Community if we do not reach agreement that the total amount of resources available to the Community should be increased?  Equally what will happen if we do not get agreement to raise the VAT ceiling?  We could have any agreement we like on agriculture, on the dairying sector, on the Social Fund, on the Regional Fund, but after a while we would discover it was not worth the paper on which it was written because we would not have the funds to support the policy on which we had agreed whether that was agriculture, the Regional Fund or anything else.  I can assure the House that I would have no interest whatsoever in having a good paper agreement on agriculture, or any one of those other areas if I was not sure that that was backed up by the level of funding required at Community level.  I have no desire whatsoever, for example, to have the kinds of regional policy prescriptions that I believe the Community should have unless I could also be sure that the money would be there to fund that policy at a level that would really make some impact on the Community, particularly at a level that would have a considerable impact on us.</P>
    <P>This year we have already seen the difficulties that have arisen in the agricultural sector as a result of the fact that <Col N="727" /> the Community is near its financial ceiling. There is no doubt that has created problems.  Equally there is no doubt that if we do not reach an agreement that allows us continue to fund the Community properly those difficulties will become more and more pressing, more and more inconvenient for us as time goes on.  It seems to me that that perspective has been totally missed by the Opposition in this debate.</P>
    <P>The other parts of the problem perhaps are ones we do not really need to discuss here in such great detail although, as I said, it is a pity the Opposition have not shown somewhat more sensitivity to them.  I do not believe it would do any of us in this House any good to conduct our negotiations on these various points in public.  We are in the process of a very difficult negotiation, at a very difficult stage at present.  Certainly I do not intend to add to the difficulties facing the Taoiseach, Minister for Agriculture or Minister for Foreign Affairs by venturing into details of what is on the table at present in a debate of this kind.  But it is fairly clear from what I have said, and indeed from what the Minister for Agriculture said last evening, that throughout this discussion with our Community partners we have been very concerned, to ensure that our position was recognised, understood and appreciated by our partners in the European Community.</P>
    <P>It is not at all an exaggeration to say that our partners in the Community know how important we believe our case in the dairying sector is to us.  Equally there is no doubt that, throughout the process of negotiations, they have come to realise more and more what are the sticking points.  They have come to realise more and more the reasons lying behind the negotiating stance we have adopted. They have come to appreciate &mdash; and it did not take them long to do so in the way the negotiations were conducted &mdash; that we are quite serious in our intent. They have also &mdash; and this is particularly important &mdash; fully realised the fact that we are quite serious in our intent to be involved in these negotiations in a way that will ensure the future well-being of the Community finances, and they know <Col N="728" /> why.  They are perfectly convinced of the fact that, while we are arguing from a position of an extremely strong, fundamental national interest on agricultural policy, on regional policy particularly, we are at the same time arguing from a position in which we take account of the fact that it is good for the Community as a whole to be able to resolve these problems and fund itself at a level we think appropriate.</P>
    <P>In the last ten days our partners in the Community have come to recognise the fact that we have been making a case based on one of the fundamental principles of the Community, that is that all of the member states have to show a degree of solidarity amongst themselves and towards one another that properly reflects the spirit and letter of the Treaty of Rome.  They have come to that realisation particularly in the last ten days as a result of the action the Taoiseach took, just what position he had to take and what were the motives that led our Taoiseach, on that occasion, to leave a meeting in the way he felt obliged to do.  In no small measure that has been a factor which has kept the other member states in a position in which they could continue to negotiate with us because they realised that one cannot run a Community on the basis that one ignores the interests of any one of its member states.  That is something every member state must recognise in the course of a discussion like this.  We have recognised that throughout.</P>
    <P>In putting forward our case it has been part of our concern to make sure that we did so in a way that afforded other member states maximum reasons for accepting the case we put forward.  We have been very careful to argue our case not simply on the basis of the effects that different measures proposed would have on us, on the dairying sector and other parts of our economy, but also on the basis of the effects they would have on the overall Community.  I am disappointed that the Opposition did not see fit to put this debate in anything like its proper context.  I am surprised that they have overlooked the one central point in relation to the dairy industry which is that this negotiation has come about partly as <Col N="729" /> a result of the acceptance from 1980 onwards that there would be limitations on the overall level of milk production at Community level.  Deputy Byrne may not have understood it at the time but that is what happened.</P>

      <P>We are all agreed that this is a matter of vital national interest.  A blunt instrument is being used to settle the agricultural problems in the EEC.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Finance misread the intention behind our motion.  It was put down to stiffen the resolve of the Government and support them in their stand against the agricultural industry being done down.</P>
      <P>The reality is that the dairy industry contributes 9 per cent to the gross national product and is responsible for 10 per cent of the total workforce here and for 10 per cent of our exports.  It is an industry with the greatest permanency as far as economic and social development is concerned.  It has the same importance for us as North Sea oil has for the UK or the car and steel industry has for Germany or perhaps as the milk industry has for other jurisdictions.  We want the Minister and his negotiating team to protect this industry for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Historically our industry could not develop at the same rate as other industries in other jurisdictions.  We had a small home market and one major export market where there were low prices and this militated against our development over the years.  Other states had unrestricted growth available to them.  They <Col N="730" /> had huge markets and price supports.  In order to benefit from their growth we joined the EEC some years ago.  We knew full well that traditional industry would suffer &mdash; and it has &mdash; because of the dismantling of trade barriers.  However, we expected the loss in revenue to the Exchequer to be made up by agricultural gains.  That is the basic reason why we joined the Community.  We needed time and it was accepted by the negotiators that we would be given time to catch up and make up the leeway.  It would not be equitable in EEC terms if a super-levy was applied to us at this stage.  We produce 5 per cent of the Community's milk. To ask for a curtailment before we reached the average Community level would condemn us to making a <i>pro rata</i> saving to the Community of up to 10 per cent.  That is a disproportionate burden on one member state and is contrary to the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>We charge the Government with political miscalculation as far as their negotiating strategy is concerned.  It goes back to the Stuttgart meeting.  That is when the marker should have been put down as far as the agricultural industry is concerned. That was not done and in Paris and Athens there was a succession of missed opportunities.  In Brussels the traditional finalising procedures were turned upside down by the Minister for Agriculture as a result of his manoeuvre the previous week.  It is patent nonsense for the Minister to come in and try to smother Government incompetence by attempting to include Fianna Fáil in the negotiating debacle he was responsible for two weeks ago.  On two separate occasions in the last few years Fianna Fáil threw out the concept of a super-levy and that is why it was not re-entered until such time as the Coalition came to office. These wounds were self-inflicted by Fine Gael and they have to carry the can for them.  The Minister misread the situation and he has been aided and abetted in that by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>We support the Government's stand to achieve a total exemption and derogation as far as the Irish industry is concerned. When the Minister for Agriculture accepted the principle of the super-levy <Col N="731" /> two weeks ago, it was a complete negotiating blunder.  There should not have been any movement at the meeting of the Council of Ministers for Agriculture and that would have kept the problem at the proper level.  It would have forced the leaders to deal with it as a first priority and not, as it ended up, as an irritant. The Taoiseach was out-manoeuvred and abandoned ship at the summit.  He forced his unfortunate and unhappy Minister for Agriculture back to use the veto on something he had agreed to in principle.  This was a total loss of credibility as far as the Government's stand was concerned.  It led to a hardening of the attitudes of Ministers for Agriculture throughout the EEC.  Worse than that, farmers are now out on the streets of Europe.  The Minister should have used the veto at the Council of Ministers for Agriculture and not one week later when the horse had bolted.</P>
    <P>The agricultural industry is under-developed throughout Ireland but it is much more so in the west.  The same case can be made for the west of Ireland within Ireland as can be made for Ireland against the EEC.  The same gap exists between the yield in the west of Ireland and the rest of Ireland.  There is a 200-gallon gap per cow between the cow in the west and the cow in the rest of Ireland.  There is a gap of 200 gallons between the Irish national average and the European one. There is no alternative to the production of milk in the west.  The land there is only suitable for growing grass and that means they can only produce milk or beef. There is no way a small farmer in the west can make a viable income from dry cattle.  He needs the support of the dairy industry.  It was up to 10 per cent in one area catered for by the NCF in Sligo and Mayo.  When we consider that 40 per cent of suppliers to the NCF creamery are under 3,000 gallons per head and that the average is about 1,200 gallons, it must be realised that in European terms many farmers could get that from one cow. Only 2 per cent of the farmers in that catchment area have an output of more than 2,500 gallons.  The west needs time to catch up with the rest of Ireland let alone with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> We must get up to the average output in Irish terms before we can consider dealing with the European position.  The farmers in the 12 western disadvantaged counties are very angry at these developments. They have kept quiet for the past few months so that a national case would stay united.  Whatever percentage is achieved for this country in the final negotiations when they come about, the west will have to be given total exemption from the levy anyway.  The farmers in the west feel hoodwinked by the Minister and the Government so far and the Minister's speech of last night really must have made the European case for imposing a super-levy.  It is just set the platform for the eventual sell-out that will take place in the next couple of weeks.  The same Minister at his last Ard-Fheis told the farmers that there would be a total derogation and that nothing less would satisfy him or the Government.  There was ministerial posturing on this matter for the last number of months with conflicting evidence about growth and potential of agriculture being flouted about here and there, and it has done nothing except sow seeds of confusion in the minds of the farming community.  Not so long ago in Sligo town the Minister made it clear to the farming interests in the west that he would not let the super-levy issue be settled without special treatment for the west one way or the other.  He will be asked to honour that.</P>
    <P>The only safe ground for the Minister to take, the only ground he should have taken at this stage, was a total exemption in so far as the Irish industry is concerned. If he does not take that position he is setting himself up for a milk war in Ireland after the final deal has been struck when he talks about allocations and quotas and how they will be devised and divided amongst the farming areas in this country.  He is walking himself into a situation on the Irish scene that he will not be able to control subsequent to the final negotiations unless he stays in and asks for a total exemption for Irish industry. The unfortunate part about these negotiations is that what is to be decided now will last for our lifetime.  Are we, particularly in the west, to accept that we will not be allowed to develop even to <Col N="733" /> reach the national average in our own country?  We do not accept that and we are bringing to the notice of the Minister that he is on promise to see to it that the Irish agricultural industry will be protected, in particular as far as western farmers are concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to two paragraphs in his speech last evening because they sum up the whole debacle as it has turned out.  In his opening paragraph he said that what he had been looking for from the very start was an exemption for Ireland until we reached a level of development similar to that in other member states.  Later on he talked about the performance between 1972 and 1983 and said that an increase of 5 per cent could be expected during that period and if we were to get 5 per cent for a few years now we would have reached what he was setting out to do as stated in the first paragraph of his speech. That is not true.  Even if you give 5 per cent increase for the next four years to Irish farmers it will not, even at the end of that period with that increased development, bring us to the average that now exists in the European sense.  We have an underdeveloped economy.  We depend for our economic goodwill and growth on export growth, and agricultural exports are vital to our economic survival.  Our economy is virtually totally dependent on the dairying industry.  That is the one safe area of growth.  Irrespective of the winds of recession, international or otherwise, you can surely depend on the grass growing green and cattle being reared on that grass.  It is the only sure thing that the Irish economy has been based on over a lifetime, and attempts are being made to withdraw it from us now.  You cannot freeze development in the way suggested by the Minister.  It would be contrary to the Treaty of Rome and the basic principles as set down for free trading and regional convergence.  That is the reason we joined the EEC and for that reason now we demand that the Minister stand firm by the tenets and principles of the original negotiators in joining up the EEC.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil support was always with the Minister and never deserted him in <Col N="734" /> this matter.  Our spokesman, Deputy Noonan, stated unequivocally and unambiguously every single week since these negotiations started that the Minister could rely on a unified House here and a unified national effort to bring to the notice of the powers that be out there that he was not going to take second best or be treated as a second-class citizen in agricultural terms.  He sold the pass on us, and that is what makes us angry here as are the farmers outside.  He had a unified Government.  He had a unified Dáil Éireann in support of this one great national issue.  It must have made him feel very secure when sitting down with the Ministers for Agriculture two weeks ago.  He should have used that muscle. He should have used the veto then that he threatened to use so often.  He conceded the principle and subsequently he had to come back and lose his credibility and move the veto on directions from his boss.</P>
    <P>We live in disadvantaged areas and we might as well face the fact that this levy, if implemented, would have disastrous effects not just on the dairy industry but on the whole question of production in the agricultural sense, including food processing.  Nobody yet has quantified the number of people who will find themselves unemployed and the cutting back of living standards that will accrue if the Minister fails to achieve his stated aim of last year.  Where will the cows be sold? Does he want them forced out on to a market and a glut created?  Are we talking about heading for another 1974 which was supervised by another Coalition Government?  What is happening now is an exact replica of what happened in 1973.  We will have high prices for second-class animals and next year we will have a glut.  Nobody will be able to buy them, and we will return to the dismal days of 1975 and 1976 which epitomised Coalition efforts in agricultural matters during that term of office.</P>
    <P>The thrust of our motion was to stiffen the resolve of the Minister for Agriculture, to send him out there knowing full well that any steps he took he was taking on behalf of the nation with the full support <Col N="735" /> of all the major parties in this country. He had a bounden duty not to sell out his countrymen and to allow us to develop in order to reach the national European average, a national standard of living at the same level as that enjoyed by the thousands of farmers who are now seeking to impose their will on him.  He has our support.  I am asking him to use it in the best interest of Ireland.  The only way he can return from his next round of negotiations is with the information that he has held the line and succeeded in his negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity of speaking to this very important motion which is going to set a scene and affect the lives of many farmers and workers in the dairy industry.  We have 65,000 full-time dairy farmers who are anxiously waiting and watching for the outcome of the final negotiations in Brussels this weekend.  We must admit that we have surpluses but as perhaps the most undeveloped nation within the EEC we are entitled to a special concession. Our case for that concession has not been well sold by our Government or Ministers in convincing the Europeans of the seriousness of the Irish situation.  We can go back to the time of our foundation as a nation when Danish agriculture was as well developed then, in the twenties, as ours is today and in that sense we have one of the strongest cases within the EEC.</P>
      <P>I must look at the structure of the dairy industry from the processing point of view.  In County Cork alone approximately 5,500 people are employed in the co-operative movement on the processing side of the business.  Effectively another 3,000 people are employed on the service side.  A frightening thought is that many of those jobs will be put at risk because of the lack of sincerity in what we have been hearing in the last six or seven months, that we would be seeking total derogation.  That raised a certain amount of confidence in those employees as well as in the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must consider the huge investment <Col N="736" /> by Irish farmers in the last number of years in the co-operative movement throughout the length and breadth of the country.  We have approximately 20 per cent over-capacity and have geared our industry towards commodity products rather than consumer items.  This was what we were educated to do, because intervention was geared towards butter and skim milk, two bulk products.  In later years this was joined by casein for the American market, which again is a bulk commodity.  If we have now to get rid of it our over-capacity and go for consumer products it will cost a vast sum of money to build that up into the added-value area.  That money will come from nowhere but the industry itself. That alone will mean a substantially decreased price for the gallon of milk for Irish producers.  That is a frightening thought, when combined with the super-levy.  The 1983 base year is not realistic.  We should have an open-ended agreement until 1993.  It is quite unfair of our European counterparts to expect anything else from us.</P>
    <P>We must examine the reasons behind the over-supply of milk within the European Community.  It is mainly brought about by the huge importation of manioc &mdash; as much as 15 million tonnes from Thailand.  This must be tackled.  It has gone unchallenged by our European counterparts, to the advantage of the Dutch and the Germans.  That is the major over-supply area.  The Netherlands and Germany account for 70 per cent of the total imports of cereal substitutes. While Ireland, France, Italy and Denmark account for 55 per cent of total agricultural production, they only import 12 per cent of all cereal substitutes.  Twice the total forage acreage is imported from outside the Community to boost artificial milk yields.  That is mainly in the hands of the Dutch and the Germans.</P>
    <P>We have a mechanism under Article 28 of the GATT by which we can tackle a problem which has arisen since the founding of the Community in 1958, which is maize gluten, a by-product of maize becoming very popular within the Community and adding to the major over-supply as a substitute feed because <Col N="737" /> of its way around the mechanism of that Article.  We must also contend with citrus pulp and various other items which are substitutes and which must be tackled.  If we are to be successful, we must renegotiate our total position in the Community at large.</P>
    <P>The British are the main problem within the Common Market.  They have been cynically referring to the Common Agricultural Policy.  I quote from an economist of Lloyds Bank who said:</P>
    <P>If the Community would stop listening to what the British say in Brussels and start listening instead to what economic experts in the city of London are saying, we would hear things like this:</P>
    <P>1.  Britain's industrial exports to the EEC have risen by £19 billion since it joined the Community.  That's nearly three times the total cost to Britain of the Common Agricultural Policy during that whole period.</P>
    <P>2.  Britain's balance of trade with the EEC has steadily improved over the decade.  Its exports to the EEC have risen by 3.4 per cent a year.  But its imports from the EEC have risen by only 2.8 per cent a year.</P>
    <P>3.  The cost of the Common Agricultural Policy is not a significant factor in Britain's cost of living.</P>
    <P>Proof?  British food prices in real terms rose by only 3 per cent in the decade to 1981; farm prices account for only about a third of total food prices, and have risen much less than other elements in the food cost chain.</P>
    <P>That comment is worth noting.  Mrs. Thatcher is playing ducks and drakes, not alone with the Common Market but with our Government here at home.  When she sneezes, we get a cough.  At this stage the British Prime Minister has not even offered us the crumbs from the table.</P>
    <P>Greece is a peripheral country, being very remote, but we are as remote, in our own way disadvantaged and not fully developed.  The Greeks have received certain concessions in the area of transport subsidies for imports and exports. <Col N="738" /> They have renegotiated their position. I cannot understand why we worry so much.  We are one of the most influential nations because of our position in the East-West situation.</P>

      <P>We can use our bargaining power to the fullest.  We will get the concessions to which we are entitled. The farmers and the workers in our dairy societies and co-operative movement are worried.  I have received many phone calls and letters from people wishing to know what we and the party are doing on their behalf, what pressure we are putting on the Government and what we can do to secure the success of the negotiations. I commit myself fully to supporting the Minister in everything he has been doing. However, we must stand up and be counted.  We must be firm in our negotiations. We cannot be asking for total derogation in mid-1983 and then shifting from that policy, with a total shift during the Fine Gael Ard Fheis.  I raised this matter in the House here and was contradicted. We have been consistent in our approach to the entire negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Germans have been strongly opposed to us in recent days, but we must examine the situation in Bavaria &mdash; a section of Germany very much like our own country.  Their agricultural industry has expanded at an enormous rate.  The northern part of France with a climate similar to our own, has the finest dairy farms in Europe, all built and expanded at the expense of the Common Agricultural Policy and the high price of milk. Our colleagues in Northern Ireland have the advantage of the British grant system and have exceptionally high yields in cattle.  They have good grassland and well managed dairy farms all because of the concessions and advantages which they have.  I must admit that we are totally disadvantaged at every level of production, farm and industrial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a serious situation.  If we lose this battle, we will never recover.  The Minister must convince his colleagues in the Council of Ministers and the heads <Col N="739" /> of Governments.  Perhaps the time is right for the Taoiseach to travel to the European capitals to meet with his counterparts, explaining to them the very special position of this country, so disadvantaged and so poor, with so very few resources.  Our basic resources are the grassland and the dairy herds.  The dairy herds are the basis of our whole economy.  Another disadvantage is that we failed to introduce here the variable premium in connection with the dead meat trade of which 60 per cent is paid by FEOGA and 40 per cent by the United Kingdom Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry brought us one of the greatest concessions ever received by this country &mdash; the £22 calf subsidy.  We must have a hard look at our progress with regard to that subsidy, which is to the advantage of the smaller dairy farmer.  Seventy per cent of our farmers produce only 30 per cent of the milk.  The other 30 per cent produce 70 per cent. That is the harsh reality.</P>

      <P>Apart from a few bars across the floor, this has been a good and worthwhile debate.  I have listened very carefully here tonight and for part of the last evening and the speakers on both sides have indicated quite clearly to our EEC counterparts that this is a vital issue to us as a nation.  The case that has been made by the Opposition is exactly the same as that being made by the Minister for Agriculture and the Government.  We believe we are entitled to this derogation; we believe our contribution <Col N="740" /> to the European problem has been minimal and we argue that our contribution to the solution should be minimal.</P>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker that some of the countries who have caused the problem in Europe have done so through special arrangements that they were allowed to get away with, not just this year but over many years.  They were allowed special arrangements in regard to feed substitutes imported from third countries and from the US.</P>
      <P>This has been a good debate and the eyes of Europe are watching us.  Everything that has been said in the House probably will be over there in a matter of minutes instead of hours.  It is important in the interests of the nation &mdash; that is why we are here &mdash; and particularly of the towns and villages of Ireland that we have a satisfactory outcome.  The towns and villages are depending on an expanding dairying industry.  All related industries, fertilisers, transport and others, are equally depending on a thriving dairying industry that can be made better.  We here can produce milk from our endemic raw material, green grass, something that most of our EEC counterparts are not doing.  Our milk is produced from a natural resource which we can grow better than anybody else.  We should be allowed to continue to do so.  I agree with those who said that parts of this country are totally unsuited for anything else.  The size of most holdings determine that if they do not get an income from dairying they will not survive.  Therefore, even the lending institutions have more or less accepted that if we are to get ourselves out of our difficulties we must expand our dairying industry.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be here tonight to support the Government and the Minister for Agriculture.  I was glad to listen to speakers across the floor.  By and large they were constructive and helpful and that is as it should be on this vital issue. Those across the floor of the House who engaged in previous negotiations and understand the scene, know the difficulties facing the country.  The super-levy would be of no importance in solving the problems of the EEC, least of all to us who are net beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> The Minister is getting the support of the House.  It is important for him. Nobody will be able to push an Irish newspaper under his nose over there and say, &ldquo;Not everybody in the Irish Parliament supported you &mdash; some people believe you should be going down a different road&rdquo;.  That is not so and, for goodness sake, let us keep it that way. Let us stay together.  The farming organisations are behind the Minister fully. The people working in the industry are behind the Minister, as they would be behind any Minister or Government at this vital moment.  We are facing a crucial few days.</P>
    <P>In my last few moments I wish the Minister well.  Let us stay with him.  Let us support him and let us not resort to any sort of cheap knocking, anything that in any way might damage the case he is making.  He is making a good case, he is a tough fighter, a tough operator who will not take &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer.  I am sure that when this deal has been finalised everything will work out right for us.  Our total milk surplus is only a drop in the ocean compared with the total surplus across the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that on our entry to the EEC we were prepared to forego many indigenous industries, car assembly and many others, because we believed our future lay in developing agriculture.  We have and always will have disadvantaged areas, but do our partners in the EEC want to give us an opportunity to make ourselves a viable economy or do they want to make the entire country a disadvantaged area? That is the case we are making and it is a good one.  I wish the Minister well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what the last speaker has said, we will support the Minister and the Government provided they pursue the terms of the resolution before the House.  Unfortunately, the Minister's speech last night made a great case for the acceptance by us of the super-levy.  We listened to the Minister for Finance trying to make a similar case. He also set out to blame everybody else but himself and the Government, a sure <Col N="742" /> sign of failure by them.  The Minister and the Government must accept full responsibility for the present position.  They are the Government but they have failed to understand what is happening.  They have failed to convince our EEC partners of the vital importance of the super-levy issue for our farmers and the economy. They have completely mishandled the negotiations.  As far back as last June &mdash; I will refer to the Dáil Official Report for 22 June, after the Stuttgart meeting, the Taoiseach described the meeting and said he had doubts about previous heads of state meetings and their importance but, he said, &ldquo;this was one of considerable significance and the outcome was strikingly positive&rdquo;.  At column 2687 he is reported:</P>
      <P>The Minister and I, with gratifying support from colleagues, were successful in preventing damage to Irish interests in the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>At column 2700 he is reported as saying:</P>
      <P>The solemn declaration acknowledges that the problems of the less favoured agricultural regions merit special attention.</P>
      <P>The impression was created by those statements that Ireland would not be affected.  Afterwards, the Government sat back and what was the result?  The most objectionable proposals affecting Ireland were put forward by the Commission. Obviously, the Government had been fooled.  They panicked and the Minister for Agriculture, going to the next Council of Ministers meeting, stated, after the Commission proposals had been published, that he was nervous.  They did not know what to do.  The discussions continued during a period of months and the Taoiseach and his Ministers scurried around Europe seeking support for Ireland's case.  On 17 December, as reported in the Dáil Official Report at column 1420, we had the Taoiseach talking about the Athens Summit:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hoped my colleagues would understand why this remains unacceptable to us, though some seemed still to have <Col N="743" /> difficulties in understanding the reality of the impact on our economy.</P>
    <P>That in itself was an admission by the Taoiseach that he had failed to convince our partners.  The Minister for Agriculture spoke on the European negotiations during a debate here on 7 November.  He referred to the Greek Presidency proposals, and he is reported at column 2614 as follows:</P>
    <P>Because of the special role of the dairy sector on this economy as a whole, and developments which have taken place in recent years, Ireland will have a guaranteed threshold corresponding to the 1983 production.</P>
    <P>He thought he had a foothold.  He was fooled again because it now appears that what was meant was that there would be a super-levy in Ireland, but from 1983 thresholds.  The most important and significant statement made by any person regarding this question was made by the Minister for Agriculture.  Deputy Deasy, on 17 November, as reported at column 2618 of the Official Report.  He stated:</P>
    <P>It might not have been such a bad idea if a super-levy of some description had been brought in in Europe and Britain because we might not be faced with the dreadful dilemma we have in front of us today.</P>
    <P>How can a Minister who says it might not be a bad idea to have a super-levy conduct negotiations on our behalf against such a proposal?</P>
    <P>As the Minister implies, everybody is to blame except his Government and himself but it is no harm to remind the House, and the Minister, of the damage he and his Government have done to agriculture at home by their own actions. They abolished the plan left by a Fianna Fáil Government, they abolished the farm modernisation scheme, abolished a number of subsidies, suspended the farm retirement scheme and reduced expenditure on drainage.  Most of those schemes were supported by EEC resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>They have displayed complete disregard for our major industry, agriculture, and reduced the national Exchequer support for our main industry. How can the Government be serious about seeking assistance in Europe when they by their own actions have done so much damage to agriculture?  A few weeks ago the Minister agreed to the implementation of the super-levy with 1981 thresholds without any real protection for our farmers.  The Minister for Agriculture was quite happy to scurry away and, as he said, send the political question regarding Ireland to the heads of state.  I should like to tell the Minister that this was not only a political question, it was very much an agricultural and economic one for Ireland.  A major tactical error was made by the Minister for Agriculture. At that Agricultural Council meeting the impression was created &mdash; one cannot blame other agriculture Ministers for being under that impression &mdash; that we would accept a super-levy but with some unspecified modifications for Ireland.  Not only did the Minister agree to the implementation of a super-levy on that day but he also allowed many other important benefits to slip away from Irish agriculture, including the calf subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the Minister, and the Government, failed to present our case to the Commission or the other member states.  All along they have dithered.  On the motion before the House they were not sure on Monday what they should do. On that day they deleted all our wording about a complete derogation for Ireland and decided to ask the House to support the efforts made by the Government to secure a satisfactory result.  However, on Tuesday they had second thoughts and accepted our wording.  That is an indication of the grave confusion on behalf of the Government, or members of it, in relation to this important question.  In his speech the Minister displayed a further lack of knowledge and confusion about the issue.  That Minister, and the Minister for Finance tonight, made much play about a sentence in the speech delivered last night which stated that the concept of production controls from which the super-levy system derives was brought in <Col N="745" />&mdash; they forgot about the matter then and somebody in the Department put in in brackets 1980 &mdash; and was formalised in 1982.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister, the Government and the House, that it was not a concept that was being discussed in 1980 or 1981.  It was a firm Commission proposal for a super-levy and not any airy fairy idea, some abstract idea or mental expression but a firm proposal by the Commission supported by the other member states in 1980 and 1981.  If the Minister, and the Government, are not able to succeed where we did they should not try to turn the blame on somebody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the points made by the two Ministers and to the regulations read by the Minister for Finance.  In those conclusions in 1980 and 1981 the super-levy was a firm proposal and any other mention of levies was in relation to the co-responsibility levy which was in existence for some years before.  Obviously, even at this late stage neither the Minister for Agriculture nor the Minister for Finance can understand the difference between the co-responsibility levy and the super-levy as is proposed.  That is the type of confusion that has the country and our farmers in the state they are in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have consistently said that we cannot, and will not, accept a super-levy on milk production here until our farmers get an opportunity to reach the levels of production that obtain in other member states.  Why is the Minister for Agriculture, and the Government, not pursuing, even at this late stage, although it might not have been agreed up to now in negotiations &mdash; it was not agreed in my time <Col N="746" />&mdash; the question of the importation of New Zealand butter, imported cereals or tax on vegetable oils and fats?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not do much about those either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the Government will not do anything about New Zealand butter is because there is no way the British government will have it.  Therefore, the Government will not force them.  The reason the Government will not do anything about cheap imported cereals is because the British, Dutch and German governments say they will not have it.  The reason why the tax on vegetables, oils and fats will not be implemented is because the British, German and Dutch governments will not have it.  Why hit the weakest country in the Community in its most important sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We joined the Community as equal partners and we are entitled to fair play. The three items I have mentioned contribute far more than if we doubled our production of milk here in the next five years.  I am sure everybody will agree that the Government have not been consistent in their negotiations so far.  After Stuttgart they displayed confidence.  The Minister for Agriculture at a meeting of the Council of Ministers for Agriculture accepted the super-levy without any real protection for Ireland.  They rejected 10 per cent at Athens, accepted 5 per cent in Brussels and used the veto last week. How in the name of goodness can anybody in Europe know what the Irish position is when the Irish Government do not know?  I hope that after tonight, with the support of the House, that the Government, and our European Community partners, will be fully aware of what the Irish position is, a full derogation for Irish farmers.  With the view of the Irish Parliament unanimously behind them we expect that the Government will secure just that.  Nothing else will do.  The veto is a blunt and ultimate weapon for us.  Now that it has been used it should secure the maximum benefit which is full derogation.  Nothing else will do.  Relief on a one year basis is not enough.  If that <Col N="747" /> is all they succeed in getting we can be sure that the dairy industry will stagnate and create permanent damage for our farmers and our economy.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, the interests which have taken over, as a going concern, the plant in question also plan to undertake with State aid, an investment programme aimed at securing the present levels of employment there.  In accordance with the existing EEC rules governing the granting of aid to firms in the synthetic fibres sector, the European Commission has been notified of the intention to provide State aid for this investment programme.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I had a discussion in Brussels on 28 February 1984 with the member of the Commission directly responsible for competition policy.  I stressed the very strong regional and industrial factors underlying the proposed State aid for the plant.  I also emphasised the need for an early and favourable response by the Commission.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that our concerns will be taken fully into account by the Commission in its examination of the matter.</P>

      <P>As regards the other detail sought by the Deputy, I refer him to the annual accounts of the NBST which are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I will be presenting the 1982 accounts shortly.  The 1983 accounts will not be presented for some time.  The National Board for Science and Technology are a corporate body established by statute (the National Board for Science and Technology Act, 1977).  Sections 16 and 18 of that Act indicate that the board are empowered to expend the grants made available to them by the Minister in such a manner and subject to such conditions as they think fit in the performance of their official functions.</P>

However, any person who does not qualify for unemployment assistance and who indicates that he is in need of assistance would be advised to apply for supplementary welfare allowance.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 458 and 459 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland at present maintains diplomatic relations, either on a resident or non-resident basis, with 57 countries. Resident Embassies, normally headed by ambassadors, are maintained in 29 of these countries.  In the case of the remaining 28 countries with which Ireland maintains diplomatic relations, these relations are conducted by means of the concurrent accreditation of ambassadors from elsewhere to the countries concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition Ireland maintains permanent representations or missions to a number of international organisations. These are the United Nations at New York and at Geneva and the European Communities at Brussels.  Ireland also maintains through the embassy in Paris permanent delegations to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.  A non-resident permanent representative is accredited to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, Ireland, in connection with its bilateral aid programme, also maintains Development Co-operation Offices in Lesotho (classified as a consulate-general), Tanzania <Col N="625" /> and Zambia.  Consulates-general (in the charge of career officers) are maintained in New York, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco.</P>
    <P>A list of the countries with which Ireland at present has diplomatic relations is given at Annex I.</P>
    <P>The names of our ambassadors abroad and the numbers of staff in their missions are contained in pages 164-170 of the current issue of the State Directory.  The following changes have occurred since its publication and the information therein might be amended accordingly: Ambassador to Canada, Mr. S. Gaynor; Ambassador to People's Republic of China, Mr. D. Waldron; Ambassador to Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. J. Campbell; Ambassador to Great Britain, Mr. N. Dorr; Ambassador to Italy, Mr. E. Kennedy; Ambassador to Lebanon, Mr. J. Craig; Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mr. S. O hUiginn; Ambassador to Spain, Mr. G. O Clerigh; Ambassador to Sweden, Mr. G. O Broin.</P>
    <P>The State Directory also lists Irish honorary consuls abroad at pages 170-173.</P>
    <P>Costs in relation to maintaining our embassies abroad are given in the book of &ldquo;Revised Estimates for Public Services&rdquo; for the year 1984 in pages 182 to 185 in respect of expenditure from the Vote for Foreign Affairs and in pages 29 and 30 in respect of expenditure from the Vote for Public Works and Buildings. With regard to subhead B.1 (Travel and Incidental Expenses), subhead B.2 (Office Machinery and Other Office Supplies) and subhead C (Post Office Services) of the Vote for Foreign Affairs, a breakdown of the total cost of these subheads on a mission by mission basis is not readily available.  A breakdown of the expenditure on the Vote for Public Works and buildings together with information on the ownership of embassy accommodation and the cost of purchasing such accommodation over the years is not available to my Department and the Deputy may wish to seek this information from the Office of Public Works which is responsible for the administration of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> The primary functions of Irish diplomatic and consular representatives abroad include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the monitoring of all developments in their countries of accreditation of interest to the Government in the political, economic, cultural and other fields;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the presentation of Irish Government policy in all such matters to the foreign Governments concerned;</P>

      <P>The terms of the planning permission granted, on appeal, to Tara Mines Ltd., on 12 March 1974 stipulated, <i>inter alia</i>, that the development should be operated in such a manner that atmospheric pollution from smoke, dust, grit, noxious or offensive gases, or mineral particles should be kept at such levels as not to be injurious to public health, livestock, vegetation or to amenity.  I am not aware of public concern with regard to antimony dust in the Navan area and neither are Meath County Council. Moreover, I understand from the county council that there are no indications of contravention of the planning condition relation to air pollution.  Antimony is present only as a trace element in the ore body and for this reason antimony checks are carried out very rarely.  However, I understand that any changes would be detected indirectly by changes in zinc and lead levels which are monitored continuously. Figures for February 1984 indicate an antimony ambient air value of less than 0.001 microgrammes per cubic metre.  Monthly reports of air monitoring results are submitted by the mining company to the local authority in compliance with the planning permission and are checked by the county medical officer on behalf of the authority.</P>
      <P>There are no statutory limits for emissions of antimony in Ireland nor have any EEC standards been set.  The need for such limits will be considered in the context of the preparation of comprehensive new air pollution legislation on which preliminary work has been carried out in my Department.</P>

      <P>He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer also assessed his means at £64.10.  He has been notified of this decision.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance following the exhaustion of his title to unemployment benefit on 16 January 1984 when he completed 390 days.  Following investigation of his means he was paid at £15.95 per week being the maximum appropriate rate £29.40 less means of £13.45 derived from land.  Arrears due were posted to him on 14 March 1984.</P>

      <P>He did not satisfy the contribution condition of having 78 paid contributions in a three-year period prior to his date of claim and as the income from his holding exceeded £2 daily his unemployment benefit claim was disallowed.</P>
      <P>He appealed against this decision and he attended an oral appeal hearing on 21 March 1984 but the appeals officer disallowed his appeal.</P>
      <P>He was advised of his right to apply for unemployment assistance but he has not done so to date.</P>

      <P>The person concerned had up to August 1983 been in receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension, at a reduced rate based on her means, since the death of her husband in 1971.</P>
      <P>Following a reinvestigation of her circumstances by a social welfare officer in July 1983 her means derived from a farm were assessed as being in excess of the statutory limit for entitlement to pension of £40 per week for a widow under 66 years of age without any qualified children. She appealed against the decision to terminate pension but her appeal was disallowed by an appeals officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules for calculation of means provide that account must be taken of the yearly value of any advantage accruing to a person from the use or enjoyment of property, e.g. a farm.  In assessing the means of the person concerned account was taken of the value derived from the sale of cattle, headage grants, value of farm produce less expenditure incurred <Col N="640" /> in stocking and running the farm.  Means were assessed at £2,500 a year or slightly in excess of £48 a week.</P>

      <P>He has appealed against the assessment of his means.  His case has been returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying contribution conditions for receipt of dental benefit in the case of persons over 21 years of age is that not less than 26 contributions have been paid or credited in the governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed dental benefit on 22 February 1983.  According to the records of the Department, however, no contributions have been paid or credited in respect of him in the 1981-82 contribution year which governed the claim.  He was not, therefore, eligible for dental benefit under the social insurance scheme.  Neither is he entitled to benefit in 1984 because there is no record of paid or credited contributions in 1982-83.</P>
      <P>He may be entitled to assistance towards the cost of dental treatment under the Health Acts.  The Eastern Health Board have been asked to examine the position and arrange to have the necessary claim forms issued to him.</P>
      <P>Credited contributions had been entered in error on the record of the person concerned in respect of the years from 1971 to 1982-83 and he had been paid benefits in error on foot of these credits.  These credits were deleted some time back when it came to notice that they were invalid and the position was explained to him by an officer of the Department.  He is not entitled to have further contributions credited to him until such-time as a further 26 employment contributions have been paid on his behalf.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will consider the formulation of an interdepartmental committee with a view to transferring funds from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of the Environment, for works to be carried out by people who are at present unemployed and while losing their unemployment status would be <Col N="651" /> paid from the transferred fund since the difference in average social welfare benefits taking everything into account &mdash; medical services, low rent, child services, no income tax, PAYE or PRSI and the average wage earners income is very small and since there is an enormous amount of work to be carried out on our environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at present developing a range of proposals for providing work for the unemployed and, particularly, the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>I propose consulting with other relevant Government Departments in the matter at an early date.  Work on the environment would be considered in this context.  I should point out, however, that the form of employment referred to in the Deputy's question is significantly more expensive than the cost of unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be interested to note that the Government, on the recommendation of the Government Task Force on Employment, have decided to extend the enterprise allowance scheme to provide for the capitalisation of pay-related unemployment benefit where deemed necessary and subject to certain conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, in view of the serious unemployment crisis in the Clondalkin area of County Dublin, he will agree to the provision of an AnCO training centre in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the training needs of the Clondalkin area are already adequately catered for, and the provision of additional training centres for that area could not at this time be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The training needs of the Clondalkin area are catered for by the existing AnCO training centre at Tallaght which intends to train 1,612 persons in 1984 and also by the other centres located in the Dublin area.  In addition, the Tallaght training <Col N="652" /> centre operates mobile training units and community and travellers' workshops in the area.</P>
    <P>Additional training needs can be met by the provision of external training courses, that is, by using outside firms or consultants to provide specific courses on AnCO's behalf.</P>
    <P>The Community Youth Training Programme, which provides training and work experience for young unemployed persons, redundant apprentices and craftsmen, also operates in the area and will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal decided on 17 January 1984 that the person concerned was dismissed from his employment by reason of redundancy and was entitled to a redundancy lump sum.</P>
      <P>As efforts to secure payment of the lump sum from the employer concerned have not been successful, the employee can now apply for payment of the full amount from the redundancy fund.  My Department are writing to the person concerned advising him to make application for payment from the fund and enclosing the necessary forms and explanatory booklet.  Payment will be made without delay as soon as the necessary application is received.</P>
