      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In paragraph 1 (3) (c) where an employer is a company, would the Minister tell us how he interprets &ldquo;insolvent&rdquo; because a person can be insolvent in a number of ways &mdash; as dictated by the court, voluntary insolvency or, as has happened quite a lot recently, people who vanish and are not made insolvent by the court, have not been liquidated by the court or have not declared themselves insolvent.  I do not intend to go into the various sections of the Companies Act in relation to winding up, liquidations, voluntary insolvencies and so on but perhaps the Minister would say what is meant by paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I congratulate Deputy Ahern on his appointment to the Front Bench and to this post.  His qualifications and skill as an accountant will be of particular benefit to the House when taking the Committee Stage of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that there are various ways in which insolvency can emerge within a firm from the legal point of view under the companies legislation. We were trying to use the broadcast possible definition to ensure that no company and, consequently, no worker, will be able to escape from the consequences of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The note I have on our understanding and interpretation of paragraph (c) is as follows:</P>
      <P>Where the employer is a company and the company is being wound up, or a receiver has been appointed, or possession is taken of any property of the company by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures secured by any floating charge....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extract from the report of the review committee on insolvency law and practice in the United Kingdom, the Cork report, setting out some background information in relation to floating charges is contained <Col N="271" /> in my note.  I can give this information if the House wishes.  Basically we are taking the broadest possible definition of insolvency we know of, such as liquidation or receivership and others where the bank move in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this legislation take account of the fairly major changes that are already in draft in regard to the Companies Act?  The 1963 Companies Act, a 200 page document covers many points which have been proved in the courts to be very marginal, whether they cover insolvency cases, liquidations and so on.  Has this new legislation taken account of these points?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have co-ordinated the definition of insolvency with the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to coincide with the existing definition of insolvency.  They will mesh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 (3) (c) states:</P>
      <P>(c)  where the employer is a company, a winding up order is made or a resolution for voluntary winding up is passed with respect to it, or a receiver or manager of its undertaking is duly appointed, or possession is taken, by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures secured by any floating charge, of any property of the company comprised in or subject to the charge, or</P>
      <P>That seems to be in line with section 285 of the Companies Act.  I take the Minister's point that he has had consultation with the Department but where in that section of the Act does it take account of companies which are fly-by-night operators?  The Companies Act adequately covers people who are put into liquidation by the courts or who voluntarily wind up but it was never intended to cover companies which closed down one day and opened up two months later under a different name.  I should like to see something written into the Bill which would take account of that.</P>

      <P>There is no reference to the implementation of directive 80/987/EC.  The Bill, welcome though it is, is limited.  It is to have retrospective effect to 22 October 1983.  The directive is dated 20 October 1980.  There is nothing under section 1 (2) to confirm that it gives effect to the minimum terms of the directive.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked if it was proposed to go through the Bill section by section.  It is so proposed. It is essential that we do so on Committee Stage.  We must deal with each section but only matters relevant to the section under consideration may be raised when that section is being considered. We are now dealing with the definition section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware of the problem Deputy Ahern referred to.  The revised legislation will cover it.  We have attempted to cover it under (d) where under the regulations to be made under section 4 (2) of the Act we will be able to describe such fly-by-night operators. That is how we intend to handle it.  We can take it up on section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We can come to it then. The Minister will accept that there will be far more problems in that category than in companies which are insolvent or in voluntary liquidation.  Most of the big firms are in liquidation, even big ones like Verolme but they are covered by statutory registration.  Employees of firms which are fly-by-night operators must be protected.  They use the legislation to close down and then reopen under a different trading name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of an employee means a person who has entered into or works under or, in the case of a contract which has been terminated, worked under a contract with an employer.  What allowance is made for family arrangements? <Col N="273" /> There can be disputes within families. How is it intended to provide some control where there is a dispute within a family?  In the Hours of Work Bill there is a different definition.  Disputes between families are left out of the Act.  Does the same apply here or does the definition of employee cover family member?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be covering relatives in the definition of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the broad sense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the definition of employee it states:</P>
      <P>... a contract with an employer, whether the contract is for manual labour, clerical work or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about those qualifications because there is a legal principle under which the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; are interpreted to mean other situations of a similar category to the two definitions which went before, namely manual labour and clerical work.  I do not see that it is necessary once the contract of employment is there.  It might have the effect of limiting or excluding certain categories of employers.  There could be many categories intended to be covered by the Bill which would not come within the definition of manual labour or clerical work. Adding &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; does not extend that in any way.  Is it necessary to put in manual labour, clerical work or otherwise? We might be better off without it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We used the definition of employee which was used in other legislation to harmonise the integration of this legislation.  It must fit into a family of labour, accountancy and company law. We went to some trouble to ensure we were using the same language and definition of language.  It may seem archaic to be talking in 1984 of manual labour, clerical work or otherwise but it is a phrase that has been used in other legislation. From the point of view of the intent <Col N="274" /> of this legislation any employee who is fully insured will be fully covered by the provisions of this legislation.'</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended to introduce Article 1 of the EC directive I have referred to?  I can see that this could be a two edged weapon in that &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; might exclude certain employees. However, the Bill should be so comprehensively constructed as to include any possible type of working relationship. That is covered in the EC directive where it states that the directive shall apply to employees' claims arising from contracts of employment or employment relationships.</P>
      <P>As a trade union official I come across cases where some workers, however questionable the relationship, want to claim something when the firm goes bust. They are told they are not provided for in law.  It should be covered by the term &ldquo;employment relationships&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what the Deputy said.  We have gone some way to meet that in the definition we have used.  Is it the same definition as is in the legislation dealing with redundancy so that someone who is properly and fully insured will benefit and derive protection from this? We want to avoid the kind of interpretation problems that might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>A person can work full time in a factory.  He contracts his labour, as it were.  Although he is working fulltime in that factory, he is paid on a contract basis, in other words, he is paid so much per job.  Deputy Prendergast is concerned about that type of person. Such a person could not be said to be under a contract within this definition.  Is it the intention that people who work on that basis should be excluded?  I was talking to a maintenance man recently. The firm maintained that he was not their employee.  Technically perhaps that was correct but, in fact, he worked for them full time.  They said they paid him by the job.  This arrangement was set up for the convenience of the employer.  The reality is that he worked for them for years and <Col N="275" /> never worked for anybody else.  Is it the intention that a person in that category should be excluded from the benefits of this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>It is crucial for us to emphasise the importance of this definition. Whether we are talking about the Holidays (Employees) Act, the Minimum Notice in Terms of Employment Act, the Redundancy Payments Act, all the existing corpus of industrial legislation takes second place to the Companies Act in establishing who is a preferential shareholder when there is a liquidation.</P>
      <P>I recognise the Minister's humanitarian input into this Bill.  Nobody in this House has dealt more often with shysters than I have as a trade union official.  They seek to exclude as many people as they can.  They rush to the protection of the courts to exclude certain types of worker such as piece workers.  They and their families have invested their life's work in a company, on whatever basis, to the benefit of that company.  The company then try to wriggle out of their obligations by devious means.  The use of the term in the EC Directive, &ldquo;employment relationship&rdquo;, would bring in everybody. I will refer to this on another section of the Bill.  I may be working on an arranged basis to the mutual benefit of the employer and myself, and I should not have to pay a penalty for that if the employer goes out of business.  This is one of the most crucial parts of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The date of retrospection in the Bill is October 1983.  The Minister and his Department should consider making it retrospective to the beginning of the financial year.  Many factories closed between the beginning of April and October 1983.  Many employees were badly affected by those closures.  As Deputy Prendergast pointed out, the law governing receivership and liquidation puts the workers in a very weak position. There are many preferential creditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This section <Col N="276" /> deals with definitions.  I do not think it deals with the commencement of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; is the one used in the other Acts.  I do not see how we can improve on that.  Deputy Prendergast said the Companies Act takes precedence over all the other legislation when it comes to the winding up of a company or a court case. Section 285 of the Companies Act, 1963, sets out a list of who gets priority in the case of a liquidation or winding up.  What account has been taken of that section of the Companies Act in this Bill?  Many of these seem out of date when you think that the Companies Act was enacted 21 years ago.  Subsection (2) (c) provides:</P>
      <P>all wages (whether payable for time or for piece work) of any workman or labourer in respect of services rendered to the company during the 4 months next before the relevant date.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (d) reads:</P>
      <P>All accrued holiday remuneration becoming payable to any clerk, servant, workman or labourer (or in the case of his death to any other person in his right) on the termination of his employment before or by the effect of the winding-up order or resolution.</P>
      <P>What is the position of this Bill in relation to the Companies Act?  I want to clear my own mind on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are introducing legislation to set up a fund which will be contributed to out of the PRSI fund to reimburse with minimum delay workers who become unemployed because of an insolvency in the company for which they work, and to ensure that they will get their full entitlement in relation to arrears of wages, salary, holiday pay, sick benefit, and so on.  At present, in the event of a company going into liquidation, the worker has to take his or her place in the queue with the liquidator until the liquidator has gone through all the process of establishing whether or not there are assets.  That process could take <Col N="277" /> up to two years in some cases and, at the end of it, there might be only ten pence to 20 pence in the £ to meet all the claims. The worker would have to stand in line along with everybody else.</P>
      <P>There is the time delay and the loss of income plus the possibility that they may not be paid in full if the company are actually insolvent and have not got enough assets to meet their liabilities.  Let us take Irish Shipping as an example.  If this legislation were not to be enacted retrospectively to the date in question, having regard to the disastrous level of borrowings relative to assets, it is quite conceivable that the salaries and the arrears would not be paid.  Under this legislation, if we enact it, all the money owed to the Irish seamen, ratings and officers on board the ships and the shore staff will be paid in full with minimum delay out of this fund.  In the event of there being assets sufficient to recoup the entitlements, they will come back into the fund at the end of the day.  I have strayed from the Bill, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I allowed that Second Stage explanation.  I do not think that we should continue that, because we would never get through the legislation. It was quite helpful, if I may say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very helpful, because people were beginning to think this legislation out of line with the Companies Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because of the passage of time between Second and Committee Stages, during which another event took place.  Regarding the question raised by Deputy Taylor about employment relationships &mdash; the ready reckoner, from a social point of view, as to who is covered by this Bill and who is not &mdash; if the person to whom he referred was having his PRSI contribution paid for in part by the employer, then he is covered. If he has entered into some other kind of arrangement with this employer, such as a salesman might, for example, on a commission basis, where the employer is not <Col N="278" /> paying a PRSI contribution, that person, for the purposes of this legislation, is not an employee.  He may, in effect, be working for the company and may have arrangements that from his point of view constitute a life-long contract, effectively working for x or y, but for the purposes of this legislation which falls within the socially insured category of the work-force within our society, if he or his employer is not paying PRSI, then he or anyone in that position is not covered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Prendergast raised the question of employment relationships.  These could be construed to mean, for example, someone &ldquo;on the lump&rdquo; on the building site.  He is in an employment relationship with the building contractor, but, as many of us know, the reason for that relationship being so defined is that it is specifically to evade a whole raft of responsibilities, insurance from the point of view of the employer and, in some cases in the building industry certainly, for those who are &ldquo;on the lump&rdquo; to avoid their tax liabilities.  From the point of view of this legislation, that employment relationship is too broad a definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's clarification of a number of points. As he has said, it is many months since Second Stage.  It is for the very reasons which he has outlined that we on this side of the House welcome this Bill.  It will clear up many of the dreadful cases which will be talked about later on under the sections, where people are unable to claim and must wait several years to know whether they are going to get their money.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This has caused a lot of hardship down the years.  It would be no harm if the Minister were to read the categories into the Bill.  There would be a feeling that State employees will go the same way as those in private life.  Are for example, all the employees of Irish Shipping or similar enterprises paying PRSI?  What categories do or do not pay <Col N="279" /> it?  While the Bill mentions those covered under the Social Welfare Acts, it would be helpful to put on the record the categories of employees who are covered in this legislation.  Otherwise, at our clinics people who feel that this Bill is going to solve their problems, because of their level in the management of their firm, will find they are not PRSI contributors and are not covered under the definitions of this Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a colleague of mine and I admire him very much for his humanitarian outlook which compels him to do this.  I give him full credit for that.  As someone who worked in the field, I take full account of the point which the Minister made that those who are &ldquo;on the lump&rdquo; seek afterwards to have the best of both worlds.  Manifestly, nobody supports that illegal position, widespread though it be.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect &mdash; and I am referring to one of the greatest scandals going on here &mdash; and that is the exploitation by unscrupulous employers of women whose husbands are idle and who come largely from housing estates.  These people must go to work and do commercial cleaning.  This is the nearest form of white slavery that I can think of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious, naturally, to abide by the procedures.  Perhaps I can get my answer by asking a question? First of all, does the Bill go back in line with the EC directives instead of just to the date outlined in the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  For example, what of a woman who had to <Col N="280" /> work for four or five hours a week and was told by her employer that she had no other rights, having no union to protect her?  A lot of these people do not know their rights.  Would she have a right to claim some compensation under this Bill? She has no one to advise her at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point that the Deputy is now making would be more appropriate on section 3 and we shall have a wide discussion on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a certain point which I was about to make and I had been waiting for quite some time, but it will come up under section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point under subsection 3 of section 1, the definition of an employer as one who is about to become insolvent if the person is adjudicated a bankrupt.  There are many employers who are insolvent but have not been adjudicated bankrupt.  For an employee or creditor to have an employer adjudicated bankrupt is quite an expensive procedure. Bankruptcies are fairly rare.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) deals with the case where the person has died and his estate, being insolvent, is being administered in accordance with the rules set out in Part I of the First Schedule to the Succession Act, 1965.  A very frequent occurrence when a person dies whose estate is insolvent is that it is not a question of the estate being administered in accordance with Part I of the Succession Act.  It is just left to lie there and it lapses.  Nobody sets about dealing with administration but the estate would be insolvent.  Category (b) would not be met because no administration at all would be under way.</P>

    <P>We come to paragraph (c), where the employer is a company and it is being wound up or a resolution for voluntary winding up is passed, or as the case may be.  Again, a very frequent occurrence is that when a company becomes insolvent nobody, either employee or creditor, is prepared to undertake the substantial <Col N="281" /> expense involved in commencing liquidation proceedings, where the company do not go into voluntary liquidation.  The whole thing just winds down, rather than the company being wound up.  The definition of insolvency required would not come under category (c) either.  Would the Minister comment on the fact that the definition of insolvency required to bring the whole Act into operation as a pre-condition has signal difficulties in so far as categories (a) (b) and (c) are concerned, for the reasons which I have given?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the definition, I would agree with my colleague, Deputy Taylor.  It is for that reason that we have inserted paragraph (d) as a catch out. This states that in the event of difficulties arising out of the first three categories, on which the Deputy has clearly put his legal finger, on being informed by a disadvantaged worker that he cannot support the cost of court proceedings and so forth and on being given the facts &mdash; and I have replied earlier to Deputy Ahern on this &mdash; the Minister, under section 4 (2), will have the power to make the decision that, effectively, insolvency has occurred and that the worker will, on the production of reasonable documentation to establish his or her claim, recoup whatever moneys are due.  The Minister and the fund can then stand in lieu of that worker and seek to reclaim that amount of money and replenish the fund accordingly.  That is the very thrust of the legislation.  It is specifically to overcome the difficulties which are being experienced, particularly in companies which just fold up and are never fully wound up.  The liquidation process, even if it is formally and legally gone into, can continue for quite a long time.  We are all, in a constituency sense, aware particularly of some small private companies where this has gone on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (d), in terms of definition, gives discretion.  There will be various definitions of insolvency which are within the Companies Act and elsewhere and we have included these to account for <Col N="282" /> those cases which do not fall neatly, naturally or adequately into those definitions. We have added a fourth, paragraph (d), which enables us to have the discretion to stand in the shoes of the worker and to replace the money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point about paragraph (d) being a catch-all provision but the reference to that in section 4 (2) is in unusual wording.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the circumstances he would envisage applying.  Why are the words &ldquo;employers who are of a class or description specified in the regulation&rdquo; included?  I can understand that in certain circumstances employers would be deemed to have become insolvent but why qualify that by referring to employers of a different class?  How would that work?  For instance, would the Minister envisage bringing in a regulation in relation to builders?  Does it mean that a type of trade would be deemed to come within the catch-all provision?  Would it not have been more logical to deal with the sort of situation I am describing by having a further subsection or by dealing with the insolvency categories with wording such as, &ldquo;where application was made to the employer for payment of a debt or wages, formal notice be sent to him by registered post and if he fails to pay within 21 days he will be deemed to have become insolvent for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;?  That might be a more efficient and speedy way of dealing with such a problem.  Otherwise, to deal with a situation as it arises, the Minister must set out a regulation. That is not something that could be done in ten minutes.  It would involve a lengthy procedure.  Regulations have to be drafted and laid before the House and there is a prolonged time span before they can come into operation.  I shall have more to say on that aspect when we come to the relevant section but suffice it to say for now that up to five or six months could elapse before regulations could become effective whereas what is required is a speedy procedure whereby an employer could be deemed to have become insolvent if the worker concerned or a creditor has sent written notice by registered post <Col N="283" /> to the employer requesting payment of what is due and if within 21 days the money has not been paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to adopt Deputy Taylor's suggestion, the procedure he envisages would be availed of on a broad scale instead of the regular process being followed.  While the redundancy fund is normally in a healthy position, there must be some control on it. The winding up of a company can be a lengthy process.  It can continue for some years before the courts.  If we were to have a situation in which the staff of, for instance, Irish Shipping Limited, or of any other company in that position were to be in a position of demanding wages and salaries for the whole month of November as well as all their other entitlements I do not know what would happen to the redundancy fund.  To legislate in the way suggested by Deputy Taylor would be to move away from the social advantages of this legislation.  We can deal later with the 21 days stipulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that in regard to Deputy Taylor's question on definition we are prevented by law from naming an employer specifically in a regulation. That explains the reference to class or description.  The regulation could specify the type of trade the employer was engaged in, the townland in which he lived and so on, for the purposes of ensuring that an aggrieved worker would be assured of his entitlement under this legislation.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's second point which relates to section 4, we are happy that in this context regulations could be made within a matter of a week.  The definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; in this instance is the same as that in section 1.  Again, this is because of the constraints about naming an employer in regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the definition of when an employer is deemed to have become insolvent.  I do not see how a regulation in that regard could be made within a week since it would have <Col N="284" /> to be laid before both Houses and a period of at least 21 sitting days would have to elapse before it came into effect. Even assuming that the House were sitting during all of that time, would that not mean that a considerable number of weeks would elapse before the regulation could come into operation?  Even longer could elapse if it were a time when the House was not in session.  I accept that an individual employer could not be named in a regulation but perhaps the Minister could give the House an indication of what would be the likely format of these regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot allow a full discussion on regulations. Obviously, that is a matter for debate on another section.  A reference to regulation in so far as it strengthens the Deputy's case for a more elaborate description of employer or employee is in order but only to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I am not making myself very clear.  I am talking about subsection (3) and paragraph (d) in particular which deals with the definition of when an employer may be deemed to have been insolvent.  Can the Minister give an indication of the format envisaged for these regulations?  What sort of circumstances are envisaged in which employers would be deemed to become insolvent?  Would the circumstances be that they were unable to pay their debts, that there was a judgment against them? What is envisaged by the circumstances in which the Minister would make the regulation and how would he envisage complying with the requirement of class or description?  Would the regulation provide, for example, that it applied to builders or to manufacturers of a certain type of product?  I should like the Minister to comment further on the crucial question of the time element.  Might not the prolonged period I envisage be damaging to the position of a worker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to answer Deputy Taylor's very real query in this <Col N="285" /> regard.  Paragraph (d) represents a catch-all provision designed to facilitate workers whose employer has not fitted in with the other previous categories with which, in a sense, there is no real problem. Let us take the example that an employer leaves the country.  In those circumstances an aggrieved employee would either go direct to the Department or to his trade union or to a public representative. Once the representation has been received and since the definition of &ldquo;insolvency&rdquo; would not come within categories (a), (b) and (c), the Department would have to appoint an inspector to establish whether the case was bona fide.  Human nature being what it is, there would always be the possibility of collusion in such matters.  The inspector who would be from within the redundancy-insolvency section of the Department would establish if there was a case.  He would act as quickly as possible and if there was a case, the Minister, within the terms of section 15, would have the power to make a regulation within the framework of the legislation covering the making of regulations generally to enable the Department and the fund to recoup the money which the employee is legitimately owed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That regulation can be activated even if the matter should arise in the summer. A regulation can be made within the framework of the section and it can be laid before the House when it resumes. The regulation can then be annulled.  This is a standard provision in many Acts. There can be a motion in the House after the efflux of 21 sitting days.  Until such time as the regulation is annulled the Minister can act in anticipation and therefore the concern over the delay that Deputy Taylor-Quinn was concerned about would not arise, because if the employer has left the country the Minister can clearly specify by regulation the nature of the claim, the nature and location of the activities of the company and on foot of that the due moneys can be paid out in bona fide cases.  As the former Chief Whip of Fianna Fáil will know, there are regulations laid before the <Col N="286" /> House every day but they are not challenged.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give us some information about the redundancy fund and its present financial state? How is the money held?  Is it invested outside the fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain this fairly comprehensively and perhaps answer other questions Deputies may have.  I will give the House the note I have on this section.  The section provides for the re-titling of the redundancy fund as the Redundancy and Employers Insolvency Fund.  Any references in the Social Welfare and Redundancy Acts to an employer's redundancy contributions shall be construed as including a reference to any amount which that contribution comprises by reason of the passing of the Bill. Subsection (1) provides for the re-titling of the existing redundancy fund as the Redundancy and Employers Insolvency Fund.  The new title reflects the increased range of coverage of the fund.</P>
      <P>Section 28 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 originally provided for flat rate monetary contributions by both employer and employees to the redundancy fund.  Under section 3 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1979 a revised section 28 was substituted for the original.  Under the revised section employees were no longer required to contribute to the fund and the employer's contribution was fixed at 0.5 per cent of the employee's reckonable earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section also provided that the contribution payable by an employer under the Social Welfare Act, 1952 would be increased by the amount of the redundancy contribution &mdash; thus the redundancy contributions became a part of the employers' PRSI contribution.  The 0.5 per cent redundancy contribution rate <Col N="287" /> was reduced to .01 per cent in 1982 and maintained at that level in 1983.  Arising from the level of expenditure from the fund it was necessary to raise the contribution rate this year.  The increase of 0.49 per cent in the employers' PRSI contribution rate, announced in the budget, brought the redundancy contribution up to 0.4 per cent; .02 of the increase is designed to meet the additional expenditure which the fund will incur as a result of the measures provided for in this Bill. It is estimated that the .02 per cent contribution will yield an income of £1 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>While it is difficult to predict what the expenditure from the fund in respect of the claims covered by this Bill is likely to be it was considered prudent to provide for an additional income to the fund of at least £1 million to meet such claims. Given that workers are unlikely to be in a position to continue to work for long periods without remuneration, claims in respect of ordinary pay should not in the majority of cases be substantial.  The experience in the United Kingdom, where a similar fund is in operation, has been that the major items of expenditure are in respect of minimum notice and holiday pay.  When estimates of the possible expenditure were being prepared the only hard information which was available was in respect of minimum notice and unfair dismissal awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal in insolvency situations during 1982.  These amounted to approximately £155,000 and £1,000 respectively.  The balance in the redundancy fund at 31 October last was £12,654,975.  The fund is not a separate account.  It is not invested as are pension funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister set off the redundancy fund for use in the Department generally?  Is the £12 million held aside as a contingency fund, for instance, to provide for the possibility of 100,000 people losing their jobs tomorrow? Is it taken into account in the Estimates each year, or is it invested <Col N="288" /> separately?  If the Minister had to call on it quickly would it be available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The moneys are held by the Department of Finance, and the Department of Labour, in processing redundancy claims, draw down certified amounts as they become necessary.  We do not have it in a separate deposit account in the accounting system of the Department of Labour.  The fund is accountable for book-keeping but it is held by the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister for Finance use it for any purpose other than redundancy payments?  Can he use it in the short term?  Say that £10 million will be collected in 1985 &mdash; that is very substantial money &mdash; is it used only for the purpose of redundancy and employers insolvency payments or can it be used for other purposes?  Can it be used only by the Department of Labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will clarify one point for me.  The Bill seeks to confine payments from the fund to those with legal agreements.  Workers claims arising from agreements registered in the Labour Court which had not been fully implemented or Labour Court recommendations which clarify disputed settlements would not be admitted for payment under the Bill.  To give an example. The Bill would not enable redundant employees to benefit from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making provision to collect an extra £1 million to the net amount I mentioned earlier.  It started in this tax year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand what the Minister estimates he will get from it but <Col N="289" /> does he agree that the amounts will be far in excess of that?  How much is there already?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount in a calendar year will bring in a net additional £1 million.  That figure was calculated on the basis of experience in other EC countries as to the amount of money that would be likely given the rate of redundancies, insolvencies, the level of employment and average wages.  The Department had consultations with other EC countries and calculated what would be a reasonable provision.  We added to that in case we were not correct.  We worked on the assumption that very few workers will be able to work for more than four or five weeks at maximum without getting some kind of income. Holiday pay, sick pay and other entitlements tend in the main to be the amounts of money which people do not get when a firm is declared insolvent.</P>
      <P>The total amount of the fund was £12,654,975 at the end of October.  It is added to with each PRSI contribution. As regards the location of the fund and its utilisation, this fund is part of the PRSI fund.  It is a sub-component of it from a redundancy point of view.  It is not at the disposal of the Department of Labour <i>per se</i>.  We do not have it on deposit.  I presume it is on deposit within the framework of the Department of Finance.  I do not have that information but I will try to get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe funds should be used for the purpose for which they are collected.  I do not believe that they should be used to offset one thing against another.  The way the levies are used is another argument.  When the increase was made it was specified exactly what it was for and how PRSI contributions were divided.  If the Department of Finance are to follow their own guidelines, which they are normally good at, I do not see why the fund is not under the control of the Department.  If that money is in the Department of Finance it is more than likely that it is being set off or invested in pension funds at their disposal because <Col N="290" /> they know it will not be drawn down.  Last April the employers' PRSI contributions were increased at a time when they were hard pressed, over-taxed and when the black economy was rife.  The increase was not really necessary.  The fund now stands at £12½ million.  We are well through the tax year.  It will be another while before this legislation is enacted. Why did the Department of Finance look for an increase in the fund?</P>

I hope to get it through the House today and I am trying to make arrangements with the Seanad to have it carried as quickly there.  The demand for the fund could be immediate.  Claims have been mounting up.  We are not legally entitled to pay out money from this fund until such time as this legislation is enacted.  The claims go back to October 1983.</P>

While the presence of Deputies Daly and Taylor is very welcome I do not think it is unrelated to the demise of a certain company.  Provision has been made for money to be paid out and for some arrears.  A calculation has to be made as to what amount is necessary to finance the fund.  We did our best on this in the Department.  If the fund attracts interest that goes back into the fund and is accounted as such.  I can get clarification and confirmation of that.  Much as the Department of Labour would be able to make good use of this money, it is part of the overall insurance fund and the Department of Social Welfare will have a claim on it as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to know. We have only been able to go on limited factual domestic experience, Employment Appeals Tribunal statistics and others.  They cover cases where there have been proper liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings.  We do not know the position in cases where companies disappear and there is no one to take a case against them.  Using that limited information plus the experience in other EC countries we made a provision for £1 million.  We are satisfied that we have more than enough resources to compensate anyone who has a legitimate claim within the legislation.  It would be unwise and inaccurate if I said I could be more precise.  We do not know nor can anyone know until we bring it in.  It may be that we have collected more money than is needed but I would prefer to be in that position and able to meet claims rather than be in the reverse position.  I cannot prejudge what the Government might do if the funds are in credit to an amount which is believed to be in excess of what is required.  We made a reasonable estimate on the limited statistics available to us and covered ourselves so that no worker <Col N="292" /> will be prevented from getting his or her entitlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now saying he cannot be sure and I accept that because he can only make an estimate. However, if his estimate is £1 million and as the fund is in an extremely healthy state, it should perhaps allow us to go back further with regard to compensating employees.  In 1983-84 this country had more redundancies, closures, liquidations and fly-by-night directors than there were since the foundation of the State. This is an opportune time to rectify the injustices which have taken place over the last few years.  If the Minister has over-estimated, the money should not be left lying in investments or pension trusts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not want the House to think that we have over-estimated the need.  We have made cautious provision for what we anticipate the need will be. I am not saying that we have over-estimated because, frankly, we do not know. However, on the best estimates, we added a certain cautious additional amount to provide for possible inaccuracies on our side.  I have just received additional information in relation to the fund which may be of interest.  The money is collected by the Department of Social Welfare and transferred on a monthly basis to the Central Bank where it is invested.  The fund is separate and any interest accruing is added to the fund and cannot be used as ready cash for any other activity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;This Act shall apply to employees' claims arising from contracts of employment or employment relationships which exist against employers who are in a state of insolvency&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a crucial section of the Bill.  The major portion of the debate on section 1 was taken up by argument about to whom the definition applied.  Deputy Prendergast raised the point about the EC directive not being mentioned in the Bill. However, it is mentioned in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill which says that it will also implement the requirements of Council Directive 80/987/EEC which came into effect on the same date and which confers certain rights on employees in insolvency situations.  This is not mentioned in the Bill and this section is contrary to the intention of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would mean the removal of section 3 and its substitution by the amendment as it is taken from the EC directive to which I referred.  It is not restricted to employees in employment which is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, 1981 to 1984, because that restricts the application of the Act to those who work more than 18 hours a week.  No other country in the EC has restricted the application of the directive in this manner, that part time workers would not be covered by the Act.  In the last couple of years particularly, the number of workers in part time employment has increased enormously and continues to increase.  The propaganda from many organisations is that people at work should share their work, <Col N="294" /> which gives the impression that everybody should be in part time employment. Those who give part time employment to young people are praised and told that it is a very worthy act.  If the Bill is put through in its present form it will give further encouragement to giving people less than 18 hours work per week. Employers could take on two people to do one job and be seen to be carrying out the wishes of the State in giving more part time jobs to young people.</P>
    <P>There are also traditional part time jobs, such as cleaners, to which Deputy Prendergast referred, and which would not be covered by the Bill.  We put down this amendment to ensure that the directive will cover all employment.  It would cover the points which worried Deputy Prendergast and Deputy Taylor although Deputy Taylor gave examples, apart from part time workers, of people who are employed under strange contracts and to whom the Bill should also apply. This amendment would ensure that the directive which the Bill purports to put into effect would, in fact, be put into effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that section 2 of the directive allows for exceptions and that member states may, by way of exception, exclude claims of certain categories of employment in the scope of this directive but if you read further on you will see that it relates to contract of employment or employment relationship or the existence of other forms of guarantee offering the employee protection equivalent to the result of this directive.  In other words, there are exceptions for people already covered by various other relationships with the employer or contracts with the employer so that it would be unnecessary to apply the directive to them.  That cannot be said of part time workers.</P>

      <P>I reflect the views of the trade union movement in saying that the Bill should not limit the workers concerned to any number of hours.  I have already referred to the blackguardism and exploitation in relation to commercial cleaners.  There should be a national <Col N="295" /> public inquiry into the abuses in that area. What is happening borders almost on legalised white slavery.  In this connection I mention the offices of one national daily newspaper in Limerick but that is only one instance.  There is exploitation of women clerical workers.  They are married women and they are offered employment deliberately less than the number of hours mentioned in the legislation. Naturally the women are glad to accept this work for the extra remuneration, or pin money as it used to be called.  It also gives them a legitimate occupation outside the house, it adds a dimension to their normal lives and takes the boredom out of their lives.  However, they are being deliberately exploited by unscrupulous employers.</P>
      <P>I have had men and women, but especially women, come to my office and complain about what is happening.  I mention in particular what is happening in the catering industries.  I have no antipathy towards foreigners who work here but when one goes to some of these people and explains to them that workers have the right to become a member of a union and that they are covered by legislation even if they are not members of a union, they do not seem to understand.  However, they would understand very quickly if they were given the wrong change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making a plea here on behalf of those unfortunate or uninformed workers who have not the intelligence or are not in a position to join a trade union and who have no access to the information we are talking about.  I am pointing the finger at the legal profession who are brilliant in their exploitation of that kind of situation because of the knowledge of the members of the profession of what is going on.  I am in line with the ICTU in saying that anyone employed for whatever time should be covered and that is also in line with the spirit of the EC directive.  There is wholesale exploitation of workers, especially poorer female workers, who are still under the belief which is encouraged by unscrupulous employers that they can be sacked for joining a trade union.  They are cut off from all forms <Col N="296" /> of protection.  That is going on every day and this Bill gives us an opportunity to protect them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the desire on the part of the Minister that there should be conformity between this legislation and other measures dealing with social matters and employment.  However, I urge him to consider that this Bill deals with a new situation and should stand on its own.  Let us take the case of a person who works for 17 hours per week and whose employer becomes insolvent.  The employee may be left with five weeks wages due to him but because he has worked for only 17 hours a week he will be deprived of the five weeks wages.  On the other hand, a person who has worked for 19 hours will get five weeks wages under the fund.</P>
      <P>What is being sought here is a modest extension to the concept of the Bill.  The concept is that a worker who is deprived of a few weeks wages as a result of an employer's insolvency should be enabled to have recourse to the fund.  What does it matter if the person has worked 17 hours, 19 hours or even five hours?  If he has worked only five hours per week his wages would be low and, consequently, the amount required to be paid out of the fund would be low.  The call a worker would have on the fund would be in proportion to his wages.</P>
      <P>It would be a fine gesture and a fair approach to say that any employee within the meaning of the Act whose employer becomes insolvent should be able to have recourse to the fund.  In any case it applies only to a maximum of eight weeks and we are not talking about any enormous sum.  Why should a person not get his wages, even though he had worked only 17 hours instead of 19 hours?  That seems a logical basis on which to approach the matter.</P>

      <P>I am not accepting the amendment in the names of Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa because it is defective.  Understandably they have taken the term used in the EC directive. This was the document agreed at the <Col N="297" /> Council among the ten member states but it was not couched in legal language.  As Deputy Mac Giolla rightly pointed out, the member states sought the right to exclude certain categories and to define in legal terms in their domestic legislation how the directive should be applied.  I will not repeat the arguments I made in relation to the potential abuse the phrase &ldquo;employment relationships&rdquo; could be construed to have with regard to, for example, lumping.  I am sure Deputy Mac Giolla is not trying to make his amendment a charter to protect lumpers but that could be the effect.  That is why I am not accepting the amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla stated Ireland is the only country that had sought an exclusion under the directive.  That is not the case.  I refer the House to the official journal of the EC, reference L283/26 dated 28/10/1980 in which four of the ten member states sought exclusions of different categories of workers.  Those countries were Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. We are not alone here and I am sure the Deputy will accept that correction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of part time working was mentioned.  The section uses the words &ldquo;subject to section 10&rdquo; and I point out that the two sections should be read together.  We are saying that the people who will be covered by this legislation will be those within the social welfare code who are paying PRSI and who are covered under redundancy legislation. Under that legislation people who worked less than 18 hours a week for more than one employer or for one employer for part time income are not covered normally under existing legislation. We propose to keep it that way for the purposes of continuity, harmony and other administrative reasons.  However, there is provision for a worker who has a part time job, who has no other source of income and who can demonstrate that to the Department of Social Welfare, to be covered for the purposes of this Bill and to receive the protection this measure will accord.  I am taking at a later stage under section 10 the powers to include other categories of workers not <Col N="298" /> currently described, if discretion and experience shows that is necessary.  The most vulnerable, the lowest paid, those who have only a part time job and who, as a result, only have a partial income, will be covered, and their cases can be looked at on an individual basis by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that it makes good logical and administrative sense to try to harmonise different types of legislation dealing in the same area where definitions, eligibility and so on are concerned. As public representatives we all have had to deal with cases where people were entitled to one thing under one category and not entitled to another thing under another category.  Matters became quite confused and people ended up not knowing what their rights were.  We are using the same categorisation, the same definitions and the same entitlements in the interests of good administrative practice, but we are also giving ourselves two additional discretionary powers, so to speak. One exists already, which is if a person with a part time job which provides his sole means of income can show that it is his sole source of income and he is accordingly at a loss for that money, holiday money or whatever, he will be covered by this fund.</P>

      <P>The basic approach adopted by this country was to exclude workers not covered by the Redundancy Payments Act.  In the case of this country among the categories for whom this exclusion is provided in an annex to the directive are persons who normally work for fewer than 18 hours a week for one or more employers and who do not derive their basic means of subsistence from the pay from this work.  Where an employee who works for fewer than 18 hours per week satisfies the Department of Social Welfare that such employment provides his or her basic means of subsistence, such an employee is fully insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  The contribution payable by the employee in such case includes his contribution to the redundancy fund although the employee has no entitlement to benefit under the Redundancy Payments Act.  The Department of Social Welfare examine all such cases on an individual basis and all income from whatever source is taken into account when assessing means.  If under that provision it emerged that somebody had a claim I would imagine that a note to that effect presented to the Department of Labour would get a reimbursement from the fund for whatever arrears the person was entitled to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for an analysis of the terminology of the directive. For example, if a woman is working for ten or 12 hours a week as a commercial office cleaner in order to keep the wolf from the door when her husband is idle, and she is living in a housing estate and has six or eight children, as is very often the case, and if she claims that the hours she is working provide her sole means of subsistence, will the Department say that that is not so because her husband has unemployment benefit or assistance?  Is she ruled out on that account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efficiency and professionalism of employers is unbelievable and they use calculated viciousness to circumvent <Col N="300" /> legislation and exploit these women. When they go below a certain number of hours a week their social welfare contributions are scaled down deliberately.  We had what was like a leper colony in Limerick when a new scale of rates was introduced and all the employers went from the top rate of social welfare contributions down to the bottom.  The unfortunate women even when they were made redundant or unemployed could not get even the normal proper social welfare level, and they were not even made aware of that.  It was reduced in many cases without their even knowing it and when they came to us we discovered that and had to ring their employers.  This had been done to suit the employer because his contribution went down far more than that of the workers.  If the purpose of this Bill is to cover unfortunate people who are not protected by trade unions or otherwise &mdash; I accept that that is the case &mdash; then the Bill should apply to all workers and, as Deputy Taylor says, it can be done on the basis of proportionality.</P>

      <P>I accept that it is not in proper legal language but it looks as legal as any language to me.  However, it says what the intention is and that is the main thing.  If it was accepted the legal brains in the Department could put it into proper language.  The Minister said that other countries also exclude certain categories of workers; we are not the only country in the EC to do that.  Could the Minister confirm that any other country excluded part time workers working for fewer than 18 hours per week?  I made the point that we were the only EC country who tried to exclude part time workers working fewer than 18 hours per week from the Bill.  The Bill will also exclude <Col N="301" /> other categories of workers such as lumpers etc. and I presume other EC countries have excluded other categories of workers also.</P>
      <P>The intention of this amendment is to include in the Bill people who work for fewer than 18 hours per week.  The purpose of the Bill is to make sure that employees' claims arising from their job, contract of employment or whatever should be paid to them from the fund if the employer goes bust.  In other words, money is due to the employees and this fund is set up to ensure that they get what they worked for, what they are supposed to get, what is due to them, for the work which they did.  Whether they did ten hours, 17 hours or 40 hours a week, they worked hours for which they are entitled to payment, the employer goes bust, there is no money to give them.  They have put in their work.  Whether it was manufacturing an article or doing something else, they have added to the value of something, whether it is the environment or something being fabricated. They are due payment for that, they are not getting it.  This fund is to see that they get it.  Why does it exclude workers who work fewer than a particular number of hours?  They have also worked their hours, they have done something which has added to the wealth of the country, they are due payment and the purpose of this Bill and the EC directive is to see they get their entitlement.  After all, the only thing a worker has are his hands.  He has no other property that he can fall back on such as a factory, farm or office block.  He has put in his work.  If he does not get payment this fund is there to see that justice is done.  We are asking the Minister to see in this section that part time workers who work fewer than 18 hours are included.  The way we felt would be best to have it included was to put down the EC directive as it was written.  If there are other ways in which they can be included, that is fair enough. The Minister says they are included already under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast has put forward a case.  If they worked the hours then it is proved that there was another source of <Col N="302" /> income to the family, whether it is the husband or wife and that it was not the sole source of income.  A family could not live on the income derived from working ten hours per week and, therefore, must have another source of income but they will not get paid even though they may have put in the hours and completed the job they were entitled to be paid for. That is not satisfactory and does not cover the whole purpose of the EC directive.  It amounts to introducing a means test for this and it appears that if people can manage to live without this they will not get it.  It is almost a charity.  The purpose of this was to ensure that they got their entitlement under their contract of employment.  I am asking the Minister, whether in this or some other language, to ensure that part time workers are included in the terms of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be helpful if the Minister put on record the categories of people entitled to benefit.  A problem here is trying to harmonise one piece of legislation with another.  Social welfare legislation precludes people who work under 18 hours per week.  If a person works for one day he or she must pay a stamp and section 3 states that it is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  A number of people have certain benefits under the Acts but not the entitlements for most other things Deputies Mac Giolla and Prendergast spoke of.  I agree with Deputy Prendergast in his reference to contract companies. I am referring particularly to the cleaning area.  To the best of my knowledge a report has been prepared highlighting a number of the inadequacies that exist.  They apply to State, semi-State companies, health boards and hospitals. I have had experience of a number of these contracting firms who tender against each other but play the various pieces of legislation to cut their cost.  By retaining a large staff to work for less than 18 hours per week they save substantially on the employers' part of the contribution.  Any Government Department could put a stop to that by ensuring that one firm does not get an advantage <Col N="303" /> over another due to the fact that they have cut their contributions to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them will argue that they are a legitimate company paying taxes and are unionised.  I am aware of one company that is very big in this city and operates elsewhere in the country that maintains that because they stick by the Act and regulations they lose out on major contracts.  Workers will co-operate with companies in other areas.  It would be unfair to go through a debate such as this without stating that there is collusion on the other side as well as on the side of the employers.  Investigations by the Department of Social Welfare into some of these companies ascertained that some employees used false names.  Apparently, those employees had been in receipt of other social welfare benefits at the same time.  It is not a matter of corrupt employees only.  It occurs among employers, particularly in the cleaning area.  In that area the staff do not understand legislation and employers can avail of the opportunity of misleading them into working a limited number of hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This also applied in the case of British Home Stores where there was a long strike last year.  Certain productivity deals were put to the staff which brought them under 18 hours work per week but when those people were told to go they were informed that they were not entitled to certain benefits.  I accompanied deputations from that store to the Department of Social Welfare to try to argue their entitlements.  I understood the Minister to say that if a person works these hours and it is their only employment they will be entitled to benefits under this legislation. Does that include or exclude members of the family?  Will it mean that if a wife is working 15 hours per week and <Col N="304" /> her husband is also employed she is entitled to benefit under this legislation?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline where public servants stand in this regard whether they are civil servants in the clerical or administrative area or State or semi-State employees?  In most cases they do not pay PRSI.  For many years there was a myth that such employees would never lose their jobs but that myth has gone and the question I have posed is relevant. A State employee will not be covered in the majority of cases by section 3 because he or she is not insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts from 1981 to 1984.  Such an employee is excluded from the provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 because under that the categories of workers not paying PRSI were excluded from a lot of benefits.  I was a member of a committee that considered that Bill.  We met for months considering the terms of the Bill which brought all the Acts for 65 years together.</P>
    <P>Civil and public servants always felt they would not lose their jobs and, consequently, would not have to claim redundancy or seek the protection of the various pieces of legislation that protect employees.  Some of the workers of Irish Shipping now find themselves in that category. What is their position?  The company was liquidated last week and workers were told that from 1 November they would not be paid although they had completed two weeks work.  Staff remaining have been told that they may or may not get paid, that it is all subject to what the liquidator will do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <P>Even if they have I do <Col N="305" /> not think we can say any longer that employees in that sector will not lose their jobs.  Threats are announced daily of what is likely to happen in the public service.  Is it likely that public servants will be made redundant and, in that event are they entitled to any benefits?  Will the Minister amend this legislation to cover such people or can such people take it that they can never be fired?  This is an important question.  What entitlements has a State employee who does not pay PRSI?  The Minister's officials are in this position.  If they were made redundant tonight because of cutbacks in the public service or if hospital or health board employees were made redundant, would they be covered because they do not pay PRSI?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to deal with the points raised in sequence.  With regard to the general point raised by Deputy Mac Giolla and others I should restate what we are doing today.  We are establishing a fund to provide for workers entitlements without any effective delay where they have those entitlements and where, for whatever reason, an employee becomes insolvent.  We are extending that provision and protection to all insured workers. Deputy Mac Giolla raised a question about the definition of that.  I accept that there is a problem about the legal definition.  The Directive was used in the Council in a general way and frequently this terminology is used because of problems of translation from one Community language to another.  However, if we were to take the amendment as worded by The Workers' Party it would become a lumpers' charter for exploitation and collusion.  We have enough evidence of collusion, in the building industry in particular, between certain road contractors who give bona fide contractors a bad name and we have certain roadworkers who give bona fide workers a bad name in relation to the manipulation and exploitation of what is the money of workers, employers and taxpayers.  It is not some isolated fund delivered from abroad; this is our own taxpayers' money, <Col N="306" /> and everybody knows how difficult it is to collect that money.</P>
      <P>We have used the definition of employee to exclude the possibility of abuse and I have used a shorthand definition to enable Deputies to establish who would be covered from the employee's point of view.  If the employee and employer are paying their PRSI contributions, they are covered.</P>
      <P>This is a broad debate and I do not want to extend it beyond what is relevant to this legislation.  Part time work is becoming an increasing economic reality because of productivity levels and other factors.  The Social Affairs Council of the EC have recognised that problem.  They have also recognised that there are difficulties arising from the mismatch between the social protection for workers in part time employment and workers in full time employment.  For that reason we are at present working on a directive to cover part time workers bearing in mind the contract cleaners scandal.  I have taken the initiative of establishing a joint labour committee on contract cleaners because of the exploitability of many workers in this area.  We all know the type of people who are being exploited by some employers &mdash; Deputy Ahern was right in the way he presented this case.  The only way to get around that and to provide for fair competition between employers tendering, in this instance, for State contracts is to have a proper floor for wages.  It is very difficult for the trade unions to organise some categories of workers and part time cleaners fall into that category.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and it is for that reason that we have introduced the joint labour committee which will establish minimum wages.  When that committee make their conclusions &mdash; and they will not do so very easily I gather from the reports I have from the chairperson of that committee &mdash; it will be my intention to ensure that all public contracts for contract cleaning utilise the provisions <Col N="307" /> and findings of the joint labour committee to get some degree of comparability. That has been done in the last couple of months, during my term as Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern asked about the categories of workers who were covered.  The not I have here gives approximate fixures.  There are approximately 140,000 persons employed in the public sector who are deemed to be insurable at the full rate.  They are employed in the following areas; within the broad category of the Civil Service, there are unestablished civil servants, 10,000; industrial staff, 6,000; contract staff, 3,000; defence civilians, 2,000&mdash;21,000 in all.  Within local authorities there are 26,000; health board employees within the State hospital system, 12,500 and in the various voluntary hospitals and nursing homes, 12,500; within education, universities, VECs, third level generally, 5,000; semi-State bodies and other public authorities, 53,000 and in the miscellaneous category, which covers other areas, 10,000, giving a total of 140,000 employees.</P>
      <P>I have tried to deal with the points raised, but we are not prepared to accept the amendment for the reasons I have given.  There is provision in the application of the social welfare code if people are deemed to be solely dependent, substantially dependent or significantly dependent.  This is a means test in effect which takes into account other sources of income within the family.  Then, provision to avail of their rights under this legislation when enacted will prevail. That provision, in terms of eligibility for an insured worker to benefits from other forms of social welfare is there and we are extending it to part time workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have used 18 hours as the threshold for eligibility in this instance but we have gone further in this legislation than the directive specifies.  We have improved it by a conscious political decision in the Department of Labour.  We have lowered the threshold for eligibility in relation to part time work in redundancy payments and unfair dismissals from 20 hours <Col N="308" /> to 18 hours a week.  They are now harmonised; it is good legislative sense to have the same level of qualification. Instead of scaling down, we are scaling up, although the numbers are coming down.  This has been a positive improvement. The exploitation of part time workers by unscrupulous employers will continue because the threshold of 18 hours will mean that somebody will be working up to 17 hours but if we were to lower the threshold to 15 hours, some employees would be working only 14 hours.  We know that from experience, hence the need for a directive on part time work.</P>
    <P>This is a subject on which I will be coming back to this House because I have consistently said that worker protection legislation is a function of economic and industrial relations.  If we start to fundamentally change the economic structures and activities within any society, as they are changing now, we must of necessity reflect that change in legislation.  It is our intention to harmonise and modernise that legislation but we must ensure that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water.  We must bring into line and extend where possible that protection in the spirit in which the labour movement has always sought to do so.  One of the changes in the economy which is evident to many people is the increasing desire for part time work for some people and the increasing need for part time work for others.  About 30 or 40 years ago a five day week would have been described as part time work and a person entitled to four or five weeks holidays would also have come into that category.  This is the kind of shift I am talking about.  I realise this is broadening the debate and the Chair has been very tolerant in allowing me to respond to these points.</P>
    <P>I would like to answer the question raised about Irish Shipping workers.  I will get confirmation of this but the information I have to date is that they are all insured workers in the full sense of the word under PRSI and social welfare and are fully covered and protected.  Irish Shipping was established in 1941 under the companies legislation and is governed <Col N="309" /> and administered by the Companies Act referred to earlier.  As Deputy Taylor said, a company set up by the State in those circumstances has the same protection and benefits as any other company. There is no question of redundancy in the public service.  There is a constraint on the increase in numbers in terms of additional people being taken on or in relation to some replacements.  There is no question of redundancy.  There is no question of any other State company being liquidated. The situation in relation to Irish Life&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What would it cost if the provision in relation to the 18-hour week were excluded?  I am grateful to the Minister for bringing out this note on the question of insurability.  Not being an expert on social welfare matters, I found it most helpful.  I should like to be certain that he is telling the House that people in that category will come in under section 3 if the decision is taken at a later date by the Department of Social Welfare.  The section states that it is confined to employment which is insurable for all benefits.  In the case of the part time category to which the Minister refers an application must be made to the officials of the Department of Social Welfare who examine the circumstances and make a decision as to whether that person has rights under the Social Welfare Acts. <Col N="310" /> That comes later.  Can the Minister assure me and the House that where a person is found to be entitled retrospectively it still comes within the definition in section 3 that the employment was insurable for all benefits?  The Department of Social Welfare having examined the circumstances might then have to decide whether the person was entitled to benefit and it seems that some addendum might be necessary to section 3, stating that the Act will cover employment which is insurable for all benefits or which is deemed by a decision of the Department or of the Minister for Social Welfare to be insurable <i>ex post facto</i>&mdash; in other words, at a later date.  Perhaps that is not necessary but it is as well to have the point clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognising that the Minister has stated that he will be dealing in due course with part time employment, it still troubles me that we, alone in Europe, should find ourselves putting a penalty on our part time workers in a manner that does not apply in any other country in the EC.  There is no basis or logic for it.  It highlights the poor rate of development in our social welfare system in comparison with the rest of Europe.  It is certainly not the fault of this Minister or of this Government alone.  It is a reflection on successive governments over the years.  One has only to look at the annex to the EC directive to see the situation. We have more exclusions than anybody else.  We have five, while Greece has one, the Netherlands has one and the United Kingdom has two.  France and Germany do not have any.  The person working 17 hours per week in France who requires to have benefit has no problem.  It makes no difference whether he is working 19, 17 or five hours.  There is no exclusion for any French or German worker.  This 18-hour limitation is confined to Ireland alone.  What is so special about our part time workers that we have to exclude them from benefit?  How much money would be involved in dealing with the matter?  I suspect that the amount involved would be relatively small.  I do not know if the Minister has the figure.  If not, perhaps he could get it for us later <Col N="311" /> in the day so that we would know what amount of money would be needed to achieve parity on this issue with all the other countries in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I must go back again to the point and purpose of the Bill.  The Minister is introducing elements which confuse the issue.  The explanatory memorandum says it is designed to protect employees' interests in regard to pay in the event of their employer becoming insolvent.  It has nothing to do with disadvantaged people or poor people.  It is simply a matter of paying people what they are due.  The banks are already covered under other Acts so that they will get what is due first.  They are well covered in cases of insolvency.  Is this an attempt to cover employees in the same way?  It could be an employee who was very well paid and had put by something over the years and had another income from investments.  It could apply to all sorts of people, regardless of whether their income is high or low.  That is the social welfare area.  The Minister is confusing the whole issue by bringing in social welfare regulations which might cover certain categories of people.  It has nothing to do with that.  It simply concerns people who are employed under a contract of employment and who were not paid for the work they did.  The purpose of the Bill is to protect employees' interests in regard to pay in the event of their employer becoming insolvent irrespective of whether they are very well off or very poor.  There is no point in confusing the issue by talking about other ways in which part time employees would be covered and would not be allowed to starve in the event of not benefiting under this legislation.  The purpose of the Bill is to do a specific job and, irrespective of any other Act, it should cover part time or full time employees who work to earn pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is also introducing the lumpers to confuse the issue further.  He could easily include part time employees if he wished to do so.  He can very easily <Col N="312" /> put in exclusions for various other categories but not an exclusion for part time employees who work less than 18 hours. Under section 10 he will have powers of inclusion and exclusion of categories of employment.  All we want to know is whether he will include part time workers who are not covered by section 3.  Those who have spoken have simply asked that they should be included within the scope of this Bill, whether they work 18, 17, ten hours or whatever.  They should be paid for the number of hours they work. That is the purpose of the Bill.  We want to see them included.</P>
    <P>We have put down this amendment on the basis that the EC directive intended that such employees should be covered. In that directive there is provision for exclusions.  No restrictions have been included on the employers' side.  There is no restriction in the Companies Act.  Why should we bring in this section when it comes to a question of workers' pay and entitlements in the case of an insolvency? This smacks of further discrimination against part time workers who, as the Minister has said, are an increasing phenomenon and will increase rapidly in the future.  That has been the case in the past number of years.  When there are exclusions in a Bill such as this, employers are encouraged to increase the number of their part time workers rather than full time workers.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Minister to include in this section, or some other section, part time workers who work under 18 hours.  This would have to come under section 3 because it is in that section that he has excluded them in the alteration to section 3.  Our amendment may not be in suitable legal terms.  We did not have it drawn up by any legal eagles.  We simply took it from the directive whose purpose is to ensure that all workers get what they contracted for in the case of an insolvency. Did any other EC country exclude part time workers under the terms of this directive?  It excluded other categories of workers and the Minister is entitled to exclude workers such as lumpers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being <Col N="313" /> badly advised.  His arguments and the arguments of his advisers are weak.  To me the implication in the Minister's statement is that he cannot reduce the hours bar because of the danger of benefiting people who manifestly should not benefit, for example, lumpers.  I have resisted a type of argument put forward by employers over the past 20 years. There is a well known maxim that the best is always the enemy of the good. When a group of workers say to an employer: &ldquo;In the name of humanity we think we are entitled to a sick pay scheme&rdquo;, the employer says: &ldquo;No, I cannot give you a sick pay scheme because it will be abused.&rdquo;  That is human nature and it applies everywhere.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has read the McGraw Hill book by Hallor Gillmor on Industrial Psychology can give you a fairly good breakdown of the people who are likely to do that.  You hear the same argument when you talk about increased holidays or overtime for Saturday work.  You are told workers will come in on Saturday for the double time and stay out on Monday, and off balance the tax effects.  We know the blackguardism that goes on.  Nothing I can say in English or in Irish could condemn sufficiently workers like lumpers and other people who abuse sick pay schemes.  They are the enemy of the workforce because they are used by employers, and in this case by the Department, not to give what is manifestly a very desirable scheme on the grounds that it will benefit the miscreants or the blackguards.  If possible we should enact a law covering all workers even on the grounds of proportionality, but introducing a <i>caveat</i> or an exclusion expressly denying the extension of the scheme to workers who are in breach of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give an example.  Recently two employees took their case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  They had been working a scheme under which they were taking so much under the counter.  They were paid £50 a week into their hands. Their cards were not being stamped. They were young men and they did not understand.  If they had any intelligence <Col N="314" /> they would not have exposed themselves to ridicule by going before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  There are also very devious employees and there can be collusion between employees and employers to defeat the various Acts. They can be expressly identified in legislation. The type of worker we are referring to here should not be penalised by the blackguardism of a few.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister &mdash; and the trade union movement have already done so &mdash; on the fact that he has reduced the threshold in several Acts which hitherto debarred workers from going before tribunals or qualifying for benefit.  In all fairness and modesty I can take some credit for being the person responsible within my own union, which is the biggest union in the country, for having the JLCs established for part time cleaners.  I ask the Minister to take my suggestion on board.  He might put a section into this Bill outlining the bona fides of himself and his Department and saying that to prevent the exploitation of unorganised or part time workers it was the intention of the Minister to establish JLCs to cover every conceivable type of employee.  They are easily identified and some of them are already covered.  I appreciate that.</P>
    <P>Under section 222 of the Companies Act a liquidator &mdash; and this happened in the case of Moracrete &mdash; can overrule all entitlements.  Despite the fact that a worker went before the Employment Appeals Tribunal or a rights commission and got a favourable hearing, that could be ruled out by the liquidator.  He could stymie him and force him to go to the High Court and the cost of the case could outweigh the benefit he might get.  The Bill should include some specific provision to stop that kind of blackguardism and kicking to touch by unscrupulous employers.  I ask the Minister to consider those points.</P>

      <P>Deputy Prendergast has made some very good points.  I welcome what the Minister said about the joint labour council proposals.  I presume he means legislation will be coming before <Col N="315" /> the House and we can debate it.  Part time work is the reason why the United States is thriving at the moment.  Perhaps it is not a concept we like but people are doing two and three jobs.  The United States is thriving and people are happy. We would all be happy if we only had the problem of cleaning contractors and we did not have 30,000 people unemployed. I would like to feel that there will be incentives for employers to employ people in any proposal the Minister brings forward.  We can get caught up in trying to cover and protect everybody. We badly need incentives for employers and entrepreneurs to take a few chances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me respond to some of the points raised.  I had forgotten an earlier intervention by Deputy Mac Giolla seeking an answer to a question which he had asked.  The only other country in the EC which has sought an exclusion for part time workers is the Netherlands.  In answer to Deputy Taylor, we cannot give a detailed estimate of the cost of the entire operation of the scheme.  We can make &ldquo;guesstimates&rdquo;, but we cannot be much surer than that.  We do not know the cost of extending the scheme to part time workers and I share very much Deputy Prendergast's view in relation to the need for extension to these workers.  We should recall what is happening, which was the thrust of Deputy Mac Giolla's last intervention.  A fund has been set up to cover the position of workers whose rights could be at risk as a result of employers, negligently, culpably or innocently, going into bankruptcy. That fund is being funded by the employer.  The employee is making no contribution, as is right and proper.  In this legislation we are requiring all employers to be made responsible for <Col N="316" /> either the failures, in bona fide economic terms, of some or the evasion of responsibilities of others.  Employers of part time workers under the 18 hours threshold do not pay full PRSI and will not be making a contribution to that fund.  The extension of the Deputy's argument is that he will be requesting employers to provide for a fund which would be to the benefit of some part time workers whose employers would not be contributing to the fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me go on to the second point.  It has frequently been said in this House &mdash; and it was the point which Deputy Ahern raised &mdash; that one could regard, in one sense from an economic point of view, PRSI as a tax on employment and the cost of PRSI contributions, not only from the employee but from the employer as well, as a labour unit cost that has to be paid for by the employer before wages are paid out.  If we increase that contribution, we are increasing the cost of labour to the employer and this argument that PRSI works against employment has been expressed by Deputy Ahern in another manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one supremely important weakness in that line of argument.  It is that one is then giving the unscrupulous employers who are employing the lower paid workers an unfair competitive advantage over the legitimate, bona fide employers, and I do not often defend employers.  Such as they are, they should be defended and prevented from exposure to the effects of the unscrupulous employers who are using the situation where they do not have to contribute to a fund.  In the building industry they are all expected to contribute to the CIF fund but some employers are not contributing and are using workers' entitlements to get in unfairly against bona fide employers.  We should watch that side of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I can add any more to what I have said.  We are <Col N="317" /> talking about the application of a specific insolvency fund to cover workers entitlements. There are many issues related to this which impinge upon it.  I recognise the validity of the argument in relation to extending protection to part time workers.  It would be my desire to do this. It is not coincidental that in France such protection extends to all categories of workers, but they have Socialist Government, similarly in West Germany where they have had the benefit of Social Democratic Governments for a long time.  That is the reality.</P>

      <P>Section 3 should be read in conjuction with section 10 which enables me, or any Minister for Labour to extend the protection of this legislation to further categories of employees.  I am not averse at all to what is being proposed by Deputy Prendergast and other Deputies.  I want to see what the implications of such legislation are, what the cost will be and the impact on other areas.  What the Deputies are raising is a much broader question of the application of worker protection legislation to part time workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. The Minister referred to it and I just want clarification of what he said.  Section 3 states &ldquo;subject to section 10 of this Act, this Act applies to employees...&rdquo; and so on.  We must refer to the possibilities under section 10 before we leave section 3.  Could the Minister clarify the point he made?  It is very important that we be aware whether he will include part time workers. This has been fairly well debated. The reasons are acceptable to the Minister and he understands them.  However, he seemed to want to postpone it until some legislation in regard to part time employees has been brought in.  That is very laudable and we would hope that such legislation will be brought in.  It is very important that it should be.  However, we should not wait until that legislation comes in.  Something else may happen and it may well not come in.  There may well be changes of Government or other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have this Act in front of us now, the whole purpose of which is to protect employees' wages in cases of insolvency. All that needs to be done is either to alter section 3 or in section 10 to have the Minister amend the section to extend the application of the Act to part time workers. All I am asking is that the Minister agree to do this under section 10 and we could allow section 3 to stand.  This section is fundamental to the whole Act. To whom does it apply?  As the number of part time workers has increased so rapidly in the last few years and will in the next couple of years, the Act would apply probably to only 50 per cent of the people unless this extension is included now.  It will be applying to fewer and <Col N="319" /> fewer as the years go on.  I ask the Minister if he would be prepared to accept &mdash; the amendment has not been put down in legal language &mdash; that other categories should be included.  I am asking if the Minister in section 10 will include part time workers specifically, as he is entitled to do under that section.  Then we could accept section 3.  Otherwise we cannot accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to amend section 3 as it stands.  I am prepared, within the framework of the enabling section 10, to look at the question of extending full protection to part time workers.  However, the definition of part time workers can vary from industry to industry, from sector to sector.  It is a very loose definition.  Quite frankly, I am not in a position at this stage to give a clear or firm undertaking that this would be extended within a given period of time to all part time workers.  It is my intention to move along that road but it would be unfair to go beyond saying that to the House at this stage.  There is specific provision in the Bill, and this was sought by me, to enable me, by regulation and without coming back to the House, to extend the provision to categories of workers by class or description.  That is in section 10 and it will enable me to make the regulation in the knowledge of all the consequences and to have it in the context of proper consultation between the social partners.  I should like to talk with the ICTU and the FUE as to how this legislation would affect their operations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (e), between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii) the date on which the receiver finally winds-up the company, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would like to return to the winding up arguments on this matter on Second Stage.  This section is one of the three most important in the Bill.  The Minister said that to get over the problem of some of these industries, particularly Kilrush Potteries, we should use the date on which the companies were wound up.  He spoke of the assets that would be left and the extra money required from the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few years many industries have gone to the wall either by actions brought in the courts or by voluntary action.  We argue that employees of such <Col N="321" /> industries would be entitled to something, some form of compensation.  We know that in future people will be covered in cases of liquidations from 22 October 1983.  That was the effect of a directive from the EC.  We have been arguing that in the case of companies which went into liquidation prior to 1983 and in which liquidators are still in operation the effective date should be the day of the final winding up.  There are substantial reserves in the fund to ensure that such people would be covered.</P>
    <P>Other sections in the Bill cover additional benefits.  There were many closures in 1983, a particularly bad year.  Many of these cases are still being dealt with by liquidators.  This amendment, and the one on pensions, are the two most important amendments proposed.  Some employees in industries in which the liquidators are still operating have suffered grave hardship.  If a person knows that on the date on which a liquidator finally winds up a company he can get some payment from the liquidator or from the courts he would be reassured to know he was covered by this Bill.  This amendment would cover many of the people who have been suffering undue hardship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the idea that we should be in harmony with the EC directive and extend this to the date of the EC directive which goes back to 20 October 1980.  Companies throughout the country have become involved in tragic situations and they would be covered by the appropriate EC directive. I do not know what prompted acceptance of 22 October 1983, which is three years from the date of the directive.</P>

I am glad that Deputies agree with the point of view expressed here that by making this amendment the Minister will tidy up the position of people who would not be covered.  On Second Stage I made this point in relation to a number of companies where employees would lose out because the legislation was not operative from 1 January 1983.  The Minister is using the last date set down in the directive. It is 22 October 1983.  He could quite easily go back to 1980.  We are not seeking that.  A later amendment seeks to bring the date back to 1 January, but this amendment is an effective way of dealing with some of the problems that will arise when the legislation has been passed.</P>
      <P>In his reply to Second Stage the Minister acknowledged that.  He said it would not affect the general principle involved. He put forward the argument that if we wait until the date of the final winding up there could be delays in making payments. It would be better to have delays in making payments rather than not be paid at all.  If the Minister accepts the amendment people who under existing law will not receive payment will have some prospect of being paid.  I hope the Minister accepts the amendment.  The amount involved is not significant.  It will be covered under the new fund.  From the limited figures the Minister gave us there is clear evidence that the fund will be well capable of meeting the demands on it.  In the meantime we are endeavouring to ensure that people will have a prospect of being paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to accept the amendment put down by Deputy Ahern.  Since the debate on Second Stage we have looked at the implication of moving the commencement date back to accommodate a difficulty in a particular constituency or region.  I understand the views expressed by Deputies.  There is a cost implication and perhaps we are being a little cautious in relation to the exercise of the discretion we have about the commencement date but we are being cautious with taxpayers' money and money which is scarce by any definition.  We do not know the level of insolvencies in the economy.  We know how many notified bankruptcies there are and so on.  It is impossible for us to calculate with any degree of certainty what the potential or estimated cost will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite have chosen two ways of achieving the same objective. One is a specific commencement date, 1 January 1983, and the other is winding up by the liquidator.  Deputy Ahern knows more about accountancy practice than I do and he will accept that there are many companies which are technically insolvent and have ceased trading but are not properly wound up by the liquidator or receiver.  There may be outstanding claims.  This legislation in terms of a claim against the company will have to be seen in the context of the Companies Act. <Col N="324" /> Compensation will be paid out of a fund which is taxpayers' money.  If we could refund workers going back five or six years, which could be the effect of this amendment, with taxpayers' money to which no contribution had been made by the employer or the employee, why could not a bona fides creditor who was getting 35p in the £ equally be refunded?</P>
    <P>We had to take a date.  We took it from the date of legal requirement, that is, 22 October 1983.  I know it does not go as far as some Deputies would like but it is a fixed point of reference to which there is a clear legal obligation.  If we move away from that point there will always be someone who will ask if it cannot be moved further or extended to cover a certain category.  I do not want to debate the relative merits of the two amendments but the other one has the benefit of being fixed in time.  This one is open.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have far more collective experience of administration of a Government Department than I have and will readily appreciate that there are limits in terms of what is administratively feasible.  One of those is determined by what can reasonably be anticipated or calculated for.  With the experience of the Department of Labour, the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Office of the Attorney General we have not been able to go further.  I indicated on Second Stage that we would look as sympathetically as possible at the points raised by Deputies.  The same Deputies were in the House then as now because of their concern with a company in Clare.  Having regard to the considerations and the anticipated cost, not what the request in relation to the specific concern in Clare would bring about but the other incalculable costs and the administrative implications, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  The reasons advanced earlier by Deputy Daly suggested the fund was in very good nick and well serviced.  Regrettably we still have substantial numbers of redundancies.  It would be misleading to think that the £12½ million is there for the purpose of insolvency.  We estimate that the total <Col N="325" /> amount of money we would have collected would be of the order of £500,000.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wishes I can get the figures in respect of Deputy Seán Barrett, Chief Whip.  His position continues as before with the use of an official State car full-time.  In the case of Deputy Nealon, Minister of State responsible for Arts and Culture, the total of the travelling expenses and payment to civilian drivers added up to approximately £36,000.  In the case of Deputy Nuala Fennell, the figure is £5,000.  These figures compare with an average annual official cost of providing official transport and drivers estimated at £77,000 per user in January-February 1983.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow me to answer the question.  The Deputy asked the question, let me answer it.  In respect of the two civilian drivers the total cost is £22,736.53.  Travel expenses paid to the Minister of State were £13,592.20.  The sum of the two added together is about £36,000 which is rather less than half the average cost per user previously.  In the case of Deputy Fennell, Minister of State responsible for Womens' Affairs, the sum of £5,042.08 was paid for travelling expenses and there was no payment of civilian drivers.  She makes very occasional use of the official car.  Again, that compares favourably with the £77,000 previously.  The Deputy will see <Col N="328" /> that the net economies involved are very substantial indeed, exceeding in the case of these two Ministers over £100,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that some counties have a huge backlog of applications while others do not?  In counties with a big backlog applicants may have to wait four or five years &mdash; in some cases ten years &mdash; before the road is repaired while in other counties where the list is very short it appears that overgenerous allocations are granted?  The time lag between the lodging of the application and the date when the repairs are carried out is a year or two.  In my experience in some counties some roads are left for up to six years.  Does the Minister know anything about the scheme?  He should not be depending on replies prepared by civil servants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of the opinion that that is a fair system of allocation? Is it fair to rely on the amount of the block grant?  There is a complete imbalance as far as the 12 western counties are concerned and I appeal to the Minister to examine that and relate the amount of the grants to the condition of the roads and the amount of economic activity taking place in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the block grant system is not the perfect guide it represents a rough one.  It is about the easiest and best way to make these allocations.  An allocation of a certain sum for county roads is a reasonable indication of the needs of that county.  It is reasonable to allocate additional funds on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as the Minister says, that is a reasonable way to allocate funds how can he explain an allocation under this scheme of £41,000 in 1981 to Leitrim and an allocation of £1.2 million to a southern county and £1.3 million to a western county?  The Minister should examine the figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reasonable way to allocate funds.  A block grant should <Col N="333" /> indicate the need within a county.  The allocations are made in a reasonably balanced manner.  I admit that at the start of the block grant system some counties were getting additional funds for miles of roads with the result that there may have been an imbalance.  However, counties are paid supplementary grants over and above the amount of the block grant, as the Deputy should be aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, we have the unique position of the Department allocating funds on some basis that does not relate to the actual need because account is not taken of the condition of the roads. Is it true that it can arise that in certain counties where the condition of the surface of county roads is deteriorating at a rapid rate because of the Department's irrelevant method of allocating funds, money will not be granted to meet the repair of those roads?  The result is that money is not allocated to areas where the greatest need exists.</P>

      <P>The report examines employment opportunities in the region in the three major sectors of the economy &mdash; agriculture, industry and services &mdash; and the adequacy of the social and physical infrastructure.

The national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> sets out the overall allocations for 1985 to 1987 for infrastructure, including roads, sanitary services and housing.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 18, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The questions put by the Deputy relate to some only of the recommendations made by the Tribunal of Inquiry on the fire at the Stardust.  All of the tribunal's recommendations are being taken into account in the ongoing development of the fire service which is being pressed ahead as rapidly and as comprehensively as possible.  As an example of this development I should point out that there has been almost a fourfold increase in the capital provision for the fire service in recent years and the Government have decided that further substantial increases will be made during the coming years.  I should mention also that there has been a significant increase in the approved staffing levels for fire prevention work by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to make a fundamental change in the nature of the existing and traditional relationship between the Minister and the fire authorities and it would not be appropriate therefore to establish an inspectorate of fire services as envisaged by the tribunal.  The Fire Services Council, which was established last year, will be of great help to me in discharging the traditional advisory and supervisory role of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The council have been given a wide range of functions including the question of recommendations on the arrangements for specialised educational courses for fire service personnel and for courses in fire safety engineering, the need for which is accepted.  Considerable discussions had taken place between my Department and the local authorities, the Department of Education, the National Council for Educational Awards, third level institutions, and appropriate staff interests in the period prior to setting up the Fire Services Council.  Taking account of this work the council have been actively considering the matter and I hope to have their report in the early part of next year.  In the meantime some fire safety engineering courses have already been provided by third level institutions and others are planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> The question of education cannot be divorced from training of fire service personnel and the provision of training facilities at local, regional and national level. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in providing local and regional training facilities and in the provision of training courses.  In addition to local training arrangements the Fire Services Council are organising 15 central training courses this year, making use of training facilities and expertise in this country, in Scotland, England and Denmark. A further 20 central training courses are planned for next year.  The experience gained will be of great assistance to the council in their consideration of the need and possible arrangements for a national training centre.  The council have commissioned and received a report from a consultant which should be of value in their consideration of the need for central training facilities.</P>
    <P>Management regulations under section 37 of the Fire Services Act, 1981, which it is envisaged will eventually replace public resort by-laws, are at present being drafted by my Department, initially in respect of places of public assembly.  A discussion document outlining the proposed approach and indicating the standards it was proposed to adopt was widely circulated by my Department for comments in August 1983.  The response to the document was generally favourable and, together with the comments received, it will form the basis for a code of practice for fire safety in places of public assembly which I have asked the Fire Services Council to prepare.  The draft regulations and code, which are well advanced, will be circulated to interested parties for views before being brought into operation.  The Building Control Bill, which is at present before the Dáil, provides for the issue by the fire authority of a fire safety certificate approving the design of a building in so far as the fire aspects of the building regulations are concerned.</P>
    <P>On the question of local authority powers with regard to fire safety and offences, the Fire Services Act, 1981, contains a wide range of powers for fire <Col N="342" /> authorities to deal with fire safety in buildings, including the issue of a fire safety notice prohibiting the use of a building or part of it for any specified purpose, or prohibiting the use of a building until specified precautions have been taken.  In particularly serious cases the fire authority can apply to the High Court under section 23 of the Fire Services Act for an order restricting or prohibiting the use of a building.  The proposed management regulations, to which I have already referred, will include a requirement that exits be maintained unlocked and unobstructed during use.  A breach of this, or any other of the regulations, will be punishable by a maximum fine of £10,000 and/or two years' imprisonment.  The effectiveness of the legislation is being kept under continuous review and I will not hesitate to introduce amending legislation if such is necessary.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the preparation of plans for a new central control room at Tara Street and the drafting of the specification for the new communications equipment, including computers, to be installed there should be completed shortly by Dublin Corporation.  Significant progress has been made by the local authority on the preparation of the data-base information for the computer system and on improving existing control and call-out facilities and arrangements.</P>

      <P>I must express my disappointment at the Minister's decision to lump all these questions into one reply. The nine questions refer to specific recommendations made by the Stardust Tribunal.  In relation to Question No. 9, what specific powers have local authorities to require the immediate closure of a building which they consider to be a fire hazard?  Would he not agree that section 37 of the Fire Services Act does not give them the power to require immediate closure because a person who receives such an order can within 14 days appeal and there is no knowing how long an appeal may take?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fire Services Act <Col N="343" /> contains a very wide range of powers to deal with the fire safety of buildings.  A notice prohibiting the use of a building or part of a building can be issued.  I admit that the person who receives such a notice has 14 days in which to appeal.  That is reasonable.  If a person's business is being affected he should have some rights as well as some obligations.  Where the local authority are satisfied that there is a danger they can go to the High Court and have the building closed.  Independently of the normal action they can take through the District Court, if they are satisfied that there is imminent danger they can go to the High Court for a decision on what to do.  There is immediate machinery for closing a building.</P>

The management regulations should be available early in 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The code of practice being drafted will cover only new buildings.  Existing buildings present much greater problems in the preparation of a code of practice.  There will be a method of trade off between the different aspects of fire safety and there will be a decision regarding the lead-in times for complying with the proposed standards. In relation to older buildings one must give people time to have the necessary works carried out.  This will be done, ensuring that an overall fire safety consideration will be maintained.  It cannot be operated overnight in regard to old buildings and will have to be brought in on a slower basis.  The fire authorities will do that.</P>

The penalty for a conviction under section 18 is two years in jail and/or a £10,000 fine.  As I indicated in my reply, if the existing legislation is found to be inadequate we will have a look at it again.

      <P>The Minister indicated in his reply that he was satisfied that the Fire Services Act at the moment allows for the prosecution of persons responsible for not ensuring the maintenance of unobstructed exits and so forth. The Stardust Tribunal in paragraph 9.170 indicated quite clearly that they were not satisfied that the Fire Services Act provided for that.  They specifically requested an amendment to that Act requiring that management be made liable for situations where exits were obstructed or not maintained in an <Col N="351" /> unlocked condition.  Could the Minister indicate why he is claiming that the Act does allow for this, while the Stardust Tribunal specifically state that it does not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together. The making of a special amenity area order is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the elected members of the planning authority and their advisers, having regard to the provisions of the Planning Acts, the development plan and <Col N="354" /> the proper planning and development of the area.  I understand that preliminary work in relation to a possible order for the Liffey valley area is being carried out by Dublin County Council.  In these circumstances it would be quite inappropriate for me to take direct action in a matter which is usually and properly within the competence of the elected council.</P>

That specific section was incorporated into the planning legislation by a predecessor of the Minister in the Coalition Government of 1973 to 1978.  As that section is there and the Minister has a direct responsibility when an area of natural beauty has been despoiled by the dumping of rubbish, what action is he going to take about an area with a population of over a quarter of a million?</P>

Does the Minister know that £650,000 was spent on acquiring 50 acres for this dump but that the 250,000 residents of the area are concerned that the dump will be in existence for perhaps 100 years?  Would the Minister consider making a special amenity order which would give some opportunity to officials of the county council and to the people concerned to prevent the dump going ahead?

Dublin County Council are examining the question of making a special amenity order for the Liffey valley area.  The making of such an order is the function of elected members.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have much more to add to what I was saying before we adjourned for lunch in regard to the amendment in the name of Deputy Ahern which essentially is an attempt to make this legislation retrospective to beyond 22 October 1983.  We have had to take a point in time which involved a degree of objectivity because we had to make some attempt at measuring the cost implications and to work back from that to establish what the level of contribution would be in order to fund that portion of what is known now as the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund.  On that basis we have made a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have thought long and hard about what was requested on Second Stage by Deputy Daly and by Deputy Taylor-Quinn and her colleague, Deputy Carey, in relation to a particular industry in their constituency.  I understand their direct <Col N="388" /> concern in that regard.  Deputy Daly will be aware that I met the representatives concerned in Ennis in the run up to the European elections in June and discussed the position with them.  It is not that we are being specific about some industry or group of industries but we cannot extend beyond the point of 22 October 1983 because of the volume of liquidations and redundancies that have occured in the recent past &mdash; and they are the official ones.  The definition of insolvency would extend to a wider category of companies than those who have simply gone into formal liquidation from the point of view of possible claims that might be lodged against the assets of the fund.  Last year 280 companies went into liquidation. That gives an idea of the scale of what we could be unleashing by accepting the amendment.</P>
    <P>We have tried to confine the cost of the fund to the minimum so as not to increase the cost of employment while at the same time we have tried to go back as far as possible.  There is the other element of the question of administration and of complexity in verifying documents and so on.  For all of those reasons I am not in a position to accept the amendment nor could I accept any consequential or related amendment that would extend the date beyond 22 October 1983.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We disagree with that. However, the point we are making is that many firms were would up in the courts or by voluntary liquidation.  The actions have been going on for a year or two and at the outset the workers may have thought they would get something from the liquidators, at least their entitlements at the time of the winding up when the liquidator would know what finance was there.  The case is made more important by the number of redundancies in 1983 and 1984 and possibly in 1982.  It is important that the Minister would allow <Col N="389" /> the date to be that on which the liquidation is completed.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us what the difference in cost would be if he allowed what the Deputies on this side have been asking for?  What would the workers be entitled to under the Companies Act and under this Bill?  The difference cannot be very substantial.  The explanatory memorandum on section 4 states:</P>
      <P>The section (subsection (2) also enables the Minister to specify by regulations (a) the circumstances in which employers who are of a class or description specified in the regulations are to be taken to have become insolvent and (b) what officer (if any) is, for the purposes of section 5 or 6, required to be appointed in connection with such an employer's insolvency.  This provision is necessary to cover possible situations which might arise in cases where no formal winding up or bankruptcy proceedings are initiated.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister give an example of how this would work?  What will the position be when there has not been any formal winding up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's reasons for not making it retrospective.  He bases his argument on his inability to assess the cost.  I am asking him to consider not only the pride of the workers but the lack of compensation to them for work done.  For example, in the Kilrush plant many of them had given 20 years of their lives.  He says he has gone back as far as he can.  He has not gone back any further than the EC directive directed.  I find this very difficult to accept and I ask him to think of the workers, particularly the many in west Clare who have no alternative to unemployment. He should seriously consider putting the date back at least to January 1983 and possibly to 20 October 1980, the date of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in trying to fix a date but our amendment tries to facilitate him.  The Minister would have power to tie it down <Col N="390" /> to a number of companies in which problems have arisen.  I do not accept that the Minister does not know precisely how many workers or companies are involved, and the cost.  The Minister said that 280 companies went into liquidation but in the vast majority of those the problem we are dealing with here may not arise because many of the outstanding liabilities would have been cleared up.</P>
      <P>Kilrush Potteries was not an ordinary company because it was supported by and funded by Fóir Teoranta.  The claim of the employees was heard by the appeals tribunal.  The Minister knows they were not spurious claims made by all sorts of people.  The amounts due to the 87 workers were certified by the tribunal.  Some of them were for only £40 or £50 and the total for the entire company is £29,000. The amounts may be small but are important and significant to the people who have lost their jobs without prospect of re-employment.  The plant and machinery have been sold and the skilled employees are signing on for social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>The Minister surely must have consideration for the fact that the company was mainly funded by a State agency and that the case came before the appeals tribunal.  He has heard Government Deputies urging him to make this retrospective. If he does not want to take our word for it he should listen to the Government Deputies who are urging him to make this minor alteration.  I do not believe he can produce figures which would demonstrate clearly that it cannot be done or that it is not within the capacity of the fund to carry that kind of payment.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept the amendment. If he thinks it is openended we could tighten it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was in my power to resolve the problem in relation to Kilrush and to settle, as Deputy Daly said in support of Deputy Taylor-Quinn, the outstanding amounts, I would have no problem whatever in doing so.  However, this House in making laws must have regard to the equity with which those laws <Col N="391" /> will be applied to every citizen.  Perhaps it is a reflection on the administration of our affairs and the inaccuracy or lack of statistics, but if I did what the two Deputies would like me to do I do not know what the downstream consequences would be.  I have no doubts as to the validity of the case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Daly is a former Minister of State at this Department and he has an intimate knowledge of the working of the Department.  He has indicated that by his understanding of the constraints that operate at present.  If I acceded to their request I do not know what we would be letting ourselves in for in money terms. If we under-fund the fund, that will have a negative effect; and if we over-fund it, we could put an extra charge on employment in net economic terms, irrespective of the point of view from which one argues that position.  I am trying to balance that against the merits of the case. Any Deputy representing an area like Kilrush has a particular difficulty.  Deputy Daly referred to Kilrush Pottery as a State company but it is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to go into that apsect but Fóir Teoranta treated the workers with very little respect from day one and the Minister knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This raises the question of the reform of company law and the use of taxpayers' money.  These difficulties would not have arisen if there had been worker control and participation in the enterprise since, as the Deputy asserts, there was State money in it.  However, that is no consolation to the workers.  I should like to be more helpful in my response to both Deputies but I cannot be.  I have looked on this as sympathetically as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ahern referred to the question <Col N="392" /> of workers not claiming their rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> this legislation in companies which did not go into formal liqudiation. They knew they had no claim to make as there was no one against whom they could make a claim.  There was no receiver, liquidator or legal entity against whom to lodge a claim for arrears of pay. All we are talking about is arrears of pay, holiday money, sick benefit and related entitlements.  We do not know, because we do not have statistics of a sufficiently accurate nature, what the volume is but we know that many people are affected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern asked what was the administrative procedure for investigation in the event of an employee finding that his employer had literally left the country.  The procedure would be along the following lines: an employee who finds that his employer has disappeared without paying back money and so on would go to the Department of Labour or his trade union or to a solicitor or public representative.  In other words, he would seek help preferably through the trade union because that is the proper body through which to make this kind of representation.  The trade union representative would assess the case and then make a claim to the Department. The Department, through its inspectorate, would make an investigation and on foot of that would make a recommendation to the Minister.  If the Minister was convinced by the evidence that it was a case of insolvency he or she would pay the money to which the employee was entitled out of the fund.  If possible the Minister would try to recoup the money from the missing employer or else write off the loss.</P>
    <P>The timing in relation to it is that any insolvency which occurs after 22 October, either formally as in the two cases the Deputy identified or informally, will be covered.  If representations are made to the effect that an employer disappeared on 29 October and the workers had no redress the Department would proceed from that basis provided the necessary documentation was brought forward.  I pay tribute to the Department <Col N="393" /> of Labour and the officials of the redundancy section who, though small in number, manage to process a large number of claims each year.  In addition to that &mdash; Deputy Daly has had experience of this &mdash; they handle telephone queries from recipients or potential recipients, public representatives and so on. The public know that on balance they get the benefit of the doubt where such discretion exists.  That is my orientation and will continue to be.</P>
    <P>The question of what the cost would be if this was made retrospective was also raised.  As I understand it, Deputy Daly suggested that if I was not too happy with the implications of the wording of the amendment they would allow me on Report Stage to amend the wording provided that the sense and intent of it could be accommodated.  I am afraid I cannot accommodate the Deputy.  As the Deputy points out, there has been great pressure from the transport union, from Patricia McCarthy in Clare, from Deputies on the Government side plus the Deputy himself on this point.  It is not that we have turned our face against resolving the problem in Kilrush.  The workers in Kilrush have been extremely well represented in this regard by all their public representatives.  We simply cannot live with the consequences of what the Kilrush decision would open up in other spheres.  One reason that we cannot live with the consequences is that we do not know the full extent of it.  If I could say that we know for a fact that if we go back to that date &mdash; 1 January 1983 which will cover Kilrush &mdash; it would cost so much money and that has a reflection of so much, then we could make a rational decision as to whether we could live with that amount of money.  Both sides of this House have shared in the administration of this country now and I am not making party points on this.  We do not know, and because we do not know and because of the overall position of public finances we are not in a position to do what otherwise I would like to do.</P>
    <P>I have gone as far as I can to meet the <Col N="394" /> sense and the sentiment of this amendment and I cannot add anything further to what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unsatisfactory. Because we do not know the implications of something we do here for five or six months we are going to deprive people who have genuine and well documented cases of their right to get amounts of money, very small in some cases, due to them.  My argument with the Minister is that because he does not know probably he is foreseeing consequences in this legislation which may not arise at all.  If he knew then probably he would agree to make this change because he would see that it is not likely to be the major significant cost that he appears to be afraid of.  I can understand the Minister being worried about downstream consequences of this or any legislation.  We need to avoid downstream consequences that we do not want to have, and this is why we are suggesting that between now and Report Stage the Minister could look at even a tightened up version of what we are putting forward in this amendment, or some amendment which will avoid undesirable downstream consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Downstream consequences exist in all legislation and they cannot be foreseen when the legislation is being debated here in the House.  Various legislation that has gone through here every year had downstream consequences that were not anticipated when the legislation was brought in.  All you can do in that situation is come back afterwards and try to rectify it.  We can avoid that if the Minister has the type of information we are looking for.  Even if he were to put it back for a further year I do not think that the amount of money involved would be very significant.  He gave figures earlier today in relation to minimum notice payments. If I recollect rightly, the figure is £155,000 per year for the amount claimed on minimum notice.  That is a very small amount of money.  I appreciate the fact that people had not a fund from which to claim.  Claims would have come in had a fund been there.  In most companies, <Col N="395" /> even those that were in liquidation in 1983, items like minimum notice and holiday pay would have been catered for and only in a very small percentage of cases would this arise.  The Minister cannot argue this with me because he does not know.</P>
    <P>Even at this stage we will hold off the amendment in the event of the Minister giving some undertaking that he will look at a tightened up version of it which could be brought in on Report Stage, even though I do not like putting it off.  We have been putting it off here from day to day.</P>
    <P>I got the impression on Second Stage that the Minister had accepted in principle that what we were arguing was right if he could be reasonably satisfied that it was not going to cost a great deal of money and that it was within the limit of the fund to carry that amount.</P>
    <P>Finally, I appeal to the Minister, who I know recognises the case we are making, to try between now and Report Stage to identify precisely what it will cost.  I do not think that the amount of money will be at all significant or that it will put any strain on the fund.  The fund will more than carry the numbers we are talking about.  We are not asking them to go back over two or three years.  We are asking to go back to about 1 January or even 1 April.  The Minister cannot argue with us when he does not know the true position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's approach on this.  The basic reason behind his approach is ignorance of the cost.  Like Deputy Daly, I ask him now to examine seriously the cost question.  If he does so maybe he will find that it is not half as expensive as he seems to feel it is at the moment.  On a national basis maybe he will find that it is less than £500,000.  In the Kilrush case we are talking about something in the region of £30,000 and up to 100 workers.  Therefore, the situation may not be as serious or the amount of money as large as the Minister anticipates.  Between now and Report Stage the Department could do <Col N="396" /> very good work in making a serious assessment of the cost, on a national basis, of changing the date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One could not but have sympathy with the amendment proposed by Deputy Ahern, but it is really misconceived and meaningless as it stands.  The amendment talks about the date on which the receiver finally winds up the company. As I understand it, receivers do not wind up companies; liquidators wind up companies.  I presume that the amendment is intended to say &ldquo;the date on which the liquidator winds up the company&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister clarify one point for me?  As I read section 4 it seems contrary to the terms of the directive.  I understand that we are bound by the directive which says that the employer shall be deemed to be in a state of insolvency and a request has been made for the opening up of proceedings involving the employer's assets.  If that means anything it means the commencement of the proceedings involving the employer's assets, whereas the section appears to deal with the matter of giving the date as the date of the conclusion of the proceedings. In other words, in the case of a bankruptcy situation it is the date of the adjudication of the bankruptcy.  That is the concluding item in the proceedings, where as the Directive requires it to be the date of the opening of the proceedings. Could that point be clarified?</P>

      <P>The answer is that we do not.  Suppose we were to give in to a claim of £15,000, for example, in relation to Kilrush, which would not be covered by this amendment because the receiver has not concluded.  That is a debating point, although I understand the spirit of what <Col N="397" /> the Deputy is offering.  We have gone into it and there was a request to see if we could calculate it between now and Report Stage.  We have been trying to do it for some time.  The officials have done sterling work in this whole area.  I am not in a position to get any net information between now and Report Stage in addition to what we have had over the last few months.

    <P>That amendment stands on its own.  I should like to respond briefly to the point made by Deputy Taylor, whether we are in line with article 2 of the Directive.  For the purposes of domestic legislation we have had to describe different kinds of insolvency &mdash; of which, obviously, bankruptcy is one &mdash; but the effective commencement date as far as a worker is concerned is the date on which proceedings were commenced, using the phrase in the directive.  In this instance in article 4.1 (b), where the employer petitions for an arrangement, it would indicate <Col N="398" /> effectively the commencement.  The legal retranslation is that where a request for a liquidator is sought by the shareholders of the company, where a debenture holder puts in either a liquidator or a receiver or where there is a voluntary liquidator in one shape or form, or alternatively in the case of a debt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If there is an instant bankruptcy, although that is most unrealistic, or if between a Friday and a Monday a company is declared bankrupt.  From his legal knowledge I am sure the Deputy is aware that that cannot be the case, although it is technically possible.</P>

      <P>Section 4 attempts to describe in legal terms the various ways an individual as an employer or a company as an employer can be declared insolvent.  That is the reason there are six definitions of different forms of insolvency. The Deputy has asked me when it becomes effective from the point of view of triggering off the protection for workers.  The six provisions are effective when the proceedings commence rather than when they are completed.  A worker will not have to wait two or three years for the process to be completed before receiving his or her entitlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>5.&mdash;(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by virtue of section 1 (3) (d) of this Act, an employer becomes insolvent for the purposes of this Act, or</P>
      <P>(b)  an employer otherwise becomes insolvent for such purposes and there is not for the time being in relation to the insolvency a relevant officer,</P>
      <P>the Minister may appoint as regards such insolvency a person under this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where the Minister makes an <Col N="401" /> appointment under this section the following provisions shall apply:</P>
    <P>(a)  the functions assigned by this Act to a relevant officer shall, as regards the employer concerned, be performed by, and only by, the person to whom the appointment relates, or if through illness or because his appointment is revoked or for any other reason the person so appointed is unable to perform such functions, another person so appointed, and</P>
    <P>(b)  for so long as the appointment remains in force, each of the references to a relevant officer in sections 5, 6 and 7 of this Act shall be construed as including a reference to the person to whom the appointment relates.</P>
    <P>We reckon that the new section technically is drafted better than the original one.  It enables the Minister to appoint a person in circumstances where an employer becomes insolvent by virtue of regulations made by the Minister under the powers conferred on him by section 4 (2); or where an employer otherwise becomes insolvent and there is not for the time being in relation to the insolvency any relevant officer.  The new section 5 also provides that any references in the Bill to a relevant officer will include a reference to a person appointed under this section.  They are the consequential amendments referred to by the Chair.</P>

      <P>The criteria will be for the relevant officer to satisfy himself that the worker had been employed by the employer, that the employer had been making PRSI contributions or was legally obliged to do so, and that the person concerned had worked for the employer and was due arrears of money for wages, holiday money or sick pay benefit.  From his experience the Deputy can imagine what the administrative procedures will be.  It will be necessary to produce evidence of having worked for the employer and that the money was due.</P>

      <P>If the Minister appoints the liquidator of a company where a company has become insolvent for the purposes of the legislation, does he proceed to liquidate the company?  Is he a limited liquidator whose duties are confined to determining the position of a worker? What are the implications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not really.  Where a company has an orthodox liquidation and a liquidator or receiver is appointed, there is a relevant officer to whom a claim can be made.  Where a company effectively disappears and there is no relevant officer to administer the residual affairs of that <Col N="403" /> company, the worker in question has nobody to refer to.  In that instance the Minister for Labour would have the power to appoint a relevant officer solely for the purpose of this legislation, not for any other aspect of company law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I wanted to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely to have someone to whom the workers can say: I have a claim for arrears of money; this is my documentation here are the facts; now please make a recommendation.  The relevant officer, who would be an official of the Department of Labour, would adjudicate, make a recommendation which would be decided upon by the Minister for Labour and payment would issue. That would arise simply where there was no receiver or liquidator.</P>
      <P>Following the Second Stage debate when we read this section we saw there was this potential gap.  To whom would a worker go?  We decided somebody would have to make the decision and have the authority.  That is the thinking behind this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that that seems to be the type of amendment which will get over the problems we were talking about this morning.  Obviously the Minister has a great deal of knowledge about the new company law legislation.  Will this fit in with that new legislation?  Will there be a section in the new company law legislation which would bring that power back under company law and do away with the relevant officer?  This legislation will be in operation six months before we discuss the new powers of the company law &mdash; three Bills which will deal with fly-by-night companies.  Is this section in line with the legislation drafted 12 months ago but which we have not yet seen?  Will the powers under the new <Col N="404" /> company legislation stay with the relevant officer in the Department of Labour?  What will happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Without prejudice to the final form that company legislation might take either as a result of amendments in this House or by finalisation within the Government Departments, I will make the following observations.  This legislation has been drawn up in very close consultation with the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. There is a harmonisation of approach here.  We are concerned exclusively with the protection of workers' rights.  So far as that impinges on the application of reformed company law, this format will prevail for the exercise of workers rights under the directive for insolvency and, by extension, for redundancy payments and so on.  As to whether the concept of putting in a relevant officer to administer the affairs of the company whose directors absconded in the night, I cannot say at this point.  The Deputy can take it that this is in harmony with company law as it will emerge for the purposes of the administration of the insolvency legislation.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), lines 12 and 13, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  the date on which the employer became insolvent was not earlier than the 1st day of January, 1983, and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go over all the arguments I have already made &mdash; I think we were talking more about Kilrush Potteries the last day than all the other firms in the country. Because of the number of liquidations which have taken place in recent years Fianna Fáil feel that 1983 was probably the worst year in the history of the State. The number of liquidations seem to have <Col N="405" /> levelled off somewhat now, but this legislation will not take into account the companies that closed between January and October 1983.  The point was made by the Minister, and I do not want to labour it, that our first amendment did not have a date or a ceiling.  We believe that including the ten month period will benefit thousands of workers who were deprived of what should have been statutory payments under various Acts &mdash; the Anti-Discrimination Act, the Minimum Notice Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Employment Equality Act and all the other labour legislation.  The biggest feature will probably be salaries and they will not amount to very much.  As the Minister said, we will not get employees working for longer than a week if they are not being paid.</P>
    <P>It became clear this morning that the redundancy fund is in a healthy state, it is fairly flush, and could carry the payments due to thousands of workers.  It would follow the very excellent provisions of this Bill if those workers were covered whose firms went into liquidation between January and October 1983. Maybe the Minister would go even part of the way to meet us.  Finance would be the only thing which might rule this out, but in section 2 it is proved conclusively that there is sufficient in the redundancy and insolvency fund to meet this charge.</P>
    <P>The Minister picked the date of the EC Directive but we are asking him to go back ten months to cover the people who were made redundant between January and October 1983.  These people lost their holiday pay, sick pay, pension contributions and so on.  They are still on the dole and are among the long term unemployed. They are still suffering and if this money was provided it would alleviate the hardship they are suffering.  Again I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing further to add to the arguments I made on the previous amendment.  I would only be taking up the time of the House if I went over them yet again.  We estimate that the total cost in one year will be £1 million. <Col N="406" /> To include the ten month period mentioned by the Deputy would mean a further £800,000 or £850,000.  The points I have made already stand and regrettably I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest figures say there is £12 million in the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear about this. There is £12.65 million in the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund.  This money is not exclusively for insolvency claims; it is for redundancy claims as well. Because of the way the Irish economy is performing, we are still running a very heavy level of redundancy claims and the bulk of that fund is being used for pay-related redundancy claims.  It is not fair to give the impression that there is a fund of £12.5 million out of which moneys due to any particular category of worker could easily be paid without doing damage to the fund.  It is a redundancy and insolvency fund and, regrettably, it has to carry a very heavy load.  There is not a large amount of money available considering the volume of demand and we anticipate that to service this legislation we need approximately £1 million a year.  If we put it back by ten months there would be a net addition of £850,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be correct to say that the increase of 0.49 per cent in the employer's contribution which came into effect in April for this financial year would give the fund an extra £1 million? This Bill should have passed through the House prior to the summer recess and the money collected is still in the fund. Presumably part of it will not be claimed in the future.  This morning we had no idea how many claims there would be on this fund.  There does not seem to be a public awareness of it but I am sure this will change when the Department of Labour advertise it.  There must be some benefit from the money collected over the past ten months.  Surely there must be interest on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="407" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In theory there would be an interest payment on £500,000 approximately. These are round figures and I should like the House to treat them as such if they should be subsequently quoted.  Claims are being lodged and processed but we have not paid out any entitlements. There has been a delay in getting the legislation through the House, although I would not attribute any responsibility to the Opposition.  On the contrary, they have been extremely cooperative in this regard.  The delay has been caused by pressure of business. There are claims outstanding which are being processed.  There are no spare resources.  If there were, there would be nobody more willing than I to go back over the period in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the sum required to put back the provision by ten months?  Is is £1 million or £750,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would certainly be of that order.  This has been funded only since April 1984 and it would be retrospective to 22 October 1983.  A half year of claims has not been funded by net additional contributions.  We are now being asked to double that and we are not in a position to do so.  It is in no way a reflection on the civil servants that this is the best guesstimate we have of statistics. If we knew more about what was happening we could perhaps be more risk-taking in terms of trying to meet some of these claims.  There were 280 liquidations this year and regrettably there are still large numbers of redundancies and it is against that background that we cannot contemplate this proposal.  We know what has been so articulately presented but when one opens the door and sets back the date in one case one opens the door to all the others.  I regret that I cannot go any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. To some extent the Minister has opened the door already in setting the date in October 1983, even though the fund did not begin to accumulate until April 1984. He has taken a backward step in that <Col N="408" /> the legislation applies to a period when receipts were not coming in.  Our point is that because of the exceptional circumstances during the whole of 1983 there is a need to go further.</P>
      <P>We have taken the case of the Kilrush plant which is well documented since it went before the appeals tribunal for examination.  The figure works out at an average of £250 per worker.  Some would get more but in other cases the amounts would be very small, probably £40 or £50. We will not go back over the argument. Some of the support we had earlier for our case seems to have evaporated. Deputy Taylor-Quinn and Deputy Carey seemed to have abandoned us at this crucial stage just before the vote on the issue.</P>
      <P>It has been clearly shown that the amounts which would become payable are not significant.  The figure of £750,000 for the ten month period would be the very maximum.  In some cases where companies have gone into liquidation these payments would not be due because they would have been paid before the companies folded up.</P>
      <P>There were exceptional circumstances in Kilrush.  The workers were led to believe that they were getting early holidays and they did not discover until the plant failed to reopen that they had been fooled by this company, one of whose directors represented Fóir Teoranta on behalf of the State.  It was a disgraceful way for a State agency to behave.  We expect something better from State agencies than the shabby treatment that was meted out to workers in Kilrush Potteries. We are pressing this issue because it involves genuine hardship for many people who have not gained re-employment. The amount of money involved is not significant &mdash; well below £1 million. We would be happy if the Minister would agree to put back the date to 1 April 1983.  The Minister seems to be adamant that he will not change the date from 22 October because he is not too clear of the implications of putting back the date. He is basing his decision on a very shaky foundation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept at least that the majority of people who became unemployed through the liquidation of firms between January and October 1983 would be on the long term unemployment list and therefore among those who are suffering the most hardship?  That fact must be taken into account.  The amount which would be payable to any individual would not be substantial.  We have calculated from our information that in some cases it would be only £100 individually.  I know that figure is of no interest to the Minister because his Department must look at the cumulative amount.  Would he accept that these are people who have suffered most in the recession, those to whom even £100 or £200 would be of great significance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that on an individual basis these people are in some cases the most vulnerable and the most battered.  However, we must operate within the terms of reference.  One could speculate as to why this legislation was not introduced earlier.  There were changes of Government and times when the House was not in session.  Priorities may have been elsewhere.  This legislation is coming in later in this State than in the other EC countries.  In the business section of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 5 October figures were given for receiverships in Irish companies.  These were the above board ones, so to speak, leaving aside the ones we do not hear about but on whom this legislation will have an effect.  That is part of the unkown factor governing my refusal to accept this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1982 the figure for receiverships was 98 and for liquidations it was 626.  The overall pattern is relatively positive, although that is not much consolation to those who lose their jobs.  I gave the figure for 1982 to show the scale of the increase.  If there was an increase in official liquidations and receiverships, <Col N="410" /> one must presume there was some parallel increase in the economic performance of companies which simply walked away. The datum line is 1982 and I am giving it because I am trying to be helpful.  In 1983 receiverships went from 98 to 207 and liquidations went from 626 to 475.  The figures for 1984 are 94 receiverships and 324 liquidations.  We are not just talking about the Kilrush Potteries.  I know the Deputy has to have regard to his own constituency.  If I were to meet the Deputy's requirements it would have implications of that order.  That is the official order.  It could extend away beyond that. For that reason I cannot go any further.</P>

I am not trying to undermine the validity of what the Deputy is saying. I can only account for what we are doing now.  There are constraints on us.  I looked long and hard at the Deputy's request and I cannot go any further than 22 October 1983.  I am sorry.</P>

      <P>Many people are suffering hardship and are anxious to get their payments. It is unfortunate that the Minister is not in a position to estimate what it is likely to cost and, for that reason, is reluctant to provide the cover needed. We feel the cost would be far less than the Minister thinks.  Many companies who <Col N="412" /> went into receivership or liquidation in the period we are talking about would not be liable for this payment to their employees.  We are prepared to agree to 1 April if that helps the Minister.  We are probably talking about less than £500,000.  Because of the hardship and the difficulties many people have experienced, we feel the Minister should go even part of the way to meet us.  We would expect some support from his colleagues in the Labour Party.</P>

The point has been made very well by my colleague that this Government have been in office for two years only.  The relevant EC directive has been there since 1980.  My colleagues on the other side of the House are very generous.  It is very easy to be decent at the town pump.  I do not object to the principle, but they had two years in which to introduce it and they did not.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of the principle.  I deal with workers.  That is my life.  I asked the Minister to go back the whole way.  If we are going back at all we should go back to the two years when the Fianna Fáil Government did not introduce it.  If you introduce a cut-off point the people who are involved the day before want to know why you did not go back another month and cover them.  Do not let us start to go down that boreen.</P>

      <P>I suppose I could argue that if we had been in office after 1982 we would have done all sorts of things. We are pressing this amendment.  We do not really know what it will cost, but it appears to us that the redundancy fund could carry the ten months we are talking about for people who are more than likely still unemployed and form part of the long term unemployment list.  It would be of great advantage to them.  It would <Col N="413" /> involve a small amount for the individual and would not be that much of a burden on the fund.  Contributions have been made to the fund.  The 49 per cent contribution from the PRSI must have been based on something.  There must have been an estimate of what it would cost. It seems to be a fairly flush fund so perhaps we could go back over the ten months to 1 January 1983 for the benefit of these people.</P>

      <P>The point about the cost is crucial.  From the Minister's reply it appears that he would like to go back to the date mentioned or even further, but he could not carry the cost. The Minister also said he has no idea of what the cost would be.  I am surprised that he has not been able to quantify it in some way.  He gave us a list of liquidations and receiverships in 1982, 1983 and 1984.  He must know how many employees were involved.  It appears to me from the subsequent sections of the Bill that the maximum any one person could get would be £1,688.  I am sure that the average would be much less than that. That would be using the maxima of eight weeks and of £211 per week.  Surely the Minister can make a quantification of the cost of bringing this back another six or eight months, or even a year.  From the figures already at his disposal that should not be difficult.</P>

If I may respond to the last point raised by Deputy Mac Giolla, I would be doing a great injustice to the civil servants in the Department of Labour, who have worked long and hard on this matter, if I gave the impression that I have no idea of the cost.  Let me correct that impression, if I gave it.  We have no idea of the full cost.  We estimate that it would be at least £1 million and we have made provision for that sum.  It could be more, having regard to what an estimate manifestly represents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Working retrospectively back from that, it could be anything between £800,000 and £500,000.  The problem is that I quoted statistics from Colm Rapple's article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 5 October which are in relation to filed liquidations.  The House has already today spent some time talking about what action can be taken with those companies which do not go into any kind of official liquidation or receivership and whose employees, under this legislation, will now have protection.  They have never presented themselves for statistics to any office.  We have not the slightest idea of how many there might be.  They are all covered from 20 October 1983 and would become entitled to payment if they have a claim, once this legislation is enacted.  We have used all the available figures and statistics.  We are putting a qualification on the conclusions which we are drawing from them, which is that we are unhappy with the spread and range of the statistics and whether they cover sufficient ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another way in which we could deal with this matter.  We could treble the amount of the contribution and take an extremely cautious amount.  The cost implications in terms of PRSI payment for an employer would be enormous, relative to the tax on the pay roll, which is what it amounts to.  That has a downstream displacement cost, or effect, on employment within our economy.  We are trying to balance that against the other. To redress an impression that I may have given, we do have an idea of the cost but are unhappy as to whether it is sufficiently accurate.  For that reason, reluctantly, I am not prepared to go further than the point of 22 October 1983.  My last reason is this, the 22 October 1983 is not an arbitrary date.  It is the date on which this <Col N="415" /> country became liable in European law to meet obligations.</P>

      <P>Let us not ruin the tone of this constructive debate.  It is the date upon which this State, under the Treaty of Rome &mdash; and the amendment thereto decided upon by referendum in this country &mdash; became legally liable to pay this money.  Any other date is arbitrary in selection, whether it be 1 January 1983 or 1 January 1973.  That is fact.  It so happens that it is also the latest date, because it was only on that date that the event took place.  The directive was agreed on 22 October 1980.  That goes back into history.  That date has all the appearance of arbitrariness, but it is the date upon which this State became liable in law and that is why we are using it. Any other date is subject to the same kind of criticism or advocacy that Deputy Daly was making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to challenge the figures of the Minister, as having been supplied by his officials, of £1 million since 22 October.  I find it a little strange that it should be as high as that.  As I understand it, the money that will come to be paid under this Act is restricted in the situations in which it would become payable.  It will only apply in a case where there are not sufficient funds in the bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership to cover these wages and other items arising.  If there is sufficient money in the company, then these items under the various pieces of legislation in any case are priority charges.  Is that not so?  The only thing which comes in priority to them is the State's take for its own tax charges and PRSI.  That is unfair. It may not be directly on this point, but <Col N="416" /> it is wrong that for some reason the State should have their paw into a small kitty first and take their tax share and postpone payment to those who have worked in that company.  I know that that is a traditional thing, but basically and objectively it is wrong.</P>
      <P>Take the case of a company where there is only sufficient to meet the State's take, so that there will be nothing left for anybody else.  The State, of all creditors, is the slowest and the most neglectful in pursuing its task of calling in that money. There is an overbalance on the point of view of the State's priorities.  The workers' priorities should be given at least an equal if not higher rating.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the limited extent of application of the Act, I wonder could the figure be really as high as £1 million, bearing in mind that in many cases, probably the bulk of them, there will be sufficient money at least to provide for the State's take.  Would it not be fair to make some concession on this point?  I realise that we are taking Report Stage today and if the Minister and his officials were to re-examine the matter further between now and when the matter comes before the Seanad, perhaps with new figures which may come forward he may on reexamination of those figures in greater detail and taking into account the State's take, find it possible to make some concession on the point being pressed here by Deputy Ahern in his amendment. Would he be prepared to consider at least some compromise?  The date this Bill was introduced to the House was 21 May 1984, which is somewhat between 1 January and the October date.  Could the Minister also possibly consider the date of the introduction and presentation of the Bill to the House as a possible compromise date?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to make that point.  I support the principle outlined <Col N="417" /> by Deputy Taylor.  The major weakness in this Bill is that workers' rights under various aspects of legislation &mdash; whether the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, the Holidays (Employees) Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the many Acts under which the worker is entitled &mdash; can all be set aside by the ploy of an unscrupulous or vindictive employer, and this is a very common practice.  They can force an employee to go into the High Court to look for his or her rights.  In the case of liquidation, as I understand the legislation, an employee or group of employees can go there only with the permission of the liquidator, somebody who knows in advance what the situation is likely to be.  Of all the Departments that I have ever dealt with, I find the Department of Labour way out in front in their ability to react fairly quickly and come up with useful conclusions. I deal with all the Departments and hope no one will take umbrage at that, but I have to say it.</P>
      <P>I support what Deputy Taylor is saying. I would support in principle the idea of the January 1983 date if the officials could produce a list of the insolvencies that have been declared but which might not be a burden on the State as a result of the action of the liquidators.  I suggest that as a gesture of goodwill the Minister should reconsider his decision in that regard and by way of compromise accept the January, 1983 date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the amendment and I concur with what Deputy Taylor says about the State having first call in respect of deductions that should be made from wages.  We must remember that employees make a major contribution to our economy and to Exchequer revenue.  Without workers we would not have progress.  Unfortunately it is found in many instances of companies going into liquidation that the various deductions in respect of PAYE, PRSI or pension funds have not been passed to the appropriate Departments or pension trusts.  During 1983 this was found to be the case quite often so that <Col N="418" /> the workers concerned found themselves totally dependent on the State for assistance.</P>
      <P>Many small companies went out of business during that time but at most the amount involved would have been £1 million or at least half of that.  Without the directive that is tying us to the 22 October 1983 date we would probably use some other date, that is, if we were to specify any date.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment. I take this opportunity of commending him and his officials for the work they have put into this Bill.  Perhaps in his generosity he will concede on this amendment and in that way give some ray of hope to those workers who were affected in the period immediately before this date in 1983.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggested approximate figure is £1 million.  Is that a gross figure or does it take into account the amounts the Minister would be likely to recover from the liquidator in assuming responsibility for the workers' rights as provided for in section 9?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that the net figure would be considerably less, taking into consideration the amounts that would be likely to be recouped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In theory, yes, but that is if there is recoupment.  In respect of most of the companies concerned there has not been recoupment.  We are talking about a workers' entitlement that is recognised already in law.  The effect of this legislation would be to speed up payment of the moneys involved.  If there was money to pay the entitlement of those workers whose companies went into liquidation two or three years ago it is reasonable to assume that the amounts have been paid substantially but if not there would be involved a net cost on the funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Prendergast, we can get a list of the insolvent companies but that would not be a total list of all the companies that disappeared.  However, <Col N="419" /> that in itself would not be sufficient.  We would need to know the numbers of workers involved and the details in respect of sick pay benefit and so on.  Such figures are not available and consequently we must maintain the position as outlined.  I appreciate the point Deputy Treacy makes and on behalf of the Department I accept the compliment he has paid us <Col N="420" /> but regrettably I cannot add any more to what I have said.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (2)(a), to delete lines 22 to 25 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  any arrears of normal weekly remuneration to which the applicant became entitled in the relevant period&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to the maximum period for which an employee would be entitled to remuneration.  Subsection (2)(a)(i) refers to any arrears of normal weekly remuneration in respect of a period or periods, in the aggregate not exceeding eight weeks, and to which the applicant became entitled during the relevant period.  The relevant period is the period of 18 months.  This section states that, no matter what the arrears of weekly remuneration due to an application, he can only be paid a maximum of eight weeks.  My amendment is to delete the words &ldquo;in respect of a period of eight weeks&rdquo;.  The section would read: &ldquo;any arrears of normal weekly remuneration to which the applicant became entitled in the relevant period&rdquo;.  This is what everyone believes the Bill should do.  It should provide for the payment of any arrears due to an employee.</P>
      <P>If a firm goes bust an employee may say that in order to keep it solvent he would not take any money for so many weeks.  In such a case this section states that that employee cannot be paid any more than a maximum of eight weeks out of 18 months.  I do not believe this refers to any other payments in the case of insolvency.  For example, payments due to banks, shareholders or preferential creditors have no restrictions.  If interest is due to a bank for a period of 12 months it cannot be reduced to a period of eight weeks.  It does not refer to anyone else except to workers.  They are being penalised.</P>

    <P>any arrears due, in respect of a period or periods not exceeding eight <Col N="423" /> weeks in all under a scheme or arrangement which, forming part of an employee's contract of employment, provides or is capable of providing in relation to employees in any description of employment, payments payable to any such employees in respect of periods during which they are unable to fulfill their contract of employment due to ill health and to which the applicant became entitled during the relevant period.</P>
    <P>If an employee was out sick for a period under the normal company sick pay scheme and was entitled to payment during illness this section states that he will not be paid for all of that period but merely for a maximum of eight weeks in all in 18 months.  This is even more inhuman because if a person suffers from illness it is not his fault.  If he had a period of illness of two or three months or a few weeks here and there making more than a total of eight weeks of illness, he is denied payment.  This will do nothing to improve his health.  It is not a humane attitude.  It is not correct to do this because such restrictions do not apply to other creditors at the time of insolvency.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 deals with holiday pay.  Subsection (2) (i) (b) states:</P>
    <P>any holiday pay in respect of a period or periods of holiday not exceeding eight weeks in all, and to which the applicant became entitled during the relevant period.</P>
    <P>This section imposes a restriction on normal remuneration due, sick pay and holiday pay.  It is too restrictive.  It limits the liability of the fund to meet the claims of employees to a certain time period.  There is also a limit on the amount of money per week no matter what a person's earnings were.</P>
    <P>My amendments are to delete that restriction.  I am well aware that most cases will be covered by the eight weeks. However, there will be some which will not be covered.  It is wrong that the restriction should be imposed even on a small number of people.  I ask the Minister to have a look at the section again. <Col N="424" /> He might have a fair idea of how many people will be excluded through the limitation of eight weeks.  Why should they be excluded?  It would be unfair and unjust to exclude a number of people from the terms of the fund.</P>

      <P>Where does the figure of eight weeks come from?  Is it an arbitrary figure, or is it out of line with what has happened in other EC countries? The arguments in relation to outstanding entitlements, and particularly holiday pay, come up frequently and they should be taken account of in any liquidation of that nature.  What provision is made in the Bill for some of the consequential amendments to the Redundancy Payments Act, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act and the Unfair Dismissal Act which are necessary to give full effect to the EC insolvency directive and to apply that directive in Ireland on equal terms as in Britain and in continental EC countries?  In the present situation here, no matter what the entitlements of an employee are under that <i>corpus</i> of legislation, they can be set aside by the decision of the liquidator; but an employee must go to the liquidator to get permission before he can go to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  As I understand it, that is not the situation in Britain and other EC countries.  We cannot afford to take an arbitrary step out of the EC directive.  I support in general the principle of the amendment, but I would like an explanation as to where the eight weeks came from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the amendment, the eight weeks comes from the directive itself and it is proposed in relation to arrears of salaries or wages.  We have extended the directive in relation to sick and holiday pay to cover eight weeks also.  Therefore, they are harmonised together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Mac Giolla argued consistently in that he compared the claims of debenture holders and creditors of one kind or another and those of workers and suggested that they should be equal and said that in this sense they <Col N="425" /> manifestly were not being made equal. This legislation is providing, in advance of any arbitration or any decision by the receiver or liquidator as to the allocation of moneys to meet liabilities that the company or employer would have, that employees on foot of providing proper evidence will automatically be paid in advance of any determination as to what the liquidator or receiver would say.  They would get arrears of wages or salaries up to a maximum of eight weeks plus sick pay, holiday pay, etc.  The eight weeks was taken from the directive.  I queried the point that Deputy Prendergast is querying now.  In turn, the eight weeks was calculated on the basis that very few people, if any, were likely to go for eight weeks without some form of income from the employer and that it was deemed to be a reasonable figure on which to calculate it.  Going back any further has an administrative implication in that additional documentary evidence is required and so forth.  For that reason we feel that the eight weeks is sufficient.  We have related it back to the two entitlements to which I made reference.  This amendment is simply not necessary and could complicate things in a way that we think is unhelpful.  The eight weeks more than meets the requirements of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC directive gives eight weeks as the absolute minimum that any member state is allowed to have, and we are opting for the absolute minimum. I agree that if the EC directive said six weeks we would have six weeks and if it said four weeks we would have four weeks.  It is sad that we are opting for the minimum permitted in terms of the EC directive.  It is a sad reflection on all sides of this House and successive Governments that much of the social legislation we have brought in over the last few years on equality and various other matters is due to promptings and insistence from EC sources and not through our own volition.  That thinking is exhibited once again here where, mindlessly, we plump for the absolute minimum provided for in the directive.  We <Col N="426" /> can do better than that.  I do not know what the record is in other EC states.  I have no prior knowledge at all, but I would be surprised if they all plumped for the absolute minimum.  Some more advanced standard of social thinking on this subject from our own point of view independent of the EC would not be inappropriate.</P>

      <P>I support the points that have been made.  The Minister said, and everyone will agree, that only a small number of people will be affected by this cut-off period.  The Minister has not explained sufficiently to the House where the complication would arise.  We are saying that to implement this and to leave <Col N="427" /> out the restriction of the eight weeks is not going to cost very much but it would eliminate injustice in some cases.  Everybody would agree that it must be a few cases, either of people being ill or making a special arrangement with the employer for a number of weeks trying to help out and keep the thing in business or whatever.  It will be only a small number of people, and if they are out of pocket after that the Minister has not explained why it cannot be done.  Obviously the reason is not financial.  What complications are preventing him from implementing this and leaving out the eight weeks restriction?</P>

      <P>Let me respond to the reference to the EC.  The EC do not make decisions in isolation from representation from this Government.  When this directive was being debated the delegation of the Irish Government of the day were at the Council table participating in the decisions, which were majority consensus decisions, not even vote decisions.  This State were party to that eight weeks at that time, and they would have been in 1980 when Fianna Fáil were in Government. Therefore, it was not imposed externally from Brussels upon this domestic Legislature.  We had a part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the point that was made that somehow or other we were sitting over here in Dublin, that in Brussels a figure was taken and imposed upon us as if we had nothing to do with that figure in the first instance.  That is not the case.  We participated fully with full rights and rights of veto in relation to the date in question.  In a number of areas we are exceeding what has been described as the common denominator of the EC directive.  The question could be asked: why are we not exceeding it in respect of this?  Experience from our nearest neighbour, the UK, in relation to the operation of this legislation is that the average amount of arrears of wages, the <Col N="428" /> point at issue in this amendment, is for two weeks.  I know that you will always get exceptions, but the average amount is for two weeks.  The period of eight weeks is a considerable excess of time over what we would be allowing for the average kind of statistical range.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla asked what type of complications there could be.  I regret to say, because this reflects badly on all of us, that there is a degree of possible collusion between workers and employers. There has been evidence of that in some sectors already.  There is nothing to prevent a worker saying he was owed four weeks this year, two weeks last year and five weeks from ten years ago if something happened.  If the employer is insolvent at that stage and the liquidator or receiver is in the company there is nothing to prevent the employer certifying that he was entitled to that money.  The money would not be coming out of his pocket.  There would be nothing to prevent the employer certifying that he has stopped wages amounting to a certain amount going back over a period of time.</P>

      <P>If one went into any company at present one would find arrears of entitlements due to employees.  If a company went into liquidation and an employee was due arrears of wages, sick pay or holiday money, there is nothing to prevent an employer saying, &ldquo;I am gone out of the company and the bank is going to get it but, in order to help you, I will say that you were owed money for many weeks going back over three or four years&rdquo;.  That may not be the Deputy's intention but it would be the effect of his amendment.  It would have the effect of not having any limit on the amount of <Col N="429" /> moneys that may be paid.  That is why we inserted the maximum amount of money we can reasonably anticipate an average employee will be due.  We should not forget that this would be for wages and not profit shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The second argument against the amendment is that it may invite collusion.  Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment is couched in terms that a minority of cases might be affected by the exclusion of eight weeks.  I am sure the House agrees that the majority of cases will be covered in regard to wages because in the main the arrears will not be more than eight weeks.  The average in the UK is two weeks.  We have to design the legislation to cater for the worst possible position.  However, if we introduce the legislation in such a way that somehow or other we will be inviting collusion we are complicating the administrative procedure in a Department that is overworked in the area of the administration of redundancy.  We will be inviting people to possibly benefit from potential collusion and having it refused after officials have gone through all the documentation.</P>
      <P>The legislation covers all the legitimate requirements one can reasonably anticipate. It is very unlikely that the person is going to allow wages accumulate or be withheld for more than eight weeks.  That will not happen unless a person is in unique circumstances.  I do not think any Member could afford to allow a stop on his or her normal income for more than two or three weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In that event they would apply to the social welfare system seeking disability pay and so on if they were not being paid by their employer.  We are not looking at this legislation in isolation to everything else.  It should be seen as part <Col N="430" /> of a comprehensive social package.  The fear that Members may have that a person may be denied in excess of eight weeks' money from a company is unjustified. If we try to remove any constraints which would be the effect of the The Workers' Party amendment we run the risk of inviting collusion.  As far as we can see there is no need for it.  It will be complicating the administrative procedure with people producing documents of one type or another.</P>

      <P>One interpretation of the Deputy's amendment is that it would have that effect and that is one of the reasons why I am not prepared to accept it.  The Bill puts a limit of 18 months prior to the notification of insolvency but the removal of any limitation could be construed as reducing that constraint entirely.  It could push back the 18 months.</P>

      <P>I do not think that is possible.  I thought the Minister said that 18 months referred to insolvencies in that period and that if an insolvency occurred on 22 October 1983 a worker could go back a period of years before that.  There is nothing in the amendments that alters in any way the other sections dealing with the date when an employer is made insolvent.  When tabling the amendment I understood we were dealing with a period of eight weeks when a worker was not paid over 18 months. My amendment seeks to eliminate the restriction on arrears of normal weekly remuneration to which an applicant became entitled during the relevant period which is dealt with in other sections. I am anxious to eliminate the eight weeks and cover any arrears due to an applicant during the relevant period.  If 18 months is held to be the relevant period it still stands and will not be altered by my amendment.  My amendment seeks to remunerate those who lose most.  It would be unfair and unjust to exclude them.  Only a small number of people will be involved and I do not see why the elimination of the eight weeks will introduce any further complications.  If collusion comes into it, it will be collusion to give everybody eight weeks.  There must be a section which gives the Minister power to rule out a case where he believes there is collusion.  I do not think that is an argument in the case of these amendments, which merely ask that the small number of persons who would exceed eight weeks would be included in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister said we should wait until we came to discuss the national income pension-related scheme. One of the saddest things in liquidation and redundancies is that pensioners and employees who paid their contributions <Col N="433" /> for years lose all their entitlements when the company goes into liquidation.  We have heard numerous cases where this happened.  I heard last week of a pensioner in Bolands Mills who spent his entire working life, 44 years, there and had received a pension of £200 a month. When Bolands Mills were taken over his pension was reduced to £60 a month.  I suppose he was lucky because in many cases people have lost all benefits under their pension schemes although they paid into them all their working lives.  In many cases these people do not even get their contributions back or if they are pensioners they do not get any further pension. This is very unfair and unjust.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister has made provision for a 12 month period to help a person pay up their contributions to qualify for benefits.  I ask the Minister to go further because there are so many companies going into liquidation.  It is bad enough to lose your job, but it is a great deal worse if you lose your pension entitlements too.  We discussed this problem at the parliamentary party meeting and almost every Deputy could recall people who had paid into a pension fund for 30 or 35 years and when the firm went into liquidation they lost all.  This is very unjust because it is hitting defenceless people who cannot join a new pension scheme.  Nobody can join a pension scheme if he is 63 years of age.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure how the Minister can help, but I do not think we should have to wait until we have the national income pension-related scheme.  When I first came into this House a White Paper or a Green Paper was issued on this subject and successive Governments have played around with this idea since.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's view and the views of other Deputies on what can be done to help these elderly people who are made redundant before they reach pensionable age or if they are pensioners who lose their pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case made by Deputy Ahern to extend this legislation to the pension rights of <Col N="434" /> employees.  As he indicated, we discussed this at a parliamentary party meeting. Unfortunately there are too many examples around the country of pension funds which are insolvent.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be particularly aware of the case I am about to mention, Castle Brand, Nenagh.  This will help to underline the injustices that arise in certain liquidations.  Castle Brand is a classic example of the need to protect pension funds and I hope the Minister will be able to respond to this suggestion.  Some employees had been contributing for over 40 years and a considerable number of them for 30 years, to the pension fund set up in the long-established factory in Nenagh.  As a consequence of the liquidation, it emerged that in recent weeks the full pension fund contributions from management had not been made.  It transpires that workers' pension fund contributions over the years will not be rewarded by pension entitlements.  This has caused a great deal of distress to many families and some employees who have a right to be protected and who might find it difficult to get employment on the open market, will be affected by this.  Let me explain further why I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The liquidator does not feel that he can indemnify any potential purchaser against pension fund liability. That legal position was introduced to protect pension funds.  In other words, he cannot waive pension fund rights in respect of any new promoter, if such could be found for Castle Brand, and because he cannot, the liability to make good the default &mdash; and that is what it is; I chose my words very carefully &mdash; cannot be discharged by the liquidator as other liabilities can.  The consequence is that not only are workers losing their pension rights but the liability which stays and which attaches to a new promoter is becoming a barrier against the possibility of renewed employment. If any interested party is informed that there is a pension fund liability of the order of a substantial six figure sum and that he cannot be indemnified against payment of that sum, then such a promoter will immediately say that he will <Col N="435" /> not start off with such a liability around his neck.  That is what is happening in Nenagh with regard to Castle Brand.</P>
    <P>I support our spokesman in welcoming the intentions of the Bill.  I know the Minister will be concerned to deal with the problem.  The number of liquidations this year is higher than last year and those who move the application for liquidation often surface again a few months later having got a clean bill of discharge from the liquidator.  I hope it will not be long before the Government bring in the long delayed Bill on company liability because some of the things which are happening at are a scandal.  Bona fide trads are being brought down by debts due to them by companies in liquidation.  Some of these liquidations are unavoidable but others are deliberate.  Then these people surface elsewhere with no liability.  A pension fund loss in addition to the loss of jobs is intolerable.</P>
    <P>I understand that the application of the EC directive in other countries is such that the Governments themselves accept responsibility for the indemnity of the pension fund in circumstances like those which have arisen at Castle Brand in Nenagh and perhaps elsewhere.  The Governments of the member states use national funds for this purpose.  That is not the case here.  We may have been reluctant to introduce these protections heretofore but the pattern of liquidations is something we have never witnessed before.  I would ask the Minister to consider accepting our amendment and to see what other effective action could be taken to build up those funds in Castle Brand and cases like it so that we will not see scandals of the kind I have addressed. I hope we can find a new purpose in this House in that respect.  Anything we can do to alleviate the consequences for the innocent of the failures of those who certainly could not be described as innocent must be a matter of urgency.  The Minister would earn the undying gratitude of many families in our home town if he did something of that nature.  He would not only repay them their due but open an avenue for the renewal of employment at <Col N="436" /> that factory by a new promoter who would not be faced with a chain around his neck in respect of which he had no part.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's able contribution highlights the need for a look at the consequential legislation. We always thought that a funded scheme could not be touched if a company went broke.  In other countries the State picks up the tab.  There is a danger here.  Some shyster fly by night companies are operating who might deliberately under-contribute their share to the pension scheme knowing that things were looking bad and that the State would pick up the tab.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider the following point.  Where pension schemes are agreed between workers and employers it should be provided in legislation that the insurers should certify on a regular basis every month or three months that the employer has paid up the due amount.  This is provided for under the Social Welfare Acts, although it does not seem to be commonly recognised by many shop stewards.  They have a right to go once a month to the employer to see what returns have been made under the PRSI system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know I am speaking in your name, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and on behalf of Deputy Michael Bell in supporting what has been said about the situation in your home town where the workers found themselves in the worst possible situation. I have negotiated hundreds of agreements on pension schemes.  These schemes have become a feature of industrial relations only in the past 15 years or so under the national wage agreements. Before that the level of wages did not permit pension schemes.  The workers in your town made a total contribution of £190,000 but only £76,000 of that money is left.  They will get only 40p in the pound on the money they paid, apart from what the employer should have paid.  We are told that the employers were given actuarial advice that their contributions to the scheme were too low and should be increased.  The company secretary gave a written assurance to the union in 1983 <Col N="437" /> that this had been done.  It subsequently transpired that it had not.</P>
    <P>The essence of a pension plan is that the employer agrees to make contributions to insurers on a level that will ensure payment of agreed benefits.  Generally there is agreement that the employees will pay their own percentage and the ratio is usually 4:1.  In this situation there was a con job.  I have been asked by representatives of my union to point out that one of the main things sought &mdash; I am speaking with specific reference to this section to the Castle Brand employees &mdash; would be a mechanism to ensure that the agreed contributions were paid to the insurers so that in an insolvency the benefits contained in the pension plan would be payable.  The relevance of the appropriate exception to Castle Brand is that the company did not remit the relevant contributions defined in section 6 (2) to the insurers.  The company said they gave a written undertaken which was false.  Section 6 (3) was mentioned as being relevant in that it appears to limit the scope of the Bill to unpaid moneys for 12 months preceding the date of the insolvency.  This would not cover a group of misfortunate workers, many of whom are moving up to pension entitlement and who now find that, having paid their due amount, they can get nothing out of it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look very seriously at this case.  We can talk about other aspects of industrial relations, employees, sick pay schemes and holiday pay, but nothing is as sacroscant as a pension scheme.  Every support necessary should be given to copperfasten the entitlement of workers in this regard.  The Bill is restrictive in that it says it shall go back 12 months only prior to the actual date.  The word &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;greater&rdquo;.  Anything that can be done in that regard should be done to protect pension schemes especially.  I ask the Minister to have a close look at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment in name of our spokesman, Deputy Ahern.  Yesterday I had occasion to meet members of a group of unions: <Col N="438" /> the Seamen's Union, the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland, the ASTMS and members of the National Seamen's Union.  One of the serious worries they raised with me was the matter which Deputy Ahern is trying to remedy by his amendment.  By direct Government action Irish Shipping have been put in the hands of a liquidator.  Some people from the FWUI indicated to me that they had been subscribing to a pension fund for 38 years.  Apparently the full pension is 40-60 ths.  In the public service it is 40-80ths and a lump sum.  I understand that the pension fund is strong enough, but now that the liquidation has taken place and the employees have been declared redundant, the managers or owners or company contributions will cease.  They do not know what their position is.  Whatever this Bill can do to cover those pensions to which people made contributions and had expectations of reasonable pensions on retirement should be done.  The Government should pay the Bill.</P>
      <P>In this case we are talking about a State company.  It is all very fine for the Minister for Communications and the Minister for Finance to say they will be responsible only for what has been guaranteed specifically by them.  I can see the reason for that.  Nevertheless a climate of opinion was created around those State companies and the belief was held by financial institutions that the State would be responsible for any defects or defaults. Perhaps nobody thought there would ever be a liquidation but the fact is that people who contributed for 37 or 38 years, for ten years, or for five years, are now in Never Never land so far as their pensions are concerned.  I should like the Minister to indicate if he thinks Deputy Ahern's amendment would cover those amendments.  I hope he is accepting it.  If it would not, would he let us know whether he has any plan to cover that eventuality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to lay stress particularly on what I said about the belief on the part of financial institutions that support would be available from the State for these companies. The Catholic theologians talked <Col N="439" /> about creeping infallibility.  The theologians proper knew that infallibility applied only to a very narrow range of decisions and pronouncements.  The Civil Service extended infallibility to every little tittle tattle.  In the same way in State companies guarantees may have applied only to specific areas, but there was a general belief that the State would not let down any of the commitments of State companies, especially a State company like Irish Shipping, totally owned by the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern is trying to cover unfortunate instances.  I am not talking about the redundancy end of things.  Nobody need answer me on that.  I understand the position there.  I am talking about people employed by a wholly State owned company who contributed to a pension fund a certain percentage of their earnings.  The State company made their annual contribution on the basis of what the employee was being paid.  The fund is there.  It is in the black and that is the position of the workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Castle Brand &mdash; and this kind of thing happens in other companies &mdash; in the confident knowledge that the fund was not in any way insolvent, a very short number of weeks before the liquidation some workers retired on full pension which was their entitlement.  In a sense they now feel &mdash; and there is no reason why they should &mdash; that because they are getting full pension rights and their fellow workers who did not retire are not, they are being treated in a manner which they do not deserve in contrast with their fellow workers.  That is the kind of thing that happens when suddenly a fund which seemed as secure as the bank becomes insolvent and some people retire and draw their pensions, to which they are fully entitled, and two weeks later others find they have nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment, if carried, would be to put no limit on the liability of the fund to provide the cash in the event of an insolvency.  One <Col N="440" /> must assume that there will be insolvencies in the long term.  In terms of the potential scale of the demand on the fund, we are talking about something which is substantially larger than the kind of money we were talking about previously. If we were to accept the amendment we would have to increase the fund very dramatically.  We can come back later to the relative size.  There is provision in the legislation for the refunding of unpaid contributions in respect of the 12 months.  That money would be redeemed to the employee.  There is reference to pensions and to pensions contributions and the rights of workers.</P>
      <P>I want to respond to some of the points raised by Deputy Wilson.  He raised a specific question about Irish Shipping.  I went to the trouble yesterday to get the details of this matter because it concerns me to see former employees and current employees of an Irish State company in liquidation.  There is a substantial pension fund in operation in Irish Shipping.  The information to date is that, with one or two exceptions, the vast majority of those who had paid contributions to pension will get the full benefit of their payments. There is a separate fund.  The danger for workers in pension schemes of private companies is where the fund would be paid out of current account with no separate fund.  The contributions would be stopped from the worker's wages and pension obligations would be met out of the day to day operation costs of the company.</P>
      <P>In the instance of Irish Shipping, my information is that the substantial numbers of the staff are well covered in relation to pension requirements.  I do not know if this came across in the meeting that the Deputy had with the union representatives of the staff of Irish Shipping.</P>

      <P>It is in one sense, but we can come back to that in substantial detail.  I am trying to facilitate the House. I can get the Deputy the up to date information. On the broader thrust and on the whole question of pensions and pension rights and their maintenance, we tried to see if we could extend the provisions of this Bill to cover the aspects which this amendment would suggest.  The conclusion was that there would be considerable extra cost which would reflect itself in a much higher PRSI contribution from the employer which is, to continue the logic of the argument which I applied earlier, an extra tax, if you like, on employment. There is that dimension to it.  Either way, it was preferable to resolve this problem by reference to a national pension plan.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern talked about his arrival here in 1977 when there was talk about a national pension plan.  The Green Paper on the National Pension Plan was published&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The matter has not advanced very much since then and has been around for some time.  We have had long, detailed discussions with the Department of Social Welfare and our and particularly their view is that the way to tackle this problem is through the integrated national plan that would pick up the liabilities in relation to this and have a proper fund.  The impact which this could have on the fund would be enormous in terms of cost and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment as proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That part of the EC directive which imposes an obligation on member states to protect workers' interests in pension schemes is the basis for this whole Bill.  While contributions of 12 months are of some benefit, because of the number of liquidations &mdash; one of the absurd results of the present economic recession &mdash; surely there should be something under this Bill, because legislation for the protection of employees will not come before this House too often.  The national pension scheme has been floating around for eight years and the last I heard of it would suggest that it would be a long time before we would see any proposals.  The Minister of State said on Second Stage that the Minister is giving consideration to it, which means that we will never see a White Paper in the life of this Dáil and goodness knows for how long we will have to wait after that.</P>
      <P>Pensioners who have contributed for periods in excess of 25 and 30 years and would be entitled to full pensions are now receiving nothing.  Others in take-overs have received reduced pensions.  A large number of the workforce had benefits and would have received these at retirement age, but when the pension funds went with the liquidation of their firms, they received absolutely nothing.  The Minister said in June that he was giving consideration to this matter.  It is sufficiently important, being one of the main items of the directive, that we do not let the opportunity of this welcome legislation go without doing something for these pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been talking about unfair dismissal sums and holiday and sick pay but these are all things about which we may do something and in money terms they can be done without.  However, to lose one's pension rights is a different matter. If you have paid into a fund in a working life of 40 years, from the age of 16 to 60, to lose your job through no fault of your own through the actions of some fly-by-night company and to be told that your pension fund is in liquidation along with your job is deplorable.  On Monday morning you have no job and no pension. <Col N="443" /> You have to draw your social asistance. Surely, when we are talking about employees' protection, there is no more deserving cause than this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On one point I can agree with the Minister.  The impact of this is much more significant than some of the proposals already in the Bill.  It also has to be acknowledged that the reason for this is that pension fund rights in the event of liquidation are of much greater significance than repayments of, say, four or six weeks' sick pay, as we have been discussing up to this. Obviously, this amendment would go away beyond anything which has been achieved by other amendments proposed in this Bill.  We know that and are fully conscious of it.  Obviously, it would extend to protecting those pensions for as long as those people would live, as would be their normal entitlement.  We are thus talking about very considerable sums.  It is a choice between a loss of very considerable sums and very considerable hard earned rights of the contributors over a period of 40 years.  I could name, and there may be need to do it, people who have been contributing for that length and more in respect of Castle Brand.  It is a question of measuring the loss to them, which is not covered by the term &ldquo;very considerable&rdquo; but only by the term &ldquo;drastic&rdquo;, and the contribution which we should acknowledge to be paid here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that it would involve considerable extra PRSI contributions from the employers to maintain this kind of insurance.  If that be the case, then that should be done. This would only arise in the event of insolvency, we must remember.  If there is a notion outside among employers, that in the event of liquidation they can avoid their obligations &mdash; and they are not just <Col N="444" /> legal; although this is not a forum for moral obligations but they are that above all else &mdash; then it is time that those involved as employers or promoters in limited liability circumstances recognised that collectively this obligation attaches to them.  I am not one who would be talking normally in terms of imposing extra PRSI charges on anyone but if that had to be the price it should be paid.  It could arise only in insolvencies of the kind we have experienced, where the contributions of management are not matched by the contributions of workers.  Surely there should be a management insurance underwriting fund whereby these awful injustices could not arise.  However, I am quoting an extreme situation.  The Minister has not responded to the point from this side that in other EC countries there is such an indemnity on the part of the State.  That is important and I am not ignoring the problems in respect of public expenditure either now or for the future.  When the integrated national pension plan is drawn up, it will, as the Minister implied, cover such cases but the plan will not be likely to extend back to the type of case I am talking of.  There is the additional factor that we might have to wait a considerable time for that pension plan.</P>
    <P>The point is that if what we are seeking is in existence elsewhere as a fundamental principle of social justice, we should be legislating on those lines also.  Statutory Instrument 306 of 1980 indicates clearly the rights and obligations of the transferor arising from a contract of employment.  In this case that would be the former management.  It is provided also that a transfer arising from an employment relationship existing on the date of transfer, by reason of such transfer, shall be transferred to the transferee.  This is exactly applicable to the case I am quoting.  The obligations of the transfer are now attached to a transferee to give a new potential management. Those obligations are such as to carry the dual consequence and burden for those who have been deprived of their pension funds that they now have not much prospect of continuing employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> It is both the insolvency of the fund and perhaps the accidental effect of Statutory Instrument 306 of 1980 that people suffer both ways.  This is the most important issue in this Bill.  It is one matter to protect workers at work but it is another to protect their pension rights after they have lost their jobs.  I should like the Minister to address himself particularly to the point about the effect of the statutory instrument I have mentioned and I should like him also to acknowledge that we acknowledge that a major increase in the fund is involved.  I say that for obvious reasons.  Pending the introduction of an integrated pension plan on a national scale, perhaps he would deal with injustices of the kind we have been referring to.</P>
    <P>I have never witnessed such frustration, anger and disillusionment among workers as I have witnessed among that fine bunch of people who have worked all their lives up to now but who have been deprived of their jobs and in addition their pension rights.  Perhaps they are not the only ones in that situation.  It is dangerous when people like them who are the salt of the earth find that there are legal or some other barriers which prevent us from protecting their interests. In those circumstances I plead with the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy O'Kennedy in his appeal to the Minister and I thank Deputy Prendergast for indicating, during the time I was in the Chair, my support for the workers of Castle Brand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only too well aware of the trauma suffered by the workers in this industry, the 50th anniversary of the founding of which is marked this year.  Even the word &ldquo;trauma&rdquo; is hardly adequate when applied to the case of a man who, having worked 40 years in a job, loses that job through no fault of his own and in addition is told that there was a serious under-financing of the pension fund.  I would go so far as to describe as criminal any employer who would put an employee in that position.  I do not know what can be done about such employers either within the terms of this Bill or of any other but <Col N="446" /> it is a sad state of affairs when a person who has given 40 years service to a native industry loses both his job and his pension rights with the collapse of that industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister in reply to Deputy O'Kennedy said that a section of the Bill covers a period of 12 months of under-financing. That is totally insufficient.  It is merely a drop in the ocean in so far as the crisis in Castle Brand is concerned. In addition to the effect on the workers who have lost their jobs, the pension crisis places a millstone around the necks of those who are making efforts to have the industry re-established.  Both Deputy O'Kennedy and I have grown up with the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast has referred to the brief I received from the workers and the local union.  Some years ago the percentage of payroll involved in the pension fund was in the region of 9 per cent. Two years ago the report of an actuary indicated to the company that to bring the funding into line with what would be an adequate pension for the workers, there would need to be an increase to bring the figure up to 15½ per cent and that that figure would have to increase in line with inflation and so on.  Unfortunately, when the factory closed the crisis was discovered all too late.  I add my voice to the appeal to the Minister to devise a way of offsetting the effect that the under-financing of the pension fund will have on the workers of Castle Brand. This is necessary, too, in terms of the efforts of semi-State companies to have the factory reopened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that the Minister has adequately covered the questions I asked.  He said on Second Stage that in addition to providing for the protection of workers' claims relating to pay, the EC directive imposed an obligation also on member states to protect workers' interests in the matter of company pension schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated, this was a State company.  There was a pension scheme and I have no reason to believe that the fears expressed to me yesterday by the workers are unfounded.  I would be glad <Col N="447" /> if the Minister can tell me they are and that their expectation of pensions &mdash; in one case for 38 years of contributory service &mdash; will not be disappointed.  What is the position of people who have been contributing for 20 years?  Will they get 20-60ths?  What will happen if the fund runs out?</P>
    <P>That is the nub of the problem.  I do not have actuarial information about when this will arise &mdash; it will depend on the decisions made on who will be paid pensions. Some employees had 37 or 38 or 39 years of service.  Will they be entitled to 40-60ths? What is the Minister's view of the State's responsibility, taking into account what he said on Second Stage, to those workers if the fund runs out?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson has been talking about a State company. When I was speaking earlier I was not aware the Minister had made that statement. The Minister also said:</P>
      <P>The EC directive also imposes an obligation on member states to protect workers' interests in the matter of company pension schemes.</P>
      <P>That means, according to the Minister, that every member state has that obligation. As we are a member state, surely the Minister will respond to what we are saying.  There are very good reasons why the EC should have such a directive because if we allow social injustice to arise without having State protection for people who have contributed we would be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on my feet I wish to express support for my colleague Deputy Ryan, but I must say this of the brief Deputy Ryan had which previously had been made available to Deputy Prendergast. It is too bad that the trade union representative in Nenagh, who happens to be a member of the Minister's party, did not make available to me as a Deputy in that town, as someone who knows all the lads on that shop floor, who worked with them and hurled with them, what he made available to a Deputy from another constituency.

      <P>Deputies Wilson and O'Kennedy have spoken of Castle Brand and Irish Shipping Limited.  This clause in the directive covers all industries and all firms that have gone into liquidation in which pensions funds collapsed and all the years service and contributions of the workers went down the drain.  I know there are financial constraints and we would support an amendment by the Minister on Report Stage.  I am sure the Minister accepts subsection (4) which is as follows:</P>
      <P>The provisions of subsections (5) and (6) of this section shall apply in a case where there is appointed or is required to be appointed &mdash;</P>

    <P>If the Minister is prepared to bring an amendment on Report Stage we would withdraw our amendments to cover the category of employees who have found themselves penniless during a recess because their pension funds disintegrated on the day their jobs vanished.  This has been discussed at length by our parliamentary party in one of the longest debates we have had in recent months and many Deputies and Senators made points.

      <P>I had hoped to get it to the Seanad tonight.  Of course, the House must do its job.  Let me start with Deputy Wilson's point.  I was not sure whether he was speaking with complete infallability following today's episcopal announcement. In relation to Irish Shipping, it is my clear understanding from information <Col N="450" /> we have received that in respect of two out of three categories of workers the status of the pension fund, based on contributions, is basically sound and they will get their full entitlement in line with what they had contributed to the fund.  I can make other details available later if the Deputy wishes.  In view of the fact that these people were employed in a State company and had certain expectations we should do the maximum possible, within the constraints of the law, to meet their present position.  Members opposite will appreciate that I am somewhat constrained in what I say because of the fact that there is a liquidator there.  However, that is my view and I will argue it in the relevant places.</P>
      <P>Deputies have quoted me fairly in relation to the intent of the EC directive about pension funds and entitlements and workers pay.  The directive imposes an obligation on member states to move in this direction.  However, it is not an immediate obligation; it is an intermediate one.  We are meeting our requirements under the directive by covering the types of payments which are covered in this legislation.</P>
      <P>We are seeking to meet in an intermediate manner the objective of covering pension claims and entitlements of workers in the workforce.  It is our considered view, as it is the view of many other EC members, that the most effective way to do this is through a pay-related national pension scheme.  The House will have regard to the fact that in this instance we are talking about the establishment of a fund which would be contributed to exclusively by employers to cover workers' entitlements to arrears of money.  They will be comparatively small amounts but their non-payment could cause considerable aggravation or loss in some cases.  That is what the fund is aimed at doing and that is why the contribution is at the level it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition spokesman on Finance was forthcoming in his willingness to contemplate a financial commitment to cover pensions.  My information is that we will be coming back during the lifetime of this Dáil to put a national pay-related pension <Col N="451" /> scheme before the House.  Obviously any such scheme will have an element of contribution to it from the employer and employee.  If those who are in paid employment, self-employer or otherwise, are to make a contribution and express solidarity with those who through no fault of their own lose their pension entitlement, it is reasonable to think that the fund that would go towards providing such a front of solidarity would be funded by both employers and employees.  That is not the case in this fund.  As a consequence, if we were to extend the scope of this fund to cover the provisions Deputies O'Kennedy and Ryan referred to, the impact on this fund and the consequent imposition of what would be in effect a pay roll tax would be substantial.  For that reason I cannot meet the amendment. However, it is intended to bring forward a proposal and that was outlined in the national plan and in the Joint Programme for Government.  It is something to which the Minister for Health is committed. Work is going on at present on that.  It is quite complex to interact the various types of pension contributions.</P>
    <P>In far too many cases where workers make a pension fund contribution, or alternatively where employers deduct a contribution from their salary, there is not adequate overseeing of the administration of the pension fund.  In some cases there is no fund as such but a contribution is taken from the employee and put into the current account, so to speak, of the company and pension liabilities are paid as they become due.  That is the way it operates under the Civil Service pension scheme.  It is arguably not the best way to do it, but that is another day's work. There is an obligation on trade union representatives and public representatives, but specifically on workers who are paying into a fund, to ensure that there are proper trustees appointed to oversee the fund and that the fund is adequately funded.  If it is not adequately funded they should be made aware of that and given the option of either increasing their contributions or making alternative arrangements.  In many cases the <Col N="452" /> undoubted injustices that arise are because workers, trade union representatives or employers failed to meet their obligations.</P>
    <P>I covered the case of Irish Shipping and our obligations under the EC.  It is an interim requirement under the directive which we propose to meet.  We will meet it under the framework of a national pay-related pension scheme and not out of this fund because of the nature of the funding of this fund and the impact it would have on costs if we were to meet it through the amendment put forward by Deputy Ahern.</P>
    <P>The safeguarding of pension contributions and funds is an obligation in the first instance on those who are members of the pension fund or trust.  They should make sure, as far as they can, that there is a fund and that there are proper trustees. Under this Bill where an employee has had contributions deducted from his or her salary at source which were deemed to have been paid or credited to the pension fund but which in reality had not been paid by the employer, this fund will make good contributions up to a maximum of the previous 12 months in order to bring the pension fund contribution up to date.  The pattern in some companies, particularly in private companies, is when they get into cash flow difficulties revenue of this kind is used as working capital.  In this instance what we are saying is that, in so far as they are pension contributions deducted from employees up to a maximum of 12 months previously, they will be fully credited out of this fund to whatever pension scheme the person was making a contribution to in the first place. That is as far as we can go.  The logic of that is within the spirit of saying that this was money which was deemed to have been paid and deducted from workers in the first place.</P>

      <P>What is the amount of money required to produce the indemnity we request?  The Minister said it would be considerable.  It is obvious we will not finish the Bill now.  If we knew the amount of money we could decide if we could accept the Minister's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> As the Minister was speaking, behind him was the Deputy General Secretary of the Commission of the European Community whom I went to greet for a moment during the course of what the Minister was saying.  I do not think he or the European institutions would be too happy to know that we are moving to what the Minister called intermediate stages, not immediate stages, to implement what we recognise as an obligation under the EC directive.  If it is an obligation &mdash; it is one that was introduced a few years ago &mdash; it is time that we acted to meet that obligation.  We have made fairly cogent arguments on this side, and the Minister has accepted them, that the need to meet that obligation is urgent.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that the Minister will know that the refund in respect of 12 months' pension rights is not what we are talking about here.  We are talking about people who have been contributing over 35 or 40 years.  The only basis on which we can refund them is to indemnify the pension fund to ensure that the contribution they have made will be matched either from management sources or, in the event that neither of those is available, from Government indemnity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put on record that the present position in relation to the health boards and the allocations that are being forwarded now to them indicate clearly that the boards will find themselves in severe difficulty over the next 12 months.  The unfortunate situation as I see it, as chairman of the North Western Health Board, is that the unfortunate people who are going to suffer as a result of the present economic problems facing the health boards are the poor and underprivileged.  The cutbacks of £30 million in the 1984 allocation to the eight health boards will not be met, and it is clear now that a target of only £20 million will be met, resulting in a £10 million overspend by the eight health boards which will have to be met out of the 1985 allocation.  The 1985 allocations are cut by 2 per cent and the effect of that together with the 1984 overrun will be a collective shortfall of £37 million or 5 per cent in 1985.  This will create great difficulties for the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the Minister to claim that we can have reductions in money allocations and that on the other hand we can increase services is stretching the imagination.  In 1984 the boards endeavoured to comply with the money allocation given to them and the resulting £10 million shortfall over the eight health boards which must <Col N="455" /> be met out of the 1985 allocation means that over the next two years this ongoing reduction in the money allocation is bound to result in cutbacks in services, closing of hospital wards and a lesser degree of health services to the communities which the boards serve.  It is not fair that the Minister should endeavour to suggest that increased services can be given for decreased moneys.  He must recognise that the boards had endeavoured over the last two or three years to cut back on what one would consider unnecessary spending.  This cannot go on indefinitely and the effect of it must ultimately be the laying off of staff, closing of hospital wards and reduced services.</P>
    <P>The health boards face a problem in relation to their allocations.  Let me refer to the Road Traffic Act decision, the increase in PRSI, the delay in social welfare payments and the withdrawal of food subsidies, all of which in turn have had an adverse effect on the financial aspects of the boards during 1984.  No recognition whatever was given by the Minister in relation to giving extra remuneration to the boards in order to compensate for these unforeseen cutbacks or shortfalls in 1984.  The Road Traffic Act decision taken in the High Court means that people involved in road accidents are now eligible for full health services in the health board hospitals, and no claims are being made against insurance as was the case heretofore when the insurance companies paid up for the hospital bills.  That is no longer legal and the boards are faced with these problems and they will receive no rebate from the insurance companies. Also there was no compensation for the increase in PRSI last year.  The withdrawal of the food subsidies also had its effect.  All these have resulted in the boards not being able to live within their allocation during 1984.  They face 1985 with a shortfall and the problem of the moneys not being available to meet the services.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister say that the boards have ample resources?  Cuts have been made in ongoing services each year since 1981.  We have a cut of over 5.5 per <Col N="456" /> cent in 1984 and we will have a further cut of over 5 per cent in 1985.  Further similar cuts are projected for 1986 and 1987.  These cuts are so high that they cannot be achieved without cutting services and shedding staff.  It is not helpful for the boards in the very difficult job they face to inform the public and the staff that the boards have ample resources. It is essential that the Minister say now openly and clearly that real cuts have been made in health funding, that further cuts are being made and that the quality and quantity of services will be affected. It is time for the Minister to face up to this situation.</P>
    <P>As chairman of a health board dealing with the board over number of years, I see the problems now facing the administrative staff of the board.  They will have problems with the people who are operating the services.  Nobody wants confrontation with the people who are responsible for carrying out services of the health boards.  Therefore, in order to avoid this situation, which is bound to crop up if the Minister pursues the course he is on at present and which is going to create terrible problems for the community the boards serve, the Minister should look seriously at it.</P>
    <P>In the document <i>Building on Reality</i> the Minister indicates that there are areas where he can make savings and collect moneys.  He says that he can save £2 million in the GMS.  How can this be done?  No indication is given.  Is it to be done by the doctors or will there be a cutback in medication supplied to the patients concerned?  If the cutback in consultant's fees is to be introduced I hope that we are not going to level that charge on to what we know as the new poor.  If this is done as indicated in the plan it will mean that that charge will go directly to the people whom the consultants are attending, therefore it will have no effect whatsoever on the consultants.  The people who will have to avail of the service will have to pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he is concerned about the mentally handicapped. I appeal to him that if that is so he must provide the moneys to implement <Col N="457" /> the communty services that are needed by the mentally handicapped in the various health board areas.  This is an area where the Minister must take action and provide health boards with sufficient money to enable them introduce these community services.  Fianna Fáil have a record of building up community services within the eight health board regions. With regard to the care of the aged they were responsible for introducing the best community service in Europe.  I hope that continues but, unfortunately, the indications are, following the Minister's meeting with the chairmen and CEOs of the eight health boards on Friday, that there is no great prospect of that.  That will have a disastrous effect on those who avail of those services.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister that before he meets those chairmen and CEOs in January he will rethink the various aspects of the proposals be put before the boards.  He should recognise the attitude of the chairmen who met him.  The Minister should have a rethink of his attitude as to how the boards should be run within the funds allocated by him.  Clearly that money will not be adequate to keep the health service going.  There is no point in fooling the public and saying that the boards can give a better service than before.  This amounts to the biggest confidence trick played on our people and I am surprised that a Labour Minister is guilty of attempting to foist it on our people.</P>

      <P>Yesterday evening the House was given a comprehensive overview of the performance of the health services in the ougoing year, 1984.  The House was also provided with quite a detailed prospectus for the future of those services over the next three years 1985, 1986 and 1987, under the aegis of the decisions arrived at in formulating the framework of the national economic plan, <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most striking features of the health services here over the last 20 years has been their rapid evolution into <Col N="458" /> a highly modern and sophisticated service from much humbler origins in the sixties and fifties.  Of course, as observed in so many other developed Western countries, progress has been accompanied by particular problems.  Principally, the intrinsically expensive cost nature of health services has tended to intensify, apart altogether from any consideration of general inflation and price movements. Nearly all inputs to health services are costly.  Most staff need to have a very high level of basic skills to begin with, and the technological revolution in medical care over the last ten or 15 years has demanded the recruitment of yet more skilled and often highly specialised staff to provide services.  The services are, by nature, demanding on the pay costs side as regards the numbers of staff needed, the type of staff needed and the presence of certain unavoidable elements of staffing outside of normal 9 am &mdash; 5 pm hours.</P>
    <P>In addition, of course, non-pay costs have escalated as well with the introduction of high technology items of equipment which have very significant acquisition, maintenance, operational and replacement costs.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised, both within and outside the health services, that this country has in recent years already reached the maximum upper limits of what we can afford to spend on health services, given our size, population and level of material wellbeing and wealth generation as witnesed by indicators such as GNP.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, this realisation, and the need to act responsibly and with maturity in tackling the consequences that flow from it, gives rise to problems.  A health service, which for so many years had tended to look upon the unprecedented real growth in the financial and personnel resources made available to it, as no more than its fair due, now finds that the era of boundless growth has ended, as indeed it has ended for public expenditure generally, not only here in Ireland, but throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>The readjustment which is now called for in response does not merely involve <Col N="459" /> the much maligned exercise of book balancing, rather, it places greater emphasis and, lets face it, greater strains on the managerial capacity of those charged with administering and managing the health services.  The readjustment is psychological also.</P>
    <P>Roughly speaking, non-capital expenditure on health services will have to be marginally reduced in real terms over the course of the next few years.  This implies that the health agencies themselves will have to become very involved in the construction and implementation of many and varied cost saving initiatives.</P>
    <P>Indeed, more generally, each and every aspect of service provision must henceforward be subject to an educated, informed and rational critical appraisal. Many would argue that this exercise is long overdue in any case, and it is long overdue, and that the current severe economic difficulties which we face as a people may yet serve a useful and productive purpose.</P>
    <P>There are three major essential headings which call to be discussed in the context of health costs over the next three years.  The first is the need to reduce and to eliminate all significant areas and practices of waste and inefficiency within the services.  That should be done in regard to all services, health and local authorities.  It is long overdue.  We must remember that we are spending taxpayers' money.  Taxpayers have reached the limit of their patience and are demanding real value for their money.  As far as we are concerned they are going to get it.  It is easy for the Opposition to suggest the spending of more resources.  We can all fall into that trap but the provision of the necessary finances is the problem.  Where is the extra money to come from?  Where are the cuts to be made?  There must be a balanced approach to this.  Any person who looks at what is happening in our health services will see that the schemes will operate in a balanced and orderly manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The second essential heading is the need to examine the contemporary <i>raison d'être</i> of services, programmes and individual institutions, in order to ascertain the degree to which real human needs in the community are being met in a positive, efficient and effective way.</P>
      <P>Finally, decisions must be taken identifying clearly priority areas which must be protected and strengthened to the extent that resources and their redistribution permit and unambiguously setting out practices and services which serve no real need, which are uneconomic and inefficent and which continue in operation due to tradition more than to any rational criterion.</P>
      <P>In the recent past the Department, with the co-operation of relevant agencies, have embarked upon a number of in-depth studies of particular aspects of health services provision.  These studies have focussed on aspects such as cost efficiency and comparative costings as between comparable institutions and services in different regions.  I was in the Department of Health for a short time and I was surprised to see the difference in figures between one institution and another.  It was an eye-opener.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cost efficiency studies already undertaken in a number of areas in the general hospitals sector have ranged over purchasing, heating-lighting, housekeeping and transport.  Further cost efficiency studies are now being undertaken in the area of hospital admissions policy, the excessive use of hospital laboratory services and arising from these studies, an examination is under way into the potential of five-day wards and indeed day beds as a real alternative to traditional practice for the many persons who do not require total continuous hospitalisation, but yet <Col N="461" /> who find themselves subject to long and inconvenient stays in hospital at present.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody could argue with that.  I was listening to the radio yesterday and somebody was talking about the five day hospitals and ridiculing it, saying people cannot arrange to get sick on a five day week.  We are well aware of that but a number of routine things can be done on the basis of a five day week.  We should not bring people in on a Friday afternoon to lodge them over the weekend, taking up beds and imposing on staff when it could be done in that way.  That is basically what we mean when we talk about a five day hospital. Of course there is a need for continuous hospital attention, but we must look at the other side of the coin.  This move is long overdue and when we go into it in greater detail, we will see the merits of such a move and the savings that can be made.</P>
    <P>These new initiatives are not an academic exercise.  The findings which emerge will be of considerable significance for the future of the services.  Already, useful and practical recommendations have emerged from these types of studies and have been communicated to the executive agencies in terms of principles of good practice.</P>
    <P>It may well be possible in future to set down criteria for admission of persons to hospital in order to eliminate the great bulk of unnecessary admissions.  I have no doubt that many other diverse elements of expenditure in the health services will need to be subjected to further studies in the future.</P>
    <P>In the area of comparative costing the Department have made available to various hospitals data as to how they compare with similar sister hospitals as regards costs and prices, etc.  This type of information will hopefully help agencies to identify particular areas of weakness in their own operations as regards financial performance.  It is also intended to develop and to refine these comparative cost data as an integral part of the accelerated movement towards greater value for money in the health services.</P>
    <P>Who can deny the philosophy of the <Col N="462" /> value for money?  I do not think anybody can.  Like many other services, the health services grew fat when we borrowed too much, but now when we have to be prudent and to pay our way, and help the beleaguered taxpayer and assure him that we are not going to mulct him further, we are making this move.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential, in addition, that there be readily available detailed information and data on the financial consequences of decisions taken by the medical profession.  We need to identify clearly the expenditure involved in treating individual patients and specified categories of patient, categorised by specialty or otherwise.  The new management information system currently coming on stream, will be extremely useful in this regard by providing ample opportunity and scope for the introduction of much more sophisticated costing systems. Again, this highlights that this is the way to do it.</P>
    <P>In particular, a pilot project on specialty costing has already been established in a particular hospital.  Hence, it will be possible to determine very accurately the level of financial resources required to support each consultant.  Arising from this, it is anticipated that clinicians will become more acutely aware of the fact that medical responsibility must encompass a broader financial cum managerial aspect, as opposed to a strictly medical role which is fulfilled without due regard to cost parameters.  One cannot argue about that.  The people must be aware, and the specialists in particular, that there is a cost element involved and they cannot continue reaching for the moon because this has been the tradition.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to press ahead rapidly with the development of computer facilities which will facilitate the provision of reliable data on cost implications arising from <i>de novo</i> service developments or expansion of existing facilities and services, as well as the budgetary and output data which will be needed to establish budgetary responsibility at levels which are responsible for generating significant expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is possible, although challengeable, <Col N="463" /> that the growth of expenditure on health services over the past ten years has meant that there is much greater room for cost reduction and reallocation of resources than was previously the case.  The need for this rationalisation of services will have to be achieved in two ways.  First, as the national plan makes clear, we need to shift resources away from cost-intensive institutional services and towards the community services, which in the case of a substantial number of patients, is likely to offer equivalent, or indeed superior services overall at much lower cost to the taxpayer, and I believe a much more personal service to patients.  Moreover, within the framework of the institutional services themselves, much needs to be done to streamline services by removing from service old, outmoded institutions which are no longer appropriate to the needs of a modern health service.  Here again, the national plan faces reality.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is an undue emphasis at the present time on the effect on our services of the levels of Exchequer allocation which it has been possible to provide.  Our health services are, however, by international standards, extremely good.  The past two decades and particularly the seventies have seen many advances in medicine, often involving the provision of new and expensive high technology equipment, and an increasing tendency towards specialisation in the practice of medicine.</P>
    <P>These advances have expanded the scope of diagnosis and care.  Some examples of the improvements in treatment which have occurred are as follows: open heart surgery; haemodialysis; joint replacement surgery, in particular, total hip replacement, which has given new life to many people who are suffering intense pain; intensive care, particularly neo-natal intensive care, where there have been major developments over the past 15 years.  These developments have given new hope to many persons.</P>
    <P>Developments in diagnostic techniques include computerised tomography which was introduced in the seventies and has had a major impact on the investigation <Col N="464" /> of brain lesions and the detection of cancer; diagnostic ultrasound, now widely used in many specialties; endoscopy which has greatly enhanced the information available to clinicians on many internal parts of the body; and laboratory investigation, the range of which has expanded enormously.</P>
    <P>At primary care level there have been a number of significant changes over the past decade in the services provided.  The introduction of the choice of doctor scheme in 1972 was a major advance on the former dispensary system.  The past decade has also seen a rationalisation and improvement of the public health nursing service.  Both of these developments contributed to a substantial improvement in the quality of primary health care available to the community and particularly to the less well off sections of the population. Improvements in community care also favoured particular target groups &mdash; for example, the mentally handicapped and many psychiatric patients who can now be treated in the community rather than in institutions.</P>
    <P>We can see over the past few years the way our health care service has expanded and the way our society has become so health conscious.  When we hear criticism of our health service we wonder what people are talking about.  Our hospitals and our services are first class.  What is the great problem?  Who is without health care?</P>
    <P>Additionally, the scope of the health services has widened to encompass new services principally in the community care sector.  A prime example is the increasing role of the health agencies in the provision of personal welfare services in the form of financial and non-financial supports for the relief of social stress in the community.</P>
    <P>In commenting, therefore, on the large increases which have occurred in spending, this range of improvements should also be borne in mind.  It is not simply an escalation of costs that we are talking about; it is a health service which has changed significantly in terms of the quantity and quality of the service it provides.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> On the capital side there is much that is positive to report.  The 1985 allocation is £58 million.  The provision for 1986 will be £58 million, and the provision for 1987 will be £61 million.</P>
    <P>This will be sufficient to meet the cost of the continued development and improvement of facilities.  It will of course be necessary to align the pace and emphasis of capital development with the funds available.  One good thing about the plan is that it sets out a three-year programme. We know what the capital programme will be and the agencies can fit in with the capital allocation that will be available rather than wondering from year to year how much they will get.  That is the kind of planning that is long overdue.  This plan will give us a better health service.</P>
    <P>The priority development areas in the capital programme are: rationalisation of the acute general hospital services.  In this context, developments undertaken will essentially replace existing outdated institutions, and facilities surplus to essential service requirements will be closed.  There is no point in filling a building with beds just because it is there.  An improvement in standards of facilities for psychiatric patients, the mentally handicapped and the elderly.  The provision of facilities for the treatment and rehabilitation of drug abusers.  The provision of further community health centres and clinics. The development of facilities for the physically handicapped.  It is noteworthy that the 1985 capital allocation will provide construction work for an average of 1,750 people throughout the year.  That clearly indicates the commitment of this Government over the next three years and the type of programme they are undertaking in a prudent and caring way.</P>
    <P>I would urge all concerned to approach the future financing and organisation of the health services on a more constructive and optimistic note than has hitherto prevailed. Once there is any mention of the budgets coming out a number of health boards become paranoid about their existence.  Of course they will continue to exist, but like any other operation they must exist within their budgets.  Certain moneys are being allocated and they have <Col N="466" /> a duty to operate efficiently within their budget.  That is not imposing any hardship on the health boards but it is imposing a responsibility on them to manage well and to give a good and caring health service.  It is scarcely too much to expect that with the goodwill and co-operation of all concerned the other side of the equation can be spelled out in the detail necessaay to produce a workable plan.</P>
    <P>Having given the information as to what we are prepared to spend over the next three years on the capital side, it is a question right across the board of ensuring that the taxpayer is getting value for money.  If we did not do that we would be irresponsible.  We all recognise that taxpayers are being taxed to the limits. The Government recognise it and have to act accordingly.  We are acting prudently and humanely and I am satisfied that our health service will continue to be excellent and that the people involved will give the same dedication and service they have always given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate which was opened last night in a very reasoned and responsible way by our spokesman on health, Deputy O'Hanlon.  Everyone who heard him will agree that his contribution was extremely fair, dignified and reflected not only the views of this party but also the concern and the worry of the vast majority of the Irish people, particularly the poorer sections of the community and the parents of young families who are most dependent on the health and social services provided for them by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the view that there is a need for a regular review of all our services and, in particular, the cost of providing those services.  I am honest enough to admit that health services are no different from any other service provided by the Government.  As a member of the Committee on Public Expenditure it is my business to be interested in such costs and <Col N="467" /> the benefits derived generally from the expenditure of taxpayers' money which was referred to on so many occasions by the previous speaker.  It is entirely different when the Government decide for purely monetarist reasons to cut back on a service which is so basic to the health and survival of our people and on which the poorer and middle classes in society are most dependent.</P>
    <P>The speech we heard tonight from the Minister is no different in content and in philosophy from the economic lectures we have been getting from the Government side of the House over the past two years.  In recent months we have seen Government Ministers pursuing such courses and such action with almost sadistic pleasure, and with no attempt or obvious desire to monitor the social cost &mdash; I emphasise the social cost &mdash; of their decisions which are great, particularly when you relate them to the health and social services.  There was no attempt to monitor or measure the economic cost of some of these harsh decisions in terms of job losses.  The cost in job losses is not the only cost to the State.  We have to try to gauge and to measure the social costs associated with the problem of unemployment when this philosophy is extended into the personal and sensitive area of health administration to the point where services are likely to collapse.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the health boards were becoming paranoid about their inability to continue to provide services. They are not becoming paranoid.  They are extremely concerned about what 1985 will bring in terms of their inability to cater for the health needs of their areas. They are concerned about the fact that many lives may be put at risk.  I do not want to sound sensational but, if you speak to members of health boards, you find that they are concerned that the cutbacks could lead to essential hospital services not being provided for the people who are most dependent on them.  When we have reached this stage in relation to health administration, this House must call a halt and warn the Minister of the inevitable outcome of his actions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> Regardless of what the previous speaker had to say it is a fact &mdash; and this is not a political statement &mdash; that health boards are not able to discharge their statutory responsibility to provide for the health needs of the people in their respective areas.  If the Minister is in touch with the situation he must surely realise that. One is tempted to ask a question which was raised here last night by Deputy O'Hanlon.  How much is the Minister in touch with the situation?  Last night Deputy O'Hanlon read to the House two replies to questions tabled by him in the Dáil seeking information about serious deficiencies.  In both cases the Minister's replies were seriously evasive which would tend to indicate that he is not in touch with the realities in his Department.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting some members of the Midland Health Board considered whether it would be more honourable for them to resign rather than to become whipping boys for the Minister or the Government.  They debated at length and with great concern the inevitable result of undermining the services in the Midland Health Board area.  On reflection &mdash; and they were right &mdash; they decided to stay together to resist in so far as they could the further consequences for the people in their area if the services were to be administered by the Minister or his Department.  That is what would happen if the members of the board found it necessary to disband themselves.  It was a responsible decision and, in the long term, it will bring the best possible benefit to the people they represent on the board.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what has happened to Government back benchers. Have they not conveyed to the Taoiseach and the Minister the realities as conveyed to them day after day in their constituencies? Have they too fallen the victims of this remote and totally insensitive Administration?  In the Midland Health Board area the CEO and the board are faced with a further cut amounting in real terms to £2 million.  The revenue allocation is £55 million from which unavoidable over-expenditure in 1984 <Col N="469" /> and additional costs for the general medical services scheme have to be deducted, not to talk of the removal of food subsidies. So far this year, these have cost the board £26,000.  The allocation must also absorb all price increases in terms of drugs and essential medical supplies.  The Minister should know that this is an impossible task for the board, coming as it does for the third year in a row.  It is tantamount to the closing of one of the larger hospitals in the Midland Health Board area, the closing of perhaps two geriatric hospitals there, or making redundant some 200 nurses.  That is the extent and effect of the proposed cutback of £2 million.  Members of this party on health boards have acted in a reasonable and responsible manner over the past two years.  They have refrained from making political capital out of a service which is so personal and vital.  They have resisted the temptation to organise protests, which were very much a part of the scene when this party were in Government.  I would encourage them tonight to retain this dignified stance and let the public coolly judge what has been happening for the past two years to the services on which they are dependent and is going to become progressively worse in 1985.</P>
    <P>Hospital staffs and employees of health boards have displayed a great willingness to maintain services under difficult conditions. Indeed, members of the public have displayed patience and understanding in relation to some of the cutbacks with which they have had to contend, over the past year in particular.  By his continuing determination to run down the services, the Minister is now totally disregarding and ignoring this commitment on the part of doctors, nurses and health board personnel at all levels.  I am inclined to ask, in conclusion, where is the social conscience of this Government which has been so vocally outlined by them in this House over the past two years?  Where is the commitment to a healthier society, to which they referred in the recent so-called policy document for the next two years?  The only commitment displayed in this House was the recent announcement to extend our <Col N="470" /> licensing laws, to put young people more at risk in relation to alcoholism, drug abuse and shamefully, to use them for the purpose of extracting additional taxation in an area which no public representative should condone or promote.  That is the situation in which we find ourselves tonight debating Deputy O'Hanlon's motion.  I hope that the vast majority of the Members of this House, if they have any interest in or commitment to the social requirements of our community, will vote in favour of the motion which has been responsibly tabled and credibly debated by Deputy O'Hanlon and the other speakers who contributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat.  It is difficult, with the time limitation, to express oneself fully on the question of the appalling cutbacks in our health services. One can take it that the adage which speaks of prevention being better than cure in all probability emanates from the culture or subculture of medicine.  If that is so, I am afraid it is not being honoured in the Department of Health or by the Minister or Ministers of State.</P>
      <P>We all know, in respect of last year especially, that there has been an appalling neglect of our people in respect of the medical care to which they are entitled and to which they had been accustomed under better and more caring Governments.  Other speakers have dealt comprehensively, in the time available to them, with certain matters.  I would hope, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to substantiate what I say be referring to specific cases.  Straight away I refer-to the position of the older people in our community.  The present Government and their spokespersons are the best people I have ever heard for enunciating verbal commitments.  They have a verbal commitment to everything that is virtuous, but a practical commitment to nothing except things that are negative.  They talk about their commitment to the old aged and I give two instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the case of the old person <Col N="471" /> who is not in need of direct medical attention and whose family are happy that he or she should be accommodated in one of our institutions.  We all know that over the years the situation there was that when those people entered the institution they yielded up their old age pension book.  The manager took from it a certain amount of money and returned to the people in question an allowance which was called comfort money.  In the Eastern Health Board in 1983 that comfort money was £10.50.  We know that since then the old age pension has been increased, but not one penny has been given to these people.  They have been obliged on that amount to look after their personal needs in the area of laundry, toiletry, newspapers, nipping out for a drink, buying a box of matches and attending to those normal requirements.  Remember that there was one famous Fine Gael Government that went down in history when the Minister took one shilling from the old age pensioners.  This Government under the present Taoiseach &mdash; that man who was referred to today as being full of tenderness for Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, a lady who could do without his tenderness &mdash; is showing such tenderness to the old ladies of Ireland that under his Government the allowance which existed in 1983 has not been increased by one penny.  Those unfortunate people are expected to attend to their normal comforts on the same money as in 1983.</P>
    <P>Before they were elected, this Government boasted that they would provide what they called dental and opthalmic treatment for people.  That has not been extended to any great degree, but again I stay with the elderly.  Those elderly who are holders of medical cards were entitled, under our Government, to obtain free opthalmic treatment.  I hope the Minister is listening, because I trust he will reply to specific cases being made to him and to his junior Minister and tell me how it is that, notwithstanding promises made, any medical card holder at the moment is unable to get opthalmic treatment, and has been unable to get it over the past two months.  The Minister and <Col N="472" /> his junior Minister will say that they have not cut back on any service, but they are not issuing any forms in respect of that service.  Elderly people who are in urgent need of spectacles but who are unable to pay for them are groping around while the Government speak of their commitment. They give verbal commitment to everything that is negative.  Likewise, married women with families must neglect their own teeth because of the failure of the Government to provide for them in that respect.  That is the gratitude we show to those great ladies who work so hard to rear their children and who look after the children's dental care at the expense of their own.  It is a measure of the commitment of this great Taoiseach who, according to today's papers, was full of kindness for the British Prime Minister, this Taoiseach who, we read, is such a kind man that he would not wish to offend the Prime Minister or cause her pain.  He is full of tenderness, but what tenderness has he displayed for the women of Ireland who are going around with mouths full of bad teeth?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give another instance which underlines the lack of commitment to the handicapped on the part of the Government.  Last week I asked the Minister about a handicapped person in my constituency who up to September of this year was in receipt of both a mobility and a domiciliary allowance. He is in a wheelchair.  Fortunately for him he married and he notified the Eastern Health Board accordingly in the hope, foolishly as it transpired, that he might thereby be entitled to bigger allowances. Instead, the allowances he was getting as a single man were removed.  In reply to my question in that regard the Minister said that, because of the operation of a means test in respect of the two allowances in question, the allowances were withdrawn.  This means that little Terry <Col N="473" /> Boland in his wheelchair and newly married must, apart from all his other problems, suffer the embarrassment of trying to exist with his new wife without any allowances whatever.  Neither the social welfare workers who are paid to look after such people nor the health board nor indeed the Department had the commitment to request the Minister for Finance to make the adjustment in the relatively small income of Mr. Boland's wife.  That is a measure of the respect the Government have for the institution of marriage, not to talk about people.  If this man had not notified the health board of his marriage he would have continued to draw both allowances.  Likewise, if the lady had merely gone to live with him without marrying him, the allowances would have been continued.  Where, then, is the evidence of the Government's commitment to the handicapped?</P>
      <P>Last evening the Minister of State accused us of criticising without indicating what should be done.  Is there a new concept that we are to have Government by Opposition?  I would remind the Minister that the budget deficit is now one and a half times what it was when we were in Government and that borrowing has increased out of all proportion to what it was then.  Why can the Minister and the Government not maintain the standard of service to those people who are ill?  If they have not got the money for health services they must have it for something else.  Their commitment to other requirements must be greater than to the one they talk so much about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given as examples the situation of the elderly in our institutions whose comfort allowances have not been increased for the past year and a half.  I have given the example of Terry Boland whose allowances have been withdrawn because of his having married a lady whose total income is about £75 per week and from which she must pay income tax and so on.  I have given the example of the old age person who is to be found in any constituency in Dublin and who, under Fianna Fáil, was entitled to free spectacles but who is told now, having <Col N="474" /> waited two months, that application forms in that respect will not be available for the next three months.</P>
    <P>To prove my point about the Government's commitment only to what is negative, I will conclude by remarking that for the past year the Government, and especially the Minister for Health, appear to have a decided and practical commitment to the provision of condoms. Their attitude in this respect would lead one to believe that the non-availability of these devices free of charge is going between young people and their sleep.  I know 99 per cent of the young people in my constituency.  They can speak freely to me but I have not yet heard any of them complain about the non-availability of condoms.  Instead, they are concerned that they have no employment, that there are no worthwhile leisure activities available for them.  They are concerned, too, that their parents and their grandparents cannot get from the State the assistance to which they were entitled when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    <P>Week after week there are leaks from Fine Gael Party meetings and from the Government to the effect that the big question at the moment is whether condoms should be made available to people at 18 or at 16.  Is this because the Minister is unable to keep open many of the maternity units?  Are the parents of these young people concerned about the non-availability to them, free of charge, of condoms? How many young people are concerned about it?  It is just a diversionary tactic taking emphasis away from the elderly who are in urgent need of medical attention and cannot get it; from the housewife who is in urgent need of dental treatment and cannot get it; from Terry Boland who in any Christian society would still be receiving his allowances; from the fact that the deficit is higher now than ever recorded, that the budget deficit next year will be higher than ever it was, that the borrowing is higher than ever.  Yet the Taoiseach's concern is for the tender feelings of Mrs. Margaret Thatcher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Our amendment <Col N="475" /> deals with two specific matters.  Its aim is to highlight the brazen hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil in putting down a motion demanding that health services be restored to the level which has hitherto prevailed.  We have asked that the level be restored to that prevailing prior to 1982.</P>
      <P>Apart from highlighting the inconsistency and brazenness of Fianna Fáil we wish to highlight the hypocrisy and inconsistency of the Government.  This is precisely what they were demanding in October 1982.  Tonight and last night Government spokesmen have been repeating practically word for word what the Fianna Fáil Government were saying in 1982.  Fianna Fáil in Opposition tonight are demanding what the Coalition, then in Opposition, were demanding in 1982. If you change the names on the speeches you will have Tweedledum and Tweedledee, with very little to choose between them.</P>
      <P>That is why our amendment has been worded in the way it is.  Very few Government spokesmen have indicated that the budget for health services will be increased in the next three years.  Of course they have not indicated that 3,000 jobs will be lost in the health services in that time.  The loss of jobs will have a very dramatic effect on the standard of the services provided, particularly with our expanding population.  It is fair to say that many services already have been pared to the bone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment we give to our sick, our handicapped and our elderly must be the yardstick by which we judge ourselves, and it is precisely those people who are affected by health cuts and by the manner in which the Government and previous Governments cut our health services.  It is clear that there was an attempt to create two health services, a health service for those in the private area who can afford to pay and a basic service with long waiting lists for those who cannot afford to pay.  It is fairly common for those who cannot afford to pay to have to wait from four to eight months for tests and there <Col N="476" /> are two year waiting lists for dental treatment. A report from the Eastern Health Board gives a long list of the kind of waiting periods there are for dental treatment.</P>
    <P>Various Government spokesmen have made the point that they have not got the money to provide health services, yet the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General announced that £3,500 million tax is uncollected.  At the same time it is announced that in the Revenue Commissioners there is a shortage of 500 staff. The £3,500 million of uncollected tax is three and a half times the total cost of the health services in a year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Government and the Minister for Health, rather than pursue the financial management epic which they have developed, to set about ensuring that those responsible for paying tax would pay it as the PAYE sector are doing, and that those who should be paying their health contributions should have it collected.  The Revenue Commissioners should be brought up to full strength to ensure that all outstanding taxes will be collected.  Then perhaps we would not be here debating cuts in our health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We put down this motion because of our concern at the rapidly falling health care.  Having listened to the two Ministers of State we are even more concerned because it appears to me that the Government do not know what is happening in the health services.  Indeed the Government are uninterested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make a few comments on Deputy Donnellan's contribution.  He told us last night that all health agencies would be informed shortly of the level of permissible spending in 1985 and in the light of the funds that can be provided have to determine the measures that can be taken.  That was told to us on Tuesday night.  On Monday I was at a health board meeting and the CEO of the board told us that the board had been notified of the allocation for next year late on Wednesday, 15 November.  Our allocation for <Col N="477" /> 1985 will be £56.980 million, £1.5 million short.</P>
    <P>It is obvious the Government do not know what is happening.  Deputy Donnellan said last night that it is difficult to be precise at this stage about the extent of the problem.  He was referring to the 1984 deficit.  On Friday last the Minister for Health told the CEOs and chairmen of health boards: &ldquo;On the basis of information supplied by the boards the deficit could reach £10 million&rdquo;.  Last week somebody, somewhere, seemed to know the allocations which the health boards would be given and what the deficit would be, but this week it appears that nobody knows, that the allocations have not been made yet and therefore it is difficult to know at this stage what the deficit will be.</P>
    <P>I have here a document called <i>Building on Reality</i>.  It is a bound volume presented to Fine Gael and Labour Deputies and Senators.  Not once in any of the paragraphs on health does it appear that there will be any hardship in 1985.  There is not as word about the allocations being reduced by £37 million in the next few years; there is nothing about the two thirds of the vacancies that will occur in 1985 being left unfilled; not a word about the £45 million deduction from the payroll. In this document they admit there will be £10 million taken off the health board payroll each year and that £6 million will be collected from private patients using State hospitals and from consultants using equipment.  I am totally confused as to where the Government stand on this serious issue of the provision of proper and adequate health services.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the motion states:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that the Government has continued to provide an excellent standard of health care....</P>
    <P>Anyone who listened to the debate or to the two Ministers of State who spoke knows that we are not providing an excellent standard of health care.  In regard to the excellent health care, ask the man <Col N="478" /> who had his eyes tested and whose spectacles are now ready but who cannot get them until next year because the health board has no money to pay for them.  Ask the young man I referred to last night who was bleeding from a kidney.  His surgeon wrote to him saying they would have the investigations carried out as soon as possible.  He stated: &ldquo;As you are very well aware we have some problems with cutbacks in so far as 40 per cent of our beds in the GU unit are closed at present&rdquo;.  Ask that man what he thinks about the excellent health service.  Ask the doctor from the midlands who wrote to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin in seeking an appointment for a child.  He was told: &ldquo;Unfortunately in the absence of approval from the Department of Health of staff required to support the outpatient clinic it has been necessary to reduce from 1 May 1984 the extent of services available.  We regret, therefore, it is not possible at this time to make the appointment you request&rdquo;.  Ask the people in Wilton Hospital in Cork. Ask those who sit around for five hours looking at empty beds and who cannot get into them what they think about the excellent service.</P>
    <P>An optician in the north-west sent me this letter:</P>
    <P>Dear Sir, it is with regret that the above scheme has been suspended for the time being due to financial constraints.</P>
    <P>That was the choice of optician scheme. Ask them what they think of the excellent health service.  Not one of them would agree with the level of service that is being provided.</P>
    <P>Last night we enumerated the problems that were created this year &mdash; the cutback in the number of beds available and the cutback in the number of admissions because wards were closed.  As regards admissions a theme which has been running through the Minister of State's speech is that the Government are assessing methods of admittance and who should be admitted to hospitals.  It is <Col N="479" /> essential that the people who are qualified to decide who should be admitted should make the decision and not the Minister or the Minister of State.  There has been a cutbacks on locums, on overtime and on overtime at weekends. Orthopaedic units have been closed and there are no knee joint or hip joint replacement being carried out in some of these units.  There is an increasing demand for psychiatric services.  There is an increasing demand for admission to hospital by the elderly.  They cannot survive outside because of the total inadequate services provided for them both in health and social welfare.  One psychiatrist told me that more people are coming to his outpatient clinic with depression and loss of confidence.  That is the direct result of the Government's economic and social policy.  I am convinced the Government do not know anything about it.  Last week they knew about the allocation, this week they do not.  Last week they knew about the deficit, this week they do not. That is how they operate.</P>
    <P>While we are primarily concerned with the health services tonight the economy is being run in the same way.  My colleague, Deputy Tunney, referred to the London summit and even there we find the same kind of attitude.  We do not know where we are going.</P>
    <P>Valuable equipment in many hospitals is not being used because the staff are not there to use it.  Buildings are not being used.  There are no staff in 14 mental handicap units, yet in the national plan we were told that development of mental handicap services was a priority.  Community care services, dental services and opthalmic services have been reduced. Essential drugs have been removed from the list.</P>
    <P>We have been told that next year two-thirds of the vacancies that will occur will not be filled.  How can one run a health service if two-thirds of the jobs are not filled?  How can one run an operating theatre if one is short of a nurse?  That would put a life at risk.  If two-thirds of the staff are dropped there will be a theatre but no operations.  Some areas <Col N="480" /> will be left with no services.  This was stated in the document the Minister gave out last Friday.  The same paragraph was read out by Deputy Donnellan last night pointing out that the criteria which applied throughout the Civil Service will apply to the health boards.  In the Minister's Department there were three nurses and two vacancies occurred but neither was filled.  If this is how the service is to be run there will not be any service by the end of 1985.  The Government should rethink this.</P>
    <P>As regards the reduced stay from seven days to five days Deputy O'Brien explained his concept of that reduction. It is obvious that people do not get sick on a five-day week basis.  It would be ideal if we could arrange it that way. There is reduced locum coverage, substitution is to be eliminated and premiums to staff are to be done away with &mdash; in other words, there is to be no overtime. Advertising is to be eliminated.  God be with the days when all advertising by health boards was to recruit staff.  The latest advertisements are to inform the public of the services they can no longer provide.  The reason they can no longer provide them is because the Government have given them an insufficient allocation.</P>
    <P>The Government have statutory responsibility for policy and the health boards have responsibility to implement that policy.  What can the health boards do?  They cannot fulfil their statutory obligation.  There are non-statutory services such as grants to voluntary bodies and home help.  Are they to abandon these?  The Minister told them last Friday to reduce sick leave levels to not more than 4 per cent.  How do you do that particularly if there is a flu epidemic?</P>
    <P>The Government have no concept of what is happening.  Last week when the Taoiseach was speaking to the Simon Community he said that poverty in Ireland was now affecting groups of people other than those previously identified as poor.  Insufficient and insecure incomes and poor housing were the more obvious aspects of poverty.  At least the Taoiseach identified it but for the last two years he <Col N="481" /> has not done anything about it.  In fact, he made it worse.  He created a new poor. Those who are above the medical card limit have to pay for school buses, drugs and so on.  They now have to pay £28 for drugs before they get any refund.  When the Government came to power the limit was £12.  The means test is administered more strictly than ever before.  I call on the Government to review the position. Their policies will create unprecedented hardship.  It will become worse in 1985.  I have no doubt but that throughout 1985 we will see the serious consequences of the way the Government are administering the health service.</P>
    <P>It is significant to note that the Government had only two speakers, one last night and one tonight and that they did not use the time available to them from 8.10 p.m. to 8.15 p.m..  I would have liked if the Minister had come in and explained to us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Flynn on Tuesday, 13 November 1984.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's failure to control the price of electricity and, in view of the serious hardship the high cost of electricity is causing countless families and the loss of jobs in industry resulting from the lack of competitiveness, calls upon the Government to withdraw its approval for the recent price increase pending the publication and a full debate on the report of the inquiry into the high cost of electricity in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To this motion the following amendment was moved by the Minister for the Environment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy has recently <Col N="486" /> received for examination the report of the Inquiry into Electricity Prices, notes that the cost behind electricity supply result for decisions taken over many decades with the approval of successive Governments, notes that the finances of the ESB must be assured to maintain an appropriate level of service to all consumers, endorses the view of the Minister for Energy that it is likely that electricity prices can only be reduced through long term structural measures which allow for the regional, employment, and social, as well as economic aspects of electricity supply, and approves the decision of the Government to allow the recent increase in electricity charges, as recommended by the National Prices Commission, which keeps the increase in electricity prices below the already reduced level of general inflation.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the information requested by the Deputy:</P>
      <P>(a)  The allocations to the Office of the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs since its establishment are as follows: 1983 &mdash; £110,000; 1984 &mdash; £135,000.  In each year the major part of the allocation is directed as a grant to the Council for the Status of Women &mdash; £75,840 in 1983 and £72,000 in 1984.  The latter figure does not include the cost of rental and outfitting of the council's new premises at 64 Lower Mount Street which is expected to be in the order of £12,700. It is intended that this expenditure will also be met from the Minister of State's 1984 allocation.</P>
      <P>(b)  Within the total allocations, the Minister also has discretion to allocate grants to organisations involved in support and developmental activities in the area of women's affairs and, while some of these bodies might have an interest and involvement in the area of family law reform, this is not of itself a criterion for eligibility in so far as the funds available to the Minister of State are concerned.</P>

Widow's pension was awarded from 8 June 1984 <Col N="378" /> at the end of the six weeks.  Regulations provide that both pensions cannot be paid concurrently.  While invalidity pension cannot be paid to the person concerned with her widow's pension, she is entitled to receive disability benefit at half the appropriate rate and this benefit has been put into payment from the time title to widow's pension began.</P>
      <P>The amount of the reduction in her arrears of widow's pension represents the amount of invalidity pension advanced to her during the overlapping period less the amount of disability benefit due.  The balance payable has been issued to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>The milk cessation premium scheme which I announced recently and which was advertised in the national newspapers on Saturday last provides for a payment of 70p per gallon (to be paid in five instalments of 14p) to producers who undertake to discontinue milk production for as long as the super-levy system operates. The purpose of the scheme is to free quotas in order that a national reserve can be set up to cater for producers whose deliveries in 1983 have been substantially affected by animal disease or certain other exceptional factors.</P>
      <P>The quantity of milk covered by the scheme will be limited to 7 million gallons and in the event of applications exceeding that quantity selection will be made by ballot.  Application forms may be had from creameries or direct from my Department.  Completed forms must reach the Department not later than 10 December 1984.  Applicants should not regard themselves as participants in the scheme until they have been notified to that effect by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any producer who delivered milk to a co-operative-dairy in 1983 and is therefore entitled to a milk quota under the super-levy arrangements can apply. He must undertake to cease milk production on his holding(s) for as long as the super levy-system operates even in the event of the levy system being extended to beyond its initial five year period.  He must also undertake that, in the event of his holding(s) being transferred by sale, lease or inheritance, it will be made clear to the tranferee that the quota entitlement relating to the holding(s) has been surrendered.  In addition to undertaking to discontinue milk production, applicants will be required to set out details of milk deliveries made by them in 1983 and if appropriate in 1984 and to have these details certified by the co-operative-dairy <Col N="380" /> concerned before the application is sent to the Department.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The precise arrangements for the policing of particular areas <Col N="381" /> are a matter for the Garda authorities and the allocation of manpower between patrol duty and other duties is a matter for the local Garda officers having regard to available resources, local circumstances and other demands on Garda services.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are aware of the concern of residents of the Pinewood and Willow Park areas of Ballymun and the Oldtown Road area of Santry about crime in their areas.  The authorities state that these areas are receiving as much Garda attention as practicable at present having regard to other commitments.  One extra garda was assigned to Ballymun station earlier this month and the Garda authorities propose to allocate two more gardaí there at the end of next week.  The increased strength of the station party will enable the local Garda officers to improve the patrolling arrangements for Ballymun Garda sub-district generally, including the areas referred to, and the question of further improvements in the policing arrangements for the sub-district will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>As regards crime in the part of the Santry area served from Santry Garda station, the Garda authorities report that provisional figures for indictable crime in the Santry Garda sub-district during the first nine months in 1984 indicate a significant reduction in the level of crime in that area as compared with previous years.</P>
