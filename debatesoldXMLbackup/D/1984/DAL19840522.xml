      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will publish the contents of the declined cases agreement entered into by those companies operating in the motor insurance business in Ireland and his predecessor in 1981; if such an agreement has been treated as a secret agreement; and, if so, whether he believes the agreement can be of assistance to young drivers looking for motor insurance cover if such drivers are not aware of the contents of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement made by the motor insurers with the Minister in 1981 in relation to declined cases is not secret.  I can give the Deputy a copy of it now if he likes.  There is, however, an agreement made between the insurers themselves supplemental to the principal agreement defining amongst other things how the declined cases committee will work and how declined cases will be allocated amongst insurers.  My Department have asked the insurers, and they have agreed, to let the Deputy have sight of <Col N="1542" /> this agreement.  If the Deputy contacts me I will have the appropriate arrangements made.</P>
      <P>As far as young drivers are concerned, if any such driver is having difficulty in getting quotations for insurance cover, he or she should contact the insurance section of my Department who will explain the terms and operation of the declined cases agreement and will provide any assistance necessary to obtain cover.  I would point out in this context, however, that any quote obtained by, or for, such persons, which is in line with the approved rates for the company concerned, puts their case outside the scope of the declined cases agreement.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that a detailed knowledge of the agreement would improve the prospects of young drivers getting cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when I contacted his Department last January I was refused a copy of the agreement and that it was only when I put down the question that contact was made by the officials of his Department indicating that the agreement was not secret?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Deputy issued a press statement on 2 February during a period in which the Department were examining his request and making contact with the insurers in relation to the supplemental agreement. The Deputy may have a copy of the main agreement and may have sight of the supplemental agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the hundreds of complaints received by Deputies regarding the impossibility of obtaining motor insurance for young people are proof that this agreement is not known and not generally available?  In reply to a question last week the Minister informed me that seven cases were referred to the declined cases agreement since 1981.  Of 17 insurance companies who were requested to insure a young person aged 20, only one would agree to do so.  Would the Minister not agree that the whole system of insurance for young people is discriminatory <Col N="1543" /> and a farce and that something needs to be done to bring insurance companies to heel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is discrimination against young drivers.  The Deputy is over-dramatising the whole area of insurance for young drivers.  My Department have made inquiries among insurance companies and are satisfied that a number of companies are taking on young people.  There is a clear procedure with regard to declined cases.  If Deputies wish to bring any specific cases to my notice, they can do so by contacting the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I sent the Minister's Department a copy of the statement I issued last February in which I instanced 16 companies who refused insurance for young people but I still have not received a response.  Neither did I get a response to the question last week.  Would the Minister be kind enough to send to every Member of this House and of the Seanad a copy of the declined cases agreement so that the information contained in it could be spread throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to let the Deputy have a copy of the declined cases agreement, which is not a public document but an agreement between my Department and the insurers.  There is a supplemental agreement between the insurers covering the manner in which they will handle various cases amongst themselves.  The Deputy may have sight of the latter agreement and that is as far as I can go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there are two types of discrimination against young people in regard to motor insurance?  In the first instance insurance companies may fail to give a quote and, in the second instance, where they do give a quote it will be ridiculously high, well beyond the means of the person to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Insurance companies have been sanctioned rates for tendering <Col N="1544" /> for all classes of motor insurance.  It is a very complex area and one must take into account such things as experience, type of car and whether the driver has a full or provisional licence.  It is not a simple case to answer.  There is a procedure under which young people who are not in a position to obtain a quotation or are being refused quotations can have their cases fully examined.  The matter should be dealt with through my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>There were several cases in the last four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister also make available to me a copy of the agreement and allow me sight of the supplementary arrangements?  That would be very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should only be too happy to do that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the difficulties which young people face because insurance companies give such high quotations that they far exceed, in some cases, the value of the car? Because they cannot get insurance cover, many are driving around completely uninsured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, there is a procedure under which such people can make contact with the insurance section of my Department and their case can then be fully processed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism whether he is aware of reports that between 10,000 and 15,000 drivers have ceased continuing their motor insurance contracts with the PMPA Insurance Company Ltd.  Since an administrator was appointed to manage the affairs of the company and do not appear to have obtained motor insurance cover elsewhere; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware of the reports referred to by the Deputy, I do not believe from the information available to me that the situation as alleged in the reports in question represents the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>What means has the Minister at his disposal to indicate as incorrect the reports which have been published which say that 15,000 fewer motorists are now insured than before the PMPA went into administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have made an investigation into this matter which indicates quite clearly that the number of policyholders of motor insurance has increased in 1983 over 1982 figures and it is projected that it will increase in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to clarify the position, is the Minister aware that from a survey carried out by the Garda Síochána&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please, Deputy, supplementary questions are for clarifying information already given by the Minister. If a Deputy asks is the Minister aware and then proceeds to give a lot of information, that is not a question in any shape or form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept totally the Chair's ruling.  I want to make this point, if I may.  All the information published indicates that the present level of uninsured driving is something of the order of <Col N="1546" /> 25 per cent of all drivers.  A report was published some short time ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely asking the Minister to tell the House the published information which he has to show that all the reports which have been made public and the results of the Garda survey are incorrect.  He has not given that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be another question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put down a number of questions, if it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may respond to the Deputy, not particularly in relation to PMPA, the insurance industry is a fairly competitive one.  Companies may increase the number of policyholders, or a number may not renew their policies. I am aware of that and it is generally acknowledged that there is an overall level of uninsured driving which is usually estimated to be around 10 per cent.  I am also aware that the Garda are intensifying their surveillance in such cases.  I am further aware that a number of cars have been taken off the road in recent years because of the general recession, or because the person no longer wants to continue driving.  There is also the fact that people change their insurance companies. I am satisfied that in this case the Deputy is again over-emphasising and over-dramatising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply to the effect that the number of policyholders in the PMPA increased in 1983 and was expected to increased again in 1984, does the Minister know the reason for that?  Could it be attributed to the fact that motor policyholders in all companies bar the PMPA are subsidising the PMPA through the imposed levy? That being so, would the Minister indicate whether the administration system at present pertaining to the PMPA is likely to continue for an indefinite number of years, or for any particular period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises out of the Minister's reply that the number of policyholders was increasing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is clearly raising another matter, of whether the present arrangements with the PMPA will continue indefinitely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I correct the statement made by Deputy Taylor?  I did not specify the PMPA in my answer.  I said that the number of policyholders generally had increased over 1982 and was expected to increase in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, I see.  In that case, what is the position in the PMPA, so far as the policyholders whom they cover are concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to indicate any company's portfolio of policyholders. I think that would be most unfair.</P>

      <P>The first indication that I, and the Industrial Development Authority, had that this company were planning to close their diagnostic reagents plant came on Wednesday, 18 January 1984.  Immediately on learning of this development, the IDA entered into discussions with the company, with a view to determining whether the redundancies could be averted or postponed, or whether alternative employment could be provided.  The company maintained that their decision was irreversible and about 140 employees were laid off on 9 March 1984.  Discussions are still proceeding between the IDA and the parent company to explore the options for the Irish operations.</P>
      <P>The IDA's plans for the general Dún Laoghaire area included the development of a major new business park at Leopardstown to accommodate quality service industries and the active promotion of their 27,000 sq. ft. advance factory at Sandyford, as well as the vacant factory space on the county council estate there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if his statement to the Dáil on 7 July 1983 that firms currently assembling vehicles who cease operations before the end of 1984 will be required to provide alternatives to assembly in order to continue to qualify for facilities to import fully built up vehicles, still represents Government policy on the motor assembly industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is that my statement to which he refers still represents Government policy on the motor assembly industry.</P>
      <P>On that occasion I mentioned one element that the alternative arrangements to assembly might involve, namely purchases from Irish sources.  Such alternative &ldquo;packages&rdquo; might also involve the establishment of an alternative manufacturing project, direct or indirect investment in manufacturing, or the training or retraining of workers.  The extent of the import facilities I would be prepared to afford would be determined by the quality of the economic package put forward having regard to the particular circumstances of the case in question.</P>

Could the Minister indicate whether he is satisfied that Government policy has been maintained in the case of firms which have ceased operation since July 1983?  Have they maintained the Government policy of providing an alternative to assembly before qualifying for import facilities for their own fully built up vehicles?</P>

He <Col N="1551" /> said that these alternative arrangements could involve additional purchases from Irish sources which would possibly create additional employment in this sector or, at least, maintain jobs at the present level.  Can the Minister say if these jobs have been maintained?

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if, in view of our substantial export of raw hides and imports of finished leather and leather products, the Government have any plans to control the export of raw hides and to promote the development of industries manufacturing leather and leather goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the objective of the Government to promote, to the fullest extent possible, the development, on a profitable and enduring basis, of industries such as the tanning industry which involve the processing of indigenous raw materials.  However there would be no economic advantage in prohibiting, in whole or in part, the export of raw hides. The difficulties of the Irish tanning industry in recent years have been mainly related to competitiveness in the international market for leather.  This determines the extent to which native hides can be processed in this country on a viable basis.  In the present circumstances of the tanning industry in Western Europe generally, it would be unrealistic to envisage the possibility of having all the native raw hides processed in this country.  The Government would of course, prefer that a higher proportion of home produced hides were converted into leather in this country, but they recognise the problems involved in selling the output profitably.  It must also be recognised that native hides are not suitable for the production of certain of the types of leather required by the footwear industry and by the leather goods industry in this country.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that substantial funds from the IDA and Fóir Teoranta have been forthcoming for the Irish Leathers group.  The amount of State aid there has been very substantial.  That is the main leather producing company in the country.  I should add, in relation to the Deputy's question, that we have our obligations as a member of the EEC which would prohibit us putting controls on the export of hides.  We simply would not be able to sell the output if all the hides were manufactured here.  It is an extremely competitive industry worldwide and a number of the major factories in the industry throughout the world have closed in recent years. It is an extremely competitive area.</P>

We are very glad we are able to sell our goods in other markets at competitive prices.  Some of the native hides are simply not suitable for the type of leather required.  Because of the nature of the industry a certain mix is necessary with regard to home production and there is need to import certain of the leather required by the industry.</P>

      <P>Action to ensure that any manufacturing operation is compettitive internationally is a matter primarily for the individual enterprise itself.  Where appropriate, the State will provide assistance to encourage developments aimed at ensuring the competitiveness of the individual firm.  Such measures, however, can only supplement, and are not a substitute for, action by the firm.

If a company consider there is dumping it is up to them to prove their case.  The State has given substantial grant aid to Irish Biscuits Limited during the years. They are a modern factory.

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Development Act, the question of providing grant aid to any industrial sector or to any particular firm is a matter for the Industrial Development Authority and under the legislation there is no provision for direct intervention by me in such matters.</P>
      <P>Following its earlier announcement on 14 March 1984, the IDA issued on 18 April 1984, a further statement as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority at its meeting yesterday, 17 April, 1984, considered its policy on grant assistance to the newspaper industry.  The Authority re-affirmed its refusal to approve capital grants for essentially re-equipment type purposes. As previously indicated (14 March, 1984) the IDA is prepared to consider assisting new proposals with clear economic benefits such as extra export earnings.  In addition, the Authority is prepared to make a limited contribution to the re-training of key operatives in the use of computerised photo composition equipment, <Col N="1560" /> because of the strategic importance of moving to the new technology.  The IDA would expect the major portion of the re-training funds to come from the European Social Funds or the industry itself. </P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the present policy of the IDA on the appropriate criteria governing assistance to the newspaper industry was adopted after thorough appraisal and discussion of all the relevant circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that other newspapers receive substantial adaptation grants?  Is he further aware that a massive number of foreign newspapers are taking a greater share of the market?  Is he allowing the IDA to capitulate in the face of this increased competition? The allegation of dumping has been referred to here today and that also is an element in newspaper competition. As a consequence, will he initiate immediate discussions with the IDA to allow this group of newspapers to have the same level of competitiveness with other newspapers, especially in relation to foreign imports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the primary responsibility of the IDA to make decisions with regard to the industrial sector. The Deputy referred to other newspapers getting re-equipment grants.  As the Deputy is aware, these grants were terminated by a Government decision on 23 December 1981.  However, during the currency of the re-equipment grants scheme, the IDA worked closely with the group of newspapers mentioned by the Deputy in an effort to have a development plan drawn up which would permit grant assistance to be provided for the re-equipment and modernisation of the operation.  Despite streneous efforts and prolonged discussions with the company management from 1971 to 1978, the company failed to provide the IDA with any future plans.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>This firm and their parent company have been notified by the Industrial Development Authority of the grant repayment liability arising from their closure and negotiations are currently taking place with the company concerning the discharge of this liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority with whom I have had continuous contact, have been working closely with the company in an effort to secure a take-over of the plant for further manufacturing, and have been keeping me informed of what is being done.  Details of the facilities available at the site have been circulated to all the IDA's overseas offices and contact has been made with <Col N="1562" /> the major nylon producers world-wide as well as a number of nylon end users and raw material suppliers but no firm proposals have emerged as yet.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the approaches to manufacturers in the nylon sector the IDA in co-operation with the company, are preparing a brochure on the plant and facilities which will be used for marketing the plant to a wider range of companies who may have an interest in the facilities for other processing type projects such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals or food processing.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that all suitable steps are being taken to bring about a take-over of the plant for a suitable manufacturing operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to negotiations which are currently taking place regarding IDA assistance, could the Minister say if the company will repay in full the assistance they received or what part of the grants, etc., will be paid?  Could he also indicate if any approaches have been made by firms for the take-over of the factory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations have not yet been completed regarding payment and, therefore, I cannot inform the Deputy of the result of the final outcome. With regard to taking over the plant, there was a preliminary interest by a company but nothing substantial that would give me cause for hope in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism in view of the continuing increase in imports of building bricks, the steps he proposes to take to encourage home manufacturers to increase their production capacity to meet the demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that total imports of building bricks have shown a significant reduction over the past two years.  Substantial State assistance has been provided in recent years to Irish manufacturers of building bricks to install <Col N="1563" /> new plant in order to increase capacity and to meet changing market demand.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that there is a considerable amount of unused home production capacity in this sector.  This situation has been aggravated by the recession in the construction industry and competition from imports, especially from Northern Ireland.  Accordingly, it would not now be appropriate for the State to encourage home manufacturers to increase production capacity for building bricks generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is a substantial reduction, would the Minister agree that up to 1981-82 there was a continuous high volume increase in importation of bricks and that there is still room for much more production here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy said with regard to production capacity which is under-utilised at present. I understand that the total quantity of building bricks imported decreased from 18.2 million in 1981 to 10.6 million in 1983, a substantial reduction.</P>

    <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers in particular to imports of <Col N="1566" /> asbestos-cement slates, which were the subject of recent representations from the Deputy and other interested parties. I have already indicated in my reply to these representations that officials of my Department are available to assist in the preparation of an application by the firm affected to the EEC Commission for protection against any harmful dumping of low priced imports from outside the EEC.</P>
    <P>As regards imports of asbestos-cement slates from other member states of the EEC, which have in fact decreased in both volume and value terms in the past year, our obligations as a member of the EEC generally preclude us from restricting such imports.  However, there is already available to industry a wide range of State expertise and assistance to help it to improve its competitiveness against imported products and to encourage development.</P>

      <P>Imports of asbestos-cement roofing of wall tiles not exceeding 40 × 60 centimetres from other countries were 17 metric tonnes to the value of £6,000.  There was no importation from third countries of other cement roofing tiles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That would seem to be at variance with information received from the home producers of slates that considerable volumes of slates are being imported from Austria and that it is possible that many jobs will be put at risk in the home industry.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1982, 10,494 metric tonnes were imported from the EEC to the value of £2,289,000.  In 1983 imports were 9,050 metric tonnes to the value of £2.115 million, a reduction again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the variation in costs between imports from outside countries is putting jobs at risk in the home manufacturing <Col N="1570" /> sector, and that the dumping of slates into this market from over supplies in other countries has to be stopped?  Apart from helping to formulate a complaint to the Commission, will the Minister take positive steps to do something about it? What does he propose to do?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

With regard to anti-dumping from non-EEC countries, the control rests with the Commission acting in consultation with the member state.  I have no evidence of dumping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the action he proposes to take to ensure that a worth-while section of farm machinery is manufactured at home; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main conclusions of a review of the Irish agricultural machinery industry, which was published in 1982 by the Industrial Development Authority in conjunction with the National Board for Science and Technology, was that import substitution would not in itself provide a sound basis for development of this industry but that development of the industry could be achieved through the export of existing and improved products using the home market as a base.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave on 7 July 1983 to a somewhat similar question by him. Action as indicated in that reply continues to be taken by the IDA in conjunction with other State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said this would not form a base for import substitution. This is one of the areas the committee who are examining import substitution should be looking into.  Most of the material imported is very low technology material and could be produced here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the industries should more properly develop through the export of existing and improved products using the home market as a base.  It is up to the industry to tackle their problems and use the State agencies whose services are available.  I refer specifically to the IDA and An Foras Talúntais who are involved in the recommendations of the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware that a British owned firm (details supplied) has announced its intention of closing down, and that this move had apparently been planned by the company for some time; the financial aid by way of grants or loans the company has received from the IDA or other State agencies; and the measures the Government intend to take to recover these moneys.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the proposed closure of the company in question. I understand the company discharged its statutory requirements by giving 30 days notice of closure to the Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>Details of grants provided by the IDA have been published in the authority's annual reports.  I am not aware that financial assistance has been provided for the company by other State agencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would seem that this company is closing not because it is not a profitable venture but because of investment decisions made by Imperial Tobacco and Barclay Trust and that there appears to be an unwillingness on the part of the company to allow the factory to be taken over by some other body or group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of <Col N="1573" /> the reason given by Ross Foods Limited was that there was surplus production capacity here and in the United Kingdom caused by a drop in demand and high production costs which, according to the company, make it no longer profitable to produce burgers for export.  The company was also unhappy with the raw material supply situation here in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware, I am sure, that the company changed its name from Portion Foods Limited to Coolock Foods Limited and there is concern among the workforce that the reason may be that it is an attempt to avoid responsibility for redundancy.  Will the Minister give an assurance that if redundancies should take place staff will get their full entitlements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very concerned that any such sharp practices would take place.  I will certainly bring what the Deputy has said to the notice of the Minister for Labour who has responsibility for redundancies.  I can assure the Deputy that with regard to my responsibility in Industry no sharp practices will be allowed with regard to the repayment of grant moneys, it that arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have assumed that as the question is one of such fundamental importance it would have been taken by the Taoiseach.  We had put the question down to the Taoiseach.  Our question asks the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is aware that Irish yachtsmen were held up by the British navy in Carlingford Lough on Sunday last; that the helm of one boat was taken over by force by British armed marines and the boat <Col N="1574" /> was damaged; that the owner was subjected to harassment and taken to a British patrol boat where he was detained for two hours and 30 minutes; that he was shown a chart purporting to indicate an agreement by the Irish and British Governments on jurisdiction over the waters of Carlingford Lough; and if he will state what action he proposes to take with a view to preventing further incursions of this kind and protecting Irish territorial sovereignity whether on land or on sea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the incident referred to by the Deputies in their question and of the details involved.  Two of the yachtsmen concerned called to my Department yesterday and provided a full and detailed account of all that had taken place.</P>
      <P>Prior to that on the basis of a report furnished by the Garda, my Department had raised the matter with the British authorities.  Specifically my Department expressed the Government's serious concern over the incident and delivered a protest to the British authorities: (i) against the boarding of the yacht and (ii) against the false assertion by the British navy captain concerned that there is an agreement between the British and Irish Governments relating to the delimitation of their respective jurisdictions in the lough.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, no such agreement between the Irish and British Governments. Nor can there be any map detailing such an agreement as it does not exist.</P>
      <P>We object to the action taken by the British security forces but we are in this instance dealing with an area that is in dispute between our two Governments. Pending the resolution of this dispute we are seeking to urge on the British authorities, whose security concerns we appreciate, the need to exercise restraint having regard to the sensitivities of the local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the final part of the Deputies' question, as I have said we have already protested to the British authorities about this matter.  I also intend to take the matter up personally <Col N="1575" /> with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, when I next meet him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on the map produced by the commanding officer of the British naval patrol vessel, the <i>Vigilant</i>, a claim is made by the British to the rock on which the Hauwerline lighthouse, otherwise known as the Greenore lighthouse, stands and that if such a claim was conceded no Irish vessel could enter Carlingford Lough without first getting permission to do so from the British authorities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in the course of my original reply, the map produced has no official status and certainly is not a map which has been agreed between the Irish and British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that British naval patrol vessels do not operate within the limits which they claim and that there is constant interference with shipping in the whole area? What action does the Minister propose to take in relation to that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of some incidents last year and on each occasion they were taken up and a protest lodged with the British authorities about them. If the Deputy, or anybody in that area, has any further complaints in this regard they should (a) give them to the Garda authorities or (b) directly to my Department and I will see that they are raised with the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the British authorities are not taking much notice of the protests that are being made to them because this problem is continuing.  Does the Minister not agree that all the waters of Carlingford Lough are Irish waters and that Irish vessels are fully entitled to use those waters without let or hindrance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said in my reply.  A further point I should like to make is that the evidence is quite the reverse.  Since I started protesting about <Col N="1576" /> this, incidents have decreased, not increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of this latest incident, which is by no means an isolated one, will the Minister state what protection he proposes to give to Irish ships, yachts and boats in Carlingford Lough so that they can freely go about their lawful business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true to say that incidents such as this are on the increase; they are on the decrease.

      <P>That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the proceedings on the motion in the name of the Minister for the Environment confirming the Local Elections (Specification of Local Election Year) Order, 1984, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 23rd May, 1984, by putting from the Chair forthwith the Question necessary to bring them to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>It is with reluctance that I move this motion.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to get agreement to bring the debate on the postponement of the local elections motion to a conclusion.  I would like to point out to the House that we have already spent ten hours 35 minutes debating this motion.  That is not to say that the Opposition are not entitled to their right to debate a motion of this nature, but I feel that the extra time we are giving both today and tomorrow until 12.30 p.m. is adequate, bearing in mind the other scheduled business we have to deal with.  It is with reluctance, therefore, that I am moving this motion.  Unfortunately I have no option because of the failure to get agreement to bring the necessary motion to a conclusion.</P>

The last time that happened it was debated for about four months in the House on and off, so I do not think the time has been excessive.  It <Col N="1641" /> is a number of weeks since it has been debated and the Government have not been in any rush to bring it forward and we felt that perhaps they had changed their minds and were intending to have local elections after all.</P>

      <P>With all due respect to <Col N="1644" /> you, Sir, since questions are not being entertained in the interest of order, Deputy Ahern, perhaps attempting to avoid a division since his troops are occupied elsewhere, attempted to introduce something that was highly dangerous although perhaps understandable in the light of the last seven days' experience in his party.  He said that he would agree to a debate provided one side of the House monopolised the time between now and the point at which the final decision will be taken.  That goes against every principle that has brought about the establishment of this democratic Assembly in the first instance.  The House should now decide whether it will take this motion and Deputy Ahern should not try to give agreement to this proposal on the basis that one side of the House monopolises the debate for the remaining period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion moved by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, in the belief that the approach taken by the Government on this occasion is a reasonable one to which a responsible Opposition could have no serious objection.  That somewhat confused response from the Opposition indicates how half-hearted is their opposition. The Government have brought forward a ministerial order pursuant to the powers vested in them under local government legislation.  That order has been debated here on three occasions.  A very large number of Members have taken the opportunity of contributing to the discussion.  Indeed, it is worth recalling what happened on each of the three occasions so that we may consider whether the Government are acting reasonably in moving this guillotine motion and in taking the view that the matter will have been debated adequately when the time set by the guillotine motion expires tomorrow afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter came before the House first for discussion on 29 February last when it was debated from 4.35 p.m. to 7 p.m., a total of two hours 55 minutes.  There has been a suggestion from the Opposition that during these debates the time was monopolised by the Government.  I wish to establish to the satisfaction of the House that there is no truth in any such suggestion.  On that first occasion the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, spoke for 15 minutes during which time he, having moved the motion, explained the legislative background to it and the procedures under which the Minister was exercising his powers.  The Minister of State addressed himself specifically to the motion.  He spoke of the need to postpone the local elections for a stated purpose, that being the Government's intention to fulfil their commitment in the <i>Programme for Government</i> to introduce a package of local government reform. The Minister of State was followed by Deputy Fitzsimons who spoke for 25 minutes and who did not regard himself <Col N="1646" /> obviously as being bound as strictly by the terms of the motion as was the Minister of State.  Deputy Fitzsimons considered himself free to comment on the general performance of the Government in considering the response of the electorate would be if the elections were proceeded with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzsimons was followed by Deputy Mervyn Taylor who addressed himself to the specific issue of the appropriateness or otherwise of proceeding with the local elections this year and raised the question of whether the case or indeed the need for local government reform was such as to justify the postponement of the elections.  He placed particular emphasis on the fact that the structure of local government in Dublin has remained unreformed for a century or more and he pointed out that because of growing urbanisation, because of the population increase in Dublin and the drift to Dublin, the structures which might have been adequate once are now hopelessly inadequate.  Deputy Taylor pointed out, for example, that he and his colleagues as councillors representing the sprawling new town of Tallaght are expected to represent an area as large as and as numerous in terms of population as constituencies represented by many Dáil Deputies.  While Deputy Taylor is a professional politician his area will be represented in many cases by part-time councillors who are elected to represent local opinion and to stay in touch with the views of people on the ground.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power intervened then in his inimitable fashion.  He was followed by his constituency colleague, Deputy Durkan. Deputy Seán Walsh spoke then.  He was followed by Deputies Kenny, Pat Gallagher and Lyons.  Therefore, on that first occasion on which the matter was debated nine speakers contributed, five of whom were from the Opposition benches including their spokesman, Deputy Fitzsimons, who is replying to the motion in the absence of Deputy Molloy.</P>
    <P>The matter was taken up again on 7 March last when it was debated between 10.45 a.m. and 1.30 p.m., a total of two hours and 44 minutes.  Later that afternoon <Col N="1647" /> it was debated for three-and-a-half hours from 3.30 p.m. until 7 p.m.  In other words, on that occasion a total of six hours and 15 minutes was devoted to debate on the issue.  On that occasion we heard again from Deputy Lyons.  We heard also from Deputy Cosgrave while the view of The Workers' Party was put by Deputy De Rossa.  Deputy Allen spoke also on that occasion as did Deputies Kirk, Gay Mitchell, Michael Barrett, Owen, Gene Fitzgerald, McEllistrim, Hilliard, Jackie Fahey and Tunney. Again, I turn to the accusation that the Government were seeking to monopolise the time and to deny Opposition Deputies the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  On that second occasion five Opposition Deputies spoke one after the other.  Then we had an intervention from the Government side but it was only of ten minutes duration and was from Deputy Harte.  He was followed by Deputies Lemass, Wallace, Niall Andrews and Connolly.  It would seem that on that occasion we went very close to achieving Deputy Ahern's desire that the debate would proceed in an unusual fashion with contributions from one side of the House only.</P>
    <P>In the light of the experience on that occasion perhaps his suggestion that they were prepared to accept the motion on the basis that all speakers would be saying the same thing was not as extraordinary or as preposterous as it might otherwise have been.  I do not wish to be unfair to Deputy Ahern.  All of us bring to the Chamber our own experiences, our knowledge of procedures and of the practices we adopt in conducting our own meetings.  I know that Deputy Ahern is Whip to a party who adopt a novel and distinctive approach to internal party debate.  I realise he is the Whip of a party who take the view that matters are best decided on the basis of one leader, one voice.  In the event of anyone being unsure as to the meaning of <i>una duce, una voce,</i> the party press officer, a constituent of mine and sometime Senator, P.J. Mara, was available to interpret.  He explained that the phrase so far as Fianna <Col N="1648" /> Fáil were concerned meant that no one was to nibble at his Leader's bum.</P>

      <P>You will appreciate too, a Chathaoirligh, that the Opposition Whip suggested that the debate should proceed in a particular manner, that being that all the contributions would come from his side of the House and that presumably all the speakers would say the same thing.  I am trying to analyse how Deputy Ahern could have put forward such a proposition and I am suggesting that perhaps his attitude is understandable given the background he has experienced in his parliamentary party.  However, that is only a passing reference.</P>
      <P>The matter of the postponement of the local government elections was debated again on 13 March last when debate continued for one hour and 55 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been attempting to establish that this matter has been adequately debated.  The issue was considered by 32 Members of the House who addressed themselves to the question.  What is the question?  The issue to which Members are asked to address themselves is: is there need for local government reform?  Members will be unanimous on that and an examination of the contributions to date will indicate how frustrated Members felt as members of local authorities and how clumsy and ineffective are the structures <Col N="1649" /> of local government, particularly in the greater Dublin area where they are unresponsive to the needs of the people.</P>
      <P>Almost without exception, Dublin Deputies pointed out how absurd were the boundaries that dissected the Ballymun estate and gave rise to Dublin Corporation building more houses within the jurisdiction of Dublin County Council than in their own area.  The result was that although people were tenants of Dublin Corporation they were within the jurisdiction of Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>The case for local government reform is clear.  The question we must ask is whether we are prepared to pay the price in terms of postponing local elections for one year.  On that, we have been subjected to a tirade of rage and indignation notwithstanding the fact that it has been put on the record that on no less than 13 occasions in the history of the State local elections have been postponed.  The two most recent ones were postponed by Fianna Fáil Governments.  That is the net issue to be decided.  Are members committed to local government reform and prepared to pay the price in terms of postponing the election?  The House does not have to answer that question yet.  All it has to say is whether, on the basis of the contributions of 32 speakers, it has been given an adequate opportunity to debate the issue.  All Members have to decide is whether, on the basis of the three day debate we have had, the debate today and tomorrow, they will have had an opportunity to make up their minds on the issue.  Are they prepared to pay the price in order to secure meaningful local government that will give people an opportunity to influence the structures which are now so remote from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone knows we have had an adequate opportunity to debate the issue. That is why Deputy Ahern was prepared to accept the motion, with the qualification that there would only be speakers from one side of the House.  We are prepared to proceed with the debate and ensure the Opposition get an adequate opportunity to contribute in the time available.  The great bulk of contributors so far has been from the Opposition benches.  However, we have reservations <Col N="1650" /> about being expected to be excluded from the debate in total.  Are the Government being unreasonable in suggesting that we bring our consideration of this matter to a conclusion tomorrow?  I have no doubt that we are being reasonable and I do not believe anyone has any serious doubts about that.  I support the motion which has been moved by my colleague.</P>

      <P>I have not yet contributed to this debate but I welcome the opportunity to do so.  It is fair to say that if we were in Government and doing what the Government are doing now, they would be saying roughly what we are saying and we would be saying what they are saying. That is the game of politics and that is how it is played.</P>
      <P>Any party in opposition want to test electoral support as quickly as possible. If we seem over-eager for this contest to take place, mature people will understand why.  I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment expressed by Deputy Kelly when he said that politicians looked forward to elections like turkeys looked forward to Christmas.  No politician looks forward to an election not just because he might not be re-elected but because of the darned inconvenience of interference with his work.  That may not be very democratic but it does interfere with one's work if one is a very hard-working politician.</P>
      <P>As regards local authority elections one is secure for five years.  They do not have sudden elections.  One can plan. New councillors can find out what is going on.  As everyone who has served on a local authority knows, about half of new councillors speak a load of rubbish at first because they do not understand how the system works.  It takes at least a year and a half before they understand the process and what it is possible to do.  Local government is a great training ground for people.  I have been a member of Dublin Corporation since 1967.  My father served on it also.</P>

The newcomers have plenty to say.  I welcome the reform of local government, which is very much needed.  In a city like Dublin there are huge areas like Tallaght and Kimmage/Crumlin which should have their own local authorities.  I welcome the move to set up the town commissioners in Greystones.  This was a very progressive move because more and more people want to have a say in their own affairs. But one must take into account that this can cost a lot of money.  Local government is fine as long as it does not cost people extra money, but when you try to raise tax locally, all hell breaks loose.

      <P>At last, after ten minutes <Col N="1652" /> I know what I am talking about.  The feeling of frustration when the guillotine motion is brought in affects all parties. When in Government, Fianna Fáil also introduced guillotine motions.  The present Government, then the Opposition, considered that the 36 hours we had provided were not enough.  Guillotine motions are part and parcel of the democratic system.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, referred to only one side speaking. It does not do us any good to have to put up speaker after speaker, nor does it do the Government any good, because it is up to the Government to keep the business of the House going.  Therefore, from their point of view a motion of this kind is inconvenient.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy George Birmingham, spoke at length.  The Chief Whip will know from experience that it is not very difficult to get Members here to filibuster.  I hate filibustering.  I am sorry I am not talking about the motion dealing with local government reform.</P>

      <P>This is very frustrating for me because I did not speak on the main motion earlier, and most of our people have already contributed, but if I can walk the tightrope of order &mdash; that is a nice expression, I hope it is carefully put into the notes &mdash; I would like to make these comments.  Speakers like myself whose business it was to round up other speakers tended to leave ourselves last, and we feel very frustrated when we find ourselves in this situation.  I welcome the reform of local government but regret that the Government have had to postpone the local elections because of the frustration felt by young people who are champing at the bit to wet their feet in local elections prior to getting involved <Col N="1653" /> in the national scene.  I can understand people of all parties feeling this sense of frustration.</P>
      <P>In my view the job of reforming government will take longer than a year and it is likely that we may have a similar debate this time next year asking for the postponement of the local elections for yet a further year.  If this guillotine motion is concluded and we get back on the main motion, I will look forward to going deeper into the main issues, such as the setting up of town commissioners but the possibility is that I will not have this opportunity.  I would like my views to be on the record so that the Government can look at them when they are preparing to reform local government. Perhaps they will issue papers on their thinking in this area so that we can all contribute.  Irrespective of what we say to each other inside this Chamber, outside we are in the same business of trying to improve the lives of the people and to help the people we represent.</P>
      <P>We have a great contribution to make but we could make an even better contribution if discussion papers were issued rather than a Bill with a certain amount of time allocated to discuss it, because there is a danger that this legislation will be rushed through the House with the result that the Government will not get the collective wisdom and experience of so many Members.  Perhaps the Government will bear this in mind because in my view it will take longer than one year to reform government.</P>
      <P>The Government's Bill will have to be discussed and there is a possibility that we will be accused of delaying the elections for another year.  On the other hand, we may not have a long discussion on it; we may decide to give the Bill and have the elections.  It is very important that we have local government reform and elections as soon as possible.  I am a great democrat.  When I say &ldquo;a great democrat&rdquo; I do not mean I am great personally, but I am a great believer in democracy.</P>

      <P>Ultimately the people will form their judgement as to the lack of wisdom in not holding these local government elections.

If the electorate have strong feelings about their postponement probably they may well show them on the occasion of the European elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to debate this motion in that one is restricted to the guillotine motion itself. While we all understand what is entailed in the guillotining of any business I should have thought that a certain amount of latitude should be allowed contributors to discuss even in a brief fashion the reasons we believe this matter should be discussed and should not be so guillotined. I hope the Acting Chairman will allow me some latitude in expressing my views as to why this motion should be accepted by the House or the local government elections postponed.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Government to postpone the local elections is an extremely serious blow to democracy, worsened by the fact that they have now guillotined debate on this motion. Indeed, the Minister of State present, he alone representing the Government in the House at this time, must find this most unpalatable and distasteful.  Any democrat must find this guillotine totally nauseating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been discussion on the postponement of local government elections <Col N="1655" /> in the course of the past few weeks.  The Minister of State at the Department of Labour, Deputy G. Birmingham, read from the Official Report a list of speakers who had contributed in that time.  In fact he went on with a lot of waffle and used some of the content of those speeches, which is completely outside the realm of this guillotine motion and should not have been allowed.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are in a most depressed and serious state at present.  In the interests of their survival it is only right that a debate on the postponement of local government elections should be allowed to continue until all Members wishing to contribute had had an opportunity of doing so.  Members' knowledge of the business of local authorities probably is much deeper than that on any other topic.  I find it personally depressing that Members should not be allowed to debate the postponement of these elections for as long as they consider necessary. It must be remembered that we are here dealing with the democratic right of people to decide who should govern them not alone at national but at local government level.  The postponement of local government elections is a serious blow to democracy, a subject which should be fully aired in this House.  Indeed, this smacks somewhat of the jackboot tactic being employed here in order to stifle debate, a most unhealthy sign.  Even in their present desperate plight I did not think the Government would stoop to that type of tactic.  Obviously, with Government numbers in the House they will vote this motion through, when there will then be a very limited time only available to discuss the postponement of local elections.</P>
    <P>Local authorities' mandate covers a very wide spectrum of responsibility affecting our everyday lives, probably having a much deeper impact on citizens than that at national government level.  I have spoken to a lot of people outside the House about this matter when I discovered they felt they had been cheated of expressing their point of view on Government performance at this time. The fact that their representatives <Col N="1656" /> equally are being cheated of any opportunity to debate the matter will infuriate them even more.  I believe the wrath of the electorate with the present Government will be shown very clearly on the occasion of the European elections.  They have themselves to blame; they brought it on their own heads.  Democracy is most valuable, was dearly fought for and it should never be denied anybody inside or outside this House.</P>
    <P>There have been other occasions when the guillotine has been applied in this House, but for very good reasons &mdash; for example, when there was a lot of filibustering preventing certain measures being passed by the House.  But this is a different ballgame altogether.  There is now no indication being given when local government elections will be held.</P>
    <P>I accept fully that local government structures should be reformed, perhaps more so in the greater Dublin area than anywhere else, because many county councillors have experienced the difficulties and drawbacks of the present system. While we all accept that such reformation is necessary it should not be advanced as an excuse for postponing local government elections.  There has been no indication to date that such reform has even commenced.  Yet it was one of the Coalition's promises prior to the last general election and the Government have been in office now since 1982.  Only in the past six to eight weeks, when we came close to holding local government elections, have we heard anything at all from the Government about such reform.</P>
    <P>I believe this guillotine motion has been imposed by a desperate Government who will seek any avenue to escape proper democratic criticism.  Even at this stage I hope the Minister of State present would be sufficiently strong in convincing his colleagues that this debate should continue as long as there are Members wishing to contribute.  As Deputy Briscoe said, we have all had vast experience of local government work and it is wrong and unfair that this guillotine motion should be imposed to stifle this debate.</P>

      <P>During my contribution to the previous motion to impose the guillotine I said that the postponement of the local elections, due to take place next month, is a bad step, which has been taken for political reasons.  The Government have said that the reason is the need for local government reform.  We know that is necessary but it is not a sufficient reason for postponing the local elections indefinitely.  We were promised local government reform two and a half years ago but so far we have not been given an indication that it has been discussed at Cabinet level.  We have not seen any evidence that it has been and therefore we must accept that the proposal to postpone the elections has been for political reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision was not taken by the Government until very late in the day after it had become obvious there had been disagreement and confusion in the <Col N="1658" /> Cabinet as to whether the elections should be held.  It has been accepted that in order to bring out the electorate for the European elections some sort of bonus should be offered to them, such as the holding of the local elections on the same day.  On the last occasion it was felt that the local elections should be held on the same day as the European elections in order to stimulate interest in the latter. Though the two will not be held simultaneously on this occasion I do not think the electorate will need much encouragement, because of the performance of the Government leading up to the European elections &mdash; I think that performance will mean that the electorate will come out in large numbers and the local elections have been postponed in the hope that that will not be so.</P>
    <P>Membership of the Seanad is controlled largely by county councils who, in themselves, are very important bodies. The work of county councillors has been understated in recent years.  They are unpaid, many of them are part-time only politicians, and they deserve great credit for the work they do and for the interest they have shown in performing their duties.  For that reason alone the postponement of the local elections is a backward step which deprives the electorate of their right to decide representation at local level.</P>
    <P>As a member of Dublin Corporation I can say there is great criticism of the Coalition parties because of the way they have controlled and monopolised completely the important office of Lord Mayor in Dublin.  We know what Labour and Fine Gael have been doing in this respect.  In 1979, 42 per cent or 43 per cent of the people in Dublin voted for Fianna Fáil candidates and since 1979 those people have not seen their choices selected as Lords Mayor in the city council.  We have seen the Labour Party holding the mayoralty in two of those years.  I have no hang-ups about it but I should like to see democracy in action. We all talk about upholding democratic rights but as far as Labour and Fine Gael are concerned in Dublin democracy is something talked about but not practised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> Therefore, it is not very difficult to appreciate and understand the cynicism of the people outside.  I would not like to think that such cynicism is at such a seriously high level that democracy as we know it could be in danger in the future. The major political parties, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour have a serious responsibility to let the public see that we are democratic and that we continue to carry out our functions in accordance with the wishes of the electorate.  Therefore, the electorate are entitled to have the local elections carried out.  We know that political convenience is the reason for postponement &mdash; the present climate is not good from the point of view of the Coalition parties.  I do not pay any attention to polls one way or another but one cannot turn a deaf ear to expressions of views by the public.</P>
    <P>In 1979 we went to the people to elect county councils, corporations and urban councils for a five-year period.  That necessarily meant that we would hold the next local elections in 1984.  Now we are not being told when they will be held.  It has been suggested that 1986 will be the date.  I notice that the Minister of State is sitting alone over there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Corporation have been controlled for the past four years by the Coalition parties and like most other local authorities they are in a very bad way financially.  Most authorities are on the verge of bankruptcy. During the past two years inflation has been running at rates between 10 per cent to 16 per cent and the increases in revenue granted to local authorities by the Government have been totally insignificant and unrealistic.  This year they will be receiving an increase of only 0.8 per cent.  What job can any local authority do with the type of funds being made available? Each city and county manager is being told that it is up to him to raise additional revenue by way of local charges etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> Last year we had the imposition of a water charge of between £30 and £50, depending on the valuation of a house.  It has been a total disaster.  Eighteen months after the introduction of these rates fewer than 50 per cent of people have paid and a very large percentage of the remainder are adamant that they will not pay the imposed rates under any circumstances. One must agree with the logic of their argument.  When rates were abolished in 1977, additional taxation was imposed to make up the required funds for local authorities and this was increased each year.  From 1977 to 1980 or 1981 the annual increases to local authorities were in the region of 11 or 12 per cent.  Whilst that may not have been sufficient to allow local authorities to do all the work they wished, nevertheless it was sufficient to enable them to carry out all essential functions.  Since then the increases granted by the Minister have been very small and meaningless.  The increase this year of 0.8 per cent is an insult to all local authorities and it would have been better for the Minister to tell them that the money was not available to give any increase.</P>
    <P>The onus is being placed once more on the public to make up the required funds. Where is this money to come from?  Are we talking in terms of further charges for services such as garbage collection, library fees and the imposition of various other fees thought up by Government and management?  The imposition of any new charges will be a fiasco and the system will be unworkable, as in the case of the water charges.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are responsible for many services within their areas.  They are required to meet some charges which I believe should be met from central funds.  The health boards are one area where charges are increasing very much year after year.  It is virtually impossible for a city manager or city treasurer to carry out his duties as imposed by statute. I pay a very high tribute to the City Manager and his officers in Dublin Corporation.  Despite ever-reducing funds, within their disposable means they have done a very good job for the city and in the areas of community and environment <Col N="1661" /> they have done extremely well, as the Minister of State will appreciate. In those circumstances, it is grievously wrong that these authorities should be put under such financial stress.</P>
    <P>We must examine the political background to the decision of the Government to postpone the local elections. There was not total agreement, I understand, within the Cabinet.  The Taoiseach is understood to be on record as being very adamant that the elections should take place, but he was over-ruled by the vast majority of the Cabinet, particularly the members of the Labour Party who under no circumstances wanted to face the electorate on two fronts next month. From a political point of view, one cannot blame them.  The Labour Party have been steadily going down since they went into Coalition in 1982.  They have let their supporters down very badly, totally reneged on Labour policy and the Labour Ministers have been given areas of responsibility which have been dealt with most reprehensibly from the public viewpoint. Environment and Health, to name two, are areas which have suffered severe cutbacks and in which there has been a total collapse under this Government. Rather than seeing some small progress in this area, we have seen retrogresion and in the area of health and social welfare the cutbacks have been of such ferocity that once again the population are moving back into the poverty of the forties.</P>

      <P>That is the political background to the reason for postponing the local elections.  The Government know that they would be set on a suicidal course if the local elections went ahead. We have been told that the postponement is because of local Government reform but that is not the reason.  We are all for reform, but why has it taken so <Col N="1663" /> long?  Since they came into office the Coalition Government have talked about reform, which was one of their main platforms before the last election.  The impression given then was that the backroom boys, of Fine Gael in particular, had already worked out their plans and done their homework in this respect. Where have those plans been since 1982? A discussion has not even taken place on that subject.  A decision was taken to postpone the local elections indefinitely. We are not told that they will take place in 1985.</P>

      <P>I have doubts that the present Government will be in office in 1985.  We are faced with the Euro-elections on June 14.  I am sure that there will be a very big turn-out for these elections because the public are very disenchanted with the performance&mdash;or non-performance &mdash; of this Government.  They are just waiting for the opportunity &mdash; which, indeed, they took in the Dublin Central by-election some months ago &mdash; and very shortly after the results of that by-election, the Government decided finally and definitely to postpone the local elections for 1984.  The Government just could not postpone the Euro elections but if they had had the possibility of doing so, I have no doubt that the Euro-elections would not be held either.  As far as staying in office is concerned, democracy does not matter.  The Government want to stay in office hoping that the political climate will improve.</P>

They can then run to the country in the hope that the people will have forgotten the bad days and will put them back into office.  That is a desperate measure and it will not work.  The Government's performance has been so bad since coming into office that the public will never forgive them and will not forget for a very long time.

      <P>The financial situation of most local authorities is very serious. Local elections are absolutely necessary in order to give real teeth to the local authorities and the councillors so elected in an endeavour to take on more power as far as local authorities are concerned. The guillotine motion has already been passed, which was putting in the real jackboot.  It was a very undemocratic decision to postpone the elections.  The public have a democratic right to decide who will govern them and who will not. The Government are only putting off the ill-fated day by putting off the elections for one or two years or whatever time it may be.  I ask even at this late stage, if the Government are so confident that they will succeed, to decide that the local elections should take place.  We must have democracy and see it work.  We must at all times let the people decide who rules, whether at national or international level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is a scandalous decision by the Government to postpone the local elections for 12 months and to give the spurious reason of local government reform.  The reality is that we are not talking about merely postponing the local elections for 12 months but a two-year period will be involved.  There is no doubt that the Government are afraid to face the people.  They would not face them at all if it were not for their commitments with the European scene.  I also have no doubt that the people will make a judgment on the performance of the Government on 14 June.  Despite this mechanism for avoiding the local government elections the Government will be shown exactly what the people think of their performance since their election to office in December 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason given by the Minister and the Government for the postponement of the local elections is that they want to investigate the possibility of local government reform.  When I was Minister for the Environment I addressed the smallest local authority in the Dublin region, the Balbriggan Town Commissioners.  I took the opportunity to request presentations from the other local authorities in the greater Dublin area and from interested parties such as community councils, resident associations, the political parties and others who would have some views about the future from the of local government in Dublin.  During my period in the Custom House various proposals were made.  There are strong rumours about <Col N="1668" /> the shape of Dublin of the future, which is being decided at the moment in the Custom House.  There is a suggestion that Dublin will be divided into three areas, taking in Blanchardstown as one local authority area, Clondalkin-Tallaght, together with the city, will go into another area and that the south and Dún Laoghaire will go into a third local authority area with some sort of a coordinating body.  That is only one of the rumours about how Dublin is to be carved up by this administration.  I agree that there is need to take a look at local government services in the Dublin region.  There is need for a greater recognition of local government for such areas as Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Clondalkin, area which are now bigger than some of the largest towns throughout the country.  For example, without committing myself to any particular structure, perhaps the possibility might be considered of giving urban council status for the town of Tallaght, for the new town of Clondalkin and also for the Blanchardstown area.  These ideas were put forward when I was in the Department.</P>
    <P>The need for local government reorganisation in the Dublin region is not a sufficient argument for the postponement of national local elections.  We hear much about local government reform in the area of finance.  Local government has evolved over many years and it is my view that it will be impossible to have radical reform carried out under a Coalition Government.  Further, I do not think it would be in the best interests of local government to carry it out in the two-year cycle suggested by this administration. I say two years because what we are debating today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Owen has contributed twice since I started to speak but she has her own views about local government.  Does she think it is in her best interest or in my best interest to entertain the press with details about North County Dublin?  It is well known <Col N="1669" /> that she is not too keen on representing her constituents in the area of Dublin that contains the Ballymun flats or the city fringe area because she feels much more comfortable with some of her other electors.  However, I do not think it is in the best interests of Parliament that the internal divisions in North County Dublin should be debated across the floor of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Reluctantly, because nothing gives me greater pleasure than to discuss the internal politics of North County Dublin with Deputy Owen.  However, I do not think that will be of help to the House in this debate.  The Government have used the spurious excuse of local government reform but I do not think it can be done in 12 months.  Neither am I sure it is a good idea to carry out this great eruption on a national scale over two years.  I am afraid that in carrying out the reform they will have structures approximately the size of the health boards and all of us are familiar with what happened in that area.  The Eastern Health Board takes in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow and that is too large an area.  I am afraid that in the decisions being made now in the Custom House local government structures will cover large administrative areas for the sake of bureaucratic convenience with little regard for the needs of the people.  I accept there is need for reform but it should evolve rather than come about by means of disruption which will happen as a result of the activities of those now in the Custom House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My real complaint is the way the Government have used the excuse of <Col N="1670" /> reform in order to postpone local government elections.  The reality is that they have been advised by their backbenchers and councillors not to have the elections because of the failure of the Government in many areas.  There is the reality of more than 200,000 people unemployed and the Government have failed to give any hope to young people who are now at school.  They have failed to look after the agricultural sector and the construction industry and they have not continued with the infrastructural development works that were carried out in our last term of office.  This administration are afraid to face the people.  I take the example of the construction industry.  Incidentally, Deputy Owen is leaving us.  She does not want to hear about the various developments in North County Dublin that have been stopped since the election of this Government.  For example, the schemes in Lusk, Skerries and in Rolestown have not been continued.  I am sorry the Deputy is leaving the House because I know that for her local government is a very sensitive subject.  Like many other decisions in the county council, the Deputy leaves when things are said that she does not like to hear.</P>

      <P>I will refer to those five schemes.  Recently I received a letter from the management of the local authority when I questioned why the schemes had not gone ahead.  I was informed that, despite the fact that they were sanctioned and ready to go ahead, the local authority were not allowed to proceed because funds were not available in the county council to service the loans even though the money was sanctioned by the Department. What is happening in my constituency is also happening in other parts of the country.  This Government have totally failed local government throughout the country.  In failing local government they have, because of its importance to the construction industry, also <Col N="1672" /> failed that industry.  Those five schemes I have mentioned and the spin-off involved &mdash; for example, we could have proceeded with a housing scheme in Rolestown and developed further in the Feltrim-Kinsealy area &mdash; would have provided jobs in the construction industry. There are thousands of men unemployed in the construction industry, large firms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to set the record straight in regard to one matter.  Deputy Shatter said that Fianna Fáil proposed to introduce water charges.  In the Coalition budget of 1982 it was estimated that a sum of £12 million would be collected by way of water rates and so in.  A Fianna Fáil Government took office in March and that element of the Coalition budget was never implemented.  Therefore, it was the Coalition Government which introduced legislation for the imposition of charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on this <Col N="1673" /> motion more in sorrow than in anger in the sense that it was not originally my intention to speak and I hoped it could have been disposed of after a sensible debate of possibly a couple of days.  The point is well worth making, as was made previously by the Minister of State when speaking on the other motion with which we dealt today, that on 13 previous occasions Governments have postponed local government elections for a variety of different reasons.  There is nothing new about that.  Presumably the Opposition of the day in a caricature fashion stood up and yelled that the Government were frightened to face the electorate.  It is tempting to say that when a Government postpone local government elections, although the statutory provisions for local government in effect permit the Government to postpone elections for two years.</P>
      <P>I regret that these elections have been postponed, although I accepted the valid reasons for doing so.  As a member of Dublin County Council, elected in 1979, I would like to have gone to the electorate in June and to have been re-elected for a period of five years.  I should also like to have seen my colleagues re-elected.  I am not afraid to face the electorate, as Deputy Burke suggested.  Fianna Fáil can thank their lucky stars that they are not facing the electorate in June in a local government election as well as in a by-election and a Euro-election because I have no doubt that, in the light of the events that occurred last week, many of those people who might have supported Fianna Fáil candidates if those events had not occurred&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that those <Col N="1674" /> local authorities in which the Fine Gael Party either on their own or in conjunction with the Labour Party, hold the majority of seats would retain their seats in local elections.  The public are not convinced by the bluster that goes on here when Deputies who should know better waffle about the iniquities of water rates, as Deputy Barrett did.  We cannot go into details of water rates or the construction industry, but Deputy Burke knows that in the last election campaign in 1982 all parties talked about the possibility of introducing local charges.  People are aware that in the election manifesto produced in November 1982 by the Fianna Fáil Party there was a specific commitment to introduce local charges.  Why do Deputies demean the processes of this House and try to &ldquo;con&rdquo; the electorate by making spurious allegations about issues such as this?  We should be honest and tell people what our individual party policies are.  Why do we adopt an attitude that if we say something often enough, whether truthful or untruthful, the majority of people will believe it?  I do not understand that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason given for postponing local government elections &mdash; and the only valid reason &mdash; is that work is now being carried out on the preparation of extensive legislation to reform the local government system.  That is the only basis upon which I support the postponement of local government elections.  I welcome the fact that the work is now being done. Successive Governments of different political persuasions have for too long ignored the need for radical overhaul of the local government system.  At times of local government elections politicans on all sides of the House have spoken lyrically for too long about the need to reform local government and made promises in that regard.  Despite all that has been said, no comprehensive legislation was introduced for decades to reform the local government system.  We are still relying on a system we inherited from the British.  In Dublin, depending on which side of the road they live people can find themselves within the bailiwick of Dublin Corporation or Dublin County <Col N="1675" /> Council, and as a result, have varied and different entitlements.</P>
    <P>The entire local government structure as it applies to Dublin city and county needs to be reformed.  It is astonishing that it has not been reformed.  The present structure do not provide an efficient and proper local government administration within the county and city of Dublin and makes no provision for the satellite towns such as Tallaght.  It is ironic that in Greystones they have their own local government system, while Tallaght has not even got town commissioners to give it the recognition due to it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House in going over old ground. Deputies have given detailed testimony of the need to reform the local government system.  Many of them made eloquent and articulate contributions on the details of the reforms that are required. I hope the legislation to provide those reforms will be produced in the not too distant future and passed through the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not believe a word of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so that this time next year we will be starting the campaign for the local government elections.  If that is the case, it will be seen to have been a genuine reason for postponing the local government elections, unlike the reasons given previously by Fianna Fáil administrations when local government elections were postponed for pure political expediency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in my repeating everything that has been said about the need for local government reform.  That is recognised on all sides.  What is required now is action.  Realistically there is no great need for Members on the other side of the House to speak for three or four hours tonight and tomorrow about the need for local government reform.  Deputies on the other side of the House are aware &mdash; but they will pretend otherwise &mdash; that the filibuster tactics being engaged in by them make no contribution at all to the democratic process, <Col N="1676" /> and do nothing to enhance the standing of this Parliament as a relevant and democratic institution tackling and dealing with the immediate problems which are confronting us all.  The type of filibuster being conducted in the House undermines the democratic process.  This type of time wasting undermines the respect people have for this House as a relevant legislative body.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret the fact that we are still embroiled in this debate with people on the opposite side of the House trying to score cheap and irrelevant party political points.  If Fianna Fáil were in Government I accept that we would probably succumb to the temptation to make similar cheap cracks at the Government and suggest that they were afraid to face the electorate.  That argument does not hold water in the context of two elections taking place on 14 June, the Euro-elections and the by-election in Laois-Offaly. The electorate will have a chance to express their views on the performance of the Government in a general way. Whereas the hope is that the Euro-elections will be fought on European issues and the functions of the European Parliament, I have no doubt that in determining the manner in which they will vote the people will take other considerations into account.</P>
    <P>A filibuster of this nature does nothing to uphold respect for this House.  The suggestion made earlier by Deputy Ahern, that Members on this side of the House should keep quite while Members on the opposite side of the House gave forth their opinions on this issues, was understandable in the context of the events of last week, when it appeared that the view in the Fianna Fáil Party is that everybody should say the same things, everybody should think alike&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and in public nobody should say anything in any way different from what a colleague had said or in particular, what the leader had said.  It is even more extraordinary to try to extend <Col N="1677" /> that principle to members of other parties within the parliamentary process.</P>
      <P>I hope we can bring this debate to a conclusion, not because I am afraid of an election and not because there is anything relevant left to be said.  Nobody can now make an original contribution to this motion which would contribute one whit to tackling the problems we should be tackling as legislators.  This debate will waffle itself away to some sort of conclusion at 12.30 tomorrow morning when every person who still happens to be a member of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, as opposed to one person who was excluded last week, will have made a comment.  It might be interesting to hear one or two Deputies whom we rarely see in this House, if for no other reason than to confirm that they are still operating as legislators.</P>
      <P>I see no reason why we should continue with a filibuster of this nature with Deputies running into the House to repeat the same old things as their colleagues have said.  If Fianna Fáil are truly a unified party and they are all expressing the same view, I cannot understand why everybody in that party who has not yet spoken has to repeat what has been said already by their party colleagues.  Perhaps if they fail to repeat it there might be a suggestion that they hold a different view, and we know that can be very dangerous in that political organisation.</P>
      <P>As a member of a local authority my preference would have been to face the electorate this year in the local government elections.  I have no fear about doing so.  In the context of the Government's commitment to reforming the local government structures, and particularly in Dublin, the area with which I am most directly concerned, I welcome the fact that in the not too distant future we will have comprehensive reforming legislation to replace the anachronistic and outdated local government system we inherited from the British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That type of reform should have been introduced many years ago.  It is no shame to say that all political parties are to be blamed for the fact that these reforms were not introduced long ago.  I hope that by this time next year we will <Col N="1678" /> have the legislation passed and we will be on the road to a local government election campaign with people seeking election to newly formed and newly established local authorities which have relevance to the modern daily needs of local government within the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to respond to the suggestion that some Fianna Fáil backbenchers might be intimidated in some way.  I was elected to this House some 20 years ago.  I have always considered it a great privilege to represent the consitutunecy of Dún Laoghaire in the Fianna Fáil interest for that period of time.  One of the reasons I will continue to do so is that I stood up in this House without fear or favour and expressed a point of view without having to look over my shoulder, and without the aid of the unecessary observations made by Deputy Shatter in that respect.</P>
      <P>If I believed that the Government were in the process of reforming local government in Dublin city and county and the Dún Laoghaire Borough areas I would support the proposition before us.  I do not believe that that is a reality.  It is my belief &mdash; I will apologise to the House if it is unfounded &mdash; that the Government, seeing the way the electoral weather vane is blowing have funked the local elections. They are hiding behind a suggestion that in some way they are reforming local government.  If the Government introduce a sincere and genuine reform package so be it but it is my view that they will introduce a half-hearted, halfbaked package which will be presented as the be-all and end-all as far as their promises are concerned.  Once more we will be propagandised into believing that they have discharged their promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that this democratic Government tomorrow will lower the guillotion on the debate.  That means that the debate is being curtailed.  It is extraordinary that Members like Deputy Shatter, for whom I have a respect, should make allegations that in some way we are abusing the time to discuss this fundamental matter.  The debate effectively is about the negation of democracy at local <Col N="1679" /> level.  I have been a Member for a long time and I have seen many things happen here but this is one of the most serious matters to come before the House in my time.  It is all right to say that Fianna Fáil took similar action in the past but if they did so it was a bad precedent.  The House should not be guided by bad precedents. However, we are considering the present and the immediate future.  To suggest that the European elections and the by-election in Laois-Offaly are a substitute for the local elections is a false argument and will be proved to be so.</P>
    <P>In the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, which I represent, we have a most unusual situation in that of the 15 councillors only three are from Fianna Fáil.  Seven members are from Fine Gael and five from the Labour Party.  Effectively, the Coalition have a massive built-in majority of 12 to three.  The Cathaoirleach of that body over the last 25 years has been either a member of the Fine Gael or Labour Parties.  So much for the concept of power-sharing.  Fianna Fáil have been excluded from the chair of Dún Laoghaire Corporation for many years. We saw an opportunity this year of at least increasing the number of Fianna Fáil councillors there but the people of the area are being denied the opportunity to exercise their mandate in regard to local government.</P>
    <P>There are many issues to be dealth with in that area.  There is a serious housing problem and a difficulty in regard to amenities.  The future of Dún Laoghaire harbour is also a controversial issue.  In our local election programme we would have proposed a harbour authority to combine all the facilities, including the right of the local yacht clubs to continue there.  I should like to record my appreciation of the membership of the local yacht clubs.  There is an element creeping into that locality which suggests that the yacht clubs are in some ways over-abusing their restricted amenities.  The George, the National and the Royal clubs are as much entitled to the amenities at Dún Laoghaire as anybody else.  The National Yacht Club have produced a comprehensive plan for the extension of the amenities <Col N="1680" /> of the harbour in a most unselfish fashion and have also proposed a marina. That is the type of development we would support.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous possibilities for a harbour authority in Dún Laoghaire and we would have fought the local election with that as one of the issues.  We support the concept of a harbour authority enshrining all local interests.  The amenities in the harbour in Dún Laoghaire must be seen in a classless fashion.  We have two of the best promenades in Europe, in the West Pier and East Pier.  The Dún Laoghaire Motor Yacht Club on Sunday last opened a magnificient extension to their premises.  I was involved in the extension of the motor yacht park on the West Pier.  The harbour is under-utilised.  I can visualise a big fishing fleet being moored there.  Up to some years ago there was a thriving fleet operating from the Coal Quay but that has almost disappeared.  Fianna Fáil's massive plan for that area could have been tested had the local elections been held on 14 June but the local people have been deprived of the opportunity of adjudicating on it.</P>
    <P>There are many other local issues that could have been debated in the course of the campaign such as the attitude of the electorate to water charges and local charges generally.  What may have been produced in the past by any political party is of little concern to me.  What is important is the plan Fianna Fáil would have produced for Dún Laoghaire.  We would have been protesting strongly at the introduction of the water charges.  Our small team of local councillors courageously in the face of the Coalition junta voted against the introduction of water charges.  The people do not have any doubt about how we stand in regard to them.  We have also taken a stand in rejecting the inequitous house property tax and described it as a direct attack on the right of people to own their own homes.  We have highlighted that the home is fundamental to the individual.  It is a constitutional right although the courts took a different view.  I understand that the case, having been rejected by the High Court, is before the Supreme Court <Col N="1681" /> on appeal.  For that reason it would be improper for me to develop the point further.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believe that they could have swung the Coalition majority into one for their party if given the opportunity next month.  We are being treated to the fairy tale that this package of reform necessitates the postponing of the local elections for one year.  We do not believe that proposition.  The reality is different. The Government will in due course announce that they have not had sufficient time to carry out these reforms.  We may find that they will ask for a further postponement of the local elections. They may postpone them until such time as the gurus in the Coalition decide that the time is propitious, in electoral terms, to test the water.</P>
    <P>These are some reasons why I, from the backbenches of the Fianna Fáil Party, in the context of the Dún Laoghaire Borough constituency, protest in the strongest possible fashion at the Government's proposal to abandon the local elections. We wanted the local election.  The Government did not want the local elections. The people gave the Government the majority, the Government exercised the majority and refused to accede to the majority will in that context.  These are some of the problems confronting us.  We reject the proposal before the House and we reject the suggestion that we are somehow filibustering this debate.  This democratic Government decided to guillotine the debate tomorrow at 12.30 p.m. and in an barupt fashion bring an end to the democratic process.  That attitude prevails in relation to the abandonment of the proposal to hold the local elections on 14 June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Andrews I want to address a few observations to the House on the postponement of the local elections and I want to take up a few of the issues and the spurious, inconsistent and contradictory arguments put forward by Deputy Shatter. I mean no disrespect to him, but sometimes he reminds me of a bee who likes to sing and then move out of the way before somebody strikes.  I regret <Col N="1682" /> that Deputy Shatter has left the House after making what to me were stinging remarks that were totally out of context in this debate.  It is only right that the record be put straight in relation to some of these remarks, particularly as they were directed to local government and had little or nothing to do with the debate here.</P>
      <P>We are faced in this House with a decision by the Government to postpone the local elections for one year, we are told, and we are given the reason that local government needs reform.  This Government in a very conscientious and just manner are to set about bringing this reforms to a conclusion or to a stage that would enable them to launch the local elections next year.  The credibility of this has been dealt with by a number of speakers on this side and I want to deal with it again.  Of course, everybody on this side of the House agrees with the need for reform of local authorities.  Most people who have had any dealings in any capacity, as Deputy, councillor, or both, with local authorities, committees, decisions and with confusion as to jurisdiction &mdash; which I experience daily in my constituency &mdash; are aware of the acute need for reform.  I would go along with any Government, as do all Deputies here, in that we acknowledge the need for reforms, but a number of questions arise in relation to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question I want to put to the Government is how they can seriously and sincerely tell us on this side that they are postponing the local elections for one year because in that time they will have undertaken and completed the enormous task of the reform of the local authorities. I do not believe for a minute that that is realistic or sincere or intended to be sincere. As Deputy Andrews and others have said, this is clearly and blatantly a decision by the Government to funk the local authority elections, to opt out from the wrath of the electorate.  Unfortunately, they must face the electorate in the European elections and the by-election. We are convinced that we have enough evidence over the past few weeks to suggest that, should the Government have decided to take the local elections <Col N="1683" /> this year, in many places they would have been very seriously eroded in terms of strength.  Nobody in any organisation or agency or the media would disagree with that.  The evidence pouring in through opinion polls and other sources points out clearly that the Government would face a very serious and rejecting decision from the electorate in local authority areas this time around if they had had the courage to take them on.  Obviously they lack that courage.  They have shown moral cowardice in this instance.</P>
    <P>I see a number of underlying reasons why the Government should postpone the local elections.  Primarily, at present they enjoy a majority in many local authority areas, and that is fair enough. They took that on the basis of the circumstances of 1979.  They also enjoy a majority on the General Council of County Councils and the General Council of County Committees.  Because they are unable to grapple with the national issues in a convincing way they know that those majorities will be taken from them should they give the electorate an opportunity to decide.  It seems to be an attitude of &ldquo;what we have we told&rdquo;.  That reminds me of other countries and other decisions taken in the past in relation to problems in Ireland.  The Government have been seriously irresponsible in this instance.  I reject out of hand the argument put forward that it is in the best interests of local democracy.</P>
    <P>One of the first steps the Government took in relation to local democracy by way of introducing a water charge was to give unto the county and city managers the managerial function which enabled a county or city manager anywhere in the country to overrule decisions by local councillors.  The Government came into office on the back of a campaign which talked about liberal reform and greater democracy.  I do not know how anybody who knows anything about democracy would tell us that this decision was democratic or how it could promote democracy, locally or nationally.  Very unfairly the Government threw on to the laps of county managers the decision they were unable to deal with themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> This has a more serious aspect.  The people have their say at local election time.  This gives them the opportunity to thrust on to people locally identifiable the power at local level to exercise those functions and to implement decisions. With one fell swoop this Government decided to withdraw that.  This is a clear negation of local democracy, a denial of the right of the electorate who in 1979 voted in councillors in every county and local authority area.  I am convinced that the Government are acutely aware of the hazards that this decision has presented them with, therefore they decided that no opportunity would be given to the electorate in June 1984 to tell them clearly that they think about them.</P>
    <P>To come back to the reasons the Government have given for the postponement of the local elections, namely reform of local authorities, everybody in this House and most local representatives throughout the country would agree with the need for reform.  The decisions of the Government are totally inadequate in terms of financial provision to deal with the very serious problems.  There is considerable confusion about functions, areas of discrimination, and the allocation of very limited funds.  As public representatives we hear daily of unemployment problems that have arisen as a result of local authority decisions.  Daily, too, we are requested by people who have lost their jobs to make representations to Government to allow for transfer of funds from the Department of Social Welfare to environmental and local authority schemes.  If the Government were serious in their approach to problems within local authorities, and if they were serious in their approach to national problems, they would take up that case seriously.  I am not the first to voice this opinion.  Public representatives both here and elsewhere have brought it to the attention of Government but their calls seem to have fallen on deaf ears.  I am not convinced that some years would be involved in implementing the change. The transfer of funds could take place expeditiously if there were the necessary goodwill and commitment on the part of <Col N="1685" /> the Government to such transfer, but obviously that is not the case.</P>
    <P>There are some who will say that there are no jobs in local authorities and that consequently there is no work in these bodies.  Any Deputy or councillor representing the greater Dublin region, for instance, is acutely aware of the very high level of unemployment in the area and of the need for jobs in local authorities.  We are all aware, too, of the need for renewal of the city and of the need for a followup to the process that we in Government started by way of urban renewal in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is enormous potential for reform of local government by way of involving and engaging other Departments.  Such reform would be far more meaningful than the reform talked of in some of the statements and attitudes that have emanated from the other side of the House. If we are to tackle the whole question of local authorities we must tackle it at all levels and not only in terms of houses in the greater Dublin region.  We must tackle, too, the question of the environment and of urban problems in general.</P>
    <P>Of course, we must tackle also the problem of infrastructure.  It was interesting to note a recent statistic which revealed that it is normal practice for roads in urban and rural areas to be resurfaced every nine years.  I understand now that resurfacing is likely to take place as infrequently as every 27 years.  A country which needs the most rapid possible development of its infrastructure cannot tolerate much longer that sort of situation. We should be very seriously setting out to ensure that our infrastructure is kept to the highest possible standard and is developed further so as to allow for industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about recent decisions which seem to underpin the decision of the Government to postpone the local elections.  I am very concerned about the whole matter of managerial function.  It has in a very frightening way undermined local democracy.  It is interesting to hear Deputy Shatter refer to events taking place or about to take place in the best interest of democracy and to <Col N="1686" /> hear him allege that Deputies on this side of the House are trying to filibuster in regard to the local elections or that we are opposing for the sake of opposing. Perhaps if the Deputy were honest and sincere with himself in relation to what is happening he would acknowledge that the decision of the Government is undemocratic. I would equate the circumstances that many local authorities find themselves in by way of committee and general meetings with the situation of that long-established and honoured body, the ICA, to whom I do not intend any disrespect in making this remark.  The ICA create a social atmosphere for their members and keep a benevolent eye on their cares. The real power that local authorities could yield by way of decisions, of policy and so on seems to be gone.  This year we have witnessed in many instances local authorities trying to arrive at decisions regarding their estimates while councillors who are in the majority, whether they are made up of the three main political parties or otherwise, are overruled by county and city managers.  It is clear that the voice of councillors is not being heard.  I submit that Deputy Shatter's references to the absence of democracy are indeed relevant in the context of his party's decision.</P>
    <P>A case put forward by speakers on the other side and again by the Deputy, to whom unfortunately I must refer in order to set the record straight since he made a number of allegations that are totally unfounded, is that our attitude is to camouflage the difficulties that we were experiencing as a party in facing the electorate. We are prepared at any minute, on the basis of a change of attitude on the part of the Minister, to face the electorate at local elections in the same way as we are prepared to face them in the European elections and in the by-election.  The virtues of credibility, sincerity, integrity and democracy are being left aside so far as the Government are concerned.  One wonders what the reaction of the electorate will be when they discover that liberal reforms and the improvements in the democratic process are being thrown out the window.  I am convinced that the answer will be given clearly on June 14.</P>

      <P>We brought out a few ourselves on local government reform. There is need for public discussion of this matter.  Discussion papers should be published rather than having the ordinary type of legislation.</P>
      <P>We need a greater Dublin council in Dublin city.  We want something like town commissioners or small local councils in areas such as Tallaght, Kimmage and Crumlin.  The Minister of State will probably agree that a small local authority for inner city areas would be valuable.  There are many dedicated people in those areas who give a lot to their communities but because of the size of local authority areas it is difficult for them to win an election.  Smaller electoral areas would be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have small councils consisting of seven or eight people.  People would participate in what was happening in their own backyard.  A greater Dublin council could incorporate other areas.  I am very fortunate that my local authority area is within my Dáil constituency.  The Minister of State not only has the same constituency as I have but he represents a local authority area which is just as big as his constituency.  That makes it difficult <Col N="1688" /> if one wishes to be a member of both bodies.  Deputies, if they so wish, should be members of local authorities.  I have been a Member of the House for 20 years. I know that my work in Dublin Corporation complements my work in the Dáil. I can usefully contribute to debates such as this one on local government reform.</P>
    <P>Politicians are very interested in local government reform and the sooner we know the Government's thoughts on this the better.  It is a shame that the elections will be postponed while this reform takes place.  We cannot have major local government reform carried out in a short while.  It would take five years to have major local government reform.  It will be a long process.  Perhaps the Minister of State will tell us how soon after the plans are published it is intended to introduce this.  Can he give an indication of their thinking in relation to Dublin city, Limerick city, Galway city, Cork city and the urban councils?  Will they be integrated or merged?  Will some areas have greater councils?  Take an area like Bluebell-Inchicore.  That area could have a small local authority of its own.  These look nice on paper but one must cost them and see how they will be administered. What additional local taxation would be necessary?  I am against local taxation where it is levied on peoples not on the basis of their income but as a poll tax.  My views on the rating system are well know but, for the record, I am absolutely against the reintroduction of rates. I hope no Government will attempt to reintroduce them.  The people do not want them.  They have made that abundantly clear.  With all the polls we hear about, I wish one of these companies would devote their attention to whether people would prefer a system of local taxation based on the old scheme of rates or whether they would prefer local authorities to be financed from the central Exchequer.  This is very important because people complain about the lack of services but when they are asked to pay for them it is a different story.  When we were at a public meeting a few weeks ago the Minister and I were under severe attack because of the water rates.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the main points which <Col N="1689" /> I consider to be important.  However, it is a little like talking in a dark room because I do not know yet what the Government have in mind.  I urge them to release some information about what they are planning as soon as possible so that we will be able to make a constructive contribution.  The majority of people in this House are also members of local authorities or have been members of local authorities.  I am referring in particular to my own party.  We have something good to contribute to local government reform and we should not have to make our contributions too quickly.  We should not have a Bill rushed through the Dáil in 36 hours without letting Members look at the Government's proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this motion.  My first reaction was that I was disappointed the elections were not being held this year.  Many Deputies feel the Government are running away from the elections. We all know the elections were postponed previously by a Fianna Fáil Government.  The European elections were held in 1979 and the local elections were held on the same day.  One of the conditions laid down by my party was that candidates would not be entitled to run for both elections.  That gives an indication of how seriously we view these elections.</P>
      <P>There are many issues which could be debated in a local election this year but obviously the most important is the financing of local authorities.  Other speakers referred to the fact that we have got only 0.8 per cent of an increase this year over last year in respect of the grant for rates and land, but there are other points which should be highlighted. There seems to be a new stipulation on the money local authorities have received.  When the Minister gives a road grant to a local authority he adds that all payments made this year will be included in the actual road grant, even though that money could relate to the previous year. This is very serious.  I am sure almost every local authority has a carry-over from the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Galway County Council thought they <Col N="1690" /> were getting a total allocation of £4.1 million, but they got only £3.2 million, £500,000 less than last year.  I am sure other local authorities are in the same position.  We in Galway County Council took a decision that the county manager would get an overdraft of £500,000 to bring us up to £3.7 million this year.  Even then we find ourselves in a very difficult situation.  We will have 100 redundancies and all council workers will be laid off for 17 weeks.  This is the first time in the history of Galway County Council that we have had redundancies and lay-offs.</P>
    <P>There are other points which could be made, particularly the powers given to the county manager.  If we talk about reform this is an area which should be debated at some length.  We are all in favour of reform and giving power to the local authorities to look at ways of financing because we know they are facing very difficult times, but what is the point in talking about reform and ways of financing the local authorities when we give the county manager rather than the elected county councillors power to introduce service charges.</P>
    <P>What efforts have been made to reform the local authorities so far?  What efforts are being made in 1984?  In 1983 we had the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act which removed the statutory requirements on the Minister to provide grants equal to the amounts the local authorities would have got from rates. Another Act was passed giving powers to the county manager to introduce charges. Those Acts are doing the opposite to reforming local authorities; they are taking power from the local authorities and the elected members to make those decisions.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers said they do not fear going to the polls and that Fine Gael and Labour local authority representatives are confident they will win back their seats.  Fine Gael and Labour had a majority in Galway County Council, with the help of two Provisional Sinn Féin councillors.  The irony of the situation was that the Fine Gael and Labour Ministers were not prepared to meet those elected representatives.  Again, I see a number of contradictions in the attitude <Col N="1691" /> the Government are adopting.  Not alone would a Fianna Fáil member like to have the issues to which I referred regarding financing debated but also those of road grants and unemployment.  Obviously also Fianna Fáil members in Galway would like to gain a majority in the local authority there, which opportunity is being denied elected councillors and prospective candidates this year.</P>
    <P>I see the problem as a reluctance on the part of the Government to face the issues.  Why not have reform and at the same time allow the local elections to proceed?  In any serious attempt at reform there should have been seminars held and questionnaires issued to county councillors on the aspects of reform they should like to see implemented.  Indeed, being a county councillor today has become a very expensive job.  I know from talking to my colleagues in Galway County Council they are concerned that there is no money now available for such things as postage and telephone calls, which facilities would render their lives somewhat easier.  It is difficult for people to give so much of their time to helping constituents in their electoral areas when all they receive is an allowance for travelling and subsistence.  All the county councillors I know are hard working people and feel very frustrated that they do not have even limited postal and telephone facilities.  However, such facilities are provided by some local authorities. Bearing in mind current cut-backs one cannot really contend that it is up to each local authority to provide for themselves. Some local authorities like mine have been very badly hit; Wexford is another example.  Some guidelines must be laid down by the Department so that local authorities would be helped in that way.  The suggestions made here can be looked at without the Government having to postpone these local elections for a year or possibly even two years.  If they are to be postponed for two years then the Government should say so now rather than leading us on for another two years saying there will be reform with perhaps very little to show at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to see <Col N="1692" /> investigated in the course of any such reform is the payments local authorities are obliged to make in statutory demands.  The situation in County Galway is that £2 million is owed to the Western Health Board while there have been very heavy demands lodged by the Office of Public Works and ACOT, causing a very great drain on local authority resources, particularly at a time when 100 people are to be made redundant.  For example, it seems ridiculous also that local authorities must still maintain court-houses. It should be noted that the fines collected do not go to Galway County Council but rather to the Department of Justice, which is hardly just.  There is a lot of this type of interference by central Government placing statutory demands on local authorities, allowing them no say at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that merely as a passing reference in order to highlight the financial problems of local authorities. The Government should state clearly what is the position, whether it will be a one year or two year postponement of local elections.  Elected representatives should know this.  When the Government talk about local government reform they should state clearly also what will be the input of local authorities, which will be most important.  If there is not an in-depth study carried out of what will be local authorities' input then the postponement of these local elections will prove to have been a waste of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his initiative in postponing the local elections for at least 12 months.  It is a well known fact that local government is in need of much reform.  Having had the privilege of being a local councillor since 1967 I realise fully the responsibilities of local authorities.  I am a firm believer in more autonomy being given <Col N="1693" /> to local administrations in the running of affairs in their areas.  Speaking as a councillor in Cork county, which constitutes one-eighth of the entire area of this State, I am only too well aware of the serious obligations of local authorities.  Cork County Council, the largest body in this State apart from Dáil Éireann, has 46 members, each of whom is of the opinion that for far too long local government has not received its fair share of the national cake.  For example, millions of pounds have been paid in taxes on lorries, motor cars, tractors and so on, a lot of which never finds its way back to the county from which it was collected.  Since becoming a member of Cork County Council I have found it most frustrating that a county of such huge dimensions has not received its rightful share, of the national cake over the years.  It is about time that local government was updated and upgraded, ensuring that each county receives its rightful share.  There should not be any favouritism when funds are being allocated.  All councils should get their rights and fair shares.  County Cork is 140 miles long and the constituency I represent forms part of the county council area but there is not one mile of national primary road in that constituency.</P>

They postponed local elections for their own selfish and greedy reasons.  We can stand over the reason why the present Minister postponed the elections for 12 months.  Until proper legislation is introduced to enable local authorities to put their own house in order I would not mind if the local elections were postponed for another 12 months.  I will not take any heed of criticism from across the House because when they postponed the elections they did it for their selfish party reasons.</P>

The European elections are of such paramount importance that they should not be confused with local government elections.  Our representation in the European Parliament is of vital importance to our national economy and I firmly believe both elections should not be held simultaneously.  Anybody with commonsense would agree with me.  Everybody knows we are at the crossroads in Europe and there is no turning back.  Therefore, the two elections should not be held at the same time.</P>

It is most important for the future of local government to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> dWe have 27 county councils and they are working very well.  If the powers of these councils are eroded or taken away it will be the death knell of democracy. Regional bodies are not working satisfactorily.  They are too big and cumbersome and are not giving the necessary service to the people.  For years I have been critical of the move to cut out the small man.  The present policy in regard to local government has outlived its usefulness and is not in line with the policy which must be adopted if we are to improve local government.

      <P>That was in 1978 and many potholes were created between 1977 and 1981.  There was no money to <Col N="1698" /> fill them in because of the policies of the Fianna Fáil administration.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this motion.  I very much regret the postponement of the local elections.  It is a course of action which should not have been undertaken. The official excuse for the postponement is the necessity for carrying out local government reform.  Nobody will deny that there is a great need for reform in many areas of local government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan's argument that the postponement of the elections is justified because Fianna Fáil did the same thing on a couple of occasions in the past does not hold water.  Times have changed and it is at least a decade since the local elections were last postponed.  Much has happened since and every year events seem to move faster, facing us with situations which we did not anticipate or expect to confront.  It is pointless to attempt to justify the postponement on the basis that a previous Government did the same thing in other times.  The postponement of these elections is damaging to democracy, especially in recessionary times when there is so much unemployment, as well as the attendant frustration, discontent and outright anger towards those who are held to be responsible.  The same would apply to any Government.</P>
      <P>Most people are inclined to blame the Government for their everyday circumstances. This is particularly so of the young who find it so difficult to get employment and will find it impossible to do so if present Government policies continue in operation.</P>

      <P>Deputy David Andrews has sought and been granted permission to raise on the Adjournment the matter of Question No. 4 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1699" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It has caused considerable concern in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire and concerns probably one of the most respected companies in the area.  That company, of whose name the Minister will have note, have been good to Dún Laoghaire and the South County Dublin area, in particular, over the years. Anything I have to say during the course of my short contribution should not be seen as a criticism of the organisation concerned, but as a helpful contribution, I hope, towards alleviating a very serious problem for a large number of people.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he would make a statement on the loss of 140 jobs at a manufacturing firm in County Dublin and the plans, if any, that he had for alternative employment for the persons concerned.</P>
      <P>His response was that the first indication that he and the Industrial Development Authority had that this company were planning to close their diagnostic reagents plant came on Wednesday, 18 January 1984.  It appears that on learning of this development, the IDA entered into discussions with the company concerned with a view to determining whether the redundancies could be averted or postponed, or alternative employment could be provided.  The company maintained that their decision was irreversible and about 140 employees were laid off on 9 March 1984.</P>
      <P>Now I come to the kernel of the problem, where we have to tread very lightly because, as I understand, discussions are still proceeding between the IDA and the parent company to explore the options for the Irish operation.  The Minister might be able to help the House and the Dún Laoghaire Deputies in this regard, telling us how these discussions are progressing. If he considers that revelation in some way prejudicial to those discussions, I certainly will not press the matter, not wishing to prejudice any ongoing negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined the IDA's plans for the general Dún Laoghaire area, <Col N="1700" /> which includes the development of a major new business park at Leopardstown to accommodate quality services and the active promotion of a 27,500 square feet advance factory at Sandyford, as well as the vacant factory space on the council estate at that location.  No doubt, the Minister and the Industrial Development Authority, because of my question, have the figures for unemployment in the Dún Laoghaire area.  As of 27 January 1984, the Dún Laoghaire employment exchange had a total registered unemployment figure of 5,561 people.  This was made up as follows: males under the age of 25 &mdash; 1,077; females under the age of 25 &mdash; 616; males over the age of 25 &mdash; 2,554; females over the age of 25 &mdash; 1,314.  These figures were given to me on January of this year.  My information is that they may have increased appreciably since then.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response indicated a massive job haemorrhage in the Dún Laoghaire area.  It is symptomatic of the job losses which are continuing daily and are now being accepted as a way of life, but that is not acceptable.  The type of job loss concerned here appears to go gaily unnoticed and is accepted as a drop in the ocean of about a quarter of a million unemployed.  I know that the official figures are 214,000 unemployed at present.  However, the figures unofficially would be somewhere in the region of a quarter of a million.</P>
    <P>Despite its size in population, the Dún Laoghaire constituency has never been the focus of specific industrial development promotion.  The Minister will be aware that there are only a few small manufacturing businesses in the whole constituency, which has been regarded as a dormitory area for Dublin city.  The borough area has a population equal to that of Limerick city, which is an extraordinary statistic.  Limerick city, however, has been the subject of a very special industrial promotion by the IDA and SFADCo and I have no complaint in that regard &mdash; good luck to them.</P>
    <P>The entire Dún Laoghaire constituency, borough and county area, has a population close to that of Cork city which, not withstanding recent problems <Col N="1701" /> such as the closure of Dunlop's and Ford's, has always been the subject of very special industrial development promotion. The best of luck to Cork area in that regard.</P>
    <P>One very important matter to which the Minister might advert in the context of unemployment is that Limerick has its own third level college which is generally regarded as a major factor in encouraging many of the new technological industries to that area.  Cork has its own university, regional technical college and technical institute.  Galway has a university and a regional technical college and has seen the arrival of a large number of big manufacturing industries over the last ten years.  The Dún Laoghaire constituency has no such facilities, although there is the long awaited proposal for a regional technical college to be developed in the Dún Laoghaire area.  These plans are on the drawing board and it is hoped that they will be off the drawing board and into their proper location in the not too distant future.  It is of the greatest importance from any point of view, social or economic, that the regional technical college as a matter of urgency be sited in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous future for the service industry in the Dún Laoghaire constituency.  A white elephant stands there at the moment, overlooking Dún Laoghaire harbour &mdash; the empty Bord lascaigh Mhara building.  There are certain plans for this, but I wish those plans would become a reality and the building inhabited as a matter of urgency.  The spin-off effect for the locality would be great, indeed.</P>
    <P>Many living in the Dún Laoghaire constituency work in Dublin city and other areas, but those who work in the constituency are mostly in the service industries. Relatively speaking, there is very little manufacturing employment there and that tends to be concentrated on Pottery Road, the location of the factory which is the subject matter of my question.  In addition, there is manufacturing employment in Kill Lane, Deans Grange and Sallynoggin.  These areas however, have suffered some large factory closure job losses &mdash; for example, Waltham Electronics <Col N="1702" /> in Sallynoggin and others.  Manufacturing employment in the borough is estimated at just over 3,000.  The service industry jobs appear to be concentrated in shops, shopping areas and the provision of professional services, representative of what might be called office jobs. The development of shopping centres such as the new one at Shankill &mdash; a supermarket and nine shops &mdash; and at Blackrock &mdash; a supermarket and 50 shops, should provide a fair number of new jobs, perhaps up to 300 in all.</P>
    <P>Again, Dún Laoghaire has been a significant tourist area with hotels and so forth.  Unfortunately many of them have now disappeared.  Consequently there has been a drop in the number of jobs associated with the tourist industry in Dún Laoghaire.  I have never been able to quantify exactly what the losses have been in that regard.</P>
    <P>This leads me to conclude that there is a very urgent need to develop a positive business and job creating development plan for the Dún Laoghaire constituency. This does not deny the many very worthy organisations that have shown great concern for the area including the Dún Laoghaire Chamber of Commerce, the Dún Laoghaire Junior Chamber of Commerce and the various organisations such as the Lions organisation and the Rotary organisation.  There is also the significant once-off annual contribution to employment in the area, the Dún Laoghaire Summer Festival which has gone from strength to strength.  It is a magnificent festival and attracts quite a large number of people into the area for its week-long activities.  This year's festival will take place in the near future.  These are the type of ongoing organisations which have contributed a great deal to development of the area.  I do not believe any praise of mine is high enough for them.  There are many other organisations which are too numerous to mention.  The ones I have named are a representative of them.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire has a number of tremendous advantages.  We have a large population base as a potential market. There are 120,000 people in the constituency without mentioning the adjoining well populated constituencies.  There are <Col N="1703" /> 45 per cent of the people in the borough under 25 years of age who will be looking for jobs.  In the county area the population under 25 will also be looking for jobs in the near future.  We have a well-educated work force with a sense of enthusiasm. This accounts for about 52 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of the constituency is that it is a maritime consituency with an almost undeveloped coastline.  The prospects for Dún Laoghaire harbour and the hopeful advent of a harbour authority in the not too distant future represent tremendous potentialities for the area incorporating all of the interests in Dún Laoghaire harbour and creating new interests such as a properly restored fishing fleet.  There are tremendous facilities for a fishing fleet in Dún Laoghaire and there are great opportunities for employment. There is also the oft mentioned marina which would attract large numbers of people to that particular part of the constituency combining the interests of the people to that particular part of the constituency combining the interests of the yacht clubs and rowing clubs who are entitled to their particular stake in the harbour.  As far as my party are concerned we will be supporting their right to continue to exist there and to make their very worthy contribution.  There is a place for all in Dún Laoghaire harbour hopefully presided over by a harbour authority.</P>
    <P>In the constituency a large proportion of the people have vast experience of business and their expertise could be further tapped to begin new business ventures. We have between 5,500 and 6,000 unemployed people.  The majority of these people are anxious to get employment. We ask the Minister to look at the possibility of setting up a Dún Laoghaire Development Association with the objective of pressing the advantages and needs of the Dun Laoghaire constituency as a location for new business.  There are examples of towns which have set up small business associations such as Killala in County Mayo which might be seen as a pilot for the proposed Dún Laoghaire Development Association.  We ask the Minister to consider that land in the constituency <Col N="1704" /> be zoned for industry.  I specifically suggest that a major industrial and business site be developed at Loughlinstown where it would be near to the AnCO training facilities.  The IDA should be specifically requested to find large manufacturing industries particularly in the new technologies which should be located in the constituency.  If a regional technical college was developed it would play a major part in encouraging industrial development in the area where it is located.  We believe that such a college should be set up in the Dún Laoghaire constituency very soon.</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister to give specific consideration to the establishment of harbour based industries in the Dún Laoghaire harbour area such as fish processing and the preparation of fish based products.  We also ask that small industries be set up which would include the manufacture of small boats, boat fittings and souvenirs.  This type of small unobtrusive industry should be considered because the harbour potential is immense.  We also ask the Minister to consider, in the context of an overall job opportunity plan for the Dún Laoghaire area, that the harbour be promoted as a base for a substantial fishing fleet which in turn would provide jobs.  We ask that the whole coastline from Blackrock to Shankill be developed as a coastal amenity and play area and that specific locations such as the existing Dalkey harbour be further developed with small industries and the area of Killiney and Shankill be developed with small piers and break-waters to improve the amenity of the beaches at these particular locations.</P>
    <P>These are some of the suggestions we have in mind in the context of an overall plan for the Dún Laoghaire constituency. We suggest that a major leisure and pleasure centre be developed in Dún Laoghaire which would act as a major recreational centre for the Dublin area in particular.  We suggest that the county council, borough corporation and the vocational educational committees in conjunction with the Youth Employment Agency and youth club community organisations recruit and appoint fulltime local youth and community leaders <Col N="1705" /> to organise and plan local activities in their areas.</P>

      <P>It is a series of notes which I have prepared.  I am very grateful to the Chair for his tolerance.  This might be seen as a launching pad for what I consider to be a job opportunity and job creation plan for the Dún Laoghaire constituency. I accept that I have gone outside the purview of my original question but, on the basis that the particular company have lost a large number of jobs, I consider, with the indulgence of the House, that I should be allowed offer a solution to the particular problem.  These are some of the solutions to what is considered to be a very serious problem in the area.  The people of Sallynoggin, for whom I have the greatest affection, the people of Ballybrack, Shankill and the central Dún Laoghaire area demand more of the Government and of their politicians.  If we cannot give them jobs immediately at least we have an obligation to give them hope.  There is a massive, well educated work force in these areas stretching from Booterstown, Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire, Sallynoggin, Loughlinstown, Ballybrack, Shankill and Killiney.  Those people are willing and able to work.  If this 20 minutes has done nothing more than to give them hope we have done our job in raising this particular issue on the Adjournment.  I agree I went considerably outside my original brief but it is an opportunity which must be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with my constituency colleague in urging that every effort be made to avoid as far as possible any job losses in the area.  I do not wish to prejudice any talks or discussions that may be going on.  As Deputy Andrews indicated, any job losses at the moment are a major problem and the increasing unemployment figure <Col N="1706" /> is disturbing.  In this area factories have operated successfully for many years and the local work force must get credit.  If there are losses in this factory every effort must be made to ensure other jobs are attracted into the area.</P>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire is by the sea and the possibility of providing jobs relating to this fact should be investigated.  In this connection consideration should be given to establishing a harbour authority.  This matter has been bounced around by several Governments but I hope this Government will make a definite decision. The possibility of creating jobs in the area of tourism, fishing and fish processing should be considered.  I hope the Government will make up their minds with regard to a harbour authority for this area, and also ensure the proper usage of the facilities that exist there. Every effort must be made to prevent further job losses in the area and to attract new industries.  Dún Laoghaire is near the main road to Rosslare and is also near the new dual carriageways being constructed at the moment and thus has easy access for industry.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank my constituency colleague for raising this matter.  He recognises the difficulties in this area and the development potential that exists.  In addition, all of us hope to avoid further job losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to the question raised on the Adjournment. I wish to assure the Deputies that I am as concerned as they are about the recent redundancies in Warner Lambert. Obviously the loss of 140 jobs is a matter that is looked at seriously by my Department. I first became aware of the company's decision on 18 January last and immediately I arranged with officials of the IDA to make contact with the executives of the Irish operation with a view to seeing if the redundancies could be averted, contained, reduced or even delayed.  I also wished to determine the status of the remaining pharmaceutical, gum base and surgical drapes operations of the company and to examine the possibility <Col N="1707" /> of a replacement project being found or the possibility of expanding any of the remaining Irish operations if there was no question of adverting the redundancies.</P>
      <P>The decision to close the diagnostics side of the Irish operation was made by the parent company because its second diagnostic plant located in New Jersey has spare capacity and could adequately meet market demand which has been dropping recently.  This drop in demand was linked to the static or declining European sales of the Irish plant product range.  I understand it would have taken a significant investment &mdash; a number of millions of pounds &mdash; to make the Irish plant capable of manufacturing the full range of diagnostics produced by the company while the New Jersey plant, which has the advantage of being situated beside the parent company's R and D centre, can manufacture this range with little or no investment.  This emphasises the importance which the IDA attach to a &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; operation in Ireland. Had the R and D centre been in Ireland, I do not think there would have been the redundancies.  It is a lesson the IDA understand and one of which they are aware when attracting new industries.</P>
      <P>The company have indicated that the closure of the Irish plant is the result of a corporate strategy aimed at strengthening their diagnostic market position and is not linked to any deficiencies in the Irish plant in terms of quality, productivity or delivery.  I am informed the company will not alter their decision which was taken for what were considered to be sound commercial reasons. This is not something over which I, my Department or the IDA have any control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, discussions between the IDA and the company are ongoing in an attempt to try to secure a replacement project or an expansion of the company's other operations here.  I should like to point out that the company still employ about 200 people in Dún Laoghaire in producing pharmaceuticals and chewing gum base.  I should also like to point out that in the general area surrounding Dún <Col N="1708" /> Laoghaire the IDA are actively promoting the vacant factory space on the local authority industrial estate at Sandyford and their 27,500 sq. ft. advance factory. The IDA originally had eight acres on this estate, the bulk of which has been fully developed and allocated.  The IDA have also undertaken a major development in the South County International Services Park at Leopardstown where they have opened a 70-acre site to house quality, international service industries. The first building of 12,000 sq. ft. is currently under construction on this site and is scheduled for completion shortly. These developments will have a beneficial effect on the entire area and the IDA will continue to promote Dún Laoghaire and surroundings for suitable industrial development.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out that there are a number of companies in the area giving substantial employment, such as Becton Dickinson, Smith and Nephew Limited and Glen Abbey Hosiery Limited.  There are also two other companies I should like to mention, Albright and Wilson and Oriflame Limited who provide valuable employment.  It is interesting to note that the manufacturing employment figures for Dún Laoghaire have remained fairly static since 1980.  In 1980 the total employed in manufacturing industry was 3,592 and in 1983 this figure was 3,423. Dún Laoghaire has survived the serious recession rather better than most places throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews spoke about third level colleges.  While that is not in my Department, I should like to point out that Dublin is well off with regard to third level education institutes.  There is the NIHE and the universities and a substantial number of third level courses are carried out at the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Unlike many towns and cities throughout Ireland who have no access to third level education, Dublin and the surrounding areas are well catered for.</P>
    <P>While Dún Laoghaire has come through the recession rather better than many towns and cities throughout the country, it does not take from the fact <Col N="1709" /> that the loss of 140 jobs is a very serious matter and one with which I sympathise fully.  I can only assure the House that the IDA will make every effort to encourage <Col N="1710" /> the company to expand in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have no power to make &ldquo;obsolete area&rdquo; orders and, therefore, the question of a time limit does not arise.  However, in making their statutory development plans, planning authorities are obliged to include objectives for development and renewal of obsolete areas.  The making and variation of development plans is the responsibility, under law, of the elected local councils.  Before a plan or variation is made, a draft must be put on public display, and any objections or representations must be considered by the authority. It is there fore open to owners of property in an area identified in a draft as an obsolete area to make their views known, and have them considered, prior to the making of the development plan. The Planning Acts impose a statutory duty on the planning authority to take such steps as may be necessary for securing the objectives of the development plan.  They are obliged to review their plans at least once in every five years and this enables local interests, or individuals, to seek to have existing policies reviewed or amended.</P>

      <P>Existing housing legislation required each local authority to provide housing for persons in its areas who are in need of housing and unable to house themselves from their own resources. Local authorities house travellers as part of their normal housing programmes and in accordance with their statutory schemes of letting priorities.  The majority of travellers who have been house have been dealt with in this way. Recently, local authorities have been asked by my Department to provide particulars of housing needs and lettings in their areas, with particular reference to specific groups such as travelling people.</P>
      <P>In addition to standard housing, local authorities provide special accommodation (group housing schemes or serviced sites) for travellers not yet ready or anxious for normal housing and my Department provides the necessary finance.  My Department also recoups 90 per cent of the salary and expenses of social workers employed by local authorities and voluntary settlement committees to assist the accommodation of travellers.</P>
      <P>To review policies and services in relation to travelling people, a widely representative review body was set up jointly by the Ministers for Health and the Environment in 1981.  A task force composed of six Ministers of State has completed consideration of the report of the review body and their recommendations will shortly be considered by the Government. It is ensivaged that a full statement will be issued when the Government has completed its deliberations on the matter.</P>

      <P>No avoidable delay occurs in dealing with proposals for revisions of speed limits.  Speed limits must be prescribed in regulations made by me under the Road Traffic Acts.  However, an administrative devolution was made in 1974 to allow local authorities themselves, in conjunction with the Garda to recommend proposals for revisions and additions to existing local speed limits, i.e. built-up area and special speed limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this system, reviews of speed limits are conducted peroidically by local authorities in accordance with guidelines laid down by my Department.  Proposals arising from such reviews are submitted to me on a county by county basis and the ensuring regulations are dealt with in a similar manner.  The first completed cycle of regulations made under these arrangements was completed at the end of 1979.  The second cycle is currently in <Col N="1588" /> progress and to date regulations have been made for 13 counties.  Proposals are currently before me for revisions of speed limits in counties Carlow, Cavan, Donegal, Dublin, Laois, Longford, Meath, Waterford and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Regulations for these counties will be made as soon as possible.  Proposals for counties Galway, Leitrim, Louth, Mayo and Sligo are still awaited from the local authorities concerned.  While it is my policy to implemented local authority proposalse as far as possible, I have reserved particular discretion in relation to national roads in view of the importance of ensuring uniformity of treatment throughout the network and of ensuring that speed limits on such roads do not adversely affect the level of service or safety on such roads.  Proposals for limits on such roads must accordingly be specially vetted by my Department's roads inspectorate.  In addition, local authority proposals must be converted into a form suitable for regulations; in particular descriptions of locations must be sufficiently accurate for legal purposes.</P>

      <P>As a result of the EEC's Western Package grants for group water schemes in the designated western region <Col N="1590" /> were determined at the higher rates of 80 per cent of the cost per unit, subject to maximum grants of £600 per domestic supply and £400 per potential farm supply. These higher rates of grants were applicable originally to schemes commenced by 31 December 1983.  On 12 December last my predecessor announced the extension of the scheme to enable the higher rate of grants to apply to schemes which commence by 30 June 1985.  The need for any further changes will be kept under review in the light of experience of the working of the present arrangements in the intervening period.</P>

The inspector of taxes has written to the taxpayer for the details necessary to carry out a review of his liabilities for earlier years.  When the required information is supplied the taxpayer's affairs will be brought up to date.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the inspector of taxes was not notified until August 1983 that the taxpayer and his spouse had, in fact, been separated since September 1977.  The taxpayer had been treated for tax purposes as a married person and was granted the appropriate allowances and reliefs for the years 1978-79 to 1983-84, inclusive. When the material facts of the case were brought to the inspector's notice it was discovered that the taxpayer was entitled to be assessed to tax as a single person only for those years.</P>

    <P>Reviews of the taxpayer's income tax liabilities for the five years 1978-79 to 1982-83 revealed that he had underpaid tax in the amount of £1,669.53.  His tax position for 1983-84 has still to be examined <Col N="1595" /> by the inspector.  The total tax underpaid will be collected by means of appropriate reductions of the taxpayer's annual tax-free allowances under PAYE and the inspector will now communicate with the taxpayer in the matter.</P>

      <P>There has been no undue delay in processing payment of benefits under the Non-Contributory Pension Scheme for non-established State employees to former employees of the Boyne Drainage Scheme who were made refundant by the Office of Public Works.  A total of 128 drainage workers (72 on the Boyne Drainage Scheme, 26 on the Maigue Drainage Scheme and 30 on the Corrib-Mask-Robe Drainage Scheme) were made redundant at fortnightly intervals between 2 March 1984 and 13 April 1984.</P>
      <P>Each of these cases has had to be examined in the context of the Non-Contributory Pension Scheme, including, in many cases, investigation and verification of potentially pensionable service with employers other than the Office of Public Works, in addition to the not inconsiderable continuous volume of cases being processed for the award of pensions and lump sums on age or ill-health retirement in all areas of the Office of Public Works's employment and the award of death gratuities and pensions to widows and children of deceased employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employees of the Boyne and other drainage schemes and their trade unions have been consistently advised on a number of occasions that in view of the very heavy additional work load involved, it would take at least two or three months after cessation of employment before the lump sum under the pension scheme, associated with redundancy, could be paid.  In the case of all former employees of the Boyne Drainage Scheme, who have been found to be entitled to benefits under the pension scheme, and who were made redundant on 2 and 16 March, and some of those who were made redundant on 30 March, payments of the pension <Col N="1598" /> lump sum has been authorised within the past week or will be authorised within the next week.

His wife claimed and was awarded a retirement pension in her own right from 2 May 1975.

The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 24 May 1982 and his application was disallowed on the grounds that he was not available for work.  He appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of his case on 27 July 1983.  The appeals officer also disallowed the application.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to state how many students will leave second level education in Galway for each of the next three years.  However, it is estimated that the number of terminal leavers from full-time second level education in Galway city and county will amount to about 3,000 in 1984.</P>

      <P>The Department have approved in principle the development of a new school on a new site at Woodford, County Galway, to cater for 200 students.  The outline sketch scheme for this project is currently under examination in the Department. The question of the allocation of grant towards the cost of the construction of the new school only arises when architectural planning has been completed, and will depend on the capital resources available at that stage, taking into consideration the Department's other commitments and priorities.  At this early stage of planning it is not possible to say when building will commence.</P>
