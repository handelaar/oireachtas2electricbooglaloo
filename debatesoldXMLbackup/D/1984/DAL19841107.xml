    <Title>Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that the Ombudsman, even in his short period of operation, has proved a resounding success.  To date, he has already received approximately 1,300 complaints and has dealt with more than 1,000 of them.  He has already, therefore, made a major impact on behalf of citizens in their dealings with bureaucracy.  The volume of complaints he has received has shown how justified was the all-party agreement to establish the office of Ombudsman.  The high number of complaints finalised is a tribute to the efficiency with which the Ombudsman, <Col N="1301" /> assisted by his capable staff, has discharged his responsibility.</P>
    <P>Of course, the success of the Ombudsman's office depends, to a great extent, on his receiving the full co-operation of Government Departments and, indeed, from every individual civil servant. I need hardly draw attention to the fact that any absence of co-operation would be tantamount to frustrating the intentions of this House.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the matter on hands, I should like to say, however, that the relationships of the bureaucracy with citizens is an area which demands constant vigilance by the Government and the Oireachtas.  State agencies exist to serve the public who ultimately, of course, pay for them.  I have always believed that those who pay the piper must call the tune.  We must be particularly careful, therefore, to ensure that, where the organs of the State touch on the daily lives of citizens, they do not forget their basic purpose, whatever their organisational form or the freedom of operation which they have.  The principle of service must be a paramount consideration in the operation of all State agencies and there can be no relaxation of this principle in any way.</P>
    <P>To turn now to the Bill before the House, the two Schedules to the Ombudsman Act, 1980, indicate the bodies which are subject or not subject to investigation by the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Amendment of these Schedules is effected by order.  Under Section 4 (10) (c) of the Act, the draft order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The order cannot be made if a resolution disapproving the draft is passed by either House within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>This time requirement, however, can lead to delays in making orders.  Depending on circumstances &mdash; frequency of House sittings, holidays, timing of order and so on &mdash; it can take up to five months to make necessary amendments to the Schedules.  In many cases, there would be widespread agreement on these amendments.  In some cases, the public interest would require early action by the Ombudsman.  Given his vital role as a <Col N="1302" /> means of redress for citizens, as I have already outlined, it is important that he be allowed to deal quickly and effectively with relevant issues.</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to speed up the procedural arrangements for amending the Schedules to the Ombudsman Act, 1980.  This is particularly important in the context of making changes in the scope of the Ombudsman's remit, on which I intend to bring proposals before the House shortly.</P>
    <P>Where the need for an independent examination of the bureaucracy's operations in particular areas is clearly demonstrated, we must ensure that the Ombudsman is permitted to respond quickly.  I am sure nobody in this House would countenance a situation where, because of procedural requirements, the Ombudsman was unduly delayed in acting quickly on behalf of the interests of citizens in their dealings with the bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect to this Bill which I regard as very important.  Its provisions envisage the active participation by the Oireachtas in future decisions affecting the Ombudsman's remit.  All changes in this remit would require a positive motion of approval by the Oireachtas which, in turn, would give Members the opportunity of making their views known.</P>
    <P>This is how it should be.  The operations of the Ombudsman touch the daily lives of citizens and offer them a central focus in seeking redress against administrative malpractice.  It is right, therefore, that the Oireachtas should be fully involved in determining the scope of these operations.</P>
    <P>It might be worth the while of the Oireachtas or of some of its committees to examine at some stage the procedure adopted in so much of our legislation whereby draft orders are tabled and remain, usually undebated, for 21 days on the Table of the House.  I suggest that the type of amendment we are proposing in this Bill might be employed in other legislation so that the Oireachtas could <Col N="1303" /> play a more positive role in the confirmation of orders than is the case now in many instances.</P>
    <P>For this reason, I am happy to submit myself to the scrutiny of the House each time that such changes are proposed here.  As Deputies will be aware, this represents a significant change in present arrangements.  In a way, these assign an essentially passive role to the Oireachtas in that they put the onus on it to take the initiative in deciding whether to pass a motion of disapproval where amendments arise.</P>
    <P>I consider, therefore, that the changes which the Bill will bring about will make a positive contribution to the effective operation of the Ombudsman and that it will also fully involve the Oireachtas in relevant decision making in this area.  For these reasons, I strongly commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the Minister on the technical aspects of this Bill and I agree, too, with his remarks regarding the procedure whereby so many items can go through by way of order and without being debated here. Whether this tactic or device was used for one reason or another down through the years, it has outlived its usefulness. There are two reasons for changing that procedure.  One is that it can delay something urgent and, secondly, something that should be debated can slip through, the latter being the one with which I would be most concerned.  For that reason I support the Bill and I welcome the opportunity to review briefly the operations to date of the office of Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>However, I am disappointed to some extent that the Minister is not at this stage extending the operations of that office to sections of the administration outside the Civil Service.  I have in mind local authorities, the health boards and the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that when the proposals for the setting up of the office of Ombudsman were being discussed by the all-party informal committee, <Col N="1304" /> the view was expressed strongly that the office should cover not only central Government administration but should be permitted to accept complaints against local authorities, health boards and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  The Chairman of the committee, the former Deputy Richie Ryan, suggested that it might be best to give the Ombudsman a limited area of work initially and then to add to it in the light of the operation of the system.  According to the report of the proceedings, the Minister's view prevailed and the all-party committee, while suggesting that they could &ldquo;see no grounds in principle for excluding local government from the Ombudsman purview&rdquo; went on to say that in the early stages a case could be made on the grounds of cautious pragmatism for temporarily excluding local authority matters. While the all-party committee were willing, with a little ministerial arm twisting, to permit the temporary exclusion of local government from the Ombudsman's jurisdiction, they caution that a temporary exclusion of this kind could not be permitted to harden into permanency.</P>
    <P>Broadly similar arguments were put forward for bringing the health boards and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies into the Ombudsman's jurisdiction on a phased basis.  When it came to translate the proposals put forward by the all-party committee into legislation Fianna Fáil had returned to power.  On the eve of the Government's introduction of their proposals for an Ombudsman Bill, which I am sure the House will well remember, Deputy Ryan attempted to make some political capital out of the Ombudsman office by introducing a Private Member's Bill.  In spite of the Deputy's advice to the all-party committee when he was Minister, he proposed virtually universal administrative jurisdiction for the Ombudsman.  When the Fianna Fáil proposals were debated much was made by Fine Gael and Labour of the fact that the Ombudsman's remit would not run to local government matters. Deputies on the far side of the House made liberal sounding appeals for an <Col N="1305" /> immediate extension of the Ombudsman's remit to all and sundry.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Minister of State at the time, Deputy Calleary, who steered the Ombudsman legislation through the House, indicated that neither he nor the Government had any objection to extending the Ombudsman's jurisdiction but that there existed the practical problem of consulting with the democratically elected representatives in local government. Deputy Calleary undertook to initiate a series of consultations with local authorities on that issue and to come back to the House within three months. Unfortunately he never got back to that because an election intervened.  I know the consultations took place in the spring of 1981.  With very few exceptions, as the Minister and his Department officials know, local authorities were positive in their attitude to the extension of the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman into their areas.  The way was open for the appointment of an Ombudsman with full jurisdiction at that stage.  Before any appointment could be made there was a general election and the incoming Coalition regime, after years of preaching on the issue from the safety of Opposition, pulled the plug on the Ombudsman &mdash; note that it was a Labour Minister &mdash; and deleted £247,000 from the 1981 Estimates thereby ending it for that stage.</P>
    <P>The result of the Coalition action was to delay the appointment of the Ombudsman for a further two years.  We now have an Ombudsman.  His office is fully operational.  It appears from listening to Deputies who are regularly in touch with him that he is doing a good job.  The office should have its jurisdiction extended without further delay.  The administrative injustice that a citizen suffers at the hands of local government, health boards or State-sponsored bodies is no less because it occurs outside of a Department of State.  In that a citizen can count on the protection of this House through parliamentary questions when he is dealing with central Government, it can be argued that injustices which occur in other areas are greater because there is less accountability.  This is true in the <Col N="1306" /> case of non-commercial State bodies where the citizen does not have the benefit of registering a protest by taking business elsewhere.</P>
    <P>One area where a number of my colleagues continually have problems is with An Bord Telecom.  Replies which my colleagues have received are far from what is desirable for an elected Member of Parliament to receive.  Without naming some of the chief executives, courtesy would be a good lesson for them to learn.</P>
    <P>As far as the majority of citizens are concerned public administration is a seamless garment.  A citizen suffering a grievance, whether real or imaginery, does not distinguish between central and local government.  In many cases citizens' dealings with local authorities and health boards are more frequent and sensitive than their dealings with central Government, except for social welfare.  Logic dictates that citizens given the protection of the Ombudsman in one area of government should be given the same protection in all areas of public administration.</P>
    <P>We have much to be proud of in our public service.  In 1980 when we created the office of Ombudsman we established an officer who was charged with the task of carrying the light of public scrutiny into all areas of public administration.  If the Ombudsman who is so empowered highlights something which is bad then it can be corrected.  If he highlights something which is good no harm can come of his highlighting it.  It is almost a quarter of a century since the first discussions on the creation of an Irish Ombudsman got underway.  The time has come to extend the office in this manner and create an Ombudsman with the power, function and jurisdiction enjoyed by the officer's counterpart in other countries.  I welcome the Bill and hope that, at an early date, the Minister brings forward proposals in line with some of the things I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Apart from the technicality of the alteration it gives an opportunity to review the role of the Ombudsman, how it has operated to date and how the office could be <Col N="1307" /> extended.  It raises the question: what type of person would best be suited to fulfil the role of Ombudsman?  It might be argued that it should be a lawyer who would know his rights under the Bill and know how he could probe to the best possible extent what goes on in Government Departments and the other organisations he was empowered to investigate. It might be argued that it should be a civil servant of high rank or a retired civil servant who would have a great deal of expertise as regards the operation of the Civil Service which would enable him to probe the dark and deep depths of the Civil Service and bring to light, for members of the public, exactly what goes on and why it goes on.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that the first Ombudsman appointed fell into neither of these categories but was a media man.  He was concerned with public relations and communications with the media.  That was the right decision.  I am not sure what the intention was in appointing a person of those qualifications but it seems that if the role of the Ombudsman is to be really effective, his effectiveness will derive from his ability to focus both public attention and parliamentary attention on citizens' grievances. In other words, this system will not be really effective unless it comes across in the media to citizens and parliamentarians. The record on this to date is a bit of a disappointment.  The office has not received the amount of publicity that I would have wished.  A higher profile in the media of the work done by the Ombudsman would have been desirable. The idea is that the Civil Service administration would thereby be made much more sensitive to public opinion than is the case.  Public service, by and large, is not sensitive to public opinion and in so far as the Ombudsman to date has failed to do that, he has fallen down to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> The Ombudsman faces a great difficulty in breaking down the barriers under which civil servants hide behind ministerial responsibility. Mistakes are frequently made in Departments by civil servants at all levels.  Injustices are perpetrated on members of the public but it is very rare, if ever, that a Minister will come into the House and say that a mistake has been made.  During the relatively short period in which I have been a Member of this House I cannot recall that ever happening.  Selected cases of a serious nature in which findings of injustice or whatever have been made by the Ombudsman should receive a high level of publicity on an anonymous basis. I do not mean that the name of the complainant should be given publicity or even that the names of the civil servants who may have been involved in a finding of injustice or bias, incompetence or delay should be mentioned but, in certain cases, the details should be reported and made fully available.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Ombudsman should have a deep and detailed knowledge of the workings of the Civil Service; otherwise he cannot do his job with any effectiveness or degree of thoroughness. He should have a role in insisting that Departments make the rules and regulations intelligible to members of the public which does not pertain at present.  It would be helpful also if a special Oireachtas committee or one of the existing committees could call in the Ombudsman and his officials from time to time to discuss his work and means by which he could keep up the pressure on Departments to ensure that the needs and rights of the citizens are protected.</P>
    <P>The Bill was brought in for one purpose, to vary the procedure under which the Minister could make his order from the negative procedure under which the House may annul a draft order into the positive one under which the House must affirmatively adopt a resolution establishing and setting up the order.  That as a principle is to be welcomed as far as it goes but it calls into question the whole concept of ministerial orders, the manner <Col N="1309" /> in which they are made and the degree of effectiveness and control which the House exercises over the making of these orders, which is virtually nil.  A vast amount of legislation in the form of ministerial orders is enacted into law which the House never sees, has no opportunity to debate and, most critically of all, has no opportunity to amend.  There ought to be consistency in the method by which ministerial orders are made and put up for the consideration of this House one way or the other.  At the moment there is a hotch-potch of arrangements.  There is the negative resolution that the Minister is excluding here, there is the positive resolution that he is introducing here and there are also other methods which are used occasionally but there is no consistency in the system.</P>
    <P>The positive method proposed here is welcomed.  I wish to criticise the way a particular clause dealing with the approval or rejection of ministerial orders is buried in a Bill.  A TD looking at the Bill cannot see exactly where the most important matter of ministerial orders is dealt with.  It is buried in the middle of a Bill as is the case here.  You find quite aften in a long Bill, there is one system of negative adoption and another of positive adoption appearing in different parts of the Bill.  I often wonder if this is a deliberate exercise on the part of the Civil Service or draftsman to try to make things more difficult for us when, under pressure of time, we do our best to examine proposals for legislation.</P>
    <P>Even though the Minister's amendment is undoubtedly an improvement which I welcome because it means draft orders come up for positive consideration and are debated and voted on if necessary, it does not get over one basic critical difficulty &mdash; it does not give the House an opportunity to amend the order.  The order is put up, a resolution comes up and it is open to the House either to adopt or reject it.  These orders are legislation, they are laws which are every bit as effective and widely binding as an Act of the Oireachtas.  It is open to a Member of the House to put down an amendment to a Bill but Members cannot <Col N="1310" /> amend one of these draft orders making laws which will affect everybody.</P>

      <P>Unless the statute made provision for the House to amend the order as it came up, the enabling statute would have to say that the order coming up for discussion and resolution could be amended by the House.  The enabling statute would have to specifically provide that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The enabling statute would have to provide that the order in draft which the Minister puts up would be open to amendment.  If that was done it would be welcome and most helpful. However, the enabling sections never provide that and some consideration ought to be given to this matter.  A large part of the problem is that the volume of law made nominally by the Minister but factually by the Civil Service is vast.  It could be 20 or 30 times the volume of law which is enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, it is still law.  A huge amount of that material deals with routine matters.  It would be fair to say Members of the House would not be particularly interested in the bulk of them.  But included among that bulk are a considerable number of measures, rules, orders and regulations which, if Deputies were aware of them, would be of intense interest to them.  The logistical problem of sifting through that massive volume of Civil Service regulations to find the part they would be interested in would be overwhelming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that a procedure should be devised under which the regulations and draft orders could be brought in a more simplified and clear manner to the attention of Deputies.  At the moment none of these orders or regulations is brought to the attention of Members of the House.  If any Deputy wants to see <Col N="1311" /> what is proposed or what is going on, he has to go to the Library, not to the Table of the House as it is referred to, and locate it there.  It is not left on the table in the Library either.  I think it is kept in a locked cupboard and it requires some degree of positive effort to go to the Library and locate it.</P>
    <P>These orders and regulations are not circulated in the way Bills are circulated. I realise that it would be a major operation to circulate them.  Perhaps an annotated version of the proposed regulations could be circulated to Members of the House who would then have some chance of picking out the matters of concern and interest to them.</P>
    <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Legislation are given a role in their terms of reference to try in some way to supervise the delegated legislation and ministerial orders.  As the Chairman of that committee I would be the first to admit that the committee have not been particularly successful in playing an effective role in that regard.  Much more co-operation will be required from the Departments and from the Ministers if we are to be enabled to perform a useful and effective role.  However, the fact that regulations to be made by this Minister on this issue will come up for debate in the House is to be welcomed, as far as it goes.  I hope the Minister's colleagues in the other Departments will take a leaf out of his book and insist that uniformity on this procedure will be adopted and that a similar procedure will be adopted throughout the entire legislative system. That would be some small step forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of minutes will suffice to enable me to make the point I want to make.  Like our spokesman I welcome the Bill.  I should like to pay tribute to the incumbent Ombudsman for the reputation he has earned for himself. The emphasis in the Minister's speech is on the bureaucrats and the citizens.  I want to mention bureaucrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occasion to write to the Ombudsman about a civil servant who felt he was <Col N="1312" /> unjustly treated in his office and subjected to various pressures to which, on a human rights basis, he should not have been subjected.  I got a reply from the Ombudsman stating that he was precluded from dealing with this matter because civil servants are excluded from the provisions of the Act.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to speed up the procedural arrangements for amending the Schedules to the Ombudsman Act, 1980. This is particularly important in the context of making changes in the scope of the Ombudsman's remit, on which I intend to bring proposals before the House shortly.</P>
    <P>I want to urge the Minister to extend the Ombudsman's remit to the relationship between civil servants, superiors and inferiors, and inferiors and superiors. Deputy Ahern has already dealt with the public service and local government service. If a civil servant comes to me and I write to the Minister, which is the protocol in the matter, in 99 cases out of 100 the Minister refers the matter to the person in charge of the office who originally caused the complaint to be made.  In such cases there is no way that a fair, objective, dispassionate judgment will come back to the Minister.  He will write to me, or to any other Member of the House, in the terms suggested to him by the civil servant.  When the Minister is having a look at the Act I urge him to include civil servants in the remit.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy Taylor said, I can see a great deal of sense in his suggestion that ministerial orders should be subject to some kind of review.  If the Oireachtas had to pass a Bill covering every specific point the whole situation would be impossible.  From experience in Government I submit that it is very difficult to get your elbow in, so to speak, and get your Bill before the House. Generally there is a long queue of Ministers with Bills, all very important, but in one Minister's eyes his Bill is more important than his fellow Ministers' Bills. <Col N="1313" /> We could load the House with legislation that can be covered by ministerial orders and statutory instruments.  I urge the Minister that when he is expanding the remit &mdash; and I understand that is what he will be doing &mdash; to make it applicable to civil servants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  We must ensure that the Ombudsman's own house is in order and that there cannot be any criticism or complaint about the legislative measures that apply to him.  It is appropriate that we should see that the Bill is in its correct form.  I welcome this amending Bill which will allow the Minister to bring about changes expeditiously.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Wilson I also welcome his indication that he intends to make changes in the remit of the Ombudsman very speedily.  I am sure he will take into account what Deputies have said.  The Ombudsman can take action where something has been done to a member of the public without proper authority, or on irrelevant grounds, or as a result of negligence, or carelessness, and so on. There are many areas where those criteria apply.  In some cases people cannot go to the Ombudsman and seek redress if they feel action has been taken against them on irrelevant grounds, or if that action was contrary to fair and sound administration.  I am thinking about the areas we politicians hear about in our clinics.  We have to tell our constituents, regretfully, that these matters are not in the remit of the Ombudsman and that they will not have recourse to his services. Areas such as the health boards and An Bord Telecom might be considered by the Minister for inclusion in the remit of the Ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, in recent times people have become more critical of the structures of the State, sometimes criticism without validity.  The role of the Ombudsman is not only to examine the complaints of the public but also to protect the institutions of the State and ensure that groundless complaints are shown to the complainant to be without foundation. Confidence can thus be restored in the particular State Department under <Col N="1314" /> attack.  This is an important role and I hope that the Ombudsman in the annual report which he must lay before this House will refer to areas in which there have been many complaints which have been found to be groundless.</P>
    <P>There is another area which I would welcome the Ombudsman making known, not only to Members of the Oirachtas but to the public.  I understand that some of the complaints received cannot be dealt with, chiefly because of legislation needing reform.  I appeal to him to try to highlight those areas which can only be dealt with by reforming legislation, in social welfare matters or others. It is important for us to use his services to highlight the legislation which, because of pressure on the House, has not been examined.  There may be very small anomalies in the legislation, but they can give rise to enormous problems.  This function would help us to get our legislative house in order.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has received 1,300 complaints and has dealt with 1,000. Obviously, one would need a detailed analysis.  The public tend to think, when they go to an Ombudsman, that dealing with the problem means solving it in their way.  We all know that that cannot always be the case.  Perhaps the Department complained about were justified in the action they took.  It is a little like taxation reform: everybody talks about it as if it were synonymous with a reduction in taxation, but that is not the case.  The credibility of the Ombudsman may be questioned if people do not get the answer which they want, so the function of that office must be made clear.</P>
    <P>In a more jocose vein, I have had letters asking if I can attend, send, or recommend people to the Ombudsman.  The name itself causes great confusion and I shall not tell the House some of the spellings which have been used.  It reminds me somewhat of a well-known advertisement &mdash; it is a quare name but it is great stuff.  That is the role of the Ombudsman.  He may have a strange name and many do not know what it means but are willing to give the functions of his office a chance.  I hope that he will <Col N="1315" /> do all that the Minister has indicated, that he will act as a liaison between the structures of the State and the general public so that we can continue to have confidence in our State institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise very briefly to give a very warm welcome to this Bill and to agree with a number of other Deputies. As Deputy Taylor has said the number of ministerial orders passing through the House which it has no opportunity to debate makes the House a lot less relevant to those outside.  The Minister has today, by bringing forward this amendment, taken a step which will make the House much more relevant to ordinary people, and I congratulate him on that.</P>
      <P>I notice that he is thinking in the very near future of making changes in the scope of the remit of the Ombudsman, and this I welcome.  During the passage of the Bill, I took into account quite a number of suggestions made by the Opposition.  The time is now opportune for the remit to be extended.  When the Bill went through, we were all a little doubtful as to how the Ombudsman would operate.  Those doubts have finally been laid to rest and the operation has been a tremendous success.</P>
      <P>It has been argued that local councillors are all ombudsmen in their own right but local authorities should be taken into the remit of the Ombudsman at this stage.  The same applies to the various State and semi-State bodies and particularly, as mentioned by Deputy Ahern, An Bord Telecom and An Post.  The time is now right for the prisons also to be included.  The Minister will probably run into a tremendous amount of resistance on this, but he should take his courage in his hands and press very hard with the Department of Justice and other Departments involved on the whole question of prisons and prisoners being included in the remit of the Ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider seriously Deputy Wilson's suggestion in relation to civil servants.  Like that Deputy, I know of a number of cases and one in particular <Col N="1316" /> in which the amount of undue pressure on an individual was unbelievable.  That individual is no longer in the Civil Service and that is due to the tremendous pressure under which he was put.</P>
    <P>I welcome especially the suggestion that the ministerial order be discussed. Would the Minister investigate whether that order could be changed without changing the main Act?  In other words, if the House felt that nine-tenths of the Minister's suggestion was good but asked for some minor alterations to be made, could that be done?  That, in essence, is what democracy is all about &mdash; the Minister taking on suggestions made by Members of the House, generally made in good faith.  The Minister is long enough in office now to know those made in good faith and those politically based.  In this case, most suggestions from the Members of the House would be made in good faith and should be taken into account by the Minister when he brings an order before the House.  I again welcome the Bill and give it my full support.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who have spoken for the welcome given to this measure.  At the outset, I congratulate the new Opposition spokesman on the Public Service.  I gather that he is also spokesman on Labour.  I wish him well in his endeavours.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Ahern for the constructive manner in which has reacted to this Bill.  I am not sure that the present incumbent of the office of Ombudsman would take kindly to being compared to a brand of agricultural produce that is recommended for the treatment of cattle, but, as Deputy Owen suggested, the slogan used to advertise that product perhaps describes the office of Ombudsman relatively well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies who spoke were anxious that I would extend as soon as possible the remit of the Ombudsman.  In my opening remarks I indicated to the House that it would be my intention to <Col N="1317" /> come back virtually immediately with proposals for the extension of that remit. That is in line with the commitment I gave last year when the name of the present incumbent was being put forward to the House.  Deputy Calleary, as he mentioned during his contribution when introducing this Bill originally, agreed to suggestions that the Ombudsman's remit should be extended to the area of local authorities and health boards within the first three months or so after the Ombudsman would take up duty.  I took the view that it was probably impracticable to expect a new office to be created and staffed carrying out a function that was entirely new to the experience of this country and then ask it to enlarge upon its activities within such a relatively short time.  However, I said last year that I would hope that within the first year of the Ombudsman's operation we would be in a position to come back and make suggestions regarding the extension of the remit.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has been in office now for almost ten months.  Obviously, the first number of months in the creation of a new office is a particularly testing time for that office and its staff.  I think the time is now appropriate to consider the extension of the Ombudsman's remit and I hope that, on the assumption of the speedy passage of this Bill through this and the other House, I will be in a position to come back virtually immediately following clearance by Government with proposals for the extension of the remit.</P>
    <P>As is generally known, the Government have always been anxious that the first extension and widening of the remit would involve the local authorities and the health boards.  It is no harm to mention that of the 1,300 complaints which the Ombudsman received and of which 1,000 have been dealt with so far, approximately 850 were valid.  Of the 450 or so which were invalid the Ombudsman, nevertheless, attempted to deal with quite a number.  A quarter of the invalid complaints or somewhere over 100 of the 1,300 complaints received were in connection with local authorities, <Col N="1318" /> although many people would have realised that the local authorities were outside his remit at present.  It is interesting that only 6 per cent of the 450 invalid complaints related to health boards.  That is an interesting comparison as opposed to the numbers who felt a sense of grievance about some action of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I noticed particularly that Deputy Ahern, Deputy Owen and Deputy Calleary suggested that the Ombudsman remit should also be extended to the operation of Telecom Éireann.  That contrasts strangely with some of the original suggestions that the Ombudsman should become involved not only in the Civil Service but in the operation of the local authorities, health boards and non-commercial State bodies.  I thought that that was what Deputy Ahern suggested originally. He went on to refer specifically to Telecom Éireann who are and are intended to be a commercial State body. Nonetheless, I take the point made by several Deputies.  While this in itself is a new body taking on myriad problems, and it has been in operation technically for only the same length of time as the Ombudsman himself since the beginning of this year, it is interesting to reflect on the fact that during the past year 150,000 complaints were made by subscribers regarding the telephone service and in particular the accounts served upon them.  Of that 150,000 complaints only 12,000 have been resolved to the subscribers' satisfaction.</P>
    <P>On any law of betting averages I do not accept that there was validity in such a small proportion as 12,000 out of 150,000 complaints, and I accept that an amount of criticism implicit in the suggestion made by several Members of the House regarding the public's dissatisfaction at present with the operation of Telecom Éireann, and in particular their method of billing their subscribers, merits attention. Whether that attention should be afforded through the eye of the Ombudsman being cast upon Telecom Éireann, as it was in the period from July of last year until Christmas because of the way in which the orders were introduced for <Col N="1319" /> setting up of the Ombudsman's office, or whether it should be done through the operation of the users' council which is provided for in the legislation which set up both the Ombudsman and Telecom Éireann, remains to be seen.  Certainly in so far as customer satisfaction is concerned it must be a cause for concern to the Oireachtas and public representatives generally that such a high level of complaint and such a low level of resolution as I have outlined should exist at present.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the remarks made by Deputy Taylor, Deputy Calleary and other Deputies and I suggest that to some extent they mirror what I said in relation to the introduction of this legislation.  It is too bad that so much of our legislation provides that in a passive way, through the tabling of draft orders which very rarely come to be debated, particular and important changes, extensions or contractions in the area of operation of particular legislation, should happen without the positive involvement of the Oireachtas, and for that reason we have introduced this change.  I also suggested in my opening remarks that the manner in which orders and regulations are made under various legislation might well receive the attention either of the Oireachtas itself or of some of its component committees, and there are people here in the House who have involvement in certain committees who might have a relevance or interest in this area.</P>
    <P>When I invited the Government to agree to the introduction of this legislation my view in relation to this matter appeared to me to be generally shared by Ministers.  It is important that this House would be not only relevant but seen to be relevant to the general public.  While the provision whereby a draft order could be made and come into force after 21 sitting days, which is seven sitting weeks, which, allowing for breaks and other delays may often end up in delays of up to five or six months as I said at the outset, that does not seem to be relevant any longer in the context of modern life. When, for a specific reason, it is felt necessary to introduce an order initiating <Col N="1320" /> a change authorised by legislation it is not acceptable very often to the general public that that change should take from six to eight months to put into effect especially when, as in the case of an extension of the Ombudsman's remit, after an order comes into effect there is a considerable lead-in delay in the advertising for and obtaining and training of suitable staff.  If the Oireachtas in the future wants to carry out changes or extensions they will have to have available a vehicle whereby those changes can be put into effect within a reasonably short time after they are first mooted.  Inviting the Oireachtas to take a positive role in the discussion of orders such as this serves to make the Oireachtas more relevant and the views of Members are invited and listened to in a more positive manner.</P>
    <P>Some Member referred to cautious pragmatism being advocated by the initial all-party committee that examined the area of the Ombudsman.  I am a great believer in pragmatism but one can carry pragmatism to the stage of such cautiousness that one would never initiate any change.  Sometimes a small shiver of apprehension runs down the spine of a Minister who advocates a change he or she believes is in the interest of the Parliament, such as this one, to hear Members suggesting that while this is good as far as it goes there are further changes that would make it better.  One is inclined to say immediately, &ldquo;What Pandora's Box have I opened up now for my colleagues or myself?&rdquo;  Deputies Taylor and Calleary suggested that not only should orders be presented in a positive way for discussion by the House, such as this one, but they should be capable not just of acceptance or rejection but of amendment.  If one takes the example of the sort of orders for the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman, such as this, I suspect that the only amendment that the House might wish to make would be to extend further the Ombudsman's remit into other areas which might be of interest to the general public but would involve extra cost.  They would involve the cost of staffing, offices and so on, a cost on the public purse.  That would then involve <Col N="1321" /> the Chair in difficulties with the sponsor of the amendment in that it is not open to a private Member to advocate amendments which constitute a charge or a potential charge on the public purse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>But the order could be excluding a function as well as adding a function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The order may well exclude a function and I suspect that a Minister would endeavour to get the mind of the House.  If the House was to suggest strenuously in the course of a debate that a particular area should not be the subject of the Ombudsman's remit it could only be an office holder who was very much out of keeping with the spirit of this type of legislation who would not be prepared to withdraw or suspend a decision on the order before the House so as to consider the views being advocated by Members.  However, in general the question of the manner in which orders or regulations are made, or might be made or provided for in legislation in the future is something that might entertain the minds and attention of the House or some of its committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor said he was a little disappointed at the relative lack of publicity given to date to the activities of the Ombudsman.  It is fair to point out that the office has been in existence for ten months only and that the incumbent, and his original staff, were in a pioneering role as far as this country was concerned. They had to engage in the best learning activity of all, learning by the experience of doing.  They have been particularly busy and so far have had 1,300 complaints. I am aware from conversation, and my perusal of the media, that the Ombudsman has accepted quite a multitude of speaking engagements in various parts of the country, some of which were reported widely in the national press but have been reported in more detail in provincial newspapers through his attendance at provincial centres.  I would not have thought that the incumbent was a person who might easily be accused of not having a nice appreciation of the value <Col N="1322" /> of the media.  I would suspect that in a progressive way as he sees fit the Ombudsman will use his skills and experience to explain to people the complexities of his office.</P>
    <P>There is an important provision in the legislation which obliges the Ombudsman to table an annual report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have discussed already with the Ombudsman the advantage of his endeavouring to table his first annual report as early after the 12 months have elapsed as is possible so that the Oireachtas may have an opportunity, which I invite it to take, of discussing in detail the contents of that report.  I suspect that Members will find that report very illuminating in the areas of particular complaint.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor suggested, with much validity, that mistakes made by civil or public servants are never admitted to either in the house or by office holders. That is because of the system under which we operate whereby each Minister is, in theory at least, absolutely responsible for each single action, or inaction, committed, or not committed, by staff of the Department for which the office holder is responsible.  As I said some months ago on a public occasion, is it not a pretty farcical situation where I have the onus or responsibility for what some beauty, terrible or otherwise, says in my name, possibly at this moment, in some letter emanating from my Department which inevitably will be prefaced by, &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for the Public Service to say&rdquo; and so on, when the Minister for the Public Service is in the House and does not know in the wide world what on earth he may or may not be saying?  However, that is the legal system that obtains at present under which the office holder bears that responsibility.  I suspect that the Deputy is suggesting that is not necessarily a good thing and that the anonymity involved in that system does not lead to positive thought or to the development of the great potential that exists within our Civil Service.  As the House is aware, the Government intend shortly to publish a White Paper which will, amongst other <Col N="1323" /> things, deal with this entire area of the relationship between office holders and civil servants.  There have been slight changes evident in recent times.  I can recall one of my colleagues being quite forthright publicly in saying that some staff in his Department had erred in not ascertaining specific statistical data as expeditiously as they might have.  If the Deputy casts his mind back a few weeks he may recall the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked that the question of complaints or dissatisfaction which individual civil servants might have regarding not so much their conditions of employment as the operation of their conditions of employment by their immediate civil service superior ought to be allowed come within the remit of the Ombudsman.  That request was supported by another Deputy.  There is a degree of validity in that and it is one I will give some attention to although I can see that there are difficulties which lurk there.  Deputy Owen asked that the Ombudsman where he has encountered small, what may be regarded as relatively unimportant legislative disbarments but which serve to prevent particular cases, which in natural justice ought be dealt with, from being attended to &mdash; those sorts of small changes which might be made, and which would improve legislation &mdash; should be adverted to by the Ombudsman in his annual report.  Of course that is a matter for the Ombudsman himself to decide as to its appropriateness or otherwise. I have had discussions with the Ombudsman regarding particular instances such as this which have come to light in the conduct of his investigations.  In cases such as those I have urged the Ombudsman to contact directly the Minister involved, pointing out to him that the manner in which certain provisions or sections of certain Acts are framed does not always operate in the best interests of the public and inviting the Minister to avail of the earliest possible opportunity to make those changes, which are perhaps of an administrative rather than of a policy nature.  I understand <Col N="1324" /> that the Ombudsman has resorted to that procedure.</P>
    <P>There was one final suggestion made by Deputy Calleary regarding what in his view has now become an increasingly important matter, that is, the possibility of the Ombudsman being allowed investigate areas of complaint regarding the operations of the prison service.  I am sure the Deputy will recall that there are in other countries provisions whereby ombudsmen investigate either the police or prison service.  In fact, in certain countries there are separate ombudsmen who deal exclusively with complaints regarding the operations of the police force and the areas of justice in prisons.  In one country at least there is an ombudsman who, because of the large size of their armed force, deals virtually exclusively with complaints from members of the armed forces.</P>
    <P>All those areas were excluded in the legislation introduced in 1979 and enacted in 1980 from the remit of the Irish Ombudsman.  It is right that the Ombudsman here should have commenced with a remit that basically encompassed the Civil Service and that now through the enactment of this Bill &mdash; and, I hope, an order being made under its provisions within the next few weeks &mdash; we should be progressively extending his remit into the next logical area, such as that of the local authorities, health boards and possibly into some others that have been suggested here this morning.  In the light of the experience gained in his operations of that wider remit perhaps the House and the Government should then examine on a regular basis how best the progressive extension of the activities of the Ombudsman would serve to enhance the reputation of the public service and satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Oireachtas and those of the general public.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the positive, constructive manner in which it has reacted to this Bill and indeed for some of the very interesting suggestions offered by Members in the course of their contributions which, I can assure them, <Col N="1325" /> will be fully taken into account in any future consideration of this Bill.</P>

      <P>On the other side of the coin it is important to point out that as the Bill stood and had the Minister not amended it &mdash; and I commend him for doing so &mdash; he or any of his successors could then come along and change the whole function or purpose of a most important State office.  Effectively, orders laid before this House are rarely examined in any great detail.  The insertion of the provision for the making of such orders is something which has been followed by the parliamentary draftsman for many years. When it comes to the point of there being restrictions in regard to proposed legislation, the parliamentary draftsman must then deal with the powers of the Minister. To put it nicely, for administrative reasons it can be of benefit to a Minister to be able to do a number of things under a statutory instrument or order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I totally agree with the Minister, that <Col N="1326" /> that provision should be omitted from as many Bills as possible.  When such is done and when an amendment such as this is agreed, then there must be some provision in any Bill to meet the point made by Deputy Wilson.  If everything is to be laid before this House and if there were, say, ten or 15 Bills with, say, five or six orders to each, how would they be dealt with?  Perhaps the Whips could decide which ones should be debated and have them passed through the House within an hour on a Thursday evening.  Let the Whips nod them through but allowing that, if a Minister or spokesman wants to say something, he can do so.  It would be much more democratic and meaningful to the House to do it in that fashion rather than having some official in a Department suggesting that it be done by an order about which nobody really hears. We must remember the old tradition of having matters laid before the House for 21 days when, it could be contended, everybody would be aware of them, but this is really a total nonsense.</P>
    <P>I would say that the Minister's colleagues are not following his good example. For example, in regard to the Nurses Bill, the Minister for Health, who is to be feared in regard to a number of matters on this side of the House, could come along and change the whole ethical code of the nursing profession, which is similar to what this Minister could do under the provisions of the Bill before the House had he not introduced this amendment.</P>
    <P>Might I ask the Minister how many orders he would foresee being made under the provisions of a Bill such as this? I presume we are talking about one or two only at any given time.  But, bearing in mind his suggestion of extending this to other Bills, would it be advisable that there be a distinction drawn between what is an order in regard to a major matter, such as an amendment of the remit of the Ombudsman, as against perhaps some other minor orders, or does such not arise?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to accept that the responsibility is at least partly mine for <Col N="1327" /> perhaps straying somewhat wider than the scope of the provisions of this section. I am now conscious that perhaps I am straying into the area that is more possibly the remit of the Leader of the House or of the Government Whip.  But, if common sense were to prevail, I would have thought that obviously orders made under the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act will have quite a major impact on the operations of the Oireachtas, the public service in its widest sense and on the right of redress available to individual citizens. Therefore, in my view, an order such as that renders it proper that it be discussed and understood by the House, that the views of the House should be made clear to the Executive, so that they can be taken into account not only in relation to that order but also in relation to any future orders that may be made.</P>
      <P>There are other orders, or draft orders, which are of a relatively minor or technical nature, under many Acts which I doubt the House would want to discuss at any time.  But, if the order procedure was changed generally so that orders were made in this positive way, it would then be the choice of the House as to whether it wished to debate them.  If there were, say, a series of orders of major consequence, such as that we have been discussing, then they would be the ones which would be chosen for discussion and the others would be voted through, usually without discussion.  But the important matter is that it would require a sponsoring Minister at least to formally move them here and have them positively accepted by the House.  If the House then chose to feel that they were sufficiently important to be discussed, it would have that opportunity.  For instance, under the procedure obtaining heretofore in relation to this matter, the House did not have that opportunity if the Minister concerned did not choose to find some device to invite the House to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot resist saying that there is of course the other danger that, as Deputy Taylor said, in regard to a draft order, the &ldquo;Table of the House&rdquo; means <Col N="1328" /> today the Library of the House.  I do not think it is really a great burden for anybody to have to transport himself or herself from the Chamber to the Library to examine something laid before the House.  Deputies seemed to feel that constituted somewhat of a burden.  I suppose it can be, because from time to time documents are placed in the Library of the House of the Oireachtas, and if and when somebody goes looking for them, if they do not know the right way to go about it, apparently it can happen that even when such documents are there a Deputy can feel that they are not there at all and could even come back to the Chamber here and so announce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was trying to make was that first of all the Deputy has to direct his mind to the fact that there is a particular order in draft in the Library on a particular subject.  He has to know that it is on a subject that may possibly be of interest to him and he has to make his way there and study it in the context of the enabling Act under which it was brought in.  He may do that a dozen times and find that the proposed order is inconsequential and may get tired of trying to investigate and search out the gold from the dross by sheer reason of the weight and volume of these ministerial rules and regulations.  That is really the problem. Perhaps the Members of the House could be assisted in having those which would be of interest to them separated from those of a routine nature.  The overwhelming bulk is purely routine and would not be of interest to Members. Perhaps some procedure could be devised which would be of help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill raises a matter of general principle. While the Minister may be reluctant to stray into the arena of the Leader of the House, the mere fact that he introduces this Bill for this one purpose means that he is straying into that area.  That is to be welcomed.  More power to him for doing it.  While I welcome the Bill which is <Col N="1329" /> directed to the single objective of changing it from a negative resolution to a positive resolution, it seems a bit strange when we recall that there is scarcely any Bill or Act of this Oireachtas that does not contain one or many cases authorising a Minister to bring in rules and regulations. That is to be found in virtually every Act which has ever gone through this House.  Very often there are many sections in an Act which will contain such provisions.</P>
    <P>There is no logic in the procedures for adopting the ministerial orders.  I have often thought that it just depends on the whim of the secretary of the Department. He may feel that the negative procedure would suit him or alternatively the positive method.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it.  These different provisions are included in all these Acts and there does not seem to be any logic applied to the approach.  When this legislation was brought in the Minister or the secretary felt that the negative procedure was appropriate but the current Minister feels that the positive procedure is more appropriate.  It seems strange and illogical to pick out this one section in this measure from the mass of legislation and enabling provisions.  If the principle is that when ministerial orders and rules are being made they should be drawn more positively to the attention of the House, that is a good thing, but why select this one section?  Why not introduce an overall interpretation measure or something of that nature to tackle the problem on a global basis and try to bring some consistency and rationality into procedures as a whole?  The Minister is acting as a trail blazer in trying to bring matters before the House in which Members would have a special interest.  To that extent it is to be welcomed but I hope that this will be used as a trial and that his colleagues will use it as a basis for similarily ensuring that the rules and orders they make under the powers granted to them by the Oireachtas will likewise in appropriate cases be brought to the specific and positive attention of the House.</P>

      <P>It is important that the <Col N="1330" /> availability of the Ombudsman service should be widely advertised.  I have referred at least half a dozen complaints I have received to the Ombudsman.  If that were taken as an average for Members of this House it would be found that possibly all the complaints he received were passed on by third parties.  That is regrettable.  I wonder if the Minister's Department would engage in advertising the service.  An idea might be to put a note on the bottom of all application forms sent out by Government Departments to the effect that if somebody has a complaint about the procedures involved the matter can be referred to the Ombudsman.  All leaflets from Government Departments could also advertise this fact.  As Deputy Owen said, the service is not widely known to the general public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very handy for Deputies if we were to follow that line and pass on many of our complaints but it would probably be very difficult for the Ombudsman.  Deputy Taylor asked why this legislation should be singled out. The Minister obviously intends it to be of a helpful nature but to ensure the success of this amendment it should be written into Standing Orders that orders can go through automatically.  The Minister said one of the reasons for this amendment was to avoid delays involved in waiting for 21 sitting days to elapse.  If we do not have some system we will run into the type of difficulties mentioned by Deputy Wilson and could be months waiting.  The system might prove to be more ineffective.</P>
      <P>My agreement to this amendment is on the basis that the Leader of the House with our co-operation will try to make sure that it goes through.  If an order was in the Library and the Member had read it it would be more helpful.  Some of the orders are so vague that they say absolutely nothing and do not give the bones of the story.  At least under this system we will be able to question the intention of a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other matter <Col N="1331" /> which should be looked at.  Where a proposal for an order is put up in appropriate cases, the order in draft should be referred to an appropriate committee where it could be looked at, examined and reported on to the House.  If proposed orders were examined by an appropriate Oireachtas committee there would be a chance to probe the implications in some detail and perhaps hear evidence from the Minister or a senior official of his Department.  Provision could be made for a referral.  It could possibly speed up the procedures in the House.  One could visualise a situation where the stated objective of the Minister &mdash; namely, speed &mdash; might not be achieved due to delay in finding time for it in the House, whereas if it had been debated in committee and came into the House on the basis of an agreed report it could be quite time-saving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take a number of the points that have been made by Deputies. Deputy Ahern mentioned the multiplicity of orders and said that there would need to be a method whereby those which might be discussed would be chosen.  I do not think there would be any insurmountable difficulty were there to be a general change in procedure.  Those that require discussion could be easily identified and the rest could be formally enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the debate has widened, it is well to remind the House of one particular difficulty which is often advocated as the reason for the provision for orders being prescribed in a different form of legislation, that is, because of the delays when the House is not sitting where the making of an order may be particularly urgent, or where it may be necessary to change an order provision at very short notice. There is a provision in some legislation whereby an order is made and comes into force immediately; it may be annulled if a motion proposing its annulment is put to the House any time within the next 21 sitting days, but without prejudice to anything which had been done while it was in force.  That was one of the procedures we looked at but we did not think <Col N="1332" /> that in this case that provision was necessary. Obviously if the Minister or the Government were considering extending the remit of the Ombudsman they ought to be able to order their affairs so that they could put forward the motion during the sitting time of the House.  I can envisage other areas where because of changed circumstances of an urgent nature, it might be necessary for a Minister to make an order which could come into effect immediately.  In certain legislation that type of provision would have to remain even if there were to be a general change.</P>
    <P>The other option we considered was to reduce the 21 day provision for the draft orders to lie on the Table of the House to seven days but it was felt that certain Members might consider seven sitting days too short a time to enable them to consider a matter which might be complex. On balance it was decided to advance this type of change.  When this matter was being discussed by the Government there was general goodwill towards the idea of changes such as this in the order procedure where it was feasible and would not inhibit the operation of Government.</P>
    <P>As a result of this draft legislation the Attorney General was asked to look at the order machinery generally to see if a procedure which involves the House more might be arrived at, if not for existing legislation at least for future legislation, and with the instructions that one enabling piece of legislation might be introduced which could cover the core of existing legislation.  While some of this morning's discussion might not be relevant to the narrower areas of this Bill as it stands, it will be of interest and will be very helpful to the Attorney General and I give Deputies an undertaking that I will bring this morning's discussion to his attention.</P>
    <P>There is possibly a role for a committee to examine this matter, but I am not sure that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that Deputies are referring complaints to the Ombudsman.  When we debated this matter some time ago I said I hoped that over the passage of time a tradition would develop whereby Members would refer a number of constituents' complaints to the Ombudsman and that that development would enable Deputies to devote more time to their parliamentary duties. Deputy Harney said she had referred six complaints to the Ombudsman.  That might seem to imply that some 800 or 900 of the 1,300 complaints have come from the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas on a third party basis, but that is not the case.  I do not have the statistics to hand but I know from discussions with the Ombudsman that the number of complaints referred to him by Members as a proportion of the whole is relatively small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer directly to him.  I told my constituents to get in touch with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That information would not appear in the statistics.  Deputy Taylor mentioned people's knowledge of the Ombudsman operation.  So far, 1,300 complaints have been received in the first ten months.  This compares more than favourably with international statistics. We provided a relatively handsome sum of money in the Ombudsman Vote for advertising purposes.  Possibly because the Ombudsman had to change from temporary to permanent premises during the year he did not feel disposed to spend a great deal of that money in the early part of the year but in the last few weeks I have noticed small advertisements in the national and local newspapers.  I gather the Ombudsman hopes to expend the provision for advertising before the end of the financial year.  We are providing an advertising budget in the Ombudsman Vote in the 1985 Estimates which will be put before the House shortly.  As the <Col N="1334" /> Deputy said, it is important that the activities of the Ombudsman be advertised not just by media advertising, but it is his intention to have posters and items of that nature produced which might be made available to community information centres and possibly schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be more than apprehensive if a notice was inserted on application forms reminding the general public of the existence of the office of Ombudsman.  So far it has been impossible to establish the number of different types of forms in existence in this country. We have 30,000 civil servants and I suspect we have one form for every civil servant, some of which are used much more widely than others.  If at the end of each application form attention was drawn to what is in effect the court of last appeal, I am not sure there would be any work for the District Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with the Ombudsman is that he may deal with the complaint only after a person has exausted the normal channels of appeal or complaint.  If we draw attention to the Ombudsman on the initial application form there may be a danger that an enormous bulk of complaints would be sent to him much earlier than would be allowed within his remit.  In other words, he would be snowed under.  Perhaps a final refusal decision is being made &mdash; as happens with planning decisions in local authorities where notice of the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála is inserted at the bottom of the notices &mdash; and it could be very useful to draw people's attention to the existence of the Ombudsman.  That is a matter to which I will give consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of publicity for the work and functions of the <Col N="1335" /> Ombudsman I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he speaks particularly in country areas and is reported in local newspapers.  That is to be welcomed. What is required and what is very helpful from a publicity point of view is not so much talking about the generality of his work, although that is important but the kind of thing that would bring home the situation is if one type of case was reported in full.  For example, a citizen might have a problem with the Department of Social Welfare and, while not reporting the names but giving the facts and the outcome of the work done by the Ombudsman, it would have more relevance for the ordinary person reading about it.  He could relate to what happened and, if necessary, he could use the office of the Ombudsman to achieve redress for himself.</P>
      <P>The ordinary citizen has difficulty in dealing with the executive branch of Government, with the Civil Service. There is not always the degree of assistance given to members of the public that one would wish.  In many Departments, and particularly with regard to the Department of Social Welfare, people complain that they get short shrift particularly from officers dealing with supplementary benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People also have great difficulty in obtaining information from Government Departments and even Members of this House find a great reluctance on the part of civil servants to give information about work in the Departments.  Very often this extends from the Minister downwards. Information from the Civil Service to the public should be much more readily forthcoming.  A defensive attitude pervades many echelons of the Civil Service that has them protecting their corner, afraid to be frank and candid and to give full information about matters that affect the public.  The Ombudsman can be of help in that regard.  He can assist members of the public to obtain information from Government Departments that may affect them vitally.  The role of the Ombudsman should be used and <Col N="1336" /> expanded to the fullest extent towards achieving that objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The defensive attitude to which the Deputy referred is, in my view, indefensible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Ombudsman will make a number of recommendations in the annual report to which the Minister referred.  He said that out of 1,300 cases some 850 were valid.  I should imagine there are anomalies in much of our legislation which the Ombudsman will examine, but I do not know if the Minister has given thought to this aspect.</P>
      <P>In regard to problems regarding obtaining information from Departments, it would be unfair to criticise Departments, particularly the Department of Social Welfare, which is located in seven or eight different parts of the city.  When the Ombudsman was appointed I said it would be desirable to have a number of information centres where the public could speak to people who were trained to deal with them.  At the moment when one goes into a Government Department one speaks to the person who is least qualified because the last person in is usually on the desk. If there were information centres in the various Departments comprising senior people they could deal with a range of problems or at least give information to the person concerned.  This would cut out many of the problems for the Minister's office and also for public representatives. It would also allow the Ombudsman and public representatives to deal with the real problems and not the many cases that arise from misunderstandings.</P>

      <P>As other people have strayed slightly and as the Minister has <Col N="1337" /> replied to previous points, let me just say that I support what Deputy Ahern has said about an information section.  There is no point in exaggerating the complaints that are made against the public service. I am one of those Deputies who believes they do a good job.  The complaints are concentrated in a few small areas and in particular they refer to delays in having cases dealt with.  Much of this could be eliminated if there was an information centre, members of the public could phone and find out where they should go to get basic information regarding their entitlement.  That would cut down on the complaints and also on the work of many public representatives who, at the moment, fill that roll.  In fairness to the public service they deserve to have an information centre of some kind where people could get basic information.  I am not talking about the average person who works behind the desk &mdash; here I want to compliment the Minister who has introduced the identification system &mdash; but I am talking about people at a fairly senior level who know what people are entitled to and can give the necessary information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I said that while I support the amendment put forward by Deputy Woods I do not believe that the Criminal Justice Bill, even if amended in this way, will achieve the objectives for which we are told the Bill was designed.  It will not improve the detection rate or achieve a reduction in crime level.  My fear is that it may well exacerbate relations between disadvantaged communities and the Garda and it is in that context that I support the view which Deputy Andrews expressed last week that the Bill even at this late stage should be scrapped.  I listened attentively to Deputy Woods explaining his amendment. I agree with much of what he said. My only regret is that the concern expressed by Deputy Woods has not led him to the view held by his colleague, Deputy Andrews.  Many of those Deputies who have spoken have linked the need for an independent complaints procedure to the <Col N="1339" /> provisions in the Bill relating to detention. My interest in this amendment is as much related to the experience of the past ten years as it is to what the future may hold if and when this Bill is brought into operation.</P>
      <P>I will illustrate my point by referring to a specific case in respect of which I have spent a good deal of time pleading with the Minister with a view to having that case investigated.  I am referring to the awful experience of Nicky Kelly and the others who were charged with the Sallins mail train robbery.  To this day the Minister has refused to have an inquiry into the allegations of ill-treatment in that case, allegations that were brought also to the attention of previous Ministers. The failure of successive Ministers to respond in that instance has had at least two adverse effects.  First, it has heightened public concern that there should be an effective and independent complaints body and, secondly, it has led some members, if not sections of the Garda to believe that the heavy-gang tactics used in the Sallins case investigation must have had some degree of official approval.</P>
      <P>Many Members of the House who are concerned at recent events and who are supporting strongly Deputy Woods's amendment chose in the past to ignore what was happening.  It is not simply a matter of the Nicky Kelly case.  A few weeks ago the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> devoted an entire page to cases which in the past ten years clearly required investigation by a body independent of the Garda. Again, all of these cases were ignored by successive Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I received a written reply from the Minister in relation to one of these cases, the case of Amanda McShane.  In this case the defence solicitor acting for Amanda McShane produced in court a concocted typewritten statement which he had found at the Garda station prior to the defendant having made any statement.  When this evidence was produced in court, the State withdrew the case.  The matter was raised in the Dáil and an independent Garda inquiry was promised.  The outcome of <Col N="1340" /> that inquiry is interesting and is relevant to the present debate.  Part of the Minister's written reply was:</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that following a full investigation a file, which of course included the statements made by the woman concerned and by her solicitor, was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for directions as to whether criminal proceedings against any member of the force were warranted. I am further informed that, on receipt of directions from the DPP criminal proceedings were not warranted, the question whether proceedings were warranted under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1971, was considered by the Commissioner and that the decision was similar to that which had been taken by the DPP in relation to criminal proceedings, namely that disciplinary proceedings were not warranted against any member.</P>
    <P>That was despite the fact that it was warranted for the State to withdraw the case based on the evidence produced, the evidence of a concocted statement which very much fits into a pattern going back to the Nicky Kelly case when that individual stated that his statement had been concocted by the Garda and that he had been forced to sign it.  Yet, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison on the sole basis of that type of statement and there is still no inquiry into the case.</P>
    <P>Without even considering the new provisions of the Criminal Justice Bill, it is this sad record that makes it essential that there be an independent complaints body.  It is in that sense that I support the emphasis placed by Deputy Woods on three aspects, first, that the procedure should be totally independent of the Garda, secondly, that all members of the force, from the garda on the beat to those at the highest levels, should be subject to that investigation procedure and, thirdly, that its function should not be simply to adjudicate but to investigate also.  That is the aspect to which I wish to turn now because anyone who has ever brought <Col N="1341" /> complaints against members of the Garda to the attention of the Garda must agree that all too often the procedure whereby the Garda investigate complaints against themselves is a cosmetic exercise.  I do not wish to make general remarks without referring to specific instances in my experience.</P>
    <P>One of these cases relates to a Mr. Thomas Dolan who is a constituent of mine.  Mr. Dolan was beaten up severely by a member or members of the Garda at Summerhill in Dublin.  The following day, after he had approached me, I arranged for him to put his complaint in person to the superintendent at Store Street Garda Station.  Though other individuals were charged in connection with the incident with which Mr. Dolan was alleged to have been associated no charges have been brought against him.  The superintendent was courteous and took a detailed note of Mr. Dolan's complaints. He examined Mr. Dolan's very severe injuries, all of which were documented at the time by others, and, inevitably, an internal inquiry was promised.</P>
    <P>Some weeks later Mr. Dolan was arrested at his home in the early hours of the morning and charged with obstructing the Garda, using abusive language and so on on the night about which he had complained in my presence to the superintendent of being beaten up by the same gardaí.  When these charges were brought to court they were dismissed by the justice and Mr. Dolan brought a High Court action subsequently against the garda involved.  He won that action.  All of this is a matter of public record.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that such instances occur every day of the week and, equally, I am not suggesting that Mr. Dolan's case was an isolated one.  I am saying simply that this sort of thing happens, that people are concerned that it happens and that it is to protect innocent people such as Mr. Dolan that an independent complaints procedure is required.  But for the assistance of various legal people it would have cost Mr. Dolan a great deal of money to pursue the course of action he took through the courts before he finally got justice.  Many people might not have <Col N="1342" /> the resources or willpower to persevere in such a long procedure.  It should not be necessary to do that in order to get justice.</P>
    <P>It is equally inevitable that I will be accused of Garda bashing but that is not my intention.  My intention is to highlight the widely held view across the country from Deputy Blaney's area in the rural north &mdash; we heard his account last week &mdash; to my area in the inner city of urban Dublin.  Time and again there are cases which warrant investigation by an independent complaints body, completely independent of the Garda.  That is not a criticism of the force but simply a statement of fact.  There are numerous instances to support the view that such a body is required.  The basis of my argument is that politicians who, over the last ten years, ignored so many cases which were subsequently brought to public attention by the media, are as much if not far more responsible for any criticism now being made of the Garda as are the actions of the force.</P>
    <P>The Garda require resources and training to enable them to get the results the public desire.  They do not need draconian powers.  Such powers simply satisfy the whim of right wing politicians and individuals.  A spokesman for the Garda is quoted in the newspapers as echoing the view that the Garda need a great deal more training and resources before any attempt is made to bring the Criminal Justice Bill into operation.</P>
    <P>In her contribution, Deputy Barnes referred to the growing alienation of young people from the Garda.  I see this in my own constituency.  I greatly fear that this Bill, even with the amendment put down by Deputy Woods, will drastically increase that alienation.  Without an effective independent complaints body we are heading for a major confrontation between young people and the Garda. I refer, as other Deputies have, to the existing powers available to the Garda which are draconian in themselves. Deputy De Rossa pointed out that approximately one in seven of all those detained and interrogated under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act <Col N="1343" /> are actually brought before a court. Surely it would have been better to review the success or failure rate of that measure and repeal it if necessary rather than introducing, as is now proposed, an even more draconian measure.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment put down by Deputy Woods. I suggest, although I suppose there is not much point at this stage, that he put the Criminal Justice Bill back on the shelf where the previous six Ministers for Justice left it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand what Deputy Woods has said there is not much difference between us.  The Seanad, in their wisdom, asked for this amendment.  The Dáil had previously asked for this kind of amendment and I said I do not think it was necessary because I was fully committed to bringing in a complaints procedure and statutory regulations governing the treatment of people in Garda custody.  I thought I would have had a complaints Bill published by now.</P>
      <P>To help the consensus emerging in the Seanad, I felt it would be helpful if the commitments I gave here and in the Seanad were written into the Bill.  The essential aspect of the Seanad amendment is not the detail of it but the fact that until this House and the Seanad are happy with the complaints procedure, which I will propose and the Houses will pass, and with the statutory regulations, which will be brought in by motion, certain major sections of the Bill cannot be put into operation by order.  That is the point of the amendment.  It is to prevent the Minister from bringing in certain sections of the Bill by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complaints procedure will not be brought in by order.  It will be by way of a Bill which will go through all Stages here and in the Seanad.  That is the time when we should have a detailed discussion on it.  However, I am glad that such a detailed discussion took place here.  The Bill is in the final stages of drafting.  It has been drafted along the lines of decisions taken in Government but it will have <Col N="1344" /> to go back to the Government for final ratification.  I am glad I have had the benefit of the opinions of so many Deputies. When the Government are making their final decisions on the Bill before it is published I will be able to communicate the views of Deputies to the Government.</P>
    <P>There is agreement on all sides that we need a different mechanism for processing complaints from the public from what we have at present.  We need a complaints procedure in the form of a statutory body which would be independent of the Garda Síochána and composed of people who would be independent of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I moved an amendment to the Seanad amendment to strengthen it.  The impression seems to be around that I was going to set up some kind of body in which the Garda would constitute the board.  Some Deputies were talking about five members of the Garda being a board to investigate complaints.  Nothing was further from my intention.  As there was concern about that, I put down an amendment to the effect that there would be adjudication by a body other than the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Varying views have been expressed here about the degree to which the Garda should be involved in a complaints procedure. Deputy Andrews and Deputy Connolly were against any Garda involvement.  Deputy Taylor envisaged the Garda playing a role in the adjudication process.  Deputy Shatter referred to the possible secondment of gardaí to the complaints board.  Deputy Woods's amendment, while it stresses the independent character of the complaints commission, also allows, by implication, investigation of complaints by the Garda acting under the direction of the Commissioner. The scheme proposed by Deputy Woods on Committee Stage is similar in many respects to the scheme in England. It provided for substantial Garda involvement in the handling of complaints by the commission.</P>
    <P>Deputies are obviously concerned about the issues and are expressing personal, sincerely held views rather than party views.  I accept that.  This is a very <Col N="1345" /> important Bill and I should like to get the largest degree of consensus possible because the question of public confidence in the Garda Síochána is a matter which concerns every Deputy and Senator.  I want a scheme that will be regarded as fair and reasonable and which will also have the support of the Garda Síochána. I will communicate the views of Deputies to the Government before they make a final decision.  The House will have ample opportunties to analyse the Bill and the new complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>The debate here, so far, has centred on relationship between the new complaints board and the force generally and I should add some comments to that. There can be a strong case made for having the Garda Commissioner or his representative on an independent board. The Garda Síochána are a disciplined body and control of discipline is an important part of the Commissioner's operational responsibility.  The Commissioner is the chief disciplinary officer in the force and it is important that any changes in the relationship regarding existing procedures and the handling of complaints against members should not undermine his position.  The Commissioner does not work under the Minister for Justice; he holds a statutory office set up by Act of Parliament.  He has an independent role and rights and he is the chief disciplinary officer and we must be careful not to undermine his position in that regard.  We should draw on the experience of people elsewhere but I do not think it is proper to exclude the Commissioner from the disciplinary process because that could undermine his authority within the force and could be very detrimental to Garda morale.</P>
    <P>The involvement of a chief officer of police in the adjudication of complaints made by members of the public is not unusual.  A survey of a number of procedures in operation abroad was carried out by officials of my Department in conjunction with the preparation of the Bill. There are many variations in approach in the systems examined but there was no case where the chief officer of the police was completely excluded from a role in <Col N="1346" /> the adjudication process.  In England, for example, the new complaints authority will supervise the investigation of complaints in serious cases and there will be no police members on the board but the investigation will be carried out by the police.  While the police will not be represented on the authority in Britain any investigations which reveal a breach of discipline will be adjudicated on by a disciplinary tribunal which will be presided over by the chief of police or his deputy in the district in which the incident occurred.</P>
    <P>In the British system, minor complaints will be dealt with by the chief of police without any involvement by the complaints authority.  In Washington there is a civilians complaint board which has civilian investigators.  Two members of the seven-man board are nominated by the chief of police and the police association.  It may not impose penalties and can only recommend actions to be taken by the chief of police.  In Toronto, Canada, the investigation and adjudication of complaints is largely a police function subject to supervision and review by a police complaints board.  Both the commissioner of police and the police association nominate a proportion of the board's membership.  I am not being selective in these examples.  There is a civil rights organisation in America and they have reviewed complaints procedure right across the United States.  Their opinion is that the one which works best is that where the chief of a particular police force takes a strong interest in the complaints regardless of the mechanism set up to deal with them or regardless of the theoretical involvement.  I know that Deputies are concerned about this and I will take their views into account.</P>
    <P>Deputies have also got caught in the semantics of the situation.  Deputy Barnes asked what did I mean by &ldquo;adjudication&rdquo;. Adjudication involves specifying the particular breach or breaches of discipline alleged, having a hearing of the evidence and of witnesses, making a decision on whether a breach has occurred and, if so, what disciplinary sanctions should be applied.  I will be bringing <Col N="1347" /> before the House a Bill which will set up an independent body to investigate complaints.  For example, if there was a seven-man board, would the House insist that all the members should be non-gardaí or would they accept that it might be appropriate to have one representative of the commissioner on that board? It is obviously an issue which concerns the House.  I see the board as having a full time staff which would be headed by a chief executive officer.  It does not matter what he is called but he will be answerable to the board and be responsible for the day-to-day running of procedures. Investigations should be carried out by Garda officers in the normal course of events but under the supervision of the board and the board would have the power to prescribe general principles to be observed in the appointment of investigating officers.  The board should also be able to give an investigating officer such directions as appear necessary in relation to any individual investigation.  I have no argument with Deputy Woods when he says it is &ldquo;by or under the board&rdquo;.  It has to be under the control of the board.</P>
    <P>I also think that there are occasions when it is in the public interest that people other than the Garda Síochána should investigate a complaint.  I envisage a situation &mdash; and I hope the House accepts it &mdash; that the chief executive officer would have the power, on the direction of the board, to investigate a complaint himself or to cause it to be investigated by appointing an appropriate person, whether that person is a barrister, in the case of a particular complaint or perhaps an accountant in the case of another complaint.  I am talking about a system where the Garda have to investigate as an investigating force any allegations of criminal activities. There also has to be provision in cases where the board are not happy with the Garda investigation or in cases where the board think it is in the public interest that somebody other than the Garda should investigate them.  I will bring proposals to the House saying that the executive <Col N="1348" /> officer responsible to the board could investigate a complaint himself or could cause it to be investigated.</P>
    <P>We will also have to have provision for minor complaints.  Minor complaints with the consent of the complainant need not go through a long rigmarole if they can be informally sorted out.  It is appropriate that that should be put in and there is a role for the Commissioner there, or his representative.  Supposing there is a complaint and it is investigated either by the Garda or, as a matter of public interest, by the chief executive officer responsible to the board.  It can go two ways.  If, as a result of the investigation, whoever does it, it transpires that there is a basis for criminal charges, it has to go to the DPP, because he is the man who has to make the decision on whether or not it is a criminal charge.</P>
    <P>We have to envisage complaints which lead to criminal charges on the one hand but, on the other hand, we have to envisage complaints which fall short of that but lead to disciplinary procedures.  That is where the adjudication comes in.  When the board receive a complaint and get it investigated by the Garda or by an executive officer, and get the result of the investigation back, if the file suggests criminal proceedings, well and good, it follows the normal course of any file that indicates crime, and goes to the DPP.  If, on the other hand, there is no criminal charge which is sustainable but there is a disciplinary charge, there must be an adjudication process, and that adjudication process should be done by a body other than the Garda.</P>
    <P>I maintain it is proper to have a representative of the Commissioner on that adjudication body because he is chief disciplinary officer.  If we are talking about a position in which people can be reduced in rank or dismissed from the force, the man who is charged statutorily with control over the force and the discipline of the force should be involved there, not on his own, or anything like that, but responsible to the board.  There must be an input at that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor also made a very valid <Col N="1349" /> point.  There has to be an appeal procedure. This can be dealt with appropriately, as Deputy Taylor said, by involving existing judges.  I do not see a major difference between what I am saying and what Deputy Woods is saying.  It is just a different formulation of words.  There are a number of things I cannot accept in the way he has phrased the amendment. There is no reluctance on my part to have complaints investigated independently. By using the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; there is a possibility of creating a clash between what we finally accept here as a complaints procedure and what we write into the amendment.</P>
    <P>For example, if somebody is lodging a complaint under the new procedure when we agree on it, it is appropriate that he should have a choice of lodging it directly with the complaints board or, if he was happy with it, lodging it with the local Garda station or with the local superintendent. If we put in the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; does that mean you cannot complain at the local Garda station?  We do not know whether it does.  We could end up in the Supreme Court arguing the case.</P>
    <P>If, for example, the Garda, under the scheme we will agree at some future date, are investigating complaints, how does the definition of &ldquo;independent&rdquo; stand up? I gave other examples when I spoke here last week.  This is not backing off from the kind of scheme I am outlining.  It is a fear that using the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in this amendment will restrict this House from agreeing on a particular scheme on which they want to agree.  It does not add anything to tying down the Minister and making sure he does not implement sections of the Bill by order.  The essential thing is to prevent the Minister from bringing in sections of the Bill until the House is happy with the complaints procedure and regulations.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of Deputy Woods's amendment with which I am in disagreement is that he has weakened the provision so far as the regulations are concerned.  In the amendment coming back from the Seanad it is said that some sections cannot be brought in until the <Col N="1350" /> regulations are made.  The phrase used by Deputy Woods is &ldquo;approved by the Oireachtas&rdquo; or words to that effect.  It is possible for this House and the other House to approve regulations.  This Minister or a subsequent one could bring in sections of the Bill which Deputies think should not be brought in until there are appropriate regulations.  The two Houses could approve of them, and then the Minister could bring in the Bill and there is no obligation on him to make the regulations.  That is the problem.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Not in the way the Deputy phrased it.  He is diminishing it.  I do not think it would be appropriate for me to go back to the Seanad with a form of words weaker and a commitment weaker than what the Seanad passed unanimously.  In so far as I understand what Deputy Woods is saying, I do not think there is any difference in principle between us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods and other Deputies have argued that it would be appropriate that every member of the Garda could be investigated right up to Commissioner level by the complaints board.  I have said in the amendment coming from the Seanad that up to chief superintendent would be appropriate.  We are talking about a commissioner, a couple of deputy commissioners and six or seven assistant commissioners.  The difficulty is that there will be some Garda involvement in the adjudication process because the Commissioner is the chief disciplinary officer.  He is unlikely to be there himself and the people he will appropriately nominate will be from that half dozen.  I do not see, if you have an involvement like that, how that particular body would be appropriate to investigate that senior rank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of exempting people of any rank from being at the receiving end of a complaint.  I suggest to the House that it is a matter for the Government to investigate complaints against very senior officers in the Garda. We will have a very fruitful debate when <Col N="1351" /> the complaints procedure Bill is published. I have outlined in brief the position at the moment.  It will go back to the Government for a final decision.  I appreciate the views which have been expressed and I will be able to express those views to the Government when the final decisions are being taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that we also want a complaints procedure which is workable and acceptable.  I know these are two areas about which the Minister is concerned.  The board must be clearly seen to be independent and to have control over both the investigation and adjudication of complaints by members of the public against members of the Garda from the lowest member to the most senior member of the force.  A very clear difference is coming out in the discussion with the Minister.  It is becoming quite clear that (1) he wants the Commissioner or a representative of the Commissioner on the board, and (2) he wants the top senior levels excluded from investigation by this board.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the regulations, it is a simple matter of redrafting and that can be dealt with very quickly &mdash; that they be passed by the Oireachtas and made.  Section 7 requires that the Minister shall make regulations providing for the treatment of persons in custody in the Garda station.  The amendment would say that these sections will not come into being until regulations under section 7 have been approved by the Oireachtas. There would still remain an onus on the Minister to make the regulations under section 7.</P>

      <P>In any event, that is a needless argument.  If the Minister feels that the amendment needs further elaboration, it is very simple to adjust that and I have no objection to such adjustment.  That is not a problem and it is not fundamental to the question that we are discussing.</P>
      <P>There are some fundamental issues. The Minister says on the one hand that there is very little between us.  The Minister speaks about needing an independent body, independent of the Garda Síochána and of investigations being carried out by the Garda by and under the control of the board.  If the Minister accepts that, it is one of the essential elements in the amendment which I have put down on behalf of our party &mdash; that the investigation and adjudication of complaints would be by or under the control of an independent complaints commission.  I take it that the Minister is accepting that it should be by and under the direction of the complaints commission and his main concern is with the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews, I think, pointed out on the last occasion that &ldquo;independent&rdquo; is an important word, as I also said at the outset.  He gave the Oxford dictionary definition as &ldquo;not depending on authority of another; not in a position of subordination; not subject to external control; free from outside interference&rdquo;.  We are talking about the commission or board being independent of political interference, a board which can inspire public confidence through their clearly seen independence. &ldquo;Independent complaints commission&rdquo; is a simple phrase.  In its ordinary and natural meaning it means acting as a body <Col N="1353" /> independent of any other body such as the Garda Síochána, the Government or, indeed, the Oireachtas.  We want the body clearly to be seen to be free from outside interference.  This is at the nub of the whole question.  The word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; is important in principle at this stage.  The Minister says he will be happy later on to bring back a Bill until the House is happy with the new Bill.  The new Bill will be constructed on the overall principles set down at this stage.  It is these guiding principles with which we are concerned, as I understand it, in this amendment.  Consequently the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; is important &mdash; in fact, it is crucial.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that the phrase &ldquo;independent complaints commission&rdquo; simply means a commission who act independently and the phrase has no other meaning such as the Minister suggests. It was well established, both in law and in practice, that any body, public or private, who adjudicate on the conduct of other persons should have an independent element in the exercise of their function. It defies common sense to say that the description &ldquo;independent&rdquo; is open to be construed in any other context.  I quote the Minister from Volume 353, No. 4 of Wednesday, 31 October:</P>
    <P>I see a difficulty about using the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in the context of the amendment.  The inclusion of such a reference would mean that we would be anticipating at this stage what the ultimate decision of the Oireachtas would be on the forthcoming legislative proposals relating to the investigation and adjudication of complaints.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that.  We would certainly be setting down the criteria and the principles which should apply in the Bill which is subsequently brought forward. It is to be hoped that it will be brought forward by the Minister but it might be at a later stage by another Minister, not wishing the Minister any ill-will but taking the vagaries of time and chance and whatever else into account.  The Minister also said, in the same volume:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> If we try to lock the detail of that complaints procedure into a short form of words here, the form of words we adopt may prove subsequently to be in conflict with what the House decides the complaints procedure should be.</P>
    <P>He further says:</P>
    <P>Would the Supreme Court see that as &ldquo;independent&rdquo;?  Would the Supreme Court decide that &ldquo;independent&rdquo; means the kind of independence the Judiciary have, no diminution in status or remuneration?  Is that what we are talking about?</P>
    <P>The Judiciary derive their independence from the Constitution and this is not a relevant argument in relation to the use of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in an Act, as we are planning that it would be used here.  I have heard outside the House the statement that you cannot reduce the remuneration of members of the Judiciary, but that is specifically provided for in the Constitution.  This is because of the whole concept of separating the Judiciary from the Legislature &mdash; the executive arm.  A body which is independent has the power and authority given to it under the Act.  The Minister is putting an artificial, strained interpretation on the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  One would think it more a political exercise to block any provision which specifies that the commission will be independent &mdash; political in the sense that the Minister has other things in his mind.  He mentioned today that he still wants to see the Commissioner or a representative of the Commissioner &mdash; there is very little difference &mdash; or someone at that level as a member of the board.  Also he wants to see the people at the highest levels excluded.  I do not think that the Minister's argument is a legal argument. It is more a political argument which he is presenting in legal language.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the complaints commission cannot be an independent body.  While the Minister seems to accept this when he says that there is very little between us, he seems to have great reluctance about putting the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; into the amendment.  It is difficult to see how the Minister would now <Col N="1355" /> try to tell the House that there is no means whereby the independence can be referred to or described in the legislation. That is not a tenable argument.  For instance, I could suggest a number of drafts if the Minister wanted to put in the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in a different way. For instance, he could say, &ldquo;by or under the direction of a complaints commission&rdquo; and drop the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;, &ldquo;a complaints commission independent of the Garda Síochána&rdquo; or &ldquo;independent in the exercise of its functions&rdquo;.  We want to see it clearly to be independent.  Again it is back to a drafting matter.  If the Minister wanted to do so he could come back with a redraft to meet the requirement of independence and so independence could be seen clearly to be present.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been forthcoming generally in the course of this Bill in making amendments and in recognising the points raised here and being prepared to redraft.  There is scope to have relatively minor redrafting which would overcome any of the difficulties which the Minister might see.  I am advised legally that there is no difficulty in relation to the use of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in this context, and therefore I must conclude that there is some other reason why the Minister does not want to use the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  That worries me at this stage.  The Minister would be wise to accept the amendment which we are proposing albeit with some minor drafting amendments to that if he felt that that was necessary.  We do not feel that it is necessary.  We feel that it is adequate as it is but if the Minister feels it is so close, we are open to coming to meet him in that regard.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the complaints and the kind of complaints, and the Minister has elaborated somewhat more.  When the Minister says that he visualises the large number of complaints being investigated by members of the Garda Síochána themselves, once he accepts our proposal that this would be by or under the direction of the complaints commission whom we want to be independent, then that is very much along the <Col N="1356" /> lines we would envisage.  We see as a practical proposition that many of these complaints could be solved informally, but again the Minister says clearly today that he would visualise these things being done informally and that where necessary the commission would have the power to go directly themselves and people could refer directly to the commission.  As we saw in the draft we had earlier of a complaints commission, particular kinds of cases should in all instances be referred directly to the commission and in other cases they might be referred to the commission and the option would be there. The teasing out of that in detail can go with the Bill subsequently.  I do not think that there is a great deal between us there.</P>
    <P>We are down to the basic question of how independent the commission should be and be seen to be.  Even since we sat here last week in the House there have been comments outside the House, and it is only fair to put these complaints in perspective.  We, the Minister and other Members recognise that quite often when a prisoner is facing a clear and well-founded charge he or she may allege brutality or threats or inducements by investigating gardaí, and we must bear this in mind as a reality of the whole area of questioning people.  Probably we are all fairly familiar with cases where an otherwise reasonable and perhaps even benign drunk who has to spend a night in jail will allege rough and brutal treatment from the Garda.  Indeed, public representatives are often approached by parents alleging rough treatment of teenage children and other persons.  Deputy Gregory mentioned a case; I am sure he could mention many other cases which have been resolved informally at superintendent level.  I have had the same experience.</P>
    <P>A sort of communication problem must be overcome there and we all have a function in trying to overcome these problems.  The public representative may be and sometimes is placed in an invidious position in this respect in that he has his duty to his constituent on the one hand and his support for the Garda in the exercise of their duties on the other.  This <Col N="1357" /> position of the public representative should be recognised by the Garda, and from some of the comments made about Members of the House and the position they find themselves in it seems that that is not always recognised.  As public representatives we must take our constituents to be honest-to-God people innocent until proven guilty and we must look at their problem in an honest way and put it through whatever machinery is available to us.  That machinery very often is the local superintendent.  There is a need for an independent procedure for investigating the complaints and this procedure should be seen clearly to be independent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory alluded to the fact that in recent years there have been complaints and allegations of a serious nature.  He referred to allegations in the mid-seventies of heavy gang operators and special heavy-handed interrogators being regarded as acceptable or even being encouraged and rewarded.  We all know the extent to which those allegations went around at that time and in relation to that period they are still going around.  These led to the O Briain report which was commissioned by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government in October 1977.  The purpose of that report was twofold: it was to recommend safeguards for persons in custody and to recommend safeguards for members of the Garda Síochána.  Therefore, its terms of reference and the brief it was given were twofold.  The report was presented in April 1978 and that report has been very important in relation to this debate and these discussions.  Further allegations, this time of political interference with the Garda, were made in 1982.  In response to these the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, approached the President of the High Court with a request for the release of a High Court judge to conduct a judicial inquiry covering the previous three years.  As we all know, an election intervened and the incoming Government, the Fine Gael Party in the first instance and then the joint parties in Government, promised then a similar judicial inquiry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>Information on allocations to each county by way of block grants per kilometre in 1981, 1982 and 1983, is set out in a tabular statement which I am circulating in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy has in mind block grant allocations to county councils. Ninety-nine per cent of regional and county roads are located in county health districts.</P>
      <P>The block grant allows county councils a wide discretion in the determination of their annual programmes of works on regional and county roads.  This grant system was introduced in the period 1973 to 1975 and replaced four separate grants.  Initially, it was related to the total cost of those grants which in turn had been determined, <i>inter alia</i>, by the open-ended discretionary expenditure of councils on the maintenance of regional roads. Since 1975 the relative amounts of the block grants to individual counties have been adjusted gradually in an effort to relate them more closely to the maintenance and improvement needs of the regional road network.</P>
      <P>The overall amount available for block grants in any one year is determined by the total Exchequer provision for road works.  The overall road grant allocation to Kildare County Council since 1981, including the allocation for the Naas by-pass, has been reasonable relative to other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> The block grant to county councils is a supplement to the provision made from the council's own resources for the improvement, maintenance and management of regional roads, for improvement works on county roads, and for traffic management measures on national roads.  The cost of the maintenance of county roads must be met solely from the council's own resources.</P>
    <P>In recent years, in addition to the block grant, special grants have been provided for strengthening works on regional roads.  New grant commitments notified in 1984 to Kildare County Council for such works total £450,000.  The works involved would otherwise have to be financed from the council's own resources, supplemented by the block grant.</P>
    <P>The figures given in the tabular statement are not strictly comparable because of the wide variation, as between county council areas, in the proportion of regional roads in the combined regional/county road network.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>Block Grant Allocations per Kilometre of Regional and County Roads.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate, as Question No. 2 sought to establish, whether Kildare County Council are getting sufficient grants to meet their requirements having regard to the heavy volume of vehicular traffic through the county?  The Minister has referred to a tabular statement but, unfortunately, I do not have that information in my possession.  Will the Minister tell the House if it is his view that Kildare County Council have sufficient funds to meet this road maintanance programme having regard to the extraordinary volume of vehicular traffic due mainly to the geographical location of the county in relation to Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We recognise the type of traffic Kildare County Council have to deal with.  That is why they got, with their block grant, £450,000.  That money was allocated to enable the council to strengthen the regional roads.  We gave that money because we recognised that the system of block grants was not necessarily applicable to Kildare and because of the high volume of traffic through the county.  We believe the money allocated is sufficient to meet the needs of the county, if one can ever supply sufficient funds to meet the needs of any county council.</P>

Will the Minister of State assure us that if we embark on a programme to improve our roads the next allocation will reflect the Government's concern that roads in Kildare should be brought up to a standard because of the huge volume of traffic they take from all other parts of the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Data on vehicle kilometres of travel are contained in the Foras Forbartha publication &ldquo;Vehicle Kilometres of Travel&rdquo; (1980 RT 257).  The data on national roads in that publication enable valid comparisons to be made relating to each county and to each county borough, but the data do not distinguish between national primary and national secondary roads.  The samples on which data on regional and county roads are based are not sufficiently large to enable valid comparisons to be made relating to these roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of national roads, the volume of vehicular traffic averaged over the length of road in each county is highest in Dublin city and county at 16,613 vehicles per day, is lowest in <Col N="1363" /> Leitrim at 1,729, while the corresponding figure for Kildare is 8,148.  Allocations of State grants for maintenance works on national roads are not based simply on vehicular traffic per kilometre.  In particular, the condition of the roads must be taken into account.  In 1984, the allocations for maintenance of national roads amounted to £615,000 in the case of Kildare County Council, £1,089,500 for Dublin city and county and £200,000 for Leitrim.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, valid comparisons cannot be made relating to vehicles kilometres of travel for regional and county roads.  Road grants are not provided specifically for the maintenance of regional roads.  However, county councils may, at their own discretion, use the block grant to supplement expenditure from their own resources on such maintenance. The cost of maintenance of county roads must be met solely from the councils' own resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because a county like Kildare is situated next to Dublin &mdash; the single largest population bloc in the country &mdash; would the Minister not agree that it is true that not only must our national primary and secondary roads carry extraordinarily heavy traffic, but also our minor roads, again occasioned by the heavy volume seeking an alternative route to the capital city?

      <P>In terms of the actual amount of grant commitments for 1984 for national primary roads, County Kildare received the third highest amount, which was £530,000, after Cork, which received £834,000, and Dublin county which received £1,004,500.  Therefore it is recognised that County Kildare carries a reasonably heavy volume of traffic and it does receive the third highest commitment from the Road Fund.</P>

      <P>From the departmental brief, there is not a great deterioration, the general roads standard is good. In isolated areas there is some deterioration. Some local authorities recognise this and operate a type of three tier system themselves, taking decisions as to how they should approach that problem; that, for example, busy county roads should receive preference and so on.  Some local authorities have implemented this scheme.  As the Deputy is aware, it is within their remit to do so because they are responsible for the maintenance of county roads.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that both of these major schemes will be constructed to motorway <Col N="1370" /> standards.  It will, therefore, be necessary to hold a public local inquiry on each of the proposals under the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974. A detailed report on all relevant aspects of a motorway proposal must be available for such an inquiry.  I understand from Kildare County Council that they expect that the detailed documentation for the Newbridge by-pass will be completed before the middle of 1985 and that the documentation for the Leixlip-Kilcock by-pass will be available by the end of 1985.  As soon as the documentation on each of the schemes is received in my Department, there will be no undue delay in making arrangements for the holding of an inquiry in each case.  In the meantime the local authority is proceeding with the design of these schemes.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the recent national plan, I intend to announce shortly details of a number of major road improvement schemes which are likely to commence during the period 1985 to 1987.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in view of the fact that five people have been killed in recent months in falls from the balconies of flats in Ballymun, Dublin, he will institute an inquiry into the circumstances of the deaths, particularly with a view to establishing if the balconies could be made safer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are well established procedures for inquiring into deaths which may not have been due to natural causes and I have no function in regard to such procedures.  The management of the Ballymun estate, including any safety aspects, is a function of Dublin Corporation.  Nonetheless, I asked the corporation on 1 October for details of any measures they might have in mind to <Col N="1372" /> reduce the possibility of incidents occurring in future.  They have stated in reply that the balconies conform to the safety standards which operated at the time of their provision and are in good condition. They also state that they have no special measures in mind at present as respects the safety aspects of the balconies.  Further consideration of this matter will, I expect, take place within the context of discussions which the corporation's special sub-committee on Ballymun sought with me and which were initiated at a meeting held, at their request, on 31 October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that there has been considerable disquiet in the Ballymun area as a result of five deaths within two months during the summer.  Since I put down the question there has been a further accidental death of a young child following a fall from a window in a flat in Ballymun.  The Department were responsible in the first place for the design and erection of these buildings.  Would the Minister not accept that it is reasonable in these circumstances that the Department should inquire into these deaths and see if steps can be taken to make the flats more safe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are well established procedures for inquiring into deaths which occur due to unnatural causes but we have looked into the situation. When these flats were built there were no Irish standards but the British building regulation standards were adopted. They require that balconies should be at least 1.10 metres above floor level. In fact the balconies are 1.17 metres or 3' 10&rdquo; above floor level.  The standard proposed in the draft building regulations is 3' 11&rdquo; above floor level.  The balconies are within what is considered safe under the new building regulations.  The corporation also indicate that there is no evidence to suggest that the balconies have any unsafe features or that any alterations may be necessary to them.  We have asked the corporation and they have clearly indicated that there are no safety measures proposed.  I certainly regret any <Col N="1373" /> deaths.  When there are balconies at such a level, what is and what is not a safety factor?  We are conforming with the general safety standards.  Beyond closing the balcony areas completely, and I do not think that would be desirable, there is not very much more we can do.</P>
      <P>A corporation special sub-committee are looking at Ballymun generally.  The Minister and I met them last week and we will continue to consider all aspects of this matter this week.  We will look at all safety aspects and we will look at any impediments which could cause serious accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>While the balconies may conform to the safety standards, clearly, in the Ballymun context, they are not operating in a safe manner.  Would the Minister agree that the simple expedient of raising the safety height by means of a bar, or something of that nature, another nine or 12 inches could, at very low cost, contribute immeasurably to the safety factor of those balconies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not against looking at this suggestion.  I am concerned about the safety of people living in high rise flats.  We will ask the corporation for their views on this and learn what the pitfalls might be.  We have to ensure that any measures taken will not contain a danger element.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that there are procedures for inquiring into deaths but he will be aware that those procedures inquire into individual instances and do not necessarily relate one to the next.  The fact is that five deaths of young adult men occurred within two months when they fell from balconies in the Ballymun flats.  Some of these young men were residents of the Ballymun area and some were not.  Does the Minister accept that there is a need to inquire into whether there are any links between the deaths or if they were purely coincidental and that it was unfortunate that they occurred within two months?  In order to allay concern in the <Col N="1374" /> area would the Minister agree that there is a need to investigate the circumstances of these five deaths?  This would assure the people that it is not something which is endemic to Ballymun that caused these deaths but that there are other circumstances.</P>

      <P>Each case is treated individually.  Such tragic accidents are logged and filed individually by the Garda Síochána.  If there is a series of accidents the authorities would take note one against the other to find out if there is any correlation.  If we set up a public inquiry we would be duplicating investigations. We have a system which works well.  The information is available if the Deputy wants to pursue it.</P>

      <P>In order to meet the costs of management, maintenance and repairs of their rented housing stock, Dublin County Council, like all other housing authorities, have available to them the entire rental income from their housing estate, together with 40 per cent of the proceeds of sales of council houses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, Dublin County Council have available the entire rental income together with 40 per cent of the proceeds of sales of council houses. None of the rental money goes towards funding the loan charges or any other capital charges.  A local authority should be able to live within the revenue they collect and should be able to maintain their houses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the present position regarding action being taken by county councils in relation to a circular letter issued by him directing county councils to cut down potentially dangerous trees on roadside ditches throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.  I am aware of the potential hazard to life and property posed by dangerous trees along roadsides.  However, local authorities already have powers to deal with this problem.  The responsibility of local authorities for the maintenance of public roads includes the duty both to prevent danger to road users and to clear roads of obstructions.  Accordingly, local authorities are obliged to remove any fallen tree that is an obstruction to traffic using a public road and also to ensure that trees growing on road margins or other land under their control are not a danger to road users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities also have specific powers under section 34 of the Local Government Act, 1925, to request a landowner or occupier to cut or trim trees <Col N="1380" /> which may cause obstruction to a road or cause danger by obstructing the view of persons using the road.  There is a right of appeal to the District Court for an order annulling such a request.  The section also includes a provision enabling a local authority to seek an order of the District Court empowering it to carry out such trimming or cutting of trees and to recover the cost where the landowner or occupier had refused to do such works despite a District Court order requiring him to do so.</P>
    <P>In a circular letter dated 20 February 1984, local authorities were urged to continue to avail of their powers to deal with dangerous trees and in particular to bring to the notice of landowners or occupiers trees which were, in the opinion of the authority, in danger of falling on public roads and to seek the co-operation of landowners and occupiers in dealing with such trees.  The exercise of these functions is entirely a matter for local authorities themselves and, accordingly, they were not asked to report on their activities.  In this context I should point out that it is in landowners' own interests to remove dangerous trees since they may be held liable for damage for injury caused by such trees.  In addition, a seminar was organised by An Foras Forbartha in March 1984 for local authority engineers on the assessment of safety in relation to roadside trees.  As a general rule, fences are not part of a public road and, therefore, local authorities are not responsible for their maintenance.</P>
    <P>Statistics indicate that the number of accidents involving trees, whether standing or fallen, has remained fairly static over a long period.  In the four-year period 1980-1983 there was one fatal accident involving falling or fallen trees.  Notwithstanding the tragic events in January of this year when there were three such accidents resulting in seven deaths and three persons seriously injured, I am not satisfied that local authority operations in this area are seriously constrained by any inadequacies in the legal position and I do not consider that there is any immediate need for additional measures, <Col N="1381" /> though I will of course keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>This is a very delicate area.  I am sure the Minister will agree it is unfair to expect landowners to do this as they would not have at their disposal the machinery required to remove trees. This is particularly the case nowadays in view of the communications and power lines that run along the roadways and also in view of the fact that there are many more vehicles on the road.  The Minister referred to the Local Government Act, 1925.  Surely it is time to update that Act and remove the responsibility from the landowner to the local authority.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.  The provision of traffic and pedestrian crossing lights is a matter for the road authority concerned acting at the request of, or with the consent of, the Garda Commissioner. I understand that the matter has been under consideration by Dublin County Council and will be considered further by the council having regard to <Col N="1384" /> the results of an overall assessment of the work which is to be undertaken shortly.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for this road, including the provision of the finance for works thereon, rests with Dublin County Council as road authority.  I have assisted the council by making a special road grant of £45,000 available to them for works on this road and it was used to replace defective sections of concrete.</P>

It is used as a speedway and generally it is a hazard to those who use it.  In those circumstances I am asking the Minister to take a personal interest in the matter in his capacity as junior Minister at the Department.  I know that colleagues of his in the constituency have been in touch with him on the matter.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that since the Government accepted EC financial support for the operation of the local improvements scheme, there has been a requirement that in all cases a minimum payment of 10 per cent be made by way of local contribution?  Is he aware that this requirment prevents people in some rural areas from benefiting under the scheme because they are poor and are not in a position to meet the 10 per cent payment?  These people would probably have waited a number of years for an offer of a grant.  In some cases the cost of a job could be up to £25,000 so that the amount that would have to be collected locally would be <Col N="1387" /> £2,500, whereas previously if a person's valuation was less than £5 he would not be required to make a contribution.

    <Title>Criminal Justice Bill, 1983: From the Seanad (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to resume consideration of amendments from the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Seanad amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 3, between lines 11 and 12, the following inserted:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  An order shall not be made under subsection (1) in respect of any of the following sections namely, sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 until provisions relating to the investigation and adjudication of complaints by the public against members of the Garda Síochána not above the rank of chief superintendent have been enacted by the Oireachtas and have come into operation and until regulations under section 7 have been made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1 to Seanad amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In the third line to delete all words after &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;have been enacted by the Oireachtas for the investigation and adjudication of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána by or under the direction of an independent Complaints Commission, and until regulations under <Col N="1415" /> section 7 have been approved by the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Deputy Woods.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was speaking about the need for the commission to be independent and to be free from political or other interference and of the need for it to have power to direct and control both the investigation and adjudication of complaints.  All members of the Garda should be subject to the independent complaints commission including the most senior ranks of the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that it would be a matter for the Government to deal with discipline at that level.  What is the position of such members &mdash; the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners &mdash; in relation to the regulations and the complaints procedure? Will they be subject to it?  They would not be subject in the same way because they would not be subject to the review of the independent complaints commission.  It is important that all members be subject to the commission.  I have given a number of reasons why this is so. It is important in the interests both of the Garda and the public that the body should be seen to be completely independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the mid-seventies there were suggestions of heavy handed interrogation procedures. These led to the commission of the Ó Briain report in October 1977.  This in turn led to a valuable report on which this House has relied greatly in the course of the proceedings of this debate.  Further allegations were made in 1982.  This time they were allegations of political interference with gardaí at the highest levels. In response to this, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, approached the President of the High Court and asked him to release a High Court judge to conduct a judicial inquiry.  These rumours and allegations, which can be made so easily by innuendo and otherwise, were regarded as so serious that there was need for an independent procedure to establish <Col N="1416" /> clearly to the satisfaction of all sides and all political persuasions that action was being taken.  Numerous allegations were made and it reached the stage where the Taoiseach of the day felt it was necessary, in the interest of public order and public relief in the system, to have an independent investigation.  The process was set up but an election intervened.  The Coalition in their Programme for Government felt it necessary also to promise an independent judicial inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister proposes that this amendment should not apply to the upper echelons of the Garda.  I propose that it should and I am giving the reasons why I think that is necessary.  I am making only a brief reference to this because of concerns which developed in the past. There is a likelihood that such concerns could develop in the future.  I suggest that since we are taking these steps we should take the right ones.  Let us bury all the old hatchets and do the best job we can. It is in that context that I suggest it would be in the overall interest of everyone to have an independent process which would include all members of the Garda Síochána.  The process should be there to deal with any allegations made against any member of the Garda.</P>
      <P>The judicial inquiry was promised. That was not carried out subsequently but, nevertheless, at that time the Coalition Government felt that being seen to be free from political interference was sufficiently important to have a full judicial independent inquiry and that there would be an effective, independent complaints procedure.  The Taoiseach in the Fianna Fáil Government at that time initiated steps in this regard and the incoming Government promised that they would do something similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister must be very concerned about the important step we are taking and that he is anxious to do the right thing.  He has talked about getting the balance right but we believe that part of getting the balance right is to <Col N="1417" /> ensure the independence of this body, especially political independence.  Perhaps the Minister has changed his views and, if so, he can tell us what he thinks at present.  He or the Government decided not to hold a judicial inquiry and the incoming Minister conducted his own inquiry.  The Government have so far failed to establish an independent one, hence the allegations were allowed to fester and a Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner were forced to retire. There are now renewed allegations of heavy handed methods being adopted during interrogations and of confessions being extracted by force.  It is not simply a case of interrogators being over-tough with ruthless subversives.  When we discuss this question people allege that we are going soft on subversives but we are talking about legislation for all the people and about a broad range of crime.</P>
    <P>There are also allegations of brutality, psychological terror and political bias being used against ordinary citizens and we must provide a remedy for these incidents when they occur.  From our knowledge we know that, happily the occurrences are not too frequent but, nevertheless, it behoves us to provide a system which will clearly deal with them. We have had recently the Kerry confessions incident which has caused concern to the Minister and the public.  There is need for an independent inquiry there. The Minister said that when the present investigations are completed, presumably in the near future, he will give his decision in relation to an independent inquiry in that case.  You are back to the question of the need for independence in any inquiry of that nature.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for an independent inquiry in relation to the Shercock case to allay people's concern in regard to the incidents which occurred there.  I have had personal experience of the Rory Buckley case in which a very ordinary citizen alleged in a sworn affidavit that he had been physically abused and maltreated in the course of questioning over a period of approximately 23 hours.  That was a case of an individual who happened <Col N="1418" /> to be related to a person who was on the pro-life amendment campaign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into great detail.  Nevertheless, it is clear from his affidavit that he was arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act on an alleged charge of causing damage in the sum of £15 to a photocopying machine.  He was never charged but the interrogation went on for quite some time.  He brought in his solicitor at a very early stage and also asked to see a doctor.  The doctor was also brought in at an early stage but he felt he had been abused and that statements were made by members.  I have no intention of mentioning names but the affidavit has been submitted to the Commissioner for investigation. A particular party was classed, among other things, as being scum, the lowest of the low and a hypocrite.  These are questions which indicate political bias and this is a matter which should be taken very seriously.  When I approached the Commissioner he regarded these allegations as being very serious.  A Senator was named in the same way by the interrogating officers and foul language was used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Buckley was a very fit person, a constant jogger and, because of his background, he had a very strong personality. In the course of the interrogation he made up his mind to resist the whole operation as strongly as possible and did his best to emerge as a normal person. His account is horrifying.  Despite the fact that this man was tough and psychologically strong and well conditioned, he ended up dazed and traumatised.  It is quite clear that if he had not received visits from his solicitor and his wife that his position would have been considerably worse.  He was innocent and just <Col N="1419" /> happened to be in or about or near a place and was suspected for that reason. This legislation is about people who will be in the same position.  We are now giving power to the Garda to arrest, detain and question such people &mdash; not for 23 hours as in his case but for periods of six hours or an extension to 12 hours. Consequently there must be provision to ensure that such people have an independent means of redress if they feel they have been badly treated.</P>
    <P>I brought this case to the attention of the Commissioner on 30 September 1983. I enclosed the affidavit and gave the information to the Commissioner.  On 3 October 1983, just over a year ago, I received a letter from him which said he had received the letter and the copy of the declaration concerning the circumstances of the arrest and interrogation, that he had appointed a senior officer to investigate the very serious allegations made, and that he hoped to commence inquiries immediately.  Inquiries were commenced very soon after that.  To this day I have heard no more about the case and I understand the family have heard no more about it either.  I certainly thought I would have heard something about it within that time and I did not.  I am a public representative and a spokesman for the Opposition.  These were very serious allegations and that is where the case rests.</P>
    <P>This man does not want to pursue the matter.  He does not want to have any more hassle.  It was a bad experience for him.  He is a very solid, well-adjusted and physically tough citizen fortunately. There is no doubt in my mind that he deserves some sort of apology, report, or something after those events.  To me that points to the need for a body to deal with these matters independently and communicate with the individuals.</P>
    <P>I prepared a document earlier which differs from the English one in certain respects.  We did more investigation than the Minister gives us credit for.  I notice that on each occasion he trys to tie in the document with the British one.  We went further than that.  I managed to bring it <Col N="1420" /> out in a relatively short time early in the year as an aid.  When you put down something you lead with your chin because the Department and the Minister can analyse it and say some little thing is wrong with it.  The easier approach is to wait until the Minister put down something and then criticise it.  We put down what we thought was fairly close to the kind of thing that is required and, as the debate goes on, it seems to be fairly close to what is required.  Obviously it is a matter for discussion in the House before it is finalised.  From what the Minister said today, I think we are fairly close in this area.</P>
    <P>On pages 13 and 14 of the document circulated at the time, I set out the way in which complaints procedures could be processed.  While it can be further discussed it fits into the amendment we are proposing.  The procedure would be by or under the direction of the independent complaints commission.  The Minister seems to be in agreement with us on &ldquo;by or under the direction of&rdquo; which really clears up that matter.  It seems that some people outside the House, and inside the House to some extent, are thinking this out at the moment and are wondering what would happen about the informal complaints as well as the more serious complaints.  I am delighted to be able to talk about this process now.  I was put out of the House for talking about it before. It might have been wiser if we had been able to refer to it at that time.</P>

      <P>I trust I will not be put out at this stage.  I will not say much more about it.  It is set out there and I think it is helpful because it indicates that there are various ways of addressing and processing the various complaints.  We would visualise that the Garda and the local superintendent would have a very important function but, for people who were not happy, there would be recourse to the central body, the complaints commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> Earlier we talked about the Ombudsman. Many complaints can be sorted out fairly readily.  I should hate to be trying to work on the ones they have in Telecom Éireann.  I understand there were 150,000 complaints and only 12,000 were resolved to the satisfaction of the public.  They have a problem.  The Ombudsman had 1,300 complaints submitted to him; 1,000 have been dealt with already; and 850 were regarded as valid complaints.  While they are valid they may be very minor. Presumably that will come out in the report later.</P>
    <P>We expect that there will be a fairly reasonable number of complaints but many of them will be of a minor nature. We visualise a large number of the complaints being investigated informally.  On that we are in agreement with the Minister. If they cannot be resolved satisfactorily they will go to the commission. Complaints of a more serious nature will go directly to the commission.  These will include complaints involving serious injury or the death of a person.</P>
    <P>For these reasons we are concerned about having an independent body.  I mentioned recent events.  There are other allegations but I will not go into them. As Deputy Gregory said, a number of them were covered recently.  Each one has its own circumstances.  If we had the details and the files we could probably debate each one of them and the legal people could debate the pros and cons.</P>
    <P>I have a case which I have passed on to the Minister and I trust he will investigate it.  It is the case of a man who is a prisoner in Mountjoy and he claims that he was forced to sign a confession, as he said, by detectives from Dublin.  He claims he is innocent.  He was convicted on a murder charge.  I will not say anything more about that.  Constituents come to Deputies with their problems but, on the other hand, we must support the Judiciary and the Garda.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with the question of a misuse of certain members of the Garda of the trust we have placed in them.  I ask the Minister to consider whether there is a pattern involving the same section or the same people in the Garda.  I should <Col N="1422" /> like the Minister to look at that because it is a matter of concern at the moment. I would be happy if the Minister would see whether there is any pattern in any section or among any members of the Garda.  We must have a procedure which is fair to the public and to the Garda Síochána.  We owe it to the Garda Síochána to set out the parameters within which we expect them to work on our behalf.  I hope that we can do that in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There have been various comments outside the House on our proceedings here.  The Garda attitude has been expressed fairly clearly and is daily brought more to our notice.  On Friday, November 2, in <i>The Irish Times</i> under the heading &ldquo;Gardaí ask Noonan to defer Justice Bill&rdquo; the general secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, Mr. Murray, said there could be no question of introducing certain measures contained in the Bill until the Garda had completed their negotiations.  He said that his association were in favour of a measure of independence when complaints against gardaí were made.  He said he would accept that there should be no Garda involvement in the adjudication of an investigation into a complaint, but that the investigation itself would have to remain solely the responsibility of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Press</i> of the same day Mr. Murray said that it should be deferred until his members had been fully trained to operate the new procedures and were given the proper facilities and resources needed.  He warned the Minister for Justice that they would not allow their members to be placed in compromises where their careers might be in jeopardy because of an obvious lack of resources. Mr. Murray said that there could be no question of introducing certain measures contained in the Bill along with the constraints and disciplinary codes and regulations which would follow them if the facilities available at Garda stations were totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána at this stage urge the postponement of the Bill on that <Col N="1423" /> basis.  We recognised here in this House from the beginning, as the Minister has recognised, that it would be necessary to provide training and facilities.  The Minister pointed to the fact that it would be possible to carry out this kind of questioning only in certain stations and not in every station.  The Minister and the House are very well aware of the requirements in this respect.  These have been debated in the House.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the newspaper articles that the Garda want the investigation to be in their hands only but would accept independent adjudication.  This is what I was trying to reason out last week. Whether it was in response to what was being said here, or otherwise, we are certainly helped in our thinking on the subject by the articles which came out since then.</P>
    <P>The <i>Garda News</i> of October 1984 points out on page 4:</P>
    <P>On the complaints procedure discussions between the garda associations and departmental officials have been going on now for some time under the aegis of the Garda Conciliation Council. A draft scheme has been talked about in some depth.</P>
    <P>It further states:</P>
    <P>The new procedure for initiating, investigating and adjudicating on complaints from members of the public against gardaí also properly falls into this category.  It is a reasonable assumption therefore, that any new system of this nature would have to be negotiated in the normal way and only after agreement had been obtained on all sides could the new system come into operation.  The problem in this instance is that even if agreement on a new system can be obtained (and there is no guarantee that it will) ... the eventual outcome might well be quite different to what the gardaí had previously agreed to.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is a second debate going on separately &mdash; and quite rightly &mdash; in relation to the practical implications <Col N="1424" /> of the measures being taken here in the House.  It is further stated:</P>
    <P>This situation places the Minister in a dilemma.  On the one hand he must recognise the legitimate right of the gardaí to negotiate and seek agreement on matters affecting their terms and conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>Further, it states:</P>
    <P>Again it cannot be denied that on a matter of such major public importance it is proper that the elected representatives of the people be given the opportunity to debate and approve such a measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now faced with the unenviable task of balancing the legitimate rights both of the gardaí and the legislature with regard to both of these important matters.  In so doing he has the close and constant ear of the legislators. He may not therefore, be aware of the strength of feeling that is building up on these issues within the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Garda Síochána are concerned about these matters.  I trust that, regarding the statements made in the papers and periodicals, we can rely on the Garda following the rule of law and accepting the democratic decision of the Oireachtas in relation to the principles involved in this case.  I can assure the Minister of the support of my party in that regard.  There can be no Garda veto on what the Oireachtas decide.  The powers of the Garda Síochána come from the people and from the Oireachtas.  We on this side of the House and the Members generally will appreciate the right and proper exercise of the function of the Garda Síochána to negotiate with the Minister on matters like training, facilities and all other related aspects and the question of providing properly for appeals and other matters.  Nevertheless, the basic principles of the independence of the institutions that are proposed are a matter for the Oireachtas.  I trust that the views expressed are related to the <Col N="1425" /> Garda Síochána accepting the function of the Oireachtas in that regard.</P>
    <P>We all know that implementation of the proposed measures will involve training and new resources.  This has been pointed out in the House by numerous Members in the course of the debate on this Bill.  Here we are in agreement with the Garda Síochána.  However, when it comes to the principle of who will control the investigation, this is clearly a matter for the Oireachtas.  <i>Quis custodiet custodes?</i>&mdash; who will guard the guards?  The Oireachtas must provide checks and balances in this regard.  The complaints procedure can, of course, be used as a source of confidence in those who protect the State and as a safeguard to protect against subversion of public confidence in the force.  Without this confidence and a restoration and preservation of Garda morale the task of the Garda would be more difficult.  There is no doubt that with the safeguards and regulations which the Minister is proposing to bring before the House and with the complaints procedure the position of the Garda would be strengthened.  Their position when they come to court with cases would be strengthened because the safeguards would be seen to have been applied.  The conditions for getting convictions in appropriate cases should be strengthened and consequently juries should have more confidence in the decisions that are taken.  For this reason we seek an independent Garda Síochána complaints commission to support the Garda in their work.</P>
    <P>These are the main points which I want to make in relation to the amendment at this stage.  As I have said, we believe they should be independent.  We believe that they should cover all the ranks and that all the ranks should be subject to the regulations and the complaints procedure. This would strengthen the position of the Minister and the independence of the whole process.  They would be seen to be independent and consequently could be much more readily relied on against any allegations that are being made.  That is why I ask the Minister to accept the amendment which we are proposing.</P>
    <Col N="1426" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the comments the Minister made in the Dáil this morning when he indicated his views on the statements made by Members on different sides of the House last week and indicated in regard to the complaints tribunal that an element of independence is necessary in the context not merely of adjudication but also of investigation. The debate has been going on across the floor of the House on this amendment and I want to make one or two brief comments as a follow on to the comments made last week.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods spoke at length in the House on previous occasions about the necessity for independence in the context of the complaints procedure.  I am not convinced as to the reason for excluding the various senior members of the force from accountability to an independent complaints procedure in the context of the amendment before the House.  They are excluded and I do not believe that that is generally in the interests of the force.  I would like to have seen the amendment providing for the senior officers in the force being amenable to the complaints procedure in the investigation of complaints in the future.  It could create a real difficulty if they are not so amenable.  It was mentioned last week and the Minister explained this morning his views on this.</P>
      <P>One can take the view that, if a complaint is made about the nature of an investigation, officers at the most senior level of the force have a direct input into that investigation and the manner in which it should be conducted.  I can see a complaints tribunal in considerable difficulties in seeking to resolve any complaint or to investigate the validity of any complaint made about the nature of that investigation and seeking to find if there is an incidence of misbehaviour which gives rise to concern.  I can see the complaints tribunal finding themselves in a sense in no man's land, in a no go area where they cannot determine where responsibility lies.  As a result this House would not be able to exercise the degree of accountability through an independent complaints procedure that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> I say no more on that other than again I urge on the Minister that he have another look at that area.  It can be dealt with ultimately when we deal with legislation on an independent complaints tribunal. It is in the interest of the force generally that everyone is seen to be accountable. Artificial difficulties could be created by the type of divide off envisaged by the Minister in the context of the amendment we are dealing with today if the provisions suggested by it eventually end up in legislation relating to an independent complaints tribunal.</P>
    <P>In a sense, the longer this debate goes on the greater the difficulty that arises for the Garda.  All of us in this House would like to see the legislation on an independent complaints procedure produced very rapidly.  Since we were in this House last week discussing this issue members of the Garda, through the journal that Deputy Woods referred to, and also through the newly elected general secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, have indicated and confirmed what all of us in this House are aware of, that at this stage morale in the Garda force is extremely low.  Many long-serving members of the Garda are very distressed to find themselves caught up in the middle of controversies in which they themselves have not been involved and are anxious that independent mechanisms be established as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>The debate that has gone on about the incidents in Shercock and Kerry, and to which I am not going to refer in any detail, has emphasised the question of whether there should be a judicial inquiry.  Deputy Dr. Woods referred to that this evening.  The point is worth making that if we had the independent complaints procedure established there would be no need to worry over the type of procedure applicable to resolve problems of this nature where serious allegations have been made which have given rise to a great deal of public concern.  The mechanisms would be there and ongoing debate as to how we deal with this type <Col N="1428" /> of incident and render people accountable for alleged misbehaviour would no longer be necessary.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is urgent that the legislation for the provision of an independent complaints tribunal should come before the House.  It is in the interest of the Garda and of the general public that that would happen.  There is a great need to restore within the Garda force their own self-confidence.  The vast majority of members of the force would never consider behaving in other than the most honourable way.  Unfortunately, many feel themselves under suspicion through no fault of their own.  We as the legislators of Parliament have an obligation to that vast majority of members of the Garda force who want to do nothing other than perform their duty properly.  We should take this difficulty off their backs by providing for an independent complaints tribunal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is responding, as he has done throughout the debate on this Bill to points made in this House.  Deputy Woods has referred, as have many other Members in this House &mdash; myself, Deputy Andrews, Deputy Skelly, Deputy Barnes, Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Gregory-Independent &mdash; to the need for an independent investigative procedure.  The Minister today has fleshed out somewhat the views he expressed on the last day.  That is essential.</P>
    <P>I was a little disturbed by the reported comments of Mr. Michael Murray of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, as reported in all our daily newspapers on Friday, 2 November, when he was talking about the need to defer the Criminal Justice Bill.  He is reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of that date as saying that his association were in favour of a measure of independence when complaints against the Garda were made.  He said that he would accept that there should be no Garda involvement in adjudication of an investigation into a complaint, but the investigation itself would have to remain solely the responsibility of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>A similar statement was made by him <Col N="1429" /> in an article published this week in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  I see that as an untenable proposition.  I take the point made by Deputy Woods that it must be for this House to determine the provisions to apply to adjudication in the context of a complaints tribunal and investigation and that the Garda, or any representative body of the Garda, cannot have any form of veto on the manner in which an investigation is supervised or exercised.  I see it as inevitable that members of the Garda will have some involvement in an investigation but I suggest that an investigation that takes place following the making of a complaint should be by and under the direction of an independent complaints tribunal or an independent complaints commission.  I would like to see a specialist group of gardaí formally attached to an independent complaints tribunal with a responsibility, under the aegis of that tribunal, for investigating complaints independent of members of the local force where the complaint originated. I do not understand why Mr. Murray of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors should state adamantly that an investigation must be the sole responsibility of the Garda.  He made a similar statement yesterday but he did not give any <i>rationale</i> or reason for making that point.  If the proposal is adopted it will cast doubt on the independence of an independent complaints tribunal.</P>
    <P>I accept the comment in the Ó'Briain report that for a complaints tribunal to work it must have the acceptance of the entire force.  It must be understood by the force that this House, ultimately, makes the decisions and legislates for the manner in which these complaints are adjudicated upon and investigated. There would be a lack of confidence on the part of the general public, and many members of the Garda, if that independence in the investigations area did not apply.</P>
    <P>The more we debate the provisions in the Bill the more we seem to tease out the problems and, eventually, reach a fairly unified view across party lines about the needs in these areas.  In my view the <Col N="1430" /> real test of the workings of this, and the accountability of the system, is ensuring that where complaints are made they are properly investigated, that false complaints are properly investigated and that the Garda do not labour under the difficulty of having complaints that do not have any justification made against them. The only way to deal with this is to provide a proper complaints procedure, proper regulations under statutory mechanism. We must also come to terms with ensuring that detention provisions in the Bill will not become operative until we have a form of video recording or, certainly, tape recording, of all interrogation or questioning that takes place of people in detention.  In addition, we must ensure that lawyers are allowed remain with people when they are under questioning.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murray, in suggesting that the Bill be deferred, seemed to indicate some reluctance on his part, or on the part of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, in the context of the complaints tribunal.  I hope I am not accurate in that.  From the contacts I have had with many gardaí of ordinary rank I have learned that they are anxious to have a complaints tribunal set up quickly.  They do not seem to be worried about it.  I find it curious that the first time a representative of an association representing some members of the force suggests that the Bill be deferred arose following on a detailed debate here when there was across-party lines agreement of the need for an independent complaints tribunal. It is worth making the point that the type of tribunal we are discussing &mdash; we will be discussing it in more detail when the legislation setting it up is introduced &mdash; is one that would be demanded by the general public and the majority of members of the force in the light of recent events even if we did not have a Criminal Justice Bill.  It should be understood that the provisions in the Bill in regard to detention will not come into force without a complaints tribunal being approved in the House.</P>
    <P>The view I take is that a complaints tribunal is necessary in itself.  Its necessity <Col N="1431" /> does not arise purely because we are dealing with the Criminal Justice Bill.  It is something we should have provided many years ago.  I have no doubt that had this Bill not arisen, had we not debated it in the last 12 months, after some of the recent events and the disturbing cases that received publicity in the last four or five years there would be an overwhelming public demand, and a demand from the vast majority of gardaí, to provide an independent complaints tribunal.  An independent complaints tribunal may be a <i>sine qua non</i> of the coming into force of the detention and other sections of the Bill but it is required as a necessity.  If the suggestion from some members of the force is that by deferring the Bill we would be putting off the day when we would have an independent complaints tribunal then that is not tenable.  That should be understood and I am sure that is the view of all Members.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by a Member last week that in the light of the type of contribution that I and other Members have made it appears we are in some way trying to do down the Garda.  It must be understood that we are not.  We want to restore the morale of the Garda.  We want to restore public confidence in the force and provide the vast majority of members of the force who are anxious to perform their duty for the State with the protection they require against being subject to false allegations of misbehaviour.  At the same time we have a public duty to protect the general public against the misbehaviour of a small number of gardaí. We can only do that by providing the mechanism of an independent complaints tribunal and proper regulations that outline what must take place by way of a code of conduct when people are being questioned in Garda stations.  We must ensure that we have other available mechanisms, such as videos or the tape recording of interviews, to ensure that where allegations are made the complaints tribunal have a real way of discovering what took place at the time relating to which a complaint has been <Col N="1432" /> made from first hand evidence.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is taking into account the comments made by all Members on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to speak at any great length at this stage.  I find myself in the unusual but, nevertheless, welcome position of being able to agree on one point made by the last speaker.  I am referring to his statement about the need for not excluding anybody from the proposed independent tribunal. Indeed, it is rather strange that the Minister finds himself in the position where he would defend excluding them on the basis that it is and should be a matter for the Government that they deal with anybody above the rank of chief superintendent.</P>
      <P>I am sure his memory is as fresh as mine in regard to the times when many within his party, some of whom are now Ministers, were calling out for an independent Garda authority.  I recollect his having to address his Ard-Fheis and explain to them that while it had been more or less promised it was not his intention to introduce such an independent Garda tribunal immediately.  I mention that because I find it rather strange that he should now propose, or see any great wisdom in, excluding anybody from the proposed complaints tribunal.  We all accept that members of the Garda force have nothing to hide.  If we develop that to its logical conclusion, then those at higher ranks should have much less to fear than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I must revert to comments made by the last speaker and talk about the morale of the Garda.  The morale of the Garda is at a very low ebb. But it does not derive solely from the last two unfortunate incidents referred to &mdash; the Kerry baby incident and the Shercock incident.  It is because members of the Garda themselves have found themselves over the last three to five years in a situation in which they have been publicly and privately attacked by Members of this House. Deputy De Rossa and I have attended meetings in our constituency and I have never heard people make the point publicly that there should be this tribunal. <Col N="1433" /> Rather do they all the time remind us that the Garda do not seem to have the powers to carry out their duties in a fashion that will protect the people from the ever-growing number of attacks and robberies that occur every day of the week.  I am quite sure that as I speak in this House, in my constituency and in every other constituency, there is some member of the public who, for the umpteenth time, has entered some house, and is attacking its owner in order to get money or property.  The Garda have told me that under existing legislation, having pursued such a person and having brought him before the courts for the umpteenth time they have found themselves having to defend their position against somebody acting under the free legal aid scheme who is being paid out of public moneys to defend that person. That is what has led to the lowering of the morale of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I said in this House last week that I am sure I have made more complaints about the Garda than has any other Member of this House, that when any constituent brings to my notice that he or she is dissatisfied in regard to an alleged abuse by any member of the force, straightaway I go and interview that garda.  I tell him I am discussing the matter with him, that it is not my practice to go above his head. Invariably, perhaps with one or two exceptions since becoming a Member of this House in 1969, that garda has been able to defend the action he has taken.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Shatter criticising Mr. Murray.  Mr. Murray is the secretary of that organisation.  Unlike the teaching, medical or, say, legal professions, that organisation has no representative in this House.  Is it not essential that they make known to us what are their thoughts and reactions?  Is it not much better that they do so now rather than when we, having passed this legislation, discover what I would fear would be inhibitions on the part of a good, decent garda, that he would be unable to discharge his duties because Members of this House would have this big eye watching, would have recorded everything he does? <Col N="1434" /> Is there any member of any other profession in this House who would yield to such examination?  Would Deputy Shatter, as a lawyer, have somebody record everything he says to a client lest it be shown that he had been unfair, or had injured that client, not perhaps by beating him &mdash; as I could do as a teacher &mdash; but in some other more serious way?</P>
    <P>What happens if we do not have the co-operation of the Garda?  We live in a free society, the right given every worker to organise and protect his interests. What happens if the members of the Garda continue with their contention &mdash; which has been mentioned already &mdash; that they should have the right to strike? Are we going to deny them that right? Suppose as a result of the passage of this Bill they find themselves in that position, where then do we find ourselves in respect of the appalling situation obtaining in which people live in dread, some of remaining inside their homes and others of walking outside them?  Here we are challenging the right of a spokesman on behalf of that organisation to say to us what he feels.  We tell him that we are the people who introduce the laws.  Of course we are.  It is because I realise that the people on behalf of whom I speak are those who pay the salaries of the Garda and who pay ours that I must, in all honesty say here what those people have asked me to say.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Gregory on a radio programme the other morning speaking about what is euphemistically called the Concerned Parents Movement.  He made the point that there was need for such a movement and accepted everything they did because it took the Garda too long to do the work, that a drug pusher can be identified but because of the processes through which a garda must operate it takes him too long to bring that identified person to justice.  We are now suggesting here that the Garda, having brought in that person, must put on the recorder, recording every word he speaks to that offender.  I would be interested to hear later how Deputy Gregory would relate what he said last week to circumstances in which he would condone, accept, or <Col N="1435" /> advance the need for recording everything a garda does.  We are all human. Would any of us have any faith in a system requiring that we have recorded, not just here but in our private lives, our interviewing of constituents and everything we said to them?  I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will probably reach for the gong, reminding me that in his opinion this is not relevant to the discussion, but he has listened&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Tunney is fully aware of everything in the Bill and perhaps even more aware of what is not in it and should be included.  Deputy Tunney is aware that Deputy De Rossa and I have attended many meetings in our constituency where the cry of the people was, &ldquo;Give the Garda more authority, more power, get them to protect us&rdquo;.  It that is not a true assessment of the proceedings of meetings we have attended &mdash; at which people of all types have expressed their concern &mdash; I will be very pleased to have Deputy De Rossa or any other Deputy tell me that I am making a mistake because I know quite well, I am not.  I am not contending that that is what we are concerned about here with regard to the proposed complaints tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having talked to some of the gardaí in recent times I know that they are anxious <Col N="1436" /> that it should not appear that they condone or feel in any way proud of serious mistakes and abuses of power and position by some handful of gardaí.  They are much more concerned that matters referred to here and things said about them here reflect on them in a fashion which will not encourage them to carry out in a way they would wish aspects of the legislation passed here.  We get from people in accordance with the respect we show to them and the confidence we place in them.  That is essential in our dealings with people, either in our own families or teaching in a school and so on.  If we say that <i>ab initio</i> we suspect them, we may say that we are only doing so in respect of the activities of a small number of gardaí who are injuring the good name of the force, but I do not think we are being as honest as we should be about that.  I am quite sure there are many members of the Garda who do not accept that we are being honest.  If we have some major criticism to make, let us cough it up and direct it to those for whom it is appropriate.  Let us not castigate the whole body of the Garda Síochána, men and women, and challenge their right to convey to this House how they feel about legislation which is so vital to them, having denied them the legislation they required over so many years.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister is as concerned and as honest about these matters as I would be but he is making a very poor case in saying that he and his Government would wish to exclude all those above the rank of chief superintendent because they think it is a matter for the Government to deal with them. Perhaps I am misinterpreting what the Minister said but I understood him to say that the Government would take action in cases where officers over a particular rank were involved.  Nobody would wish to see that happen.  It would be far better for Government and everybody concerned to have this complaints tribunal set up immediately.  It should be seen to be as independent as possible and nobody should be excluded from it.  That is the least that is required.</P>
    <P>Let me again remind the House that <Col N="1437" /> we should not in their absence, while they have nobody to speak for them, deny the right to any organised group of people to comment on what we propose doing. Rather we should welcome their comments and pay heed to them.  We can say and do what we like here but ultimately we must have a Garda force who have confidence in us and who accept that we have an interest in them and a respect for them, as well as a dependence on them. If that is not the case at the end of the day, then the time spent on this legislation could have been better spent.  The first essential is that we have the understanding, sympathy and confidence of the Garda.  Let us take issue with them every day of the week where they do anything which is contrary to the duties imposed on them or the behaviour expected of them, but do not let us treat them as people who are mere puppets of people here who for, one reason or another, may be challenging their authority, integrity and honour.</P>

      <P>I wish the debate had not once again descended to the level where people were for or against.  Consistently throughout the debate the whole emphasis has been on striving for balance, making sure that the rights of all sides are protected and supported and making sure that the extra powers contained in the Bill would not be abused, particularly in regard to innocent people.  I did not think that at this late stage I would have to begin by laying down those foundations again.</P>
      <P>I found part of Deputy Tunney's speech questionable but I ask his pardon if I have misunderstood him.  He felt that some of us were not being honest in talking only of a minority, that really there were a certain number of Deputies who were trying to get at the whole Garda force and undermine this group of people, whom we have actually been striving to support and protect as well. The Garda themselves are the first to suffer from the abuses of a minority. There is no need to go into any further detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> We who have been elected are concerned not only that the morale of the Garda should be upheld but that the confidence and trust of the public should be upheld.  Concern and anxiety have been expressed not just in regard to recent events but also in regard to other matters which have been left unanswered and uninvestigated.  This has damaged confidence and trust among the public.  It is a matter of balance but our first task as legislators is to guard the civil rights of everyone.  I am amazed that Deputy Tunney should be under the impression that we would be damaging the Garda by demanding an independent tribunal and electronic recording.  This is not the kind of support and protection which he believes to be in operation in eastern bloc countries.  He said this would be a totalitarian invention brought in by the Dáil.  Completely independent tribunals and electronic recording are part and parcel of the strongest democracies for which we have a high regard.</P>

      <P>We are asking for a completely independent tribunal that will restore the confidence of the public and also the confidence of all right-minded and right-behaving gardaí.  We are not asking for anything radical, damaging or subversive.  In other democratic countries this is accepted and in no way has it been alleged to be an attack on the police force or an interference in their rightful behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> In asking for independence for the tribunal we are also asking that their tasks, powers and resources be defined, and they must have investigative powers.  I would like to think that we are not taking up precious time in the Dáil when we have a backlog of legislation waiting to be introduced and debated.  I would like all Deputies to realise that electronic recording is not an attack on the Garda or questioning their behaviour.  It is an accepted practice in other democratic countries.  The sooner we can conclude this debate without anyone alleging any kind of bad intention against another, the better.  I was not alleging anything against Deputy Tunney; I merely hoped he was not making any allegations against the Deputies who had spoken here at length with great sincerity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>To a large extent I feel this House has gone about its business backwards.  We are now practically at the end of the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill which erodes the civil liberties of every citizen.  We are now talking about safeguards which will be implemented before certain sections of this Bill are brought into effect.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the need for these safeguards existed prior to, and independent of, the existence of the Criminal Justice Bill.  Six years ago the Ó Briain Report set out very clearly the need for an independent complaints tribunal, the need for regulations governing the treatment of persons in custody and the need for the monitoring the treatment of persons held in custody.  The Ó Briain Report made two proposals in relation to monitoring. The first was the establishment of a garda in a station who would be responsible for overseeing what was going on in the station and the second was that the Government should immediately set in motion a study into the feasibility of electronic recording of questioning and so on.  Those needs were there prior to the emergence of this Bill.  For that reason we should by right have been discussing and implementing those measures before this Bill was discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> Section 7 is very brief and is only referred to in the Seanad amendment, in the Minister's amendment and in Deputy Woods's amendment.  There is no information in that amendment as to precisely what kind of regulations will be introduced. On a previous Stage on this Bill the Minister outlined what he thought the regulations might be, but they were the Minister's opinion at that stage and they may have changed since, as the Minister's opinion has changed in relation to other matters in the Bill.  In my opinion we should have these regulations before us before we make a decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is not happy to accept Deputy Woods's amendment because it includes the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;. He feels that would restrict in some way the subsequent legislation regarding the complaints tribunal.  I would like to point out that including the phrase in his amendment &ldquo;complaints by the public against members of the Garda Síochána not above the rank of chief superintendent&rdquo; is also restricting legislation which he may bring before us.  If this amendment is passed he is effectively setting guidelines beyond which the Complaints Trubunal Bill will not be able to go.  There is no doubt that if the Minister's amendment is passed as worded, any attempt to ensure that the complaints tribunal will apply to all gardaí up to Commissioner will be ruled out of order or will not be accepted by the Minister because the statement that a complaints procedure will not apply to any member of the Garda above the rank of chief superintendent will be in the Criminal Justice Bill.  In my view there is an inconsistency in the Minister's case in relation to the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in Deputy Woods's amendment.</P>
    <P>According to Garda crime statistics reports the crime rate in the State is declining.  In the Finglas area there is a neighbourhood watch pilot scheme in progress.  The inspector in charge in the Finglas area wrote to me recently indicating that the crime level in that area has fallen and he attributes this in some respects to the operation of the neighbourhood watch scheme.  Taking the <Col N="1441" /> underlying decrease in the rate of crime and the effectiveness of the community neighbourhood watch, it seems that the need for the Criminal Justice Bill has not been proved, that the need for these extraordinary powers which will be given to the Garda has not been proved, and that other more effective methods have not been tried.  For that reason, as I said on numerous occasions, I do not support the Bill although I welcome the efforts the Minister made to soften it and to reduce its impact.</P>
    <P>May I take up one or two points raised by Deputy Tunney relating to our amendment to section 27, which deals with electronic recording in Garda stations?  I want to point out that that provision is in the Bill; we put down our amendment to require that the controversial sections of the Bill would not take effect until the recording procedures had been implemented.</P>
    <P>Section 27 was introduced by the Minister.  It was not some dark plot by The Workers' Party to introduce some extraordinary system of spying on the Garda.  He is drawing an incorrect analogy between a person who voluntarily goes to see a solicitor or a school teacher. That person can walk out of the office at any time.  He cannot be compared with a person who, in present circumstances, is requested to go to a Garda station and who, in many cases, does not know he can walk out at any time.  When this Bill becomes law he will be required to go to the station and spend up to 12 or even 20 hours in it.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Tunney had been in on the debate from the beginning he would be aware there is considerable debate as to the effectiveness of that section.  There is no obligation on the Garda at present to get a professional to represent a person who is held in custody. We had a serious case during the visit of President Reagan when a large number of women were held over two days in <Col N="1442" /> the Bridewell station.  They were refused access in the first instance to a solicitor and charges were subsequently not brought against them.  Protection for the citizen is completely inadequate and recent cases prove that.  The need for the complaints tribunal and for monitoring the treatment of persons in custody does not arise as a result of recent headlines; they simply bring home to everyone that there is a need for protection.</P>
      <P>To refer to the meetings which Deputy Tunney mentioned, there is a demand by people that they be protected.  There is a demand for the tightening up of the licensing laws, there is a demand for the Garda to be able to respond more quickly to calls of distress and there is a demand for dealing with stolen cars.  I understand that aspect has been dealt with by amendment to the Road Traffic Act.  There are all kinds of demands but I think Deputy Tunney will also agree that there is widespread opposition to any form of vigilante-style policing.  This has emerged under the auspices of various Provo groups and also we notice recently from middle-class groups in the Dún Laoghaire area.  There was the extraordinary development where business people were offering themselves as vigilante-type policing.  That is a very regrettable development and any person or political party who has an influence on such groups should urge them to think twice before they go any further in trying to set up an alternative or an auxiliary police force. The consequences of that are frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the restrictions his amendment is placing on the debate we are bound to have on the complaints tribunal by the restriction on ranks only up to the rank of chief superintendent. I ask him also to consider the necessity for regulations under section 27 and section 7.  They are required now irrespective of the demise or otherwise of the Criminal Justice Bill.  It seems to me that with the mounting concern about the Bill it is quite possible it may disappear and land on the Minister's shelves, that a general election may intervene and it may be forgotten.  However, we will still be without regulations governing the <Col N="1443" /> treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations and we will still be without the means to monitor the treatment of such persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>When I dealt with this Bill last week I did not deal with the complaints tribunal.  I wish to know if the tribunal will have statutory powers and the right to subpoena witnesses?  If it will not have such power there is no point in having it at all.</P>
      <P>I have been speaking to some members of the Garda force and they have expressed some grave reservations.  Their anxiety arises because gardaí up to the rank of chief superintendent will be investigated but the commissioner and the assistant commissioners will not be investigated. Who runs the force?  It is the commissioner who looks after the procedures adopted by the force and he is responsible for the members.  I am convinced if the tribunal is not totally independent of the Garda Síochána the people will treat it with contempt and will not have any trust in it.  It will be like other organisations that investigate complaints.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned last week, the gardaí have looked after our affairs very well since the foundation of the State.  There are more than 11,000 members in the Garda Síochána and, like other organisations, there will always be a tiny minority who will not apply the rules or who will go outside the rules.  I should not like it to be taken from anything said in this House that all gardaí are not carrying out their duties in a proper manner.  That is not the case.  A few members of the force may out of loyalty try to cover up for the tiny minority who make errors.  Here is where the tribunal will come into effect. I have some reservations about those electronic devices but that is another matter.  The main point is that the public expect the Garda to perform their duties in a proper and efficient manner.  Far be it from me to criticise the Garda but something is needed to restore public confidence in them and we have a duty in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> There are reservations also in regard to the question of detention.  The Minister will appreciate that after a long period of continuous questioning a person may become confused.  For instance, if I were detained and questioned continuously during a 12-hour period, I might not be sure at the end of that time whether, for instance, I had been in Edenderry on the previous evening or whether I had been at home.  A number of people have brought to my notice their concern in regard to the detention proposals.</P>
    <P>A practice I dislike is that of a case being transferred from one court to another and then, possibly after appearances on four different occasions and over a period of months, a judge will ask why the book of evidence is not on the table.  Then one hears that the charges have been withdrawn by the DPP.  That leaves the person concerned in a very embarrassing position.  I may be departing from the amendment but this is a fundamental matter that I wish to highlight.</P>
    <P>The newly appointed secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, Mr. Murray, has said that at this point the Garda are not equipped to operate the proposed legislation.  This man's views must be taken into consideration. Perhaps we should begin with the question of the training programme for Garda recruits.  A garda who passes out from the training centre at the age of 19 or a little more and who is posted to a big urban area can hardly be said to be trained adequately, after a mere 22 weeks at Templemore, to deal with all the issues involved in this Bill.  Therefore, we need to provide proper training facilities for the Garda and we must do so without delay.</P>
    <P>I trust that when he is replying the Minister will be in a position to assure us on this question of a totally impartial and independent complaints procedure.  Such a procedure must have the confidence of the public if it is to be successful.  As I have said already, it must extent to every officer of the force, from the commissioner down to the man on the beat.</P>
    <P>I might mention in passing that some <Col N="1445" /> people have reservations about another body who investigate themselves also.  I refer to the Incorporated Law Society. Whatever about the validity or otherwise of that concern, it is not one that I wish to become involved in.  The Garda, if they are to be successful in the fight against crime, must have the co-operation of the public.  I want to see the people protected and to see them look on the Garda as the custodians of the law.  I want the people to have the confidence in the Garda that we have had in them since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>It should be made clear that we do not want to come in here and engage in bashing the Garda.  We want to see them do their duty and do it well.  We want an independent tribunal.  It must be a fair one.  If the Government agree to that the people will have confidence in the Garda and in us as legislators and will know that we did the right thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Connolly I disagree with him when he calls for the total exclusion of the Garda from representation on the complaints tribunal.  Last week I asked the Minister to have one seat on that board for the Garda.  There must be a balanced input.  No body has ever been denied representation on a board which was investigating it.  It is only fair that the Garda should have an opportunity to put their case to the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The events in Shercock and Kerry have come at a most inopportune time for the Garda.  They have given grounds to people to knock the Garda.  As Deputies have said the Garda need to know that people have confidence in them.  They need to be supported by the Parliament. I share everyone's concern at the tragic events which occurred but those who were at fault will be brought to justice.  I have no doubt about that.  The Minister said that no one was above the law and that that applied to Deputies.  I do not agree with the decision to exempt chief superintendents or the Commissioner from the scope of the complaints tribunal. If a complaint is made about them it <Col N="1446" /> should be investigated.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the Garda have a representative on the board.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa suggested that the rate of crime was falling.  I dispute that. Last year's figures suggest that only 30 per cent of crime was solved.  It is against that background that the Criminal Justice Bill was introduced.  The need for it was appreciated by Deputy Tunney.  I find that I am more in agreement with his views than those of some members of my party.  That is not to detract from their humanitarian views but many of them are naive and their concern is for a few people who may be ill-treated in a few places. They turn a blind eye to criminal activity.</P>
    <P>The people are crying out for this Bill. There are mounting statistics which show an increase of crime in every area.  Our only growth industry is the security business. That is an indication of widespread criminal activity.  I come from the town of Dundalk which has the highest level of criminal activity outside of Dublin and Limerick.  We suffer from a surplus of cross-Border criminal activity.  Strong measures must be taken to prevent his engulfing the country.  The battle to restore law and order is delicately poised. Unless we have deterrents to criminal activity we will lose that battle.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my call to the Minister to ensure that there is a Garda representative on the tribunal.  I am not asking that they be given a controlling interest but rather a say, so that they can give their side of the story.  I also ask him to make superintendents and the Commissioner subject to the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has gone on for a considerable length of time and has been conducted in a fairly reasonable fashion.  I do not want to introduce any unnecessary rancour into the debate.  I listened as carefully as I could to the speech made by the Minister today and I found his arguments tenuous and unconvincing. The Minister emphasised the adjudication aspects of the complaints tribunal but he skipped over the investigation side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently it is the Government's <Col N="1447" /> intention that the Garda will continue to investigate themselves.  That is the kernel of the problem.  The Minister mentioned that in certain cases the adjudication board will arrange for a complaint to be investigated or will investigate the complaint themselves, but it is obvious from the Minister's statement that such cases will be in the minority.  It is envisaged that in over 90 per cent of cases the Garda will continue to investigate themselves. That is not acceptable to me, or to those on this side of the House, or to many of those on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said this morning that he was somewhat hesitant about accepting the amendment put down by Deputy Woods and adopting the use of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; because to do so would lock him in when he brings in legislation to establish the tribunal.  His argument was that if we introduce an amendment which includes the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; the legislation which will be brought in to establish the tribunal will have to comply with that.  The Minister's argument seems to reduce itself to this: we cannot introduce an amendment which would make the complaints tribunal truly independent because when the legislation is brought in to introduce the complaints tribunal we might decide it should not be independent.  That is absurd.  I thought that on all sides, and including the Minister, we were in agreement with the proposition that the complaints procedure be truly independent and be seen to be independent.  It is not just a matter of giving proper access to people who have complaints; it is a matter of public perception and, as Deputy Connolly and Deputy Woods said, unless this whole procedure is seen to be independent and separate from the Garda, the public perception will be deficient and it will inevitably fail.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument in relation to excluding officers of a certain level from the ambit of the complaints tribunal seems, to a certain extent, to defeat itself. Perhaps I misunderstood the Minister but he seemed to say that it would not be appropriate that those people should be <Col N="1448" /> in the ambit of the complaints procedure because, in effect, they would be investigating themselves.  I agree with that and I find it totally unacceptable that anybody should investigate themselves.  What about the gardaí who are below the level of these officers?  The clear implication of the Minister's amendment is that those people will be investigating themselves. Where is the consistency there?</P>
    <P>We all agree that there is a need for a response to the problem of crime.  However, the response of the Government will not do anything to solve this problem. If you adopt a response which is not going to solve a problem the result is usually neutral.  The result here will not be neutral because we are giving the Garda more powers than they already have. They already have enough powers to investigate crime and we should ensure that they are controlled in the exercise of those powers.  We should also be taking practical steps in the area of Garda training, the provision of technology and resources and Garda deployment which will combat crime.  When the Conroy Commission reported in 1969 the strength of the Garda was 6,500 men. Now, 15 years later, the strength is 11,000 men, but the number of recorded crimes has risen from 26,000 to something between 80,000 and 90,000.  I may not be accurate in regard to those figures but they are near enough to the truth.</P>
    <P>However, in the 15 years since the Conroy Commission reported there has been little or no change in the structures and organisation of the Garda Síochána. We must tackle the crime problem on the ground and I do not think the answer is to give more powers to the Garda.  If the Government feel that more powers should be given to the Garda, the least we are entitled to expect is a proper complaints procedure which will be independent from the point of view of adjudication and investigation and which will be seen by the public to be truly independent of and above the Garda.</P>

      <P>Many of us know the old saying that Nero fiddled while Rome burned, and that applies to the <Col N="1449" /> problem of law and order here and our debating the Criminal Justice Bill and the Minister's amendment.  I want to say &mdash; not for the first time &mdash; that I am wholeheartedly and fully behind the principle of the Criminal Justice Bill.  We are living in abnormal times which call for abnormal legislation.  The Garda have been criticised recently and this Bill has led to some of that criticism together with incidents outside the House involving the Garda which did not reflect too brightly on the force.</P>
      <P>Our Army is second to none in its integrity and our police force is also of a very high standard.  I stand four square behind the Garda.  I should like to ask Deputies who were critical of the Garda what kind of a State would we have today if we removed the Army and the Garda. God knows the State is bad enough, with lawlessness in every sphere of life and activity.  We are not doing a service to the country by being critical of the Army, the Garda or the Incorporated Law Society because in every walk of life there are people who will fall short of the right and proper standards.  If standards are to be investigated by a tribunal to be set up under the Criminal Justice Bill, it means that in a force such as the Garda, where there are so many thousands drawn from every walk of life, you are bound to find misfits.  Some have professional parents, others are farmers, craftsmen and churchmen.  Perhaps some parents are even Members of this House.  Many who qualified come from very poor families. Under the present system of Garda training which is much too short, it is hard to turn out a first class policeman.  Before we consider investigating complaints against members of the force we should turn out gardaí who will not need tribunals to investigate their activities.</P>

From the entry of the recruit into the force he is prepared for active duty to protect life and property.  We hear criticisms of those who are charged with administering the laws we pass.  From time to time we hear that members of the Garda are overstepping the line and not fulfilling the law, that there should be inquiries into this, that and the other.  Their job is to administer the law as this House passes it.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with the question of complaints.  Complaints are made against members of the Garda in relation to the taking of a statement, perhaps the altering of a statement, or perhaps a failure to read a statement.

      <P>I am perfectly well aware of what the Minister said and what we are dealing with.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman and I are approaching this from different directions.  In the investigation of a complaint, who will decide that a complaint is to be referred to a tribunal? Inquiries and investigations should be independent and should appear to be independent.  I agree wholeheartedly with what Deputy McGahon said.  If there is to be an independent investigation it would be wrong to exclude the Garda from participating in such an inquiry.  They should be at the table to give a satisfactory explanation or perhaps fail to give a satisfactory explanation. They should be there to answer charges made against them.  Every member of the force from the latest recruit to the Commissioner should be subject to investigation if a complaint is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> I am not too happy about the publicity which has been given to the Garda in recent times.  It could have been avoided if there were proper procedures for dealing with matters of public concern.  I dealt with this matter elsewhere.  I want to remind the Minister of what was said by myself and Deputy Kelly at another meeting.  Calls have been made by Members of this House for public inquiries and judicial inquiries into the activities of the Garda pending the passage of the Minister's amendment and the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act. Those in authority were not in a position to answer some of the charges made by journalists and by others, including Members of this House.</P>
    <P>What has the office of the Attorney General being doing about some of these problems?  In a matter of 24 to 48 hours information concerning the activities of the Garda could be put in writing by the chief superintendent of every division. This would enable the Minister to reassure the public, the Garda and those who felt a sense of grievance.  This is a very serious matter.  There have been slip-ups in making information available without delay.  This causes publicity and innuendo.</P>
    <P>Articles are supplied deliberately to discredit the Garda, the office of the Minister for Justice and the office of the Commissioner of the Garda.  When such charges are made we are very near to a collapse in society.  The longer we discuss this amendment without reaching positive decisions the more charges of an irresponsible character will be made by those who are anxious to bring ridicule and discredit on the Garda.</P>
    <P>Many people are doing that.  They are being paid to do it and many of them are thriving on it.  They want to cause dissention.  If the House were sincere about ending crime Deputies would say to the Minister, &ldquo;We will give you all the powers you ask for in the name of the Garda.  In relation to charges made against the Garda, set up whatever tribunal you intend to set up, but do not let that hold up the Criminal Justice Bill.&rdquo;<Col N="1452" /> There are criminals at large today simply because the Garda Síochána have not the power to deal with them under the law. We will not give the Garda the power, but will criticise them for not, as we say, doing their job of bringing criminals to justice.  We in this House cannot have it both ways.  Either we give them the power to deal with crime, or we remain silent hereafter.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a tribunal to investigate charges against the Garda will be healthy for the force.  It will strengthen and renew public confidence and trust in that force.  Many feel that public confidence in the Garda Síochána has been shaken, but I do not think so.  We have great respect for those who are labouring under the most difficult conditions, some living in fear of their lives and their families also in fear.  Many gardaí have lost their lives in recent years.  I am perturbed that the vast majority of the Garda Force who are decent people, should be subject to ridicule, just as I was on hearing the unnecessary criticism of the prison officers.  I had to take upon myself to defend them because I know their quality and their standards.  I know the difficult tasks they have to undertake.  If cases have to be investigated against members of the Garda Síochána, it must be remembered that they will amount to a very few and I venture to say that there would be no need for any complaints investigation if the proper system of turning out fully trained and fully fledged police officers were available.  Until the proper system of training is provided, let us in this House be slow to criticise.</P>
    <P>There will be people in the force who will act in an irresponsible manner, but there are sensible people at the head.  We saw that during the week when certain action was taken by the Garda Commissioner in relation to the Shercock case. An effort is being made to clear the Garda force.  It will be above public suspicion. It will have, not 99 per cent but 100 per cent of the confidence of the public. How can we expect the public to have respect for the Garda Síochána when the Members of this House are highly critical of their activities although they do not <Col N="1453" /> give this House evidence for that criticism?</P>
    <P>It is quite true to say that every Dáil Éireann Member is not an angel.  There may be located and discovered from time to time an odd weed in the blooming Oireachtas flower patch.  If we think we are all perfect, we are fooling ourselves. The same applies to the Garda force and to every profession and walk of life.  It is not possible to have 100 per cent perfection. Our aim and that of the Garda Commissioner and of the Minister for Justice is to have as near as possible to 100 per cent perfection in the force.</P>
    <P>On the whole, we have a fine type of person in the Garda Síochána today who will never come under public notice for over-stepping their duties and never have to appear before any complaints tribunal. If there is to be a complaints tribunal, I ask the Minister to ensure, not alone that it appear to be independent but that it be independent.  I do not know what personnel are likely to be charged with the onerous task of investigating complaints against a police officer, but they should know their job.  They should be people of integrity who will have no axe to grind. To set up a complaints tribunal without Garda representation would be tantamount to setting up an unfair structure. I hope that when decisions are being taken by the Department, the Garda will at least have a say and be able to listen and answer.</P>
    <P>I have great confidence in the judicial jury system.  That is because I have great confidence in the commonsense and intelligence of the ordinary, plain, country people.  If charges are to be registered against members of the Garda Síochána, I hope that they will be considered in the presence of members of that force and of their legal representatives.  In that way, wild statements and irresponsible charges which cannot be substantiated will not be made.  It is not right that members should be convicted in their absence.</P>
    <P>In the event of the legal profession having the right to be heard before such a tribunal &mdash; and this should be &mdash; I point out in relation to the Army that as regards <Col N="1454" /> complaints, the investigation of Army law is in much need of overhaul.</P>

      <P>I quite agree.  I wanted to demonstrate, if I might, to the Minister for Justice that military law is long since out of date and should be updated.  It was one of the items with which I was very much concerned as Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>When complaints are made against the Garda Síochána they must defend themselves and be legally and professionally represented to uphold their good name. If they cannot do that, there is every justification for a reprimand and complete removal from the force.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I must pay a very special tribute to the various Garda commissioners down through the years. Sometimes their work was appreciated and at other times it was not appreciated.  I remember the time of Colonel Broy, the late General O'Duffy, the late Mr. Dan Costigan, who was a civil servant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy, I appreciate your tribute to former Garda Commissioners, but I would like to bring you back to the Seanad amendment, the Minister's amendment to the amendment and Deputy Wood's amendment to the amendment.  It is a very confined debate. I would be very grateful if you would co-operate with the Chair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, certainly. In view of that I ask that the Minister give his fullest consideration to the views expressed by Members of this House, always bearing in mind that his job as Minister and our job as legislators is to stand by the Garda, to uphold them in every way in the exercise of their duty of implementing fully the laws passed by this House.  I feel very sorry for the vast majority of the decent men serving with the force whose reputation is tainted by the activities of those who may have acted <Col N="1455" /> irresponsibly.  The Minister for Justice and every Member of this House has a duty to make every effort, if we feel there is a lack of confidence in the Garda, to restore that confidence.  We have a duty to the public also to do that.  I do not believe that there is any great lack of confidence in the Garda among the public, because if the public are in trouble they have nobody but the Garda to turn to.  That is why I feel that we are expressing the opinion of the general public who, if the activities of the Garda are to be investigated, would like the investigation to be impartial and fair.  In return the public would wish to have fair and just administration of the law by the Garda, who are charged with protecting and safeguarding the lives of citizens and their property.  While we have them to do that job we should uphold them in every way possible.  Some of the debates in this House on the Criminal Justice Bill have fallen short of giving the Garda the encouragement they are entitled to in the very difficult times in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at great length on this, but it appals me to listen to some of the remarks criticising the Garda Síochána and expressing no appreciation for the service which many members of the force have given this nation since its foundation.  Indeed, it was once the pride of Irishmen that we had an unarmed civil police force set up during the time of the Civil War.  All of us, not alone members of one party but of all parties, should have pride in the history of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I support what the Minister has proposed, my gut reaction is that I am against any judicial inquiry or body outside the Garda to investigate the Garda. It is like saying that people should not investigate people.  If anything happens in the teaching profession, teachers investigate teachers.  If something happens regarding a bus driver in CIE, it is bus drivers who investigate the matter. Civil servants investigate civil servants. The people who protect us when in trouble, the lawyers, are investigated by <Col N="1456" /> lawyers.  However, the people who are saddled with the responsibility of investigating crime are told by the Parliament of this nation: &ldquo;You are not competent, you are not capable of investigating your own affairs.&rdquo;  The situation is ludicrous, and I do not know how we ever got into this discussion.</P>
    <P>The Minister of Government in charge of the Garda Síochána, no matter whether it is the present Minister or any other Minister, should have sufficient confidence in the Commissioner of the Garda to ensure that if he wants to find out what happened in any Garda station in the Republic he should know within 24 hours and not later than 72 hours afterwards.  That would be quite possible if the structures of the Garda were such as to allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>At one time when the Minister rang the Commissioner's office and said that something had happened in a certain Garda area, that he wanted to know what happened and he wanted a report on his desk in a certain number of hours, that was done, because the Commissioner knew that through his command structure he could find out exactly what had happened.  That was because the sergeant in charge of the Garda barracks knew the personalities of the gardaí under his command.  He knew the person who had a personality difficulty.  He knew the people in whom he had total confidence and those about whom he had certain doubts.  He could recognise the weaknesses and human failings &mdash; failings we all have &mdash; of any garda under his command. If that sergeant was allowed to continue to do that in that way under that structure then the problems existing in the Garda force at the moment would not exist.</P>
    <P>What has happened in the Garda force in the last ten years?  The dogs in the street know that if you attempt to establish discipline in the Garda the Fianna Fáil Party let it be known that if they were back in power you would be sacked. That is a total vote of no confidence in the Commissioner of the Garda.  Unless you have a Commissioner whom you can <Col N="1457" /> leave in charge of the Garda without political interference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am making the point that if the authority structures within the Garda were respected and interference with them by politicians was stopped and the gardaí were allowed to go on ruling the Garda, we would not have this debate in the House and we would have far more confidence in the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Let us take the example of my own constituency.  I do not know what happened in Kerry and Cavan, and I do not particularly want to know.  Of course, I will want to know all about those incidents later, but for the purpose of this debate I do not refer to it.  However, I know what happens in County Donegal. I have been a Member of this Parliament for 23 years and we have had almost as many chief superintendents in the division of County Donegal as I have seen years of service in this Parliament.  Let me put on record that I have personal knowledge of the service some of those chief superintendents gave during the troubled times in the Border areas, and in no way can I cast reflections on the service they gave; rather is the reverse the case.  I can praise them immensely for their dedication to duty and the courage with which they carried it out.  They are at the distinct disadvantage of not being left long enough in County Donegal to know the superintendents, inspectors, sergeants and particularly, the gardaí under them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> The Minister should discontinue this type of service.  A person appointed chief superintendent of a Garda division should be a person who wants to stay in that division.  There are many good officers in Donegal eligible for such appointments and the Minister should consider them.  If that procedure was followed then a Minister for Justice would say to the Commissioner that he should find out what happened in a district and the chief superintendent of that district would soon know how to get the information. We should adopt that method without spending fortunes that we cannot afford, spending money that should be devoted to more worthy projects such as building houses or creating jobs.  What is happening at present is that the money is being given to lawyers to work out how and what did not happen.</P>
    <P>We have heard lawyers expounding the theory of good law, the purification of law, but what happens if a garda goes to a solicitor's office saying he has a problem? The advice he will get will be to shut up and not to say anything.  We are all aware that if we go to a solicitor's office to talk about problems we are told, &ldquo;Keep quiet about that&rdquo;.  On the other hand we have lawyers telling us that gardaí are not capable of investigating themselves, that people who have risen through the ranks of the Garda Síochána, have given dedicated service to the State, won the confidence of the community and have unstained records are not capable of investigating simple or serious faults within the Garda structure.  Members of the House are casting aspersions on gardaí in that regard.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the type of inquiry that is set up or the person put in charge of it a garda in trouble who seeks the opinion of a solicitor will be advised to keep quiet. How will any inquiry establish the facts if the advice given to the person in trouble or who may want to protect himself is to keep quiet?  It is the constitutional right of any person to protect himself.  The reason we have this problem at present is because there has been far too much political interference in the running of the Garda Síochána.  One case that sticks <Col N="1459" /> out like a sore thumb is that of former Commissioner Edmund Garvey.  Let nobody question a man who joined the force as an ordinary rookie and rose through the ranks to become Commissioner. Such a person must have talent and displayed some ability to be promoted to the highest rank.  His successor, Commissioner Patrick McLaughlin, had talent also but the same thing happened to him due to political interference.  We sit here in judgment as politicians and point the finger at the Garda and say that it is not in this House the mistakes are occurring but at Garda headquarters, at all levels of the Garda right down to the ordinary member in rural stations.  The trouble is that as legislators we have been too tempted to get our friends into the force.  One party has been more responsible for this bad conduct than others.  If there is a weakness it is that people have got into the Garda Síochána who should not be in it.  The body that represents gardaí, and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have on a number of occasions admitted this.  That ball comes back to the desks of the politicians.</P>
    <P>I must put it on record that if I walk the streets of Dublin at night it is not gardaí I am afraid of but the people the gardaí are trying to protect me from. Members seem to have lost sight of that. Some Members pleaded that the gardaí should not lean too heavily on those who smash the windscreens of cars or break into houses and beat up old people. Human nature being what it is, no matter what laws we bring in to control the force, no matter what regulations are introduced in regard to recruiting, if a garda in pursuit of his duty is confronted with a problem he will react in a human manner.  I am not condoning what a garda may do but it is important to point out that it will happen in spite of all the laws we bring in or the judicial bodies we establish to inquire into misbehaviour by members of the force.  We have to live with that.  While walking the streets of this or any other city it is not gardaí we are afraid of although from some of the <Col N="1460" /> statements made in the House it appears that that is the case.</P>
    <P>I do not have any problem in supporting the Minister's amendment but in view of the bad publicity the Garda Síochána have been getting in recent weeks it is time somebody said something in their defence.  I have not spoken in the House too often recently but I must put it on record that I have total confidence in the force.  That does not mean to say that all gardaí are white haired boys who do not make mistakes.  However, if a garda makes a mistake the structure of the force should be such as to have means of finding out what went wrong and the reason for it.  There should not be a major discussion in the House on this.  We should put it on record that we have total confidence in the majority of the force.  If one or two members have gone astray we must remember that in all groups one or two go astray, including Members elected to this House.  I have contributed to this debate for fear that by keeping quiet it would be taken that I condone the criticism levelled at the force by Members, particularly a Member from my constituency. I must stress clearly that I have absolute confidence in the Commissioner and in the structures he has control of as I had in the former Commissioners, Patrick McLaughlin and Edmund Garvey.  If you do not have confidence in the Garda Commissioner, then you sack him &mdash; but not for the reasons that Fianna Fáil removed Edmund Garvey and not for the reasons that forced Paddy McLaughlin to retire prematurely. Rather you sack him when you know that he is incompetent.  I do not think that either Edmund Garvey or Paddy McLaughlin was incompetent.  They were both removed from Office through nothing other than pure, blatant, political interference.</P>

      <P>If I have, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I beg your indulgence but I <Col N="1461" /> rather question that.  I am merely saying that had we recognised the need to have a proper structure in the Garda Síochána, had we stopped interfering politically in the running of the police force, had we allowed their commissioner and the officers under his command to run the force, then we would not now be talking as we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to some of the points made by Deputies Harte and O. J. Flanagan, I should say that the House has expressed many times in the course of the debate on this Bill its support for the Garda Síochána and their work.</P>
      <P>The point of the proposed independent complaints tribunal about which we are talking here &mdash; and the safeguards to accompany the extended powers to be given the Garda &mdash; is to meet many of the objections raised by Deputy Harte. If there is established an independent complaints commission, through which complaints can be processed, then there will be no need for the kind of political interference about which Deputy Harte speaks.  When I spoke earlier I said that some of the many allegations and innuendoes made in the past could be dealt with through an independent complaints procedure and put to rest there and then.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister and most Members of the House recognise the importance of having a proper, suitable complaints procedure established.  There may be some differences of opinion but, as the Minister has said, points of view have come closer.  However, there still remain some differences of opinion as to how such a complaints commission could best operate.  Our attempts in this House have been to forget about the past, to put it behind us and say: with our experience in the past in what way should we shape the future?  How do we now design structures that will minimise these allegations in the future and deal with them effectively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We dealt earlier in the day with the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill.  It should be remembered that many people were very much afraid of the appointment of an Ombudsman for a long time. <Col N="1462" /> Many politicians, civil servants, even Ministers shied away from the thought of an Ombudsman prying into the affairs of a Department, saying: was the Secretary of the Department not a man in whom we all had confidence, were not civil servants people in whom we all had confidence? Of course they were but that did not take from the fact that, not alone here but in other countries also, there is such an appointee.  His appointment, forming part of our public administration, can ensure that people with grievances, whether or not well founded, will have redress to an independent process through which such grievances can rightly be seen to be dealt with and dealt with effectively.  We know from experiences elsewhere with regard to ombudsmen that that process generally throws up fairly substantial numbers of inquiries that have no great foundation and a small number that do have foundation, which should be dug out and dealt with.  In so doing it will be seen that the system is healthier and better founded for the future.</P>
    <P>A parallel can be drawn between that and this situation in regard to the Garda Síochána in which we want to provide an independent complaints procedure.  The amendment we have put down says that it will be independent; we are not afraid of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;; we want its insertion.  I ask: why does Deputy Harte not want the insertion of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;? The present difference between the Minister and those of us on this side of the House is that he does not want to write in the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;. If I turned round Deputy Harte's argument I could say all of what he has said from this side of the House and contend: therefore, let us have an independent commission free from political or any other kind of interference.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte referred to past events. There is no point in our now going into such events in any detail but they indicate the need to have a truly independent complaints procedure to which all political parties can turn in the event of allegations being made.  I would be somewhat <Col N="1463" /> concerned about the type of behind-the-scenes picture Deputy Harte painted, that of telephone calls &mdash; that I will be in touch with this body, that the Minister will be in touch with somebody else and we will get it all sorted out.  We have been endeavouring to assert the independence of the Garda and their operations in this House in the course of the whole of this debate which also underlines the importance of having such a complaints procedure independent not alone in regard to those members of the public who lodge complaints but also in regard to safeguarding the Garda themselves.  It must be guaranteed also that, with the regulations provided for in this section, the Garda will be safeguarded from complaints or the kinds of abuse to which they may be subjected.</P>
    <P>Shortly we will reach the stage when we will be voting on this issue.  One matter that concerns me is the fact that in the Minister's amendment we are now building in an exclusion of the ranks above chief superintendent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are not.  We are building in an inclusion up to that rank; there is no exclusion.  I said I would take the Deputy's views into account, that I would think about them and talk to the Government about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough, I accept the Minister's point, that he will not be totally tied, that the sections will not be implemented until such time as the proposed complaints procedure is established, that at this point the Minister is only giving an undertaking in regard to the ranks up to that of chief superintendent, that he still retains the freedom subsequently to examine that position and come back later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our position is that we want the principle of independence built in at this point.  As some other Deputies have said, the instructions emanate from the top and I shall not go into detail on that at this stage.  I think it is sufficiently clear that instructions emanate from the top. <Col N="1464" /> The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to examine that situation and I accept his assurance in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the request by the Garda to defer the implementation of the Bill until their training is brought up to a certain standard.  Perhaps he would comment on that.</P>

I simply wanted to put that on the record of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I shall revert to where I began.  The amendment has come from the Seanad.  I have strengthened that Seanad amendment to absolutely assure this House now, by means of amendment of the Bill, that certain of its provisions cannot become law until we do two things: pass a complaints procedure and endorse or approve regulations, and then I can make such regulations. That is the purpose of the amendment. Its purpose is not to give the detail of the particular complaints procedure to which this House will give its approval.  I have found the debate very helpful.  As I said this morning, certain proposals are being drafted along certain lines where the Government have made decisions in principle. When that draft is completed it must go back to Government for final decision and it is useful to me as Minister to have had such a strong input from the House so that I can see the kind of approach Deputies are taking and the kind of consensus that is emerging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods in his position as spokesman is giving the reasoned views of the Opposition.  There are two points of difference between us.  I have no difficulty with the commission directing investigations.  Deputy Woods says he has been advised that there is no problem about using the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; but I have been advised to the contrary.  I am <Col N="1465" /> talking not about the concept of independence but rather the use of the word in the amendment.  Deputy Woods outlined his idea of what independence was and gave a very broad definition.  I could not quarrel with his definition of independence in relation to the new complaints body.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect on which our views differ.  I have said that the complaints tribunal will deal with complaints made against members of the Garda up to and including the rank of chief superintendent. The people being excluded are a handful of people of more senior rank &mdash; Commissioner, Deputy Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners, I have also said that I had reasons for this and I was indicating that since the Commissioner is chief disciplinary officer of the force there would have to be some input in the adjudication aspect by the Garda Síochána themselves.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to the views expressed by Deputies on all sides of the House and I will evaluate the situation again.  When we come back with the Bill Deputies will be free to move amendments if they are not happy with it.  There is no question of the amendment excluding the right of the House to extend this procedure to any rank in the Garda Síochána.  In the amendment we have a commitment that the complaints procedure cover all ranks from gardaí in training in Templemore to chief superintendents.  It is still open to the House to debate that subsequently when the Bill is before it.</P>
    <P>There is a very large measure of agreement between what I am saying and what the spokesman for the Opposition is saying.  The main purpose of the amendment is to make sure that these things become law before certain sections of the Bill can come into operation and we have made a lot of progress.  I presume Deputy <Col N="1466" /> Woods is pushing his amendment to a vote.  I do not think it is necessary but I suppose we have to vote here as well as doing a lot of other things.</P>
    <P>The Ó Briain report was published in 1978.  I should be glad if many of the recommendations of the report had been implemented by statutory regulation and I can assure the House that I will be drawing heavily not only on the existing internal Garda code but also on the Ó Briain report in drafting the new regulations on the treatment of persons in custody.  Members will see the effect of that when I come back to the House with those regulations.</P>
    <P>We cannot amend the Criminal Justice Bill because it has passed through both Houses but there is no backing off by me from the commitments given during the debate.  I hope that when the House agrees to the amendment from the Seanad we will move on very quickly in this session to have a full debate on the complaints procedure with the actual text of a Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Many points were made by Deputies who contributed to this debate and, while they were interesting, many of them were not particularly <i>ad rem.</i>  A couple of specific requests were made about information on various matters.  Deputy Woods talked about a prisoner in Mountjoy.  I will take up those points and communicate individually with the Deputies who raised them.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand down to and including `investigation&rdquo;'.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That, pursuant to Standing Order 47, Dáil Éireann hereby rescinds its Resolution of 18th October, 1984 approving the policies set out in the document <i>Building on Reality</i> and in view of the mounting evidence that it is based on unreliable statistics and false assumptions and has been rejected by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, calls on the Government to withdraw the document and to prepare a credible plan for economic development based on accurate figures and realistic forecasts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Deputy Lenihan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I referred to the statistics section of the motion and also to the contents of the ICTU document, <i>The Jobs Crisis,</i> which was published in September before the publication of the plan indicating disappointment that the Minister for Finance had not dealt with farmer's capital tax or the problem of pay, especially in regard to the public service.</P>
      <P>I should now like to refer to the assumption that the services sector will automatically grow in the period under review.  Congress is right when it rejects the idea that there will be growth in the services sector if the industrial sector is allowed to stagnate.  Because the services sector is huge in the United States, this does not mean that in an industrially under-developed country like Ireland the same will happen &mdash; and Congress points this out &mdash; if we neglect industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> I am going to repeat for the umpteenth time that the ESRI Report, Employment and Unemployment Policy for Ireland, 1984, edited by Conniffe and Kennedy has not received the attention in this House or from the Government which it deserves.  It claims and justifies its claim to be not merely descriptive and analytical but prescriptive as well.  The philosophy which underlies it is sounder than that which underlies the plan.  I see the Minister for Labour here and I guess that he would subscribe to the philosophy behind the ESRI report but that he was beaten in Cabinet on that philisophy because the one that underlies the national plan is not one to which any sensible person could subscribe.  This study would not go along with the objectives of the White Paper on Industrial Development which I mentioned yesterday and which said that the emphasis for the future would be on output rather than on employment.  There is an indication that if output was substantially increased, increased employment would follow. There is no law of logic which indicates that that would inevitably happen and the ICTU have stated that they do not believe that could happen.</P>
    <P>This report takes cognisance of the fact that there is and will be more women in the workforce as this century progresses. It examines the changing age structure of the workforce.  Above all, it points to the evil of unemployment, not merely to the evil itself but to its cost which is referred to occasionally but seldom worked out, not merely the cost to the Exchequer on unemployment assistance, but the cost to the Government in loss of revenue, for example, in the loss of PRSI contributions per week and in the loss of indirect taxation which the employed person pays in the purchase of goods.  It even puts in a modicum of costs for the results of the social evil of unemployment such as vandalism.</P>
    <P>We called for the withdrawal of the national plan and the substitution of something worthwhile and positive and there is an obligation on us to indicate what we think can be done.  The report <Col N="1474" /> indicates that from studying the demographic scene in Europe, it is apparent that the number of young people available for work with various degrees of skill in the EEC as a whole will decrease.  The authors think that this will give young Irish people an opportunity.  I presume they mean that industries will be set up in Ireland and that we will be able to attract them here because we have a young, well educated work-force.</P>
    <P>References were made to emigration and the plan posits 7,000 to 8,000 emigrants per annum but the actual figure seems to be around 13,000.  I do not know if we have a solid statistic in that regard. This is linked with the growth in the labour force.  The plan says that annual growth will be in the order of 15,000 but this brings us into the area of flimsy figures.  The White Paper on Industrial Policy indicates that the growth in the labour force will be in the order of 17,000. It is interesting to look at the report of Conniffe and Kennedy of the ESRI in that regard.  They advance three possibilities in regard to emigration.  The first envisages about 10,000 a year, the second says there will be practically none in the first five years and the third envisages an increase of about 1,500 from 1986 to 1991.  According to the ESRI, two of the years covered by the national plan are 1986 and 1987 and, depending on which emigration statistic you adopt, for those two years you will either have a 15.8 per cent, a 20.4 per cent or a 23.6 per cent increase in the labour force.  I am wondering if the figures were studied carefully and whether the Government used them honestly in forming this plan.</P>
    <P>From chapter 10 to chapter 17 in that study of employment and unemployment by the ESRI, there are positive suggestions as to what could be done to revive our economy and to increase employment. Their emphasis is on increasing productive employment and not on increasing output from the manufacturing industry.  I cannot go through all our resources, energy, agriculture, building construction and the manufacturing industry.  In the United States seven out often people are employed in the services <Col N="1475" /> industry.  We will not be able to provide large numbers of jobs in the services sector in this country unless we develop a manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The public service employment problem is an important one.  There are various aspects of it which need discussion. I will leave that aside.  I want to say how disappointed I am that there is nothing in the plan in ease of the PAYE worker.  One inevitable result of this is the brain drain.  Young graduates in electronics, some of them with very high qualifications, are emigrating to the United States and elsewhere.  Young men with degrees, diplomas and certificates in agriculture are taking to the emigrant ship. Even when a job is available, the burden of PAYE tax and PRSI is frightening people into emigration.</P>
    <P>I recall that Sydney Smith at the beginning of the 19th century said:</P>
    <P>The schoolboy whips his taxed top &mdash; the beardless youth manages his taxed horse, with a taxed bridle, on a taxed road;&mdash;and the dying Englishman, pouring his medicine, which has paid seven per cent, into a spoon that has paid fifteen per cent&mdash;flings himself back upon his chintz bed, which has paid twenty-two per cent&mdash;and expires in the arms of an apothecary who has paid a licence of a hundred pounds for the privilege of putting him to death.</P>
    <P>Translated to 1984 in the reign of a Government who promised tax reductions that would read: the young citizen buys his first car on which he pays 25 per cent excise, and 23 per cent VAT, fills it with petrol&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The spoon he uses will have paid 35 per cent tax.  I do not want him <Col N="1476" /> to go, but I understand what he is doing. Do the Government understand or care?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I did not hear the contribution Deputy Wilson made yesterday evening.  I would like to enter into a debate which would educate not just both sides of this House but also the country on the realities which confront all of us. As a young person who has not decided to flee this country, who has put down roots and who intends to stay, I recognise that, of all the races of Irish people who have lived on this island &mdash; and there have been about 150 from the time history first records early settlements in the Deputy's province of Ulster and the province of the Ceann Comhairle around the shores of Lough Neagh &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>6,000 BC, to be precise. Of all the generations who have lived in this land since that time, this generation of Irish people are the best fed, the best educated, the best housed and the best trained.  In economic terms they are outperforming any previous generation.  We now have a short-term difficulty.  We must recognise that it is there, and we will not solve any problem by saying who was directly responsible for it.  That would not redress the needs of young people, or elderly people, or middle-aged people.</P>
      <P>As politicians we have to speak the truth, initially to ourselves and secondly to the public.  The public are becoming extremely cynical about politicians promising what they think the public want to hear while in reality the public know that those promises cannot be delivered, however attractive they may be individually. We owe that to the democratic political process to which we are all committed and which regrettably is still at risk in our society and on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is a second run, so to speak, on the national plan which was <Col N="1477" /> debated at considerable length.  The debate is confined to a claim by Fianna Fáil that certain facts and figures in relation to the statistics have emerged since the publication of the plan, and since the substantial debate on it in the House, which would totally invalidate the premises and the assumptions &mdash; and some of them have to be assumptions since we are talking about 1987 &mdash; and that somehow these assumptions are wrong or have been wrongly assembled by the Government in order to minimise the case.</P>
    <P>I would have thought any Government, and particularly this Government, a coalition of two separate political parties, who came forward with a plan and indicated that after three years of hardship and difficulty in some cases we will still have an unacceptably high level of unemployment, could hardly be accused of trying to cook the figures.  If we wanted to cook the figures &mdash; and that is the assertion in this debate &mdash; we could have been a little better at cooking them than to say that at the end of three years, despite all the efforts and despite harnessing the taxpayers' money and the enthusiasm of young people, we would have that kind of output at the end.  If we wanted to cook the figures we could have done so a little better than that.  We published a plan that says to everybody: &ldquo;The situation is bad, but it is not disastrous.  It is difficult, but we can overcome it.  In large part it is of our own making, but we can unmake it.&rdquo;  The figures are there and the assumptions upon which the rest of the edifice of the plan rests are there for people to see.  As the Taoiseach said at the launching of the plan in Iveagh House, and as other Ministers have said, we have taken the best assumptions which were available to us and we have given the sources.  If people can show that the economic experts of the OECD are wrong, we will change them.  If they can prove that the economists in the European Community are wrong, and show us where and how, we can change them. If we are wrong on the pessimistic side this will be a bonus at the end of the three year period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> The basis of the Opposition's argument yesterday and tonight was that somehow or other the statistics upon which this plan rests are wrong, inaccurate or mispresented, to use that euphemistic phrase.  It is up to Fianna Fáil to show up precisely where.  If we have been too pessimistic, nobody will be happier than myself if somebody can tell us that our estimates of world trade increase and growth or GNP growth were too low and should be higher.  If they are higher the unemployment figures will be lower and that will be a bonus for everyone on this island.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson referred to the philosophy which underpins the document published by the ESRI and asked whether I would not be more in sympathy with that philosophy than the one which permeates this document.  This is the product of two parties with separate traditions and separate philosophies in Government.  I am not happy with the philosophy.  I never made any secret of that.  We have 9 per cent of the vote and 16 seats in this House and a mandate from our party to participate in Government on an agreed joint programme.  I am not responsible and the Labour Party are not responsible for the fact that 90 per cent of the electorate of this democratic society in free elections voted for two parties espousing separate philosophies.  That is their perfect democratic right.</P>
    <P>I want to say something to the largest party in the land, the Fianna Fáil Party, who are part of that conservative 90 per cent.  In every country with a mixed economy where capitalist parties rule, despite the enormous success they had in creating wealth in pushing forward the frontiers of science and all the other marvellous things which have been done in those large countries, the one thing that they have never done, even in the most successful prolonged periods of growth in countries like the United States, West Germany and Britain, is to eliminate unemployment.</P>
    <P>Let us be consistent and rational and, at the invitation of Deputy Wilson, let us look at the philosophy.  It seems that Fianna Fáil in their conservatism refused <Col N="1479" /> to adopt radical socialist measures.  The Irish electorate, as is their right, have not voted for parties that propose such measures.  Yet, that electorate want the conservative party, on this island with a weak economy, to produce full employment while the US, France, Germany and Britain over very many years have never solved that problem.  That is the philosophical response I would give to Deputy Wilson in relation to that issue.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, we have lived with unemployment in our society for a long time. What is acute now, not just here but throughout the whole of the EC, is the traumatic increase in the level of unemployment in every part of the European Communities.  Politicians in a democratic society have an obligation to provide leadership and education to a public that want to listen, not to the slogans trotted out at election time, with the paper hats and pop tunes with which they are festooned, but to what we think is actually happening because we are elected by them to try to provide leadership.  We should start by trading in facts rather than myths.  It is traumatic to have people in one's family suddenly lose their livelihood and have their skills for a lifetime eliminated overnight by a microchip.  It is necessary for us not to curse the darkness but to try to explain what has happened and show ways in which we can counteract it and ameliorate the journey from where we are now to where we all want to be as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record of the House some broad historic facts.  Today the United States, the wealthiest democracy in the world, is celebrating its expression of democratic choice. Approximately 120 years ago, 40 per cent of the then population of that country were engaged in the primary production of agriculture, working on the farm in Oklahoma, New England and right across the board to the opening-up land of California.  Today, less than 3 to 5 per cent of an enlarged population are currently engaged in agricultural output. They are producing too much, far more than was ever produced 120 years ago. <Col N="1480" /> What happened to the other 25 per cent of that growing population?  They moved in most cases into manufacturing employment because the first industrial revolution which brought about factories and industries in different parts of the United States absorbed that employment.  The percentage of manufacturing employment out of the total of all employment in the United States was at its highest in 1950 to 1952.  That was the peak in terms of young people having jobs in factories. From that time it has been declining and that pattern can be repeated in countries similar to the United States, like Britain, France, Germany and indeed Ireland.</P>
    <P>While we are producing more from our factories than ever before, we are doing it with fewer people.  We are doing it more efficiently and competitively, but with fewer people.  Everybody in the working line knows this.  We are, however, doing it very successfully in terms of output.  It may come as a surprise to most Members of this House tonight that the Irish workers, men and women, are producing two and a half times more and exporting two and a half times more per worker than their counterparts in the UK economy.  We have in many respects a healthy manufacturing base producing more than we have ever produced but with fewer people.  That is a fact.  It is not a very acceptable fact, but anybody who talks to industrialists or anybody in the trade union movement who talks to companies rationalising and bringing in new processes and new systems of extracting more value out of the productive process in which they are engaged knows very well that more can be produced with less in this instance.  Every time you bring in a word processor, a forklift truck, or some kind of automated system that enables you to sell more goods abroad, one of the consequences seems to be fewer people needed in that enterprise.</P>
    <P>About three years ago throughout the EC &mdash; and it is a very rich part of the entire globe &mdash; approximately 6½ million European citizens were unemployed.  Of that number, approximately 100,000 were Irish citizens.  Today that figure has doubled, not just in this country but <Col N="1481" /> throughout the whole of the EC &mdash; 12.4 million at best estimate, and I use that phrase because our statistics, as Deputy Wilson indicated in his contribution, are inadequate.  We do not know for sure and where and for how long, but we do know that it is at least twice what it was before. It is happening in countries like Germany, the UK and France.  Germany and the UK, on the one hand, and France on the other have applied radically different economic policies to combat the same phenomenon, but both economies and Governments &mdash; and certainly the public in those economies &mdash; would concede that, whatever else they have done, they have not dealt with the problem of how to reduce unemployment.</P>
    <P>What can we in this country do against such a background?  The first thing we have to do is to be in a position where the resources of the State can be used to provide productive employment, where the taxpayer's money that Deputy Wilson referred to can actually be channelled into processes, factories and services &mdash; any kind of economic activity that will generate wealth and thus generate jobs. That is what Fine Gael and the Labour Party want to do and I know that is what Fianna Fáil want to do.</P>
    <P>Already, the net effect of previous policy decisions by previous administrations &mdash; and I am not going to be partisan in this debate because there have been different administrations over the last three to five years &mdash; has been to borrow so much money abroad that now requires to be repaid that by the time it is taken, and taken very painfully, from everybody &mdash; TDs, Senators, staff of the Oireachtas, civil servants and every other worker paying tax &mdash; by the time some of the moneys due have been repaid, we do not have the freedom for action that we all would like.  That is a reality, too. It is not a very pleasant reality and is one that I would love to be able to wave away. However, as a society we have been paying ourselves, in global terms, more than we have been earning and have had to borrow to close the gap.  Everybody in this room tonight knows that some day that kind of policy results in the bank <Col N="1482" /> manager, money lender or debt collector saying that enough is enough.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House, and in particular the Fianna Fáil Party, to cast their minds back to December 1982 when this Government came into office.  At that time, that Government were attempting to address themselves to major problems of which everybody was aware, so much so that we were then contemplating the formation of the third Government within the space of 18 months unprecedented in the history of this independent State.  A little speech was made by the outgoing Minister for Finance &mdash; or rather he was then ex-Minister for Finance &mdash; before the Government in effect got going fully.  I refer to Deputy Mac Sharry.  He said that, irrespective of who was going to be Minister for Finance, the incoming Government were going to find it extremely difficult to borrow minimal sums of money from the international money markets to keep Ireland going and pay for salaries, grants, the provision of schools and all the other necessities because of the way the international market for money was and many countries much richer than ours had got themselves into major difficulties in relation to borrowing.  That is a reality.  We did not invent that.  Deputy MacSharry from his traumatic experience of being Minister for Finance was painfully aware of it. He knew that that reality constrained severely the freedom for manoeuvre that any administration would have in trying to organise their affairs and deal with the evil of unemployment, an evil the description of which I will share with Deputy Burke and Deputy Wilson.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have a marvellous reputation for playing with words and for mixing myth, fantasy, and mysticism on occasion, to the delight of our tourists. We do it fairly well.  The tragedy is that too many people who practise the art of politics brought those unique skills into the mainstream of economic debate and would like to think that somehow or other the same kind of magic that beguiles our foreign tourists should be used to beguile the taxpayers and the banking institutions of this economy and outside.  This <Col N="1483" /> Government confronted that problem that has afflicted too many administrations for too long, and we say that these are the facts, the realities.  They are very unpleasant, painful realities which perhaps should not exist, but they exist because of decisions which were taken in the past and we are going to confront them.  They have been made more difficult by decisions taken by Irish people in the past and now they can be turned around.  That is what the document <i>Building on Reality</i> is about.  That is why the very title is stitched in to the third word of that document.</P>
    <P>What does it say?  It says to the taxpayer, &ldquo;We know you have been crucified over the last three to five years and that is going to end.  We know you have had a rough time.&rdquo;  The biggest peaceful demonstration that the streets of Dublin ever saw &mdash; leave aside 1916, 1918, 1921 and 1922 &mdash; was the taxpayers' march in 1979. Deputy Burke was in Government at the time.  No doubt he recalls it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have said to that category, the PAYE workers who have carried the burden for too long, that it is not going to get any worse.  That is a promise and we would like to be able to say more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Too many Governments invoked the wand of mysticism to say that it would go away and, what happened? The PAYE worker was paying more and more.  Based on the realities that we have had the courage to publish, we can say in all honesty that it is not going to get worse and it is in all probability going to get better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does the document say in relation to that section of the community who have failed consistently to make an adequate contribution to the tax load of this community and have at the same time benefited disproportionately from <Col N="1484" /> the social infrastructure provided by taxpayers' money?  I refer to the farming community, and in no disparaging way.  We are saying that there will be a land tax, that it will take a certain form, that it will not confuse and complicate many farm holdings with unnecessary paper and form-keeping which resulted frequently in many farmers paying more fees to accountants in an effort to sort out their tax affairs than they paid to the Revenue Commissioners in the form of tax.  All through the summer it was claimed that the Government would not bring in such a tax, that the Government were incapable of doing so because of the political realities out there beyond this House. As with the unpalatable economic facts which we have inherited and confronted, we have confronted that political reality also, and there will be a land tax.  It will be double what the farmers are paying at the moment and it probably will be more efficiently collected than any other form of tax.  Deputy Burke will recall from his experience in local government that the success rate of local government tax collection under the traditional structure was about 97 or 98 per cent.  The money collected at local level will stay at local level.  Some people claim that this is only farmers' rates under another label, and should the farmers not pay rates anyway? That is not the case because of the successive limits to the threshold below which farmers did not have to pay rates. What came through in the Book of Estimates as farming rates was a grant paid from central Government with PAYE workers' tax money appearing in the form of farmers' rates.</P>
    <P>Many other things are costed, described and put into the plan in facts and figures spanning over three years.  Many of them are not too pleasant.  Many are things which must and will be done and many of them are infinitely better than they would otherwise have been if we had allowed the situation to drift as it was drifting.  We had three Governments in 18 months.  Talk to anybody in the economic commentary area or any of the senior civil servants who try to get any <Col N="1485" /> legislative programme through or anybody who is looking for a decision from Government and ask them what it was like to be waiting for some kind of concrete decision during that 18 months when we did not know from day to day or hour to hour whether we were going to have a Government or a Minister.  That is no way to run a country, and that is how we were trying to run a country for 18 months.  We have confronted that reality and we have published the painful but essential facts and figures in that document.  I believe that they are accurate and the best available facts and figures that we can get.  In some cases it would be preferable if they were more accurate, but that is a reflection on our own system of gathering statistics.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I turn to a theme I have spoken about previously here and at length in the European Parliament in my capcity as President of the Council of Social Affairs Ministers.  I have described the way in which unemployment has doubled traumatically over the last two or three years in countries and economies that never previously experienced that kind of phenomena, for reasons totally outside the control of the worker in the work place, the manager in the office or the local politician.  I put to the House as part and parcel of this plan that even if we were dramatically successful in the next three years in turning things around, even if our figures are pessimistically low and things turn out better and we have a substantial reduction in unemployment, we will still be left with an unacceptably high level of people unemployed for a long time, 12 months.  Those at work, the 84 per cent of the workforce who have jobs, who get up in the morning and have somewhere to go and something to do, have an obligation to declare solidarity with the 16 per cent who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I do not think it is right or proper to say to the unemployed that they should remain unemployed until such time as we get the economy right again.  There is an obligation on us to develop programmes, schemes and measures to provide work and activity but, most of all, dignity for <Col N="1486" /> the long term unemployed as an interim measure until such time as we get the economy right and get them back to full time jobs.</P>
    <P>Medical studies show that prolonged unemployment is creating diseases and medical problems of a kind never previously encountered and for which, perhaps, we do not have a cure.  The drug pusher and the criminal have plenty of cures for that kind of phenomenon.  I do not think we want to go into that type of solution.  I believe that parallel with the realities that underpin this document the special social employment scheme we have introduced will address itself to that phenomenon which is not unique to Ireland but is more acute here than in any other member state.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am honoured to speak to this motion which states:</P>
      <P>That, pursuant to Standing Order 47, Dáil Éireann hereby rescinds its Resolution of 18 October, 1984 approving the policies set out in the document <i>Building on Reality</i> and in view of the mounting evidence that it is based on unreliable statistics and false assumptions and has been rejected by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, calls on the Government to withdraw the document and to prepare a credible plan for economic development based on accurate figures and realistic forecasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sat with growing amazement listening to a Labour Member who is Minister for Labour in this administration make an unusual speech.  At the outset he told us that Labour were not happy with the philosophy behind the plan and he went on to ask us for a type of fool's pardon on the basis that they have only 16 seats in the House.  The Minister mentioned a lot about the philosophy of the various political forms in the US, the UK, France and Germany but we did not hear anything from him about principles.  Where is the principle behind Labour participation in Government?  Where are the Labour principles in the plan?  We heard a lot of waffle about the reduction in the number <Col N="1487" /> of people involved in farming in the US and the economic plans being followed by a number of other governments, but we did not hear anything about what will be done to tackle the problems at home.</P>
    <P>Our motion criticises the plan because it is based on unreliable statistics.  The Minister told us that it would be preferable if the plan had been based on more accurate statistics, but unfortunately they were not available because of the system of collecting statistics we have here.  That Labour Minister correctly dealt with the need for work.  It was correct to refer to the dignity of our people and to remind us of the medical problems of those who are long term unemployed.  However, that Minister is a member of a Government &mdash; I do not wish to concentrate on the Minister for Labour alone because the Fine Gael and Labour Parties are involved &mdash; who in this bleak grey plan tell us that at the commencement of the plan, in April 1984, 209,000 were unemployed and at the end of the period, if they meet their projections, there will be 210,000 unemployed.  That Minister lectured us earlier on the philosophy of the Labour Party but did not tell us anything about the principle involved.  He has told us about the medical problems of the long term unemployed.  It is no wonder that he has scurried from the House because it must be sickening to have his own words thrown back at him.</P>
    <P>An economic and social plan should set out one goal: the future welfare of the Irish people.  This hotch-potch document of a discredited Government manifestly fails this basic test.  One thing the country needs is hope and confidence in itself and in its people, especially the young people. Fianna Fáil would give people a belief in themselves, which unfortunately the Government are not doing and do not appear to be interested in doing.  <i>Building on Reality</i> should surely involve identifying our problems and clearly setting out proposals to resolve them.  The Government have constantly blathered on about unemployment being the top priority but their plan does not propose to do anything to solve that problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> It is important to remember that the plan has the full backing of the Labour Parliamentary Party but not members of the Labour Party throughout the country. The plan states that unemployment will increase to 210,000 in 1987, but what way do they propose to trick around with those figures?  They intend to put 11,000 people on new training schemes and 7,500 into early retirement.  In other words, there will still be 228,000 not employed but eligible for employment against an unemployment level of 209,000.  Is that reducing unemployment?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are committed to creating an environment which will encourage job creation.  We expect the institutions of the State, which were set up to encourage and promote job creation, to actively pursue that objective.  That is why we have called on the Government to produce a credible plan for economic development based on accurate figures and realistic forecasts.  All State institutions, including the major one, the IDA, over the years have had at their disposal considerable State funds aimed at creating jobs.  We are aware that the nature of jobs has changed dramatically in the last 20 years.  Many industries and companies have not been able to keep pace with technological changes and have suffered major job losses.  We are aware that we have had to spend a lot of money to acquire new technological industries, but it is disappointing and alarming that after 20 years of industrial development our manufacturing labour force is still just the same despite the growth in our population.</P>
    <P>It is particularly disconcerting, at a time when our unemployment level is at a record high, that the Government, our primary agency responsible for the creation of jobs, in their latest economic plan should be seeking to focus the emphasis of the IDA on the concept of wealth creation, downgrading the objective of the IDA, which is that of job creation, our major social need.  That is not contained in this plan.  We in Fianna Fáil do not deny the need for major, national wealth creation but at a time when so many of our people are unemployed, <Col N="1489" /> surely it is not good enough for the IDA, with the support of the Government White Paper on Industrial Policy, and their economic plan, to declare that their future focus should be on wealth creation. With practically 220,000 people unemployed surely the focus should be on finding ways of creating jobs rather than just caving in and saying, &ldquo;We can do nothing about it&rdquo;, as we heard the Minister for Labour saying a while ago. He contended that it is happening all over the world and he told us about four or five countries and about jobs as a result of increasing the pool of wealth.  We know and agree that wealth creation is important.  But primarily within the needs of this country today job creation is important.  This plan fails manifestly in job creation.  Even the job creation figures shown are contradicted between their White Paper on Industrial Policy and their economic plan.  The figures are totally different in both documents.</P>
    <P>Just a few years ago the Coalition Parties complained that the unemployment level of 126,000 was catastrophic.  I am sorry that the Minister for Labour has left the House because he would have been responsible for the drafting of some of these documents.  I might remind the House of what Labour and Fine Gael were saying in the past about unemployment and what they are saying today.  For example, at the Labour Party Conference in 1980, they said that in order to achieve full employment in the eighties the economy would need to grow continuously from 7 per cent to 9 per cent per annum, that the basis for Labour's policy for a planned economy was to make full employment the primary policy objective of all Government activity with a rapid increase in the growth of national income.  They contended then that in the future employment would consititute the prime policy objective and that planning would be directive instead of indicative in nature.  They contended then that a 15 to 20 year plan could not be allowed to founder in the face of short term financial problems or the inability or unwillingness of private enterprise to invest in the sectors where expansion was needed.  One <Col N="1490" /> might well ask how does that sort of comment fit in with this bleak, grey document <i>Building on Reality?</i></P>
    <P>In the Labour election programme of 1981 it was shown that unemployment had climbed to 120,000 officially though it was contended that the real level was 150,000.  It was said further that unemployment among young people had reached catastrophic proportions &mdash; 33,000 was the figure about which they were talking of people under the age of 25 then unemployed.  The figure given in this House last week by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach was 72,000 under the age of 25 unemployed. One must ask what are this Government doing about that?  They are doing nothing.  To continue on this Labour election programme, they contended that a policy of deflation must be resisted as it would simply lead to more unemployment.  What is this document <i>Building on Reality</i> but a policy for deflation?</P>
    <P>In the Fine Gael-Labour Programme for Government 1981-1986 there appear these comments &mdash; that jobs must be protected and created, that investment for new job creation be maintained and increased.  It was maintained that that policy would be achieved by giving aid immediately to vulnerable sectors which have been suffering as a result of loss of competitiveness, inflation, manufacturing, tourism and agriculture.  What help is there for any of those sectors in this latest economic plan?  Absolutely none.</P>
    <P>I progress now right up to the December 1982 Joint Programme for Government in respect of which I have read much recently about Ministers talking about the support they received from the people for that programme.  I want to nail that lie straightaway.  They never put that Joint Programme for Government before the people.  They went before the electorate as independent parties saying that they would not go into a Coalition. Then, after the election was over, they sat in smoke-filled back rooms and cobbled together a policy which they say now had the electoral support of the people.  If they say it has the electoral support of <Col N="1491" /> the people, I challenge them here and now to go out and ask for that support, when I know the people will reject them. In that programme, cobbled together after the election, they contended that the most urgent problem was that of unemployment, with 170,000 unemployed, 50,000 of whom were under the age of 25.  An alarming situation.  They said emergency measures were needed to halt the rise in unemployment which had then reached disastrous proportions. They said the then emergency employment measures would be linked to the urgent need to remove bottlenecks in our infrastructure which, if not tackled, would impede future growth.</P>
    <P>Then they went on to say that the national development corporation would be established as an early priority of the parties in Government, that it was to constitute a major vehicle for job creation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It never will and I shall have another few words to say about that in a moment.  The Fine Gael-Labour Programme for Government &mdash; it was published on 14 December 1982 &mdash; said that the national development corporation would initiate new job creation projects and stimulate projects involving productive employment within the existing public sector.  Of course, &ldquo;the public sector&rdquo; have become dirty words as far as this Government are concerned.  The national development corporation, initially promulgated by the Labour Party back in 1981 but without the support of Fine Gael &mdash; who later only begrudgingly accepted it in a watered-down version as part of the Coalition Programme for Government &mdash; has been scaled down.  It is a well known stalking horse of the Labour Party on which they fall back whenever they are really desperate &mdash; I see Deputy McLoughlin in the House here this evening &mdash; for example, food subsidies are removed, which constitutes the bottom line.  When the bottom line <Col N="1492" /> was once again reached, like the moveable feast it is, then the corporation constituted another of those bottom lines.  In the period since 1981, the scale of the NDC has dropped dramatically.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil established the National Enterprise Agency as a vehicle to encourage new risk type ventures, whereas the NDC was to be an umbrella body for all commercial State investments, including CIE, NET, the ESB, Aer Lingus and so on.  Indeed it received a very bad public and press response when Deputy Michael O'Leary, former Labour Tánaiste &mdash; does Deputy Reynolds remember him?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but when he was Tánaiste he announced the proposed establishment of the NDC and it received a very bad public and press response.  The main problem was that he really did not know what that corporation would do.  In effect, it would constitute a place where semi-State, non-profitable bodies would be found.  In 1981 Labour proposed that the NDC should have an equity base of £300 million, Government provided, with a borrowing power of up to £1,000 million.  The 1981 Labour-Fine Gael programme announced that its equity would be £200 million, with its borrowing power £500 million, the figure dropping all the time.  The White Paper on Industrial Policy of July last stated that the Government would provide the NDC with £7 million in 1984.  We are now into November and that corporation still has not been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does this economic plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> this grey, dismal, dreary booklet say about the NDC?  It says that the NDC will deal only with commercial operations, that the emphasis will be on developing modern industry, based on commerciality and profits and strengthening indigenous industry.  Granted there is nothing wrong with that.  But there is <Col N="1493" /> then added that, in view of this emphasis, the Government will be ready to make funds available to the NDC for such projects as and when needed.  How about that for a back-down from the £1,000 million and the £300 million about which we heard earlier?  Of course the NDC will be unable to sneeze without the Government allowing it to do so.  And the Labour Party go along meekly with this proposed emaciated organisation.</P>
    <P>What has happened in relation to the plans to deal with unemployment?  The Government and the IDA have now changed the goalposts because the placing of the goalposts no longer suited them with regard to unemployment.  Instead of focussing on the need for job creation we are now switching to wealth creation needs.  That is a neat little trick.</P>
    <P>The recently published IDA annual report refers to the White Paper on Industrial Policy and states:</P>
    <P>The IDA sees the central focus of the new policy as the target of doubling manufacturing output over the next ten years and capturing the maximum added value within the economy aimed at generating further investment and additional employment in the economy.</P>
    <P>While we subscribe to these objectives individually we feel that the emphasis on the social importance of job creation has been gravely relegated by this Government in their economic plan and by the IDA, with the support of the Government. As our premier job creating body perhaps we should ask the IDA and this Government how and where jobs could be developed, acknowledging their input in respect of the need to create wealth, instead of having it relegated to being just a function of wealth creation.</P>
    <P>We can see and judge the success of job creation policies, of which there are none at all in this national plan, but there is a large question mark now over the whole question of value statistics for the economy such as growth and output of Irish industry or the value of exports as quoted by the IDA in their annual report. The Taoiseach's own economic adviser, <Col N="1494" /> Dr. Honohan, has highlighted the dubiousness of some of our economic data. In the circumstances this Government should be concentrating the efforts of their main job creating body, the IDA, on job creation rather than changing the goalposts because they did not like the game that was being played.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have dismissed this plan as being a grey and gloomy document, as can be seen from the opinion polls.  All the effort of the roadshow throughout the length and breadth of the country will not save this Government from the wrath of the people or breathe life into this document.  Their Ard-Fhéis and their meeting at Castlebar reminded me of the Bible story of the man who sent invitations to the wedding feast but nobody came.  They sent out 3,000 invitations. Fair play to the principled staff of the local authorities and institutions in Mayo who refused to be intimidated by this administration.</P>
    <P>Last night in North County Dublin we had the Taoiseach night clubbing in Sardis at the Country Club Hotel in Portmarnock. This is in the middle of 290 acres of land on which the local authority placed a compulsory purchase order years ago in order to develop it as an amenity for the people.  Unfortunately the local authority had to let their compulsory purchase order drop.  They could not go ahead with the development of this environmental project to protect the sand dunes of Portmarnock for the people of Dublin generally because there was no money in the kitty.  The well had run dry.  The Taoiseach goes out night clubbing in the North county to tell the Irish people about the improved environment in the country as a result of this grey and gloomy document.  It is a glorious irony that he decided to go to a place where the local authority did not have the necessary few shillings to complete a compulsory purchase order signed by us many years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on an aspect of the plan <Col N="1495" /> which concerns my Department in particular. I refer to the subject of co-operation with developing countries.  The fact that our relations with developing countries should merit a section in the plan shows in itself the importance with which the Government regard them.  The present crisis in Ethiopia and other parts of Africa and the relief operation now underway in that continent highlight the major need for an expansion of our development and relief programme.</P>
      <P>There are two initial comments I wish to make.  The outpouring of generous support from the Irish people in response to the castastrophy in Ethiopia has not been equalled, as far as I am aware, in any other country in the world.  As the Minister with special responsibility in this area I am intensely proud of this marvellous response and urge our people to continue their support for Concern, Gorta, GOAL and the other voluntary agencies active in this field.</P>
      <P>I find it unfortunate that incorrect information should be given to the Irish people on the Government programme of aid to the Third World.  This has arisen in the media arising from comments by Cardinal Ó Fiaich yesterday.  Today's edition of <i>The Irish Press</i> stated:</P>
      <P>Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiaich yesterday criticised the Irish Government for cutting its aid to Third World countries and urged the Cabinet to rethink its priorities.</P>

      <P>Deputy Reynolds will have his opportunity to reply if he has any interest at all in this area.  Such has not been displayed by his party in the past.  In 1973 the official aid figure for Ireland was £1.5 million.  In 1981, the year when I first took up my appointment with special responsibility in this area, the official aid figure was £18 million.  In 1984 the official aid figure is £34 million. Over the period of the plan this figure will be further increased to £50 million by the year 1987.  This is not as much as I would wish and does not approach the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP at the pace I would like or at the pace projected in the joint programme.  To suggest or imply that it involves a cut in official aid is quite misleading and I take the opportunity to put the record right.  It is important that the Irish people know the full facts and recognise that their own individual generous efforts are paralleled by a similar effort on the part of the Government.</P>

      <P>I do not for a moment refer to the Cardinal as a liar.  He is either incorrect or was misquoted.  It is my intention now to put the record right.  I mentioned that the fact of a section in the plan on this subject indicates the concern which this Government have for developing countries.  This approach is based on moral concern and other factors.  I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this aspect in more detail but my time is very brief.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the opportunity to wind up this debate which is unreal for many reasons.  The Government have been in office for two years against a background of an extra 50,000 people unemployed since they came into office, with foreign debt increased from £3 billion to £8 billion in the middle of 1981, against commitments by this Government not alone to tackle but to reverse the escalating trend of unemployment and to put our finances in order.  That is the background against which the man in the street will judge this Government. What did the Coalition come up with?  A document called <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
      <P>This <i>Building on Reality</i> is what I would describe as building on quicksand.  It was interesting to note that the Taoiseach headed off for the Sands Night Club in Portmarnock to try to give a display of another building on reality.  I asked questions of Ministers and the Taoiseach, and I challenged them to answer the questions I raised about the assumptions that form the basis of this plan and the figures which are supposed to be unemployment figures.  I asked what will happen over the duration of this plan and what will be the results at the end of the day.  Nobody took the opportunity to give a reasonable answer to my questions and nobody accepted my challenge during this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government wonder why there is not greater acceptance of this plan.  When <Col N="1498" /> anybody produces a plan the first thing the people look at is that person's credibility. I do not have to waste the time of this House telling the people what they already know only too well.  The credibility the Taoiseach enjoyed two years ago no longer exists.  He has discredited himself.  This man said he would have open and honest government, he would come before the Irish people and tell them what was good for them, but the first hard decision he had to make was on the food subsidies and we all know what he did.  It was hit and run medicine.  He disappeared to France to enjoy himself at EEC expense.  We were told he was on his holidays forgetting the Irish people, forgetting the 250,000 people who are unemployed.  That is the type of medicine he dished out <i>in absentia</i> to the Irish people.  That, more than anything else, ruined his credibility.</P>
    <P>Two years ago the Coalition parties put a Programme for Government before the people.  When the Taoiseach was asked in October 1984 if he could point to any policy, commitment or promise given which had been carried out, he had to admit on a radio programme that he could not name one.  Now the Government wonder why the people do not believe what this plan says.  That is the kind of Government we have.  During two disastrous years in office this Government borrowed far more than they said the economy needed.  In 1981-82 this Government instilled in the hearts and minds of our people a great fear when they said that the economy was on the point of bankruptcy and at that time our foreign borrowing stood at £3 billion.  If that was true then, how much truer is it today when foreign borrowing stands at £8 billion and the national debt is £17.7 billion?  We know the Coalition were conning the people then, and the people know it now, and the first chance the people get they will put the Coalition out of office quicker than they put them in. Even at this stage the Coalition do not appear to know what are the problems facing the economy.  They said they identified them two years ago, but they did nothing about them.  According to this <Col N="1499" /> document it will be more of the same for the next few years.  Good luck to anybody who believes that because I do not believe in this document and I will tell why later.</P>
    <P>In 1983 700 businesses ceased trading and we are fast approaching that figure for 1984.  Unemployment is going through the roof; and borrowing is going through the roof.  The Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, gave a solemn promise to the PAYE workers that taxation will not increase during the term of this plan, but what he failed to tell them was that the Government have found a new name for taxation &mdash; levies, local charges, increases in school transport fees, or increases in VHI charges.  All these words mean an extra tax on the people and less money in their take home pay.  There will be a definite increase in taxation.  That is the reality.  That is the dishonesty and the deceit which is running through this document.  Yet the Government wonder why the people do not believe in it.  I will tell them why: they do not have the credibility to sell it.</P>
    <P>In Iveagh House this document was launched at a lavish party attended by trade unionists, business people, and every name one could think of &mdash; including men with six inch Havana cigars &mdash; and glasses of brandy.  That was a nice sight for the people sitting at home who had no money to pay their bills on Friday, the people who were unemployed and with no hope of a job.  What did the Government do then?  They brought out a beautiful booklet called <i>Building on Reality: A Summary.</i></P>
    <P>I want to show the deceit and dishonesty that is attached to this whole operation.  There is not a word to be found in that booklet about taking off the rest of the food subsidies, or that hospital wards would be closed down.  All the good news was handed out to the general public but no word of the bad news. Would you believe what it says on the front page &mdash; this is not a definitive statement of Government policy.  What is it supposed to be?  It is supposed to be a con job which the Irish electorate, and even the Coalition back benchers, have <Col N="1500" /> seen through.  The Fine Gael Party members did not attend their Ard-Fheis and the Taoiseach and his Ministers had to decide to go around the country explaining the document.</P>
    <P>I will go through the basic assumptions in this magic document <i>Building on Reality.</i>  Let us take the unemployment figures for a start.  According to this document the growth in the labour force will be 15,000 a year.  The White Paper on industrial policy published six weeks earlier said the growth in the labour force would be 17,000; ESRI and the NESC produced two different reports which said that the growth in the labour force would be 20,000.  To this day there has been no explanation from the Government as to how these different figures came about. We are given the figures of 20,000, 17,000 and 15,000 and the Government say that is honesty, that that is building on reality and that we can believe what is in this document although they are not able to explain the difference in these figures.</P>

      <P>Maybe the Deputy from Clare, his colleague from the Labour Party or the Minister of State would like to explain another fallacy, another spurious example, another falsehood in the figures on page 26 of this infamous document. It says that the number at work in manufacturing employment in April 1984 was 214,000 people.  No one knows where that figure came from.  The only clue I get is under an asterisk which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Monthly Live Register data are <Col N="1501" /> used as an indicator of unemployment. The annual Labour Force Survey provides a better basis for determining numbers at work and those out of work, but is not available with the same frequency.</P>
    <P>No one knows where this base figure comes from.  I will produce the only Government document that gave the factual situation in April 1984.  I refer to the CSO document which gives a figure of 195,700 people at work in manufacturing employment as the March-April figure. Yet, in the document <i>Building on Reality</i> we get a figure of 214,000, a difference of 10 per cent, or a difference of 18,700 people.  If there was such a difference on that point, what will be the difference at the finish?  According to the CSO, at the end of June the figure was even less; it was 194,900 people.  Where did the Government get the fictitious figure? How can they expect this House or the people to believe unemployment figures that have been fabricated?  We have the official document and we also have the Government's plan.  Would the Minister like to explain the difference?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not see the Deputy here very often but, for his information, I should like to tell him that we have constantly told the Government their figures were wrong in relation to cross-Border traffic.  We put the figure at £150 million but the Government laughed at us and said we were living in cloud-cuckoo land.  However, when the Allied <Col N="1502" /> Irish Banks produced their report a few months age they put the figure at £230 million.  That is a loss of between £70 million and £80 million in revenue to the Exchequer.  The Government could not run a sweet shop on the corner and it is no wonder they cannot run the business of this House and this country.</P>
      <P>There was also the mistake with regard to milk.  The figures compiled by the farmers were sent to the Government but they could not even copy the figures and send them to Brussels.  They were not able to put down correctly the gallons of milk which the co-ops had counted and which were sent to the Department of Agriculture.  That Minister went to Brussels with the wrong set of figures and he is now the laughing stock of Europe.</P>
      <P>The Government cannot even count the number of cattle going to Libya.  The Government say that trade with that country amounts to between £50 million and £70 million but if they contact the people who are sending the cattle to Libya they will tell them that trade is worth between £124 and £127 million. They are out between £50 million and £60 million.  That is the kind of record the Minister for Agriculture has.  Is it any wonder the people of Longford have named him quite properly the Cliff Barnes of Irish politics.</P>
      <P>I will not dwell on the £17.8 million in respect of VAT which was sent in mistake to Europe.  They would not have known anything about it if the Comptroller and Auditor General had not brought it to their notice.  Then, after all this mismanagement the Government expect us to believe what they say in <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the cornerstones of the plan and one on which it either stands or falls is a freeze in public sector pay this year, an increase of 1 per cent next year and the hope that if all goes well in 1987, the official date for the next general election, the Government will look after that sector if they get that far.  As I said on the first day, the document is political polyfilla, evostick or super glue.  Whatever name it is called, it helped to keep the Government together and it got them <Col N="1503" /> out of a problem when they might have cracked up a few months ago.</P>
    <P>Has collective bargaining been thrown out by this Government?  How can they put forward a policy that depends on having a pay freeze this year, a 1 per cent increase next year and good times ahead in 1987?  There is a word that is synonymous with this Government and Deputy Flynn will remember it well &mdash; it is the word &ldquo;eventually&rdquo;.  To every question one asks in this House one is told that eventually it will be done.  I am glad the Taoiseach is in the House because I wish to ask him if collective bargaining for the trade union movement has been thrown out the door.  If that is so why not be honest with the trade unions and tell them the Government will legislate for it?  Why leave the whole matter so vague in the document?</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of the basic assumptions made with regard to currency. They say there will be stable relationships between the punt and the dollar.  If the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are sure of that, then our problems are over.  However, nobody else is sure of it.  Economic commentators at home and abroad do not believe it, but yet the Government expect the country to believe what they say in that regard. The Westminster Bank says that the punt-dollar relationship in 1989 will be 75 cents to the punt.</P>
    <P>Interest rates have to come down if this plan is to succeed.  They have been high for the past two years.  I looked at interviews of various people during the American election and not one of them said they would come down.  In fact, they said interest rates would go the other way.  A very important man in the US Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Volcker, said on 26 July:</P>
    <P>Interest rates currently at high level will remain high and possibly move upwards, producing strains at home and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Another member of the Federal Reserve Board said on 2 October:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> We are more likely to see interest rates rise than fall over the next three months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>So much for the Government's assumptions regarding interest rates and the dollar.  The growth in world trade is projected at 4½ per cent but that means that our exports have to increase by 4½ per cent in the world markets in which they trade.  If the Government are basing those growth figures, as was pointed out by Deputy Lenihan last night, on the transfer pricing that is going on and what is called location preference operated by multinationals, the figures are also out on this count.  This has been made known in documents that were supposed to be secret but that have been released by a man who is now working for the Government and who pointed out that 20 per cent of our exports could be fictitious.</P>
      <P>Those are the figures and the assumptions we are asked to accept as valid.  All I can say to the Taoiseach and the Government is this: this is the second wake I have been at in relation to this document.  I know the Taoiseach believes that the patient is only unconscious and that he can revive the patient.  His roadshow throughout the country started off in Castlebar but they had an attendance of 184 people, which figure has been doubly checked, even though 3,000 invitations were sent to their own supporters. Fine Gael supporters did not even attend the Ard-Fheis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National and international commentators have said that the plan will not work. In my view the Government have demeaned the document by putting into it such items as late opening hours for pubs, giving licences to certain restaurants and bringing down the price of whiskey.  If the document was a serious one it would not include such items but it is not a serious document.  The wake is on for the second time.  The cortege was moved to Castlebar but was returned last evening to the quicksands of Portmarnock.  Let us <Col N="1505" /> give it a decent burial and give the Irish electorate the opportunity of dancing on its grave.  It must now be put to its eternal rest.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by relating a small but significant incident which was witnessed at Iveagh House as the Taoiseach was walking to the podium to announce the plan.  A civil servant standing at the back of the hall was whistling Nearer My God to Thee, the air that was played by the band as the Titanic sank.  That civil servant was well ahead in regard to the <Col N="1506" /> reaction that the plan was to evoke.  As the Titanic sank, let us now sink this document forever and celebrate the resurrection of Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Offaly Detention Centre Proposal.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad of the opportunity to raise this matter.  In view of the fact that it is proposed by the Government that Castle Bernard in County Offaly is to become a detention centre I wish to ask the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry what proposals he has for the continued training of young foresters and if he will clarify the specific details involved in the proposed arrangement between his Department and the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>I have raised this matter to highlight the unacceptable manner in which the Minister for Justice and his Department have collaborated with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry in closing down an established school for young foresters and the disastrous proposal to use the premises as a detention centre for young offenders.  We are casting no aspersions on the magnificent work of people involved in the prison service who work in detention centres.  Our major argument is that this is not a suitable location.</P>
      <P>Mr. David Stewart, the head of planning in An Foras Forbartha, has spoken about the suitability of Castle Bernard as a location for a national folk museum in the event of its not being used as a training school for foresters.  The place has been inspected during the past week and has been short-listed as being suitable for this purpose.  The previous Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy Brendan Daly, opened a log cabin in the vicinity of Castle Bernard and we were hopeful at that time that it would be developed into a major amenity area such as a forest park.  Castle Bernard is a national monument and there is a second national monument in the grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Fisheries and Forestry have built a workshop in Mountrath for the maintenance and repair of machinery and it seems to be a retrograde step to close down at the same time the <Col N="1509" /> educational facility in Kinnitty Castle for the training of young foresters.  It is a major irony that the Civil Service, which has run the forestry industry very inefficiently through their tender system and certainly not on a commercial basis, should have the gall to propose the closure of this school and put in its stead a detention centre.  They are thereby torpedoing any prospect of an improvement in the forestry industry.  Young people who are interested in that industry should be in a position to avail of training so that they can take their places in a rejuvenated industry.</P>
    <P>It seemed to a recent deputation that the matter was a <i>fait accompli.</i>  The Minister for Justice was saying that he wanted the place and it was to be subject to a final Government decision.  The Office of Public Works have now inspected the building.</P>
    <P>It is not very honest of the Government to proceed in that manner without taking into account the stiff and growing opposition of the whole area which is running against the long and dedicated service of many people in voluntary organisations there.  It is incumbent on the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to restore Kinnity Castle as an educational facility for the training of young foresters so that they can work in harmony with the development of the surrounding area which is a major amenity and environmental centre.  It is one part of the midlands which can be developed properly as a tourist attraction and he should act responsibly to alter this disastrous decision. He should return Castle Bernard to its proper place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you for allowing us to discuss this very important matter.  Many years ago, when I was a member of Offaly County Council I put forward proposals to Laois County Council to develop the Slieve Bloom area.  A committee was formed and roads were planned by the county council.  Money was allocated to the Slieve Bloom area as well as to the midlands region.  This is <Col N="1510" /> a disastrous move as far as the area is concerned.  It is an amenity and tourist area and it is out of the question to have a detention centre there.  It is alleged that the Minister's Department have now agreed to lease this building to the Department of Justice to use as a detention centre.  If that happens all the money which was put into it by the county councils of Laois and Offaly and the tourist organisations will all go down the Swanee.  There will be a high security involved and naturally people will have reservations about coming to such an area.  People of all shades of political belief say it is wrong and now is the time to reverse that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the other Members for allowing me to speak on this important matter.  The village of Kinnity is probably one of the most picturesque in the country.  It is situated on the edge of the Slieve Bloom mountain range which is the major tourist attraction in the midlands.  A tremendous amount of development has taken place over the years by Offaly County Council, Laois County Council, Lakeland Tourism and the midlands regional development organisation.  Because of the Slieve Bloom mountain range, there is a tremendous bond between the people of Counties Laois and Offaly.  As major development has taken place in tourism over the past 15 to 20 years, it is important not to allow Castle Bernard to be turned into a detention centre.  It is one of the key areas &mdash; Kinnity is another &mdash; in this mountain range.  It would be a mistake to convert this beautiful castle on the grounds of which are situated two listed national monuments which date back to the 9th and 12th centuries.  It could be developed as a national folk centre for tourism and I hope the Minister will retain control over this very important centre which was used formerly for training young foresters. Kinnity is a small community and the provision of a detention centre in an area with a population of about 300 people would have a detrimental effect on a wonderful, <Col N="1511" /> closeknit community who have developed many skills and attractions.  I ask the Minister to ensure that this will not occur.  When the Minister visited Portlaoise recently he gave a commitment to examine the provision of a forest park.  If he is sincere in this commitment, I ask him to proceed with that and to ensure further development of the Slieve Bloom area as a tourist attraction and amenity for the people of the midlands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of correcting some misapprehensions and misrepresentations that have been made in the House. Deputy Cowen said that the Minister for Justice and I had collaborated in closing Kinnity Castle as a training centre.  I assure him that that allegation is false and unfounded.  There was no collaboration between the Minister for Justice and myself at any time in relation to this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was it secret?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing secret about it.  This facility was acquired by my Department in 1951.  In 1951 the training of foresters commenced there.  In the meantime the training of foresters proceeded and the final batch reached the end of their three year training period in March this year.  I must deal with facts, not with assumptions or with what people might think.  At present in the Department we have, at taxpayers' expense, 25 foresters who have not been offered jobs as foresters for which they have been trained because there is no room for them within the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not develop the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That means we will not need a training facility this side of 1991. This is a very fine facility which has not been used since last March and my information is that it will not be used for the next seven years for the purpose for which it was purchased, the training of <Col N="1512" /> foresters.  In the normal way I said I did not need this facility for the purpose of training foresters and it was offered to other Departments as a vacant building to seek their advice on how they might use this facility if it was needed by them. This was done in July, and in August I received a communication from the Department of Justice pointing out that they were seeking this facility or at least they would like to examine it to see if it would suit their purposes for an open detention centre.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connolly said this matter had been completed and that it was a <i>fait accompli.</i>  No decision has yet been made and if the Office of Public Works are down there it is to establish its suitability on behalf of the Department of Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but a decision is imminent.  I have looked at other options in relation to it, including the option for the Department of Justice and that is normal procedure.  The next step is that if other Departments do not need that facility it will be offered to someone else outside the public area.  There is nothing secretive or underhand about it and there was no collaboration at any time in relation to this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an assurance that it will not be handed over to the Department of Justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is my duty to ensure that it is not left vacant, open to becoming derelict or vandalised as many vacant buildings are.  I also have an obligation to apply the normal procedure which is to offer it to other Departments. At present, the possibility of its being taken over by the Department of Justice is being looked at &mdash; it is as simple as <Col N="1513" /> that.  I cannot give any assurance here because I do not know what the building will be used for although I hope to make an announcement during the next week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Following discussions between CIE and the trade unions regarding revisions in the pension scheme for CIE wages grades employees I considered the pension position generally of these employees and, having done so, I advised CIE on 1 November 1984, that the following improvements could be effected in the existing scheme.</P>
      <P>(i)  Updating of the existing levels of pension from a maximum of £16.50 per week to a maximum of £34.50 per week which when added to their social welfare pension will increase their present total level of pension of £64.75 per week for a single pensioner and £95.55 or £100.75 per week (depending on age of spouse) for a married pensioner to £82.75 per week for a single pensioner and £113.55 or £118.75 per week for a married pensioner;</P>
      <P>(ii)  pension may be paid to members who retire on ill-health grounds with at least ten years service irrespective of age instead of the present requirement that members must have completed 20 years service and be within ten years of the normal retirement age of 65 years; and</P>
      <P>(iii)  the existing death-in-service arrangement whereby a mortality grant is payable in respect of a member who had a minimum of 20 years service and was within ten years of the normal retiring age of 65 years is replaced by a provision that a lump sum of one year's pensionable pay will be payable in the case of all members having ten years service irrespective of age.</P>
      <P>When the board of CIE, having completed their discussions with the unions, submit an amending scheme to me within the limits set out above, I will arrange for confirmation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long been concerned about the protracted nature of the negotiations for improvements in the pensions of the CIE wages grades employees which has been to a great extent caused by the need to consider all the aspects of the matter and all of the options put forward by the trade <Col N="1398" /> union representatives.  While the new public sector type scheme that I had hoped for has not proved acceptable to the majority of the union interests, leaving aside the question of its cost to the Exchequer, I feel that, particularly in the present economic climate, the improvements I have now sanctioned are by no means inconsiderable.</P>

      <P>I am aware that despite the significant level of seizures by the Revenue Commissioners there may still be some smuggling of electrical goods across the Border and I accept that the significant tax differential on these goods between here and Northern Ireland has a bearing on this situation. Trade statistics are not available to me on a local or regional basis to indicate the level of business in electrical goods in particular towns.</P>
      <P>The 23 and 35 per cent VAT rates which apply, among a wide variety of other goods, to electrical items, are high. This fact is acknowledged in the recently published National Plan, and, as outlined therein, there will be reductions in these rates on a selective basis.  Naturally, I cannot say at this time what form the reductions will take.  I feel I should mention, however, that, as indicated in the plan, if the high VAT rates are to be reduced in a significant way then VAT will have to be progressively applied to items which heretofore have been VAT-free or liable at a very low rate of VAT.</P>

      <P>It was decided on 11 September 1984 that the person concerned is entitled to a pension at the weekly rate of £32.65 from 3 August 1984 which includes an adult dependant allowance of <Col N="1403" /> £4.75 in respect of his wife and £18.60 dependent child allowance in respect of his two children.  This is the rate to which he is entitled having regard to the assessment of his means consisting of half the weekly value of income from a holding. The reduction in pension is due to the fact that his son Patrick is no longer a qualified child dependant for old age pension purposes.  However, the pensioner has lodged an appeal against the decision and his case has been referred to an appeals officer for decision.  The pensioner will be notified of the outcome in due course.</P>
