    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the basis on which he reduced the number of maternity beds in the North Eastern Health Board region from 182, as approved at the March 1983 meetings of the Health Board, to 165.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main difference between the North Eastern Health Board's calculation of the future maternity bed requirement for their area and the figure used by my Department arises from the recognition, in the latter, of the net outflow of mothers resident in the board's area who have their babies delivered elsewhere, especially in the Dublin hospitals.  No account was taken of this important factor in the calculation which was the basis of the board's decision in March 1983.  Ignoring this significant aspect of the overall situation would eventually lead to an over-provision of maternity beds.  My Department, therefore, quite rightly took account of this and concluded from the evidence available that a total of 165 beds would be adequate to cater for births <Col N="160" /> delivered within the board's area by the nineties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that only about one-third of the mothers within the region go to the regional hospitals for the delivery of their babies?  Is he also aware that the policy of health board members like myself is to ensure that the greatest possible use is made of our regional facilities?  Instead of encouraging that, the Minister is reducing the number of maternity beds in the region. This is a policy matter and I would ask the Minister to examine it very closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The main factor concerned here is that when the health board came to their conclusion that 182 beds would be required, they did not take into account that the planning of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital at Blanchardstown catered for a projected population of 20,000 from south Meath for maternity purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with that assessment.  I was a member of the committee which drew up that report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and is the Minister aware that we, as members of the health board concerned, were satisfied that there was a need for 182 beds?  The management team of the health board are still so satisfied.  I am asking the Minister two fundamental questions &mdash; firstly, is he going to disregard the views of that health board and secondly, is his policy geared towards use for maternity services of hospitals outside the control of that health board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The health board gave an estimate of 7,271 births.  On the other hand, my Department's figure, using a slight revision of the birth rate projected, was 7,030.  We then deducted births expected to be delivered in the Dublin area &mdash; about 1,000.  We added to the result the north Dublin births to be delivered in Drogheda &mdash; 480.  That left <Col N="161" /> a net figure of births to be catered for in the north eastern region of 6,510.  The number of maternity beds needed to cater for this number, on the basis of the planning guideline providing for 39.5 births per bed, is 165.  I might state that the health board in its calculation did not take into account even the number of mothers from Balbriggan who would have their babies delivered in Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We did take that into account and, in addition, the projection of figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question, Deputy, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me, a Cheann Comhairle.  This is an important question &mdash; as important as many which we are discussing here for 20 minutes on some days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that it is, but it still does not bear a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a debate. Is the Minister aware that we took into account the projection from the National Economic and Social Council's study to the year 1991 for births, which showed a substantial increase in that area, an increase in respect of some of the hospitals in that area of up to 20 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1982 July Report on Population and Labour Force Projections published by the NESC has also been availed of by my Department.  That is the general source of the calculations. In 1981 a total of 354 live births to mothers resident outside the area was delivered in the North Eastern Health Board area, mostly from north Dublin. We have projected an increase to 480 per annum, taking into account that there is a growing population in north Dublin and that there is a new unit in Drogheda.  I have checked the calculations quite thoroughly. There is no statement from the health board as to how they got the figure of 182.  They do not take into account the outflow and inflow into the area.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated he revised the plans put forward by the North Eastern Health Board because of the number of births in Dublin from outside the region.  Can the Minister give us details of the counties in the North Eastern Health Board region in which the mothers were resident?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information.  I have no doubt quite a number of mothers come to Dublin.  For example, it is not unknown for the Deputy's obstetrician colleague in Cavan to send quite a number to the Coombe. I can get the details for the Deputy.  The number is quite substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the vast majority are from County Meath where there is no obstetrics service since Trim hospital was closed? The Minister and his Department have agreed that a new unit will be set up in Navan.  Further, will he accept that a number of women from the Dundalk area go to Newry for their deliveries?  With the appointment of an obstetrician in Dundalk &mdash; there is not one at the moment &mdash; and with the building of a new maternity unit at Navan the trend will be reversed and fewer births will take place in Dublin from outside the North Eastern Health Board region.  Will the Minister accept that the North Eastern Health Board were quite correct in deciding on the number of beds for the region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share entirely the views of the Deputy in that regard.  For example, a substantial number of women who go to Newry are from the North and they prefer to go back to Newry to have their children where they will be near their own families.  I do not think the development of the consultant unit in Dundalk will have any dramatic impact.  A substantial number of mothers from south Meath will come to Dublin. We have assigned to Blanchardstown hospital about 20,000 of the population from south Meath.  In the North Eastern Health Board area in a population of about 315,000 there is a new unit in <Col N="163" /> Drogheda and there will be a major maternity unit in Navan and also in Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when an obstetrician was appointed in his own town the number of deliveries increased from 600 to 1,000 births?  Is the Minister suggesting that when he opens a new maternity unit in Navan the women from Meath will continue to come to Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A substantial number of women from Cavan, Meath, Louth and from Monaghan will tend to come to Dublin.  A substantial number from the general Leinster region still gravitate to Dublin.  I cannot dictate to the mothers of Ireland where they wish to have their children.  The situation in the health board area will improve substantially with the major development in Dundalk. For the first time we are giving consultant cover in Dundalk.  I do not know what else we can do.  The Deputies can hardly expect me to deliver the babies myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is satisfied that it will be possible to maintain the present quality and level of service by filling only one in three vacancies which arise in each health board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No direction has been given to health boards that they can only fill one of every three vacancies arising. They have been told that, in the light of the reduction in pay volume in this year's allocation and provided each health board takes the necessary measures to achieve the required retrenchment to accord with the approved pay allocation, no specific directions in regard to the non-filling of vacancies will be issued.  It is, therefore, a matter for each board within the general guidelines laid <Col N="164" /> down by the Department to determine the measures necessary to keep within its allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister now saying that the embargo on the filling of vacancies in the public service does not apply to health boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I issued a letter on 6 February which I wish to put on the record of the House:</P>
      <P>On further consideration of this issue, the Minister has decided that in the light of the reduction in pay and volume in this year's allocation and provided health boards take the necessary measures to achieve the required retrenchment in accord with the approved allocation, no specific directions in regard to the non-filling of vacancies will be issued.  Within the general guidelines, as set out in the Department's letter of 14 December, it will be a matter for each health board to determine the measures necessary to keep within the allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister please read out paragraph 6 of the letter of 15 December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, It stated:</P>
      <P>The Government decided throughout 1984 the arrangement whereby two-thirds of all vacancies occurring in the Civil Service are held open will continue in force and that measures at least equivalent in effect in terms of the numbers of posts which must remain unfilled and their cost will be applied in health agencies.  Further discussions on the implementation of this decision will be held with you as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I make the point that that was in December. There was also a budget statement by the Minister for Finance.  I sought and obtained &mdash; and I am grateful to the Minister for Finance and the Department &mdash; some flexibility.  In my contribution on the budget on 26 January I made the following comment:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> To facilitate the health boards and their agencies in their task I am prepared to leave them relatively free to determine the measures they need to take to ensure that they keep within their allocations.  This flexibility will also apply to the question of filling or non-filling of vacancies which may arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state if that freedom which has been allowed by him to the Southern Health Board is responsible for the 125 redundancies notified in the Cork Regional Hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sanctioned the placing of advertisements for the Southern Health Board of 165 vacancies for the Tralee hospital.  I cannot do any more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister now saying he is creating 165 jobs in Tralee and 125 vacancies in Cork?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will instruct the Midland Health Board to advertise for a second obstetrician/gynaecologist to Tullamore General Hospital as a matter of extreme urgency and the chief executive officer to appoint a second obstetrician/ gynaecologist in a temporary capacity, pending a permanent appointment being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the widespread demand in County Offaly for the appointment of a second permanent obstetrician/gynaecologist to Tullamore General Hospital; and, if so, when he intends to make this appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="166" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is some disquiet locally about the maternity service at the General Hospital, Tullamore, and I know that many people feel that the appointment of a second consultant obstetrician/gynaecologist is the answer to the problem.  However, in the current difficult budgetary situation the appointment of additional consultants poses many difficulties and I am convinced that there is a greater need in the midland area for consultant paediatricians rather than obstetricians if it should prove possible to make additional appointments.</P>
      <P>The problem at Tullamore is currently being examined by officers of my Department and officials from the health board and I am hopeful that the matter will be resolved soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that maternity patients are being brought to the general hospital in Tullamore and that when there is no obstetrician/gynaecologist available they are put back into the ambulances and transferred to Portlaoise; that immediately after a normal birth they are put back into the ambulances and taken back to the Tullamore hospital?  Does he regard that as a satisfactory arrangement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the situation in Tullamore.  I have reviewed it in detail.  As Deputies are aware, the consultant obstetrician/ gynacologist in Tullamore has been successfull in his application for a vacant post in Wexford.  The health board have had some difficulty in ensuring locum cover for the consultant.  It is not entirely the fault of the health board, but they are confident that when the replacement will take up duty difficulties in Tullamore will be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say the present gynaecologist is leaving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister expressed the hope that the matter will be resolved. I hope he was referring to the position of <Col N="167" /> obstetrician/gynaecologist.  I am pleased the Minister has stated publicly he is not satisfied with the position there.  In view of that, will the Minister ensure that a second appointment will be made?  It has been pointed out that when the permanent consultant at the moment is on leave, for a weekend or on holidays, there is the unsatisfactory situation that patients have to be transferred to other hospitals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies Molloy and Connolly have any interest in what we are discussing they should give me an opportunity to ask a question.  Because of the existing position, expectant mothers will not go to the Tullamore consultant &mdash; they go to other hospitals in which there is adequate cover.  Will the Minister say what definite plans he has to make this appointment?  In view of the fact that the ancillary services are available in Tullamore the only appointment that is necessary is of a second permanent surgeon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am no more convinced than was my predecessor that there should be a second consultant appointed directly to Tullamore.  I am doing my utmost, and I think I will be successful, to have a paediatrician appointed there in the near future.  What Tullamore and Portlaoise and Mullingar need more than anything else is a paediatrician. Such a consultant works in a private hospital in Mullingar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that the obstetrician/gynaecologist was departing from the general hospital in Tullamore. In view of that, has the Minister directed the Midlands Health Board to advertise <Col N="168" /> immediately for a successor?  There is a doubt in Offaly in regard to the future of the maternity unit in Tullamore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of a doubt there.  Denis Doherty, the CEO, is an outstanding executive.  He has the matter well in hand.  He is concerned about the lack of locum cover in Tullamore.  There was no consultant cover and as a consequence, in the interests of the safety of mothers and babies, he had to direct that all deliveries should be transferred to Portlaoise when the Tullamore consultant was away.  The matter is now being resolved and full maternity services will be resumed in Tullamore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Minister if the CEO has advertised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to local disquiet about failure to make a second permanent appointment.  He spoke about a paediatrician and I can assure him that the people of Offaly and I agree that such an appointment is necessary. Irrespective of the views of the CEO, is the Minister satisfied that expectant mothers are put into ambulances, brought on a 20 to 30 mile journey in the worst of weather to deliver their babies and are put back into an ambulance and brought back within five hours? Are the Minister and the CEO satisfied with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputies as clearly as I could that I am not satisfied with the continuation of present arrangements. I said the matter has been kept under very close review.  It will be resolved.  When the replacement has been appointed, as all good consultants do I am sure he will arrange adequate locum cover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

We know how slow the Local Appointments Commission are in finalising appointments.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable question.  The committee held their first meeting on 29 April 1983 under the chairmanship of Dr. J. Robbins, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health. Up to the end of January the committee met on no less than 18 separate occasions. Two-day meetings are scheduled for the remainder of this month.  The committee have completed their preliminary consideration of the major adoption issues and I expect to have a report from them before Easter.  They have now set a deadline for the completion of their work.  They had to obtain some legal consultancy advice.  They have done a lot of good work.  Adoption, constitutional and legal issues are enormously complicated. I want to thank the members of the committee for the amount of time they gave to the committee.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that all these complex and difficult legal and constitutional issues were examined in detail in the report published by the Task Force on Child Care Services and referred to in great detail in the minority report?  What is required in this instance is a political decision on the content of legislation.  Can the Minister indicate how the advice the working party are seeking differs in any way from the advice given to the Task Force on Child Care Services originally established in 1975? They reported to the former Minister in September 1980.</P>

      <P>The committee were <Col N="172" /> set up in April 1983 to perform the major job of reviewing four existing adoption Acts, to consolidate them and produce new legislation.  If they complete their work, having met on about 26 occasions, and having given me the report by Easter, they deserve our thanks.  With respect to the task force's report, the question of adoption is more complex than their recommendations appeared to show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the delay in producing this report and the delay in introducing legislation are resulting in well over 1,000 abandoned children who are legitimate not having the facility of being adopted and taken out of care?  In the light of that, will the Minister guarantee to this House that this working party will conclude their deliberations by Easter, and that the report will be published within three or four weeks of the deliberations being concluded?</P>

      <P>Without question that would by my intention.  I am aware of the point made about the adoption of legitimate children.  I concur with many of the views expressed by the Deputy. The adoption of legitimate children &mdash; if I may use that phrase for whatever it is worth &mdash; is a major constitutional question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the steps he proposes to take with a view to improving the ambulance service available through the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of ambulance services is a matter for each health board in the first instance.  Individual health boards can improve the ambulance service in their own area without reference to me as Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>However, there is also a national structure for the co-ordination and development of ambulance services, comprising an Ambulance Services Council and an Ambulance Operations Committee. These two groups are representative of ambulance officers, health boards management, medical and technical advisers and the Department of Health.  They were set up in late 1983, at the request of the health board chief executive officers, to replace the Ambulance Services Committee which served as an advisory group to successive Ministers for Health.  The new structure gives the health boards a more decisive role in relation to changes in the ambulance service and I expect that any recommendations for major improvements in the service will be channelled through the Ambulance Services Council to me.</P>
      <P>The present ambulance service operates very satisfactorily and I am not aware of calls for its improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that <Col N="175" /> the ambulance services, particularly the emergency services, are satisfactory as run by the health boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reasonably satisfied. I have not had any complaints. The Ambulance Operations Committee consists of eight ambulance officers, two programme managers, two technical services officers, one accident emergency consultant, one Army representative, one representative from Dublin Fire Brigade and two from the Department of Health.  They prepare the plans and strategies for ambulance services and are responsible for implementing these, subject to the prior agreement of the Ambulance Services Council.  It is rather a convoluted structure but it works.  The council consists of a CEO, a programme manager, one representative from the Department of Health and three representatives from the Ambulance Operations Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a significant number of ambulances have clocked up over 100,000 miles?  Would he agree that they would hardly be an appropriate type of vehicle for the service?  Would he also agree that a review is being undertaken, particularly by the Western Health Board, which would reduce the emergency services available and render the position less than satisfactory?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total finance available to the Western Health Board for the running of their services in 1984; and if agreement has been reached with the board in achieving the savings necessary to meet his allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1984 allocation for the Western Health Board in respect of their direct expenditure is £105.130 million.  This is £4.5 million less than the board's estimate of their financial requirements.</P>

    <P>The board have approved of measures involving reductions in expenditure estimated at £2.5 million.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the exact details because it was a relatively recent meeting.  However, on 10 February the board were unanimous in approving measures to achieve cutbacks in services in the order of approximately £2.5 million.  They also unanimously authorised the CEO to hold further discussions as a matter of urgency with officers of the Department of Health on the question of the other £2 million.  I understand that this meeting has not yet been arranged.  The only information I have is that about £0.5 million is to be saved by reducing purchases and £443,000 is to be saved on locums in the general hospital area.  In other areas, special hospitals and so on, savings will be achieved mainly through reducing purchases.  I never cease to be amazed at what health boards can do to run their show.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note that £2.5 million has been agreed unanimously by the board.

      <P>In the normal course, medical and surgical appliances are provided free to medical card holders. Requests are sometimes received for items which cannot readily be classed as medical or surgical appliances.  In such cases health boards may seek a contribution towards the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only aware of two incidents.  One case is where a couple, who are medical card holders, sought an orthopaedic bed.  It is open to question, in terms of definition under the Health Act whether an orthopaedic bed is an applicance, which is what we are obliged to supply free of charge &mdash; we are obliged to supply medical and surgical appliances &mdash; or whether it can be classified as furniture.  In this instance the health board supplied the bed, which was an orthopaedic bed, at a cost of £400 and asked for a nominal contribution of £20 from the couple.  The only other case I know of is that of a person in his twenties who made an application for an orthopaedic bed and, likewise, a contribution of £20 was sought.  I am assured that in cases where major equipment, such as furniture items are supplied and there is no prospect of a nominal contribution the beds and all other such equipment are supplied free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that doctors are not in the habit of prescribing furniture for patients and if a doctor wants a patient to have a particular applicance he does so for particular medical reasons?  Under the Health Act appliances of this kind are supplied free to persons with full eligibility.  Therefore, the health boards who are looking for contributions of this kind are in breach of the Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. <Col N="181" /> Orthopaedic beds are advertised in all furniture advertisements as furniture. Any person can buy an orthopaedic bed. Section 59 of the Health Act requires the health boards to supply drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances.  In this instance the health board felt they should supply an orthopaedic bed.  Only in two instances within the operation of the health board in the past 12 months were beds to the value of £400 each supplied. The question arose as to whether they were covered by the Health Act and the health board asked for a nominal contribution.  I do not know if in fact the £20 was paid but I know they got the beds in both cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that doctors are entitled to prescribe appliances of this kind in the medical interest of the patient and where a patient has full eligibility that the health board are obliged under the Act to supply such equipment free of charge?  They have an obligation to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many items which doctors would wish to prescribe, for example, a commode.  A doctor may wish to see a patient supplied with one but this is not covered under the Health Act in terms of a medical or surgical appliance.  Because a doctor issues a prescription under the GMS for such an item to be supplied it does not automatically mean that the health board are obliged on a statutory basis to supply it. I would make the point very strongly to the Deputy that the health boards, to my knowledge, supply a very wide range of appliances and equipment above and beyond what they might normally be expected to supply.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court recently ruled that the exclusion from eligibility for services of those persons who required treatment for injuries received in road traffic accidents and who had received, or were entitled to receive, compensation or damages, was <i>ultra vires</i> the power of the Minister.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made inquiries of the authorities of Jervis Street Hospital who have informed me that the student in question was examined by a doctor in the casualty department of the hospital on 2 February.  He was considered not to require further hospital treatment and was therefore discharged.  He was advised to visit his general practitioner if he experienced further pain.  I understand that the accident happened four days prior to the student attending Jervis Street Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The information given by the Minister is in direct contradiction to the information the student gave me. This student stated categorically that he attended Jervis Street Hospital and they refused to see him although he explained he was a student.  They told him that he would have to have a note from his doctor before they could see him and he then left the hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I have is quite different.  The student concerned was examined by a house officer in the casualty department of Jervis Street Hospital on 2 February.  The student was complaining of a pain in the head arising from a blow he received <Col N="184" /> from a tin can four days previously.  Following medical examination the house officer considered that the student did not require further hospital treatment and he advised him to see his GP if he experienced any further distress.  The hospital considers that the doctor in the casualty department acted in a professional manner and that it was his clinical judgment that the student did not require further hospital treatment at the time and would be more appropriately dealt with by a GP.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to the note-taker perhaps the Chair would allow time for the Chamber to clear before I commence. Nor would I like it to be thought that I had driven everyone from the Chamber.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill &mdash; for the benefit of the people in the gallery, the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill, 1983 &mdash; which came before this House last week.  From time to time there have been many references to the need for a speedier bringing to court of the perpetrators of road traffic offences.  To that end I have suggested frequently that night courts be established to deal specifically with motor offences.  I understand the average time it takes for a case to come before the courts is in the region of two years and sometimes it can be longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Government would give consideration to the inclusion of a provision in this Bill for the compulsory fixing of rear seat belts in cars, say, two or three years hence.  There has been reference to this matter recently in the United Kingdom also when it was brought to people's attention that many people had been killed &mdash; this is an amusing but nevertheless true way &mdash; by &ldquo;flying grannies,&rdquo; meaning that a grandmother in the back seat of a car hit from behind in a collision was flung over on top of front seat passengers, in turn killing them and/or herself.  Perhaps the Minister of State present would give some consideration to this suggestion in the <Col N="263" /> interests of the safety of not only elderly people but also of children who may travel in the back seats of cars who are not strapped in.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased fines for uninsured drivers.  I know this provision has been widely welcomed by the general public in addition to the general motoring public, people who may find themselves some day hit by a vehicle whose owner is uninsured.  I believe this will have quite an impact on people insuring themselves. I understand that at present the maximum fine for driving an uninsured vehicle is £100 which is now to be increased to £1,000, which is commendable.  Also commendable are the many other changes in the levels of fines, particularly those relating to overloaded vehicles, heavy lorries carrying many tons in excess of the maximum amounts permissible in law.  This is particularly laudable when one remembers the havoc many of these lorries wreak on our roads and the cost of repairs to our roads which must be borne by the taxpayer.  I appreciate the fact that every person who owns a fleet of trucks is anxious to make as much money as possible on every load he delivers. However there is a price to be paid in respect of road repairs occasioned by such traffic and the taxpayer must take up the tab for the amount of damage done, particularly on small, narrow little roads throughout the country which were not constructed to withstand such heavy traffic.</P>
    <P>I might refer also to parking fines.  Different types of fines should be imposed for different types of parking offences, for example, to give just two instances, that of parking on a clearway and, on the other hand, parking on a single yellow line where one may not necessarily cause much obstruction.  But where cars are parked within, say, 25 feet of traffic lights, reducing traffic lanes to a single row, fines should be heavier.  Also I believe that anybody who has to have his vehicle towed away should be made to pay heavily for having parked his car in a way that caused considerable obstruction. Usually such cars are removed from the corners of little side roads, or where <Col N="264" /> they have been double parked so as to reduce traffic flows to a single lane.</P>
    <P>Another provision I should like to have seen included was one effecting some control over the noise of motor bicycles. I know there is at present a decibel limit but I am not aware that anybody has been charged in the last few years.  Were I to put down a parliamentary question I should probably get confirmation of this. It should be an offence to drive a motor bicycle creating noise far in excess of the noise levels allowed by law.  The Minister should consider this aspect because there is nothing more annoying, particularly late at night but also at other times during the day, than to hear these motor bicycles revving up making excessive noise.  There should be some control over that.</P>
    <P>Our gardaí are already overworked, which leads to the general feeling that traffic regulations are not enforced as vigorously as perhaps they should be. Heavier fines would help by reducing the number of breaches of the law.  An increase in the number of prosecutions every so often would have beneficial results.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea to have an insurance disc visible on cars.  I am amazed at the number driving uninsured and untaxed cars.  Many, but not all, itinerants drive unlicensed and untaxed cars and it is difficult for the Garda to prosecute successfully in these cases, because many are of no fixed abode.  The powers of the Garda should be strengthened in dealing instantly with people who have no permanent address.  Some thought should be given to that matter.  There is a large enough number of people in this category committing such offences for it to be of grave concern.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the imposition of larger fines against those who damage unoccupied parked cars and drive away. I am sure that there is not a Member of this House who has not found dents, and quite severe damage at times, done to his or her car in this manner.  People who witness these occurrences should be encouraged to report the matter, as they are very prevalent.  With the increase of <Col N="265" /> fines and with good citizenship on the part of onlookers, the position would improve.</P>
    <P>A much more heinous offence is that of the hit-and-run driver who injures or kills a pedestrian, cyclists or any other road user.  It should be mandatory that such people lose their driving licences for the rest of their lives.  This is one of the lowest forms of crime against another human being, particularly when the victim's life might well have been saved had an ambulance been called immediately &mdash; had the offender even had the decency to ring anonymously for medical help. These offenders are usually drunk at the time and, unfortunately, many lives are unnecessarily lost through their complete lack of consideration.  This is a form of murder, as far as I am concerned.  Not only should such an offender never be allowed to drive a car again, but the State should allow insurance companies to refuse to insure this class of person again.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the variety of severity in the penalties laid down by courts.  Deputy Ray Burke gave an example last week in this House of grave public disquiet with regard to sentencing. The son of a friend of mine was killed in a hit-and-run accident and the young men who had stolen the car which killed the boy were given 18 months' imprisonment. That sentence did not give the bereaved father a feeling that justice had been administered.  Unless there is a deterrent by way of heavy sentencing, these crimes will continue to be committed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased penalties for stealing cars.  Up to now all that a person in this category could be charged with was stealing the actual petrol and driving an uninsured car, but this has changed, which is an improvement.  The person who steals a car and damages it or sets it alight should be made to pay the full amount of damages.  Insurance companies have to pay out of their pool for uninsured cars and the offenders should be made to pay not only the fine levied in court, but for the damage done.  Deductions should be taken from their wages, salary or source of income at 10 per cent, but the word should go out that if a car, <Col N="266" /> or motor bicycle &mdash; many of which are stolen and dumped in canals &mdash; is stolen and damaged, the full penalty will be exacted.</P>
    <P>Eye tests for drivers should be introduced. It is very important that this form part of the Department of the Environment driving test.  I do not know if this operates at present.  Most traffic accidents happen through selfishness and a bullying attitude on the part of many motorists.  75 per cent of all accidents are absolutely unnecessary.  The position would improve if there were more motorcycle gardaí monitoring the traffic and getting the rush hour traffic to form into two lanes where possible, when the rush of traffic is going only in one direction. This might help to speed up the flow of traffic.</P>
    <P>Drivers of those cars which give out excessive diesel or petrol fumes should be dealt with severely.  Nothing is more dangerous than a car trying to overtake another vehicle which is blowing out clouds of black smoke and reducing the visibility ahead.  If the penalties imposed in the courts were sufficiently high to make the costs of repairing the fault in the car economical by comparison, a lot of this pollution would vanish.  If people know that they will be fined from £50 to £200 for causing such pollution, they will have the faults in their cars seen to pretty quickly.  As far as I am aware, we on this side of the House welcome this Bill.  I certainly welcome all its provisions and hope that it will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it is only the first part of new legislation dealing with road traffic and general behaviour on our roads.  It is a very serious problem at the moment.  All of us know of people who have been involved in accidents, whether it be car damage, serious injuries to the person or even death.  We are all aware of the grief and hardship caused to relatives and friends of those killed in road accidents. There are many aspects that must be considered, including uninsured driving, drunken and careless driving and speeding and parking offences.  There are varying <Col N="267" /> degrees of culpability in relation to the offences.  In some instances there can be absolutely no excuse but in others one might look at them in not quite so serious a light.</P>
      <P>The Bill is to be welcomed because it has updated some matters that have to be considered.  I refer in particular to the situation that exists nowadays where some people consider it not worth insuring their car because the fine imposed is less than the cost of insurance.  Apart from the risk of having one's licence withdrawn a person is probably better off in monetary terms not to have car insurance. This is a disgraceful situation.  I hope the Minister will look at the whole question of insurance.  Insurance companies have a duty to quote realistic premiums. I am not condoning anyone who drives a car that is not insured but many young people under the ages of 25 or 30 years are unfairly loaded.  Many of them find it very difficult to get a quotation for insuring their car or motor cycle.  Insurance companies have a duty to offer insurance at a competitive rate.  If all motorists insured their cars the premium for each driver would decrease considerably.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker spoke in favour of a disc system in respect of car insurance. It would be easy to operate a system such as that applied to car tax.  Traffic wardens and the Garda could check on the disc and motorists could be asked to produce their certificate of insurance within a certain number of days.  If people got tickets such as those issued in respect of parking offences there would be a reduction in the number of uninsured drivers.  I hope the Minister of State will pass on the suggestion to the relevant Minister.  Legislation on these lines is long overdue.  The majority of motorists go to the trouble and expense of insuring their cars and if the steps I have outlined were taken it might result in a reduction in the insurance premiums.  I hope the relevant legislation will be brought before the House without much delay. The report on this matter was issued some time age and I am sure it has been with the Minister for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> There are many types of parking offences, some obviously more serious than others.  There is parking on clearways, on double yellow lines and parking at meters without paying the charge.  A person who parks on a clearway or in a place where he is likely to cause traffic chaos should be penalised to the full extent but a person who parks on a single yellow line or who parks at a meter without inserting sufficient money should not be penalised quite so heavily.</P>
    <P>Motorists who bring their cars into the city are worried about getting adequate and safe parking.  Some people may resort to public transport but this brings up the whole question of the efficiency and reliability of public transport.  We must question whether we are providing motorists with the necessary parking facilities and at a reasonable rate.  Motorists have to drive around the city looking for empty parking spaces and this causes annoyance and unnecessary expense. People who are trying to carry on their business in a proper way are affected adversely by the lack of adequate parking facilities.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment must consider traffic problems when future office blocks are being built and when there are major new developments in this city and in cities and towns throughout the country.  It is quite clear that there is a lack of adequate parking facilities.  I agree that people should be penalised fully for parking on clearways and causing obstructions and possible traffic chaos which can make it difficult for emergency traffic trying to get through.  In other areas motorists should not be penalised so harshly.  In other cities motorists can rely on metro services or undergrounds and efficient public transport systems.  Here many people would not make so much use of their cars if they could depend on an efficient public transport service.  Therefore we must try to improve our public transport system because many people would allow CIE or some other undertaking, if such should arrive, to do the driving for them.</P>
    <P>There are varying aspects to careless and dangerous driving.  Some are very serious.  I suppose most of us have <Col N="269" /> exceeded the speed limit at times.  In a 55-mile zone people sometimes drive at 60 miles per hour.  On the other hand there is the serious matter of people speeding through housing estates where there is always the danger of children playing on roads.  There have been suggestions that car ramps should be laid down to stop tear-away drivers or to slow the traffic down.  There has been a suggestion that legislation should provide for such ramps, and when we are reviewing various aspects of road traffic legislation we should consider providing such ramps in certain areas, places where people are using certain roads as short-cuts to get quickly from one place to another, though they know such roads are not through-ways.  In this respect we have a duty towards children in estates who should be able to go about and play in safety.</P>
    <P>I read an article in a newspaper yesterday in relation to local authorities' responsibility under the Civil Liability Act of 1961.  They have certain duties in relation to roads and conditions adjacent to them.  Local authorities should see what improvements can be made.  Apart from road surfaces, other problems could be cleared up without too much cost. Twice in as many months we have had accidents because of falling trees.  High winds could cause any tree to fall, but roadside trees should be looked at carefully from the point of view of age and general appearance.  Local authorities should consider having certain trees cut down.  I am not saying this would avert accidents, but greater vigilance is needed.</P>
    <P>People are often penalised for failure to display their tax discs.  This can be due to the fact that they have not received their discs from motor taxation offices.  I and Deputy David Andrews have advocated the opening of sub-offices in Dublin for the issue of tax discs, and naturally we have advocated one for Dún Laoghaire.  The situation around River House at present is chaotic.  People have to get away from work possibly for up to half a day to go down there and queue to try to get their tax dealt with quickly.  A simpler way would be to allow people to <Col N="270" /> renew their registration without travelling all the way into town at expense and inconvenience.  The parking facilities near the Four Courts are as bad as anywhere else.  The opening of sub-offices would facilitate people who would not normally go to town.  It would be interesting to count the number of work hours lost by people having to travel to get their tax renewed.  If they sent their tax applications by post they might not get a reply for months and one has to tell the garda when stopped that the disc is on the way, that the cheque has been sent off.  It would be interesting to count the number of man hours lost by the duty to renew tax.  I suggest it would run into thousands now that there are so many extra cars in the city.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate will have some influence on people so that they will wear seat belts at all times.  The Minister said that about 80 per cent of people killed in car crashes were not wearing their seat belts. The Department of the Environment should run a campaign to show people that not wearing seat belts can contribute to injuries and death in car accidents. The rate of fatalities has dropped, but it is still too high.  I read in an article recently that in the big snow in 1982 there were very few car accidents because people could not drive their cars.  The more cars there are on the roads the more accidents there will be.</P>
    <P>We should try to make it attractive for people to have their cars repaired and in good working order.  A spot check system should be in operation to ensure that cars on the roads are not defective.  The reduction in the VAT rate makes it less costly to get your car checked and repaired.  We also have the problem of the non-insurance of cars.  For offences like this it might be possible to have the cars impounded.  If people lost their licence for a short time this might contribute to a reduction in road traffic offences.</P>
    <P>The increase in the monetary penalties in the Bill is a start.  There are other aspects to be dealt with as soon as possible. This Bill is part of the Government's proposals to bring about an improvement on our roads.  This will not be done over-night, but we have to make a start.  The <Col N="271" /> offence of uninsured driving must be tackled.  People have been very badly affected by this.  While the Motor Insurers' Bureau have helped them out to a certain extent, in the long term people have been left very badly off because of uninsured driving.  We have a duty to ensure that all drivers have their cars insured.  We hope there will be a better detection rate following the introduction of discs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it will help to reduce the carnage on our roads. All drivers should have an awareness of other road users.  While the number of people killed has been reduced, the carnage is still too high.  We all know people who have been injured or killed in road accidents.  We have a duty to enact this Bill and we hope further legislation will be introduced without too much delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the spirit of the Bill.  It increases a number of penalties for various road traffic offences. There is one aspect of the Bill which must be of concern not only to me and my colleagues in Opposition but also to Members of the Government parties, that is, the outrageous proposal to increase fines from £20 to £150 for a first offence and from £50 to £350 for certain second and subsequent offences, in respect of, for example, parking violations. I could understand a reasonable fine for dangerous parking but in the built-up areas of the city and county of Dublin the prospect of parking is nil.  But for the fact that some of the traffic wardens have yellow bands around their caps I suspect that the tops of their heads would be parked on because of the lack of parking space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I protest in the strongest possible fashion that minor parking violations are to be subjected to a fine of this nature.  Until we can provide proper facilities for motorists we should not consider introducing fines of this nature.  The whole infrastructure in the city and county of Dublin is a scandal and a black mark on the planning authorities over the years. We are only now coming to grips with the Donnybrook to Bray road via Stillorgan. <Col N="272" /> That should have been done 20 years ago. We are only now coming to grips with the road to one of our main airports.  There is the other blight from the back of the Park, through Castleknock, through Clonee, to Navan.  That is another example of the type of hardship motorists have to put up with over the years.  When that problem is solved and when proper parking facilities are provided, fines such as those proposed in this Bill should be considered.</P>
    <P>The other problem is enforcement. Who will enforce the traffic laws?  Those of us who travel a great deal are passed by cars travelling far in excess of the speed limit.  Who enforces the law there? The traffic wardens in Dublin do their best.  They are not an unreasonable group of people.  They are courteous and they will give you five or ten minutes if they see you have a problem.  That is how the law should be enforced.  We should temper justice with courtesy.</P>
    <P>As far as other aspects are concerned such as dangerous driving and speeding, there should be a special corps set up within the Garda Síochána.  I will not engage in the current sport of Garda bashing.  I am a strong supporter of the Garda and very supportive of them, although I will be critical when necessary. The Government have an obligation to set up a traffic corps within the Garda to ensure the enforcement of the rules of the road.  This is essential.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the matter of road traffic deaths.  As a member of this House I have always asked about the number of road deaths per year.  Since 1969 an average of 500 people per year have died which means that 6,500 people have died in the Republic since that date.  We talk about the on-going tragedy of the North but &ldquo;only&rdquo; 2,300 people have died in the troubles there while this part of the country is suffering from a massive haemorrhage. It must not go unnoticed.  People are being killed on a daily basis but particularly at weekends when we seem to go on a frolic.  We have become blasé about road traffic deaths and injuries.  It is a sad commentary on this part of the island that we accept almost without demur the number of road traffic deaths since 1969 <Col N="273" /> while at the same time we properly lift our hands in horror when we hear of violent deaths in the Six Counties.  Road traffic deaths seen to be acceptable to the citizens of the Republic.  On the other hand, deaths through violence caused by the bomb and the bullet by the merchants of terror seem to affect us in a different way.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State who is in charge of this part of the Department to hold an inquiry into the whole problem of road traffic deaths.  It is of no concern to me whether it is a public inquiry or an inter-departmental inquiry as long as it is conducted as a matter of urgency.  We cannot be allowed to go on killing one another on the roads.  Certainly the Road Traffic Association have done their best and they make fine proclamations about the number of road traffic deaths reducing by, perhaps, 20 on the previous year. We are talking about a reduction from, say, 600 to 580 and we are meant to give three cheers for the new figures.  I do not want to under-rate the work being done by the Road Traffic Association.  But for their work the number of deaths and injuries would be far more significant.  At least they continue to emphasise the need to prevent us from killing and injuring one another.  On and on the ritual goes. It must be stopped.  It seems we are becoming an uncaring society.</P>
    <P>There will be newspaper headlines if somebody opens his or her mouth about divorce or contraception but the deaths of two or three young people in a car crash will merit only a small paragraph in a newspaper.  I am not being critical of the media.  They reflect their readership who, perhaps, may not want to know about the number of people dying every day on the roads.</P>
    <P>There is one contributor to the letters page of <i>the Irish Times</i> who writes weekly about road traffic deaths and injuries caused by drunken driving.  If the Minister intends holding some form of inquiry into the problem of road deaths he might examine the connection with drinking. Let us call a drunk a drunk.  He might consider the proposition that we should abandon the use of the breathalyser because anybody who drinks should not <Col N="274" /> drive.  Anybody found doing so should automatically have his or her licence suspended. I think this is the first time this has been said by an Irish politician.  So be it.  It will not make me very popular in certain quarters but that is a matter of total indifference to me.  If my contribution or those of other Deputies can reduce the number of road traffic deaths we will have done our job well.  I am asking the Minister as a matter of public urgency to have a look at the possibility of setting up some form of inquiry into the cause of road traffic deaths and injuries.  He should look at the reality of the relationship between road traffic deaths and injuries and drinking, as well as the infrastructure of our roads.  There are twisting, pot-holed roads in rural areas and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be useless unless the law is enforced by a special Garda corps and an inquiry is set up as a matter of urgency and action taken on their report within 12 months.  That may be too much to hope for.  There are so many reports on the shelf that I wonder if we will ever have a solution to any problem.</P>
    <P>My constituency colleague mentioned that I had raised by way of parliamentary question the matter of the Motor Taxation Office at River House.  I happen to be near River House from time to time in my professional capacity and I have seen long queues in bad weather outside that establishment.  I am in no way critical of the staff of that office who are an extremely courteous and overworked group of people.  Why do we not issue motor tax discs through the Post Office? I cannot understand why that is not done. The Minister should not come back with some half-baked excuse or some half-baked bureaucratic explanation because that would be unworthy of him.  He knows that what I am speaking about is the right solution to the problem.  If car tax discs were issued through post offices this would be of great convenience to the public.  If those tax discs are not issued through every post office they could be issued through a post office in each particular area.  It beats me why we should have to burden the people in River House <Col N="275" /> for tax discs for the city and county of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that in the event of the Minister not agreeing to the issuing of car tax discs through post offices he might consider setting up a taxation office on the south side of the river.  He could set one up in Dún Laoghaire or if it is not set up there a tax disc office should at least be set up some place in the south side of Dublin to cover the south side of the city.  This would be of great convenience to the public generally. There might be more jobs for the people who are issuing tax discs.  I do not want to deprive the people in River House of what they consider to be their particular jobs or that they should feel their jobs are in jeopardy.  I see those people working very hard and they are also very courteous.  I also see the other side of the problem with queues stretching out into the street often in very bad weather.</P>
    <P>Uninsured cars are another problem. There are quite a number of people who do not insure their cars.  Some of them will not insure their cars because they feel they should not do so.  They take a chance.  We are a great nation at taking chances.  It should be spelt out to those people that they are taking chances with other people's lives.  The Motor Insurers' Bureau deals with uninsured car collisions. I welcome the increase in the fines for uninsured motor vehicles.  The fines could not be high enough as far as I am concerned.  Where does the money for those fines go?  Should it not go into the pool administered by the Motor Insurers' Bureau?  Does it go into the Exchequer? Would the Minister insure that this money goes into the fund administered to take care of the victims of uninsured drivers?</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the wearing of seat belts.  There are some people who protest that their liberty is infringed in some way by an obligation to wear seat belts.  It has been proved without any doubt that seat belts have saved so many lives and also saved so many people being projected though the front window of cars that the compulsory wearing of seat <Col N="276" /> belts is a good law.  While the fines may be excessive in relation to other road traffic offences the fine in relation to the wearing of seat belts is correct.  I welcome that.  Some people have to be protected from themselves and their bad judgment. It is bad judgment on the part of people who get into motor cars and do not wear seat belts.  It is absolutely essential that people driving cars and their passengers should wear seat belts.</P>
    <P>There is an outrageous proposal in the Bill to vastly increase the fines in relation to traffic parking violations in certain circumstances. I hope the Minister will publicly urge our District Courts to exercise discretion in relation to the cases which come before them, to adjudicate each case on its merits.  If a person continually violates the parking regulations the maximum fine should be imposed on him.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which affects my constituency and I am sure it affects the Minister's constituency as well as other constituencies throughout the country.  I refer to people taking short cuts through housing estates and built-up areas.  If there is traffic jamming on the main roads people turn off into built-up areas.  This includes many areas where young children are playing and are at great risk.  I have been putting forward this proposition over the years.  Sometimes your propositions proposed over the years become a reality.  You continue plugging away until you see what you consider to be the correct solution implemented. The correct solution which has been used in the United States for many years to great effect is rumble strips to slow down speeding motorists.  If some of the people who travel through housing estates found that other motorists left the main roads and travelled through the estates where they live they would object but it seems to be a different matter when they do it through other housing estates. I am sure the problem we have in Dún Laoghaire in relation to motorists taking short cuts through housing estates is a problem in other parts of Dublin, other cities throughout the country and many of our large towns.</P>
    <P>The car has become a necessity, particularly in Dublin city and county, where <Col N="277" /> public transport has almost broken down. In some instances people have to wait in the most appalling weather for buses running late and two and three buses for the same destination pulling up behind one another at bus stops.  That is one of the reasons why cars are no longer regarded as a luxury.  If people living near the city and throughout the county of Dublin tried to get to work on public transport half of them would be late every day of the week.  The other tragic result of the breakdown in public transport throughout the city and county of Dublin is that when one has to go to work between 8.30 and 9.30 in the morning there are huge queues of traffic no matter from what part of the city or county one comes.</P>
    <P>Effectively to get from the main street in Dún Laoghaire to the main street in Dublin city takes an hour. Would the Minister consider the prospect of opening up a third lane on the road between Blackrock and, say, Ballsbridge?  Four traffic lanes are in operation there, two going into Dublin and two coming out of it.  Would the Minister consider opening up the second lane on the way out from the city to Blackrock between the hours of 8.30 a.m. and 9.30 a.m., in other words making a three-lane thoroughfare between Dún Laoghaire and Ballsbridge and leaving one lane only for traffic coming out from Dublin to Dún Laoghaire? The bus lanes appear to be working relatively well.  Could this not be an extension of the bus lane?  Let us open an outgoing lane as an ingoing lane at the height of the traffic in the morning and <i>vice versa</i> in the evening.  There is no reason why that should not be done.  I have never heard it being proposed before now.  I am proposing it now and the Minister during the course of his reply to this very necessary debate might respond to that problem.  Utilisation of the road traffic lanes in the direction opposite to which they are normally used might well speed up traffic.  The idea of taking an hour to go from Dún Laoghaire to O'Connell Bridge at the height of traffic is an appalling loss in terms of the economy.  Inevitably you will have cars with only one person in each.  I am not <Col N="278" /> blaming the Minister in this regard but I am pointing out the reality.  That is part of democracy; you can have whom you like as a passenger and if you want to go in your car on your own, so be it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the spirit and intention of the Bill.  I have put my marker down in relation to a number of matters and I urge on the Minister the possibility of opening a public or inter-departmental inquiry or an inquiry within the Department of the Environment, its deliberations to be published, in relation to road traffic deaths and road traffic deaths related to drink and driving.  Those who drink and drive should be penalised.  The sooner the better that we face up to the reality that as a matter of social justice, if not to ourselves to others, we should not be allowed even one drink and then drive.  I ask the Minister to examine this. I am not guiltless.  I am not doing a Persil operation on Deputy David Andrews but I have accumulated enough experience in this House over the last 20 years to respond to what I see as some of the problems confronting the community.  I will leave it at that and I thank the Minister for his attention during the course of my short contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill before the House is important legislation.  I want to touch on a couple of small items before dealing with the Bill itself.  I recommend to the Minister and his Department something that is not contained in this Bill or in any Road Traffic Acts that I have seen.  Side by side with every road tax disc displayed the owner or driver of a vehicle should be obliged to display an insurance disc. We have heard figures for the amounts of money paid out through the Motor Insurers' Bureau because of uninsured driving. If every owner or driver of a car could be compelled to display his motor insurance disc that would be of tremendous assistance to the Garda in detecting uninsured driving.  In court after court, day after day, week after week, people are charged for driving without insurance and the Garda have no possible way of knowing whether a vehicle is insured.  The simple device that I have mentioned would <Col N="279" /> involve no problem in enforcement.  If I am the owner of a car then it is my duty to see that the insurance disc is displayed beside the tax disc.  If I give my car to Mr. X to drive it is my duty and obligation to ensure that Mr. X is authorised to drive and to know and to ensure that he knows the limitations and difficulties regarding the use of my car.  This simple remedy brought into our legislation would be of tremendous assistance to everybody and would reduce the incidence of people driving motor cars while uninsured and injuring and killing people.  This method is very simple and probably that is why we are not following it.  Common sense cries out for a look into this matter.</P>
      <P>A young boy or girl gets a motor cycle, puts on a crash helmet and gear and drives away on the motor cycle, and is covered by insurance.  My son or daughter may be a pillion passenger on the back seat of that motor cycle.  God forbid the occurrence of an accident, but if the motor cycle hits a stone wall the likelihood is that the pillion passenger is not covered by insurance, about 90 per cent of pillion passengers are not covered by insurance.</P>
      <P>In the last few years I have met five young people not even in the prime of life who were physically maimed after being pillion passengers on motor cycles which met with accidents.  I have met a lovely girl of 18 years of age badly disfigured after being a pillion passenger on a motor cycle which hit a stone wall.  You would have to meet her to realise how badly she is affected.  She is unfit to work. She is permanently physically injured and will be handicapped for the rest of her life.  She cannot get employment anywhere. That young girl has no come-back against anybody.  The best she will get in this life from the State or anybody else is roughly £25 per week from the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to clarify that if the Ceann Comhairle will permit me.  If the driver of a motorcycle is involved in an accident with an oncoming vehicle it is likely that the other person would be held to be negligent to some extent.  If the other driver is held to be even 1 per cent negligent <Col N="280" /> a motorcycle pillion passenger will be able to sue the driver of the other vehicle and recover some damages.  However, if the driver of a motorcycle hits a stone wall and his pillion passenger is seriously injured the latter does not have redress against any person.  I have had to deal with many such cases.  It is frightening to realise that on any bank holiday weekend nine out of ten motorcycle pillion passengers who are injured will not have redress against anybody.  That indicates that there is a glaring loophole in the law.  It is an example of ineptitude on the part of those concerned with the enforcement of our road traffic laws. That glaring injustice must be remedied very soon.</P>
    <P>Through the efforts of the Departments of the Environment and Justice there has been a big reduction in the number of accidents since the introduction of the breathalyser.  It has proved worth while.  For the old section 49 cases it was necessary to have carried out many tests such as blood pressure and whether an accused could walk a straight line or not; but, luckily enough, they are gone and have been replaced by the breathalyser. Department officials, and the courts, ensure that breaches of this law are dealt with.  If the amount of the fines for driving while drunk are increased substantially I have no doubt that the message will get home to people that they are not entitled to drive while under the influence of drink.  That should help to reduce the number of accidents also.</P>
    <P>I notice that the fines for failure to wear safety belts have been increased substantially and I do not see anything wrong with that.  Many people are careless about seat belts and they should be made aware of the danger of driving without them.  There is no doubt that if more drivers and front seat passengers wore seat belts there would be a big reduction in the number of people seriously injured in accidents.  Two out of every three people injured in accidents would not have been had they worn seat belts, according to statistics, and that is why it is important to stress the necessity for wearing seat belts.  In fact, I suggest that the Department prepare a plan to compel <Col N="281" /> back seat passengers to wear seat belts. Lives could be saved and the extent of serious injury reduced if people wore seat belts.  I accept that the accidents will occur but the wearing of seat belts will reduce the extent of personal injury.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increase in the fines for illegal parking I should like to point out that the manner of parking often results in accidents.  People park cars carelessly at dangerous junctions and on narrow roads.  They park on double yellow lines and in areas where they are bound to cause a traffic hazard.  We must make an effort to get people to be more careful when parking.  In a ten-year period 170 people were killed and 4,000 injured in accidents involving parked cars and lorries.  That is one reason why we must make every effort to get people to be careful in regard to the parking of vehicles.  We should have a national policy on car parking.  However, in many instances people are forced to park their vehicles illegally because of the lack of adequate car parking facilities.  Parking is so restricted in cities like Dublin that it is difficult for out of town drivers to find a proper place.  City planners and local authorities should provide proper car parking facilities so that people are not forced to park cars in dangerous areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department should try to find proper parking space for lorries.  Many truck drivers are obliged to leave their heavily loaded vehicles, which in most cases are badly marked, on the sides of streets.  In most cases they represent a serious hazard for other road users.  A secure car parking area should be provided for such vehicles. If we do not produce a national policy on vehicle parking we will continue to have careless and haphazard parking. The authority are not placing sufficient emphasis on car parking with the result that drivers are not taking this matter as seriously as they should.</P>
    <P>People in towns and villages, particularly pedestrians and the elderly, should be encouraged to wear brighter clothes and reflective belts.  Many people walk along our roads at night without any reflective clothing and this causes accidents <Col N="282" /> because the motorist when driving along these dark roads in driving rain cannot see them.  A campaign encouraging people to wear this clothing would help reduce the number of accidents and this would benefit all.  The Minister should encourage the Department to start up such a campaign.</P>
    <P>From reading An Foras Forbartha reports one realises that many accidents occur in the vicinity of schools, churches and large shopping centres.  The Department should be encouraged to provide well marked pedestrian crossings in these areas.  There should be no problem arranging with the local authorities to provide these facilities.  If railings were provided near crossings, people would be encouraged to stay on the footpath until they reached the crossings.  This too would help reduce the number of accidents at known black spots.  It is easy to identify such places.  This matter should be looked into and greater emphasis should be placed on identifying these areas and providing these crossings.</P>
    <P>People should be made more aware of the dangers on our roads and they should be encouraged to adopt a more responsible attitude to using the roads.  The fines and increased penalties proposed here are part and parcel of a very important effort by the Department.  This is an on-going policy but it is very essential.  I recommend that the Minister continue his efforts with this very important work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this Bill and am pleased to see the updating of the legislation and that the new levels are keeping in line with inflation.  These figures are extremely high.  Uninsured drivers are the greatest risk on our roads, and there are many of them.  The maximum penalty for this and other offences has been increased to £1,000.  It is coincidental that this is the car insurance figure now being paid by many of our under 25-year-old drivers.  This is completely beyond their paying ability and that is why many young drivers do not have insurance and are taking the risk of driving without insurance.  As a result of this terrible loading, allied to the astronomically high figures being awarded by juries <Col N="283" /> to victims of accident cases, the amount for insurance cover for these young people is prohibitive.</P>
      <P>As public representatives we have a duty to provide realistic legislation to deal with crimes.  On the other hand, we have a duty to ensure that the necessary insurance cover is available to all drivers, including young drivers who cannot get cover, or if they can, cannot pay for it. On the basis of age and experience it is discrimination to deprive or impede one group from what they require &mdash; to avail of the right to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle.  I realise this does not fall within the brief of the Minister of State but I appeal to him to request co-ordination on the problem of insurance with his colleague, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill but I believe there is a major vacuum in it particularly with regard to drunken and dangerous driving penalties.  While I could not condone drunken driving, I believe the operation of the laws in this area are far too extreme at the minor end; by this I mean just plain drunken driving.  I am not here to speak for drunken drivers.  Because I do not participate in the consumption of those much desired beverages, I believe what I have to say might get more credence. There is a necessity for strict legislation and stricter penalties to be introduced in certain cases of drunken driving.  After this Bill is passed the person who drinks three pints of alcohol, leaves a tavern, is breathalysed half-a-mile down the road, fails the test, is summoned and taken to court, will be fined £1,000.  Contrast this with the situation where a person filled with alcohol, as loaded as an oil tanker, gets into his car, starts to drive and after a short time crosses to the other side of the road hitting an oncoming car: there is a very bad smash; both drivers are injured and the sober driver is dead.  Another driver summons the priest, doctor, the Garda and the ambulance and after a few minutes several people have congregated to give assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What a horrendous scene.  Both people are admitted to hospital in the same ambulance &mdash; the sober driver who dies <Col N="284" /> and the drunken driver who was injured. After one night in hospital the drunken driver is discharged.  The Garda investigate the situation and draw up a report. A court case ensues.  The drunken driver is summoned to court and the Garda report establishes that the car had no rear white light, had a bald tyre, and the drunken driver admits he was not wearing a safety belt.  He is fined £5 on all charges. One might well contrast this with the situation in which if this man had been driving down the road and failed a breathalyser test he would be fined £1,000.  As a result of the court case the family of the victim of the accident, the dead driver &mdash; the breadwinner of a family, perhaps the owner of a car on hire purchase &mdash; have no recourse whatever to justice.</P>
    <P>Surely there is a major vacuum in the law here.  This Bill has avoided tackling that situation.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this omission is rectified, so there will be the necessary recourse to justice and the appropriate penalties for the offence of drunken driving where it is the cause of killing or maiming people on the road and so that the perpetrators of such drunken-driving would be brought to justice.</P>
    <P>I agree with other Deputies in their pleas for the expedition of payment of road taxes and the ease with which these can be paid.  They should all be payable through any post office just as are television, dog and other licences.  There is no reason that the payment of road tax could not be rendered easier for Seán Citizen.  Payment in this manner would result in less city and urban traffic adjacent to motor taxation offices and more money becoming available to the Department of the Environment through speedier payment at post offices.</P>
    <P>I consider the proposed fines for parking in public places fairly extreme. Indeed, the State has failed over the years to provide proper parking facilities outside public offices.  We are all aware that people must go to public offices for various reasons.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach if, in view of the serious and far-reaching implications of the placing of concealed listening equipment in a house in which the Deputy Leader of the SDLP stays in Dublin and the statements emanating from the Taoiseach and other Government sources about the affair, he will immediately establish a full judicial inquiry into all aspects of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues that have been raised about this matter can be grouped under two headings.  The first is the event itself &mdash; that is, who put in the listening device and with what motives. The second is the response at various levels to the complaint.</P>
      <P>A judicial inquiry could not be expected to establish who put in the listening device or with what motives and I do not see how anybody could seriously suggest that it might do so.</P>
      <P>As for the response to the complaint, the central facts are already known, are at least in large measure independently verifiable, and are not, I believe, in dispute. This latter point is important because it may have been obscured as a result of the rapidity with which report has followed report in the news media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to re-state the main facts.  On 16 November last Mr. Mallon gave to an official in a Government Department two documents for transmission to me.  One of them related to an apparent attempt to instal a listening device in a house where Mr. Mallon stays.  I got the documents two days later and sent them to the Minister for Justice.  The second document was dealt with by the Minister for Justice and I need not refer to it further at this point.  The first document, relating <Col N="286" /> to the apparent bugging attempt, was sent to the Garda Síochána for inquiry.</P>
    <P>An official statement, issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána yesterday, explains in detail what happened next.  Briefly, the Garda quite reasonably decided to begin their inquiries by getting in touch with Posts and Telegraphs officials who were referred to in the document.  They discovered that Posts and Telegraphs officials had already carried out an investigation as a result of an approach made to the Post Office by one of the occupants of the house arising from suspicions about wiring in the house.  Posts and Telegraphs officials had been to the house twice and had been shown certain wiring done by men who had held themselves out to be employees of the Post Office working on a new telephone installation. They did not purport to be coming to correct a fault although a fault on the line had been reported shortly beforehand. No microphone or transmitter had been found by those investigating officials and no reference had been made to them about anything other than wiring, nor to the fact that Séamus Mallon stayed in the house.  The impression the Posts and Telegraphs officials got &mdash; an impression they understood to be shared by at least one of the occupants &mdash; was that it was an attempt to &ldquo;case&rdquo; the house with a view to a subsequent burglary and in fact a report reflecting that view was made to the local Garda station at Howth.</P>
    <P>Information to this effect was given to me on 11 January by the Minister for Justice.  Shortly afterwards, I met Séamus Mallon, spoke to him on other matters and, because time for discussion was limited, gave him copies of statements by two Posts and Telegraphs officials so that he could read them for himself.  I had in mind particularly the fact that those statements appeared to show a discrepancy between what was now being said and what had been said earlier.  A week later he handed back the statements without comment on the contents.  As he made no comment on them other than to express his regret that he had not given them back to me sooner, I took it that he accepted that the situation was as it had <Col N="287" /> been reported by the Post Office official and that he was not pursuing the allegations about a microphone and transmitter made in the original statement.</P>
    <P>It was only after this information had been supplied, through the Minister for Justice, to me that the Garda Síochána decided to pursue the matter further and to interview the occupants of the house. Again the reason was explained in yesterday's official statement and is, briefly, that they were very doubtful about doing so since the occupants had, apparently deliberately, decided to raise the matter with the Post Office and not with them. It must be said that events showed that this was by no means an unreasonable attitude as the initial response the Garda inspector got when he approached the occupants was one of surprise that the Garda should be carrying out any investigation. I think the point needs to be made at some stage, and this is as good as any other, that while Mr. Mallon's status is well recognised he is not the occupier of the house and it was the occupants' view or attitude that the Garda had to regard as the primary one.</P>
    <P>Since the official statement was issued yesterday, two questions have been raised that I think it right to answer now. The first concerns the alleged tardiness of the initial Garda response.  I have already explained why the Garda did not interview the occupants earlier.  They had, of course, long since made contact with the Posts and Telegraphs officials.  It is not to be overlooked that the installation of the device appears to have been on 1 November but it was not until over a fortnight later that Mr. Mallon handed over a statement about it.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that there was an interval of some weeks between the Garda contacts with the Post Office and my response to Séamus Mallon.  There is a perfectly reasonable explanation.  At that point the incident appeared to have been explained and almost the entire senior level of the Garda Síochána at headquarters and indeed in other divisions, was taken up with one aspect or another of the Tidey kidnapping and the murders of Garda Gary Sheehan and Private <Col N="288" /> Patrick Kelly.  As a result, the report was not cleared by a senior officer for transmission.</P>
    <P>The second question that has been raised since yesterday is why, if the Garda refrained from interviewing the occupants before early January, they then changed their minds.  The answer is that when their report was received in the Department of Justice it was immediately sent to me because I was about to meet Séamus Mallon but after that, as a result of an evaluation by the Minister for Justice, it was suggested to the Garda that there could be no real objection to their seeking an interview with the occupants and that it would be better to do so.  The subsequent Garda inquiries which began only in about the second week in January are not, in fact, completed.  They are concerned with the question of who put in the device and with what motive.</P>
    <P>I note that spokesmen for the Opposition have challenged the statement that the whole installation was crude and inefficient.  I can deal with that matter very simply.  I am asking the Minister for Justice to make an arrangement, the details of which will be communicated to the Opposition Whip, under which the equipment in question and enlarged photographs of the manner of wiring will be available for inspection by any member of the House at a place to be specified. The same facility will be offered to journalists nominated for that purpose by the national or provincial newspapers.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the only question that appears to remain, which is the allegation that Government sources have been alleging, without proof, that the device was installed by representatives of the Provisional IRA.  The Government Information Service have been constantly pressed to say what is the official view as to the likely explanation of this unusual event.  The only official view that matters in this context is the view of the Garda Síochána.  If the question had been asked even a few days ago, the answer would have been that the Garda had no theory that they themselves would offer as probable.  However, I am advised that the Garda have now reason to have a much firmer view on this point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> There can be no doubt that it was a project that was meant to be discovered, as in fact it was.  The Garda believe that it was intended to generate confusion.  It does not necessarily follow that it was intended to be publicised.  One theory is that it was not necessarily intended to do more than cause worry to Mr. Mallon, who could be expected to hear about it immediately.  One way or the other, the Garda believe that those responsible are members of a subversive organisation, though not necessarily acting with the knowledge of the most senior leaders of the organisation.  They are not at the moment in a position to prove this, however.</P>
    <P>I believe that this answers the questions that have been raised, but there is one thing more that I must add.  Mr. Mallon has stated that there was no connection between the two documents he initially sent to me and there was at least an implication that I should not have referred to the other document.  I accept without question Mr. Mallon's good faith but I am afraid that, to me, there is a connection and for two reasons.  The first is that I responded, even though negatively, to his representations on this second document, something that shows that I did not ignore him, or either of the two documents.  The second is that the person on whose behalf those representations were made is a relative of one of the occupants of the house and was a person who was consulted by the occupants about the device in the house.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, that person is one who at present stands charged with an offence involving the alleged possession or control of explosive substances or devices. Despite what I understand to have been said on radio by the Opposition spokesman on Justice, the fact that a particular person has appeared before a court and is awaiting trial is a matter of public record and it is quite appropriate that it should be referred to where there is a good and sufficient reason for doing so, as I believe there is now.</P>

      <P>The statement which I issued &mdash; just allow me to get the text of it, I am just looking for the exact words &mdash; made it clear that the original complaint related to an allegation of a bugging device.

      <P>Despite the fact that the Taoiseach knew that central to this whole matter was a microphone and a transmitter, he attempted to convey the impression last Sunday to the Irish public that only a relatively harmless piece of telephone wire was found.  In view of the fact that the Taoiseach has, on a number of occasions adverted to what a very fair-minded person would regard as an extraneous matter &mdash; namely, the situation of the nephews of the householder and, in particular, in view of the fact that he put a reference to one of those nephews at the head of his statement last Sunday &mdash; would he regard as an unfair interpretation by me of his behaviour in this matter, that he attempted to deter Séamus Mallon from pursuing it any further?</P>

      <P>I would certainly regard that as an unfair conclusion to draw.  I would point out that the statement which I issued was prepared by me immediately after I heard the allegation in the <i>Sunday Tribune,</i> that I thought it right to put on record the situation as it had been known to me up to that time and to add that an approach from the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> was the first intimation that I have had of any further development as a result of Garda inquiries and that I was seeking a full report on these matters.  It was only on that night in the course of my inquiries that I became <Col N="292" /> aware of the fact that there had been further Garda inquiries and that a report of these inquiries existed.  My concern was to clarify the position as it was known to me at that point, to make it clear that I would be reporting further when I had information on these Garda inquiries of which I had just learned in the course of the night as I investigated the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> allegation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach has consistently over the last twelve months spoken about his alleged fears about a police state and similar-type allegations, does he think it now credible for him to suggest that in a matter as serious as this he had only a perfunctory interest in it and that he was prepared to leave it to one or two officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to pursue the inquiries and not to insist that the Garda, who were the people directly and immediately involved, carry out a full investigation? How can he ask this House to believe that from 16 November, as he says &mdash; although we believe that it was 9 November &mdash; he did not insist that the Minister for Justice and the Garda Síochána carry out an immediate and urgent investigation into the matter?</P>

      <P>When I received the original communication, I passed it to the Minister for Justice and asked him to investigate it.  I did not receive a report for some time.  When it came to January, and there had been the whole question of the Tidey kidnapping and Ballinamore in between, I was concerned to be able to inform Séamus Mallon of the position. Therefore, I made inquiries and I received the report which I handed to him.  On the face of it, that report showed that the Post Office investigators had not found and had not been shown any microphone or transmitter and that no microphone or transmitter had been mentioned to them.  I handed that report to Séamus Mallon so that he could see for himself, rather than by simply a verbal communication from me, that the original suggestion made in the unsigned statement he had handed to me was not <Col N="293" /> borne out by the Post Office investigation. I awaited a response from him.  He came back to me and handed it back to me without comment, from which I drew the conclusion that he accepted what was in the report and that the earlier suggestion must have been without foundation. I presumed if he felt the earlier suggestion was valid, despite what was said in the report, he would take up the matter further with me.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach gave the report in the first instance to the Minister for Justice, not to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Presumably the Taoiseach wanted a Garda investigation but two months later he receives a rather inconsequential flimsy report from two Post Office officials and passes that on to Séamus Mallon as if that were a satisfactory reply.  Is the Taoiseach aware that subsequent to 11 January or 12 January, when that rubbish report from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had been passed on to Séamus Mallon, he, Séamus Mallon, raised the matter with the official whom he had approached in the first place asking if he was going to get any further information or reports about it?  Does not the Taoiseach admit that this House can hardly accept that a flimsy report by two Post Office officials is any substitute for a Garda report, particularly when he had asked the Minister for Justice to get him such a Garda report?</P>

      <P>Because Séamus Mallon was directly involved I thought the appropriate action was that he should see precisely what had been discovered as a result of Garda inquiries.  However, although the contents of the Garda report did not go significantly beyond that, I did not think it proper to hand over to a private citizen an actual Garda report.

      <P>The Taoiseach has mentioned on a number of occasions the matter of the assiduous campaign which has been engaged in by the GIS, of which he is head, to sell &mdash; and as far as I can see successfully sell &mdash; to the media a story that either some gang of subversives or some gang of ordinary burglars were responsible for this operation.  In that connection, does the Taoiseach advert to the fact that within two hours after a telephone complaint had been made to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs these three individuals appeared at the house and carried out this operation? Does the Taoiseach attribute either to the subversive organisation in question or to some ordinary gang of burglars the foreknowledge of that complaint to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs? Does not the conjunction of those events not indicate to him, to me and to everyone else that there was some official involvement in the placing of this equipment in this house?</P>

      <P>I adverted specifically to that in my statement.  I mentioned that the visit of these men to the house followed immediately after a fault on the telephone had been reported.  However, they did not come to the house purporting to repair the fault.  Their reason was a quite different one, to instal new wiring in connection with a new development in the telephone system in the area.  I do not know what significance to attach to the conjunction of the two events.  I think it is open to two interpretations: one, that the two events were coincidental and, two, that the people concerned had managed to cause a fault in the system immediately before calling.  However, as they did not use the fault as the excuse for calling or refer to it, I do not think it is necessary to assume the latter, more sinister explanation; but obviously I am not in a position to make a judgment between the two possible explanations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach began his reply to me by saying that the judicial inquiry would not be able to establish who installed the equipment.  We have judges sitting regularly who establish who carried out murders; we have judges sitting regularly who establish all kinds of rather obscure matters, who find out the facts and come to a decision.  Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that a judicial inquiry could not establish the full facts of this matter with the full co-operation of the Garda Síochána?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that under our system of justice the investigation of crime, or possible crime, is a matter for the Garda Síochána in pursuit of their inquiries.  When they have sufficient evidence they submit it to the DPP, a case is taken in court and the Judiciary play their part in helping to determine whether an offence has been committed, with the assistance of a jury in some cases but without a jury in others.  The idea that a judicial inquiry could itself carry out the investigation into who was responsible &mdash; that is normal Garda <Col N="297" /> detective work &mdash; would suggest an unusual concept of a judicial inquiry, one unfamiliar to us in this State.  There may be such systems of justice in other countries where they have examining magistrates, but in our system a judicial inquiry could not fulfil that function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely the function of a judicial inquiry in matters of this sort to establish exactly who was responsible or guilty.  That is the procedure that has been resorted to on many an occasion. Does the Taoiseach recall that he gave a solemn commitment some time ago to establish a judicial inquiry into allegations of political interference in the Garda Síochána?  Surely this is a much more specific matter that a judicial inquiry could investigate.  In view of his own personal involvement in this either through negligence or failure to prosecute something of fundamental far-reaching importance, the suspicions that have been cast in regard to the behaviour of the Garda Síochána and the Post Office and the whole atmosphere of confusion that surrounds it, will the Taoiseach now give the House an assurance that he will have the matter dealt with in the only feasible and satisfactory way in which it can be dealt with, namely, the establishment of a full scale public judicial inquiry to ascertain and to publish the facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reasons stated in my reply I do not propose to take that course of action.  I propose that the Garda Síochána should continue their inquiries, which have not been completed.  It is a matter for them to seek to establish who was responsible for this action and to initiate proceedings against any people against whom they can find evidence.</P>

The Taoiseach, who has talked much about the dangers of a police state and security matters, now tells us three months afterwards that the Garda have not completed their inquiries, despite the fact that on 11 January he <Col N="298" /> tried to pass off a flimsy P and T report on Séamus Mallon in satisfaction of a query about this matter.

These reports did not verify the statements originally made.  They were at variance with them, and suggested the absence of any indication that there was a microphone or transmitter, but only wiring; and, as one of the occupants of the house indicated, this was likely to be a case of somebody seeking to prepare for a burglary of the house.  The only evidence was a wire with nothing connected to its end, and no reference had been made by the householder to any microphone or transmitter. That is what I passed to Séamus Mallon and at no stage did Séamus Mallon suggest to me that the original allegation made was substantial or that he was dissatisfied with that report which, on the face of it, showed no evidence of any microphone or transmitter.</P>

      <P>The Garda have investigated the matter but they have not yet succeeded in identifying the perpetrators. In any criminal investigation it takes time to identify those involved.  To that extent, the Garda inquiries have not been completed.  They are continuing.  As I said, they have reason to believe that the authors of this are members of a subversive organisation.  They have not yet been able to complete their inquiries to the point of bringing charges against any group of people.  It is a matter for them to pursue their inquiries to a conclusion. I hope it will be a successful conclusion that will clarify the matter once and for all.  I am most anxious that that should happen.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to explore this matter.  I know the Taoiseach accepts that this is a matter of very serious and far-reaching implications. Would he not accept that the proper procedure in matters of this sort is for the Garda to carry out inquiries and place the result of these inquiries before a properly constituted judicial tribunal who would then decide on a verdict on the facts?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that that is a time honoured, well established way to deal with this matter, particularly in view of the fact, rightly or wrongly, that there is a suspicion that the <Col N="300" /> Garda themselves may or may not in some way have been involved in the matter, or that at least some official agency may or may not have been involved? Does he not think that in these circumstances he owes it to himself, to the Garda and to Séamus Mallon to have a full scale judicial inquiry without delay as the only satisfactory manner to satisfy the House and the general public about the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that the normal procedure after a Garda investigation is &mdash; he omitted this part &mdash; that if they find evidence against individuals the evidence is submitted to the DPP with a view to prosecution should the DPP find that the evidence is sufficient.  The Garda have not identified anybody at this stage as being the perpetrator of this event.  Therefore, their inquiries are incomplete, and reference to the DPP in the ordinary way is irrelevant.  For the reasons I have already stated I do not propose there should be a judicial inquiry.  I have endeavoured to clarify every aspect of the matter fully and frankly in response to the Deputy's question.  We now hope that the Garda can carry their inquiries to a successful conclusion.</P>

      <P>Neither I nor the GIS have made irresponsible allegations.  The position is as I have stated.  The Garda have reason to believe that the perpetrators of this are members of a subversive organisation.  They are not in a position to identify particular persons and to proceed <Col N="301" /> against them at present.  I stated that to this House and in confirmation of what has been indicated in response to press inquiries.  I think that is entirely appropriate. With regard to the matter of a debate, I am frankly astonished.  As the Deputy is aware, a short while ago the Government proposed to the Deputy that there should be a debate on this matter, rather than this question and answer process, because the matter could be more fully developed in a debate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the proposed excess penalties in this Bill for illegal parking in public places.  Over the years the State has initiated this type of illegal problem because the location of many Government Departments and <Col N="303" /> agency offices in the heart of our cities and towns has made it impossible for the public, who use these offices to get what they are entitled to, to park.  Private institutions who want to purchase, acquire or develop property in similar locations have to get planning permission to do so, and one of the conditions they have to comply with is the provision of parking facilities.  I appeal to the Minister to try to ensure that reasonable parking facilities are made available in close proximity to all Government and public offices so that physically able-bodied people, or people who may be physically retarded or disabled, would have proper parking facilities available to them.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the fines proposed for speeding.  Since the energy crisis the maximum speed limit on our national primary and secondary roads is 55 mph.  Despite the fact that energy is readily available its cost has not lessened in the meantime.  We should now have the abolition of speed limits on our national primary roads.  There should be open driving without limitation on our national primary roads.  There should be certain limits on our secondary roads and lower limits on minor and other roads.</P>
      <P>We have an ever-increasing population. In modern times with a high rate of unemployment, it is inevitable that our people should turn to the normal types of recreation on more numerous occasions than heretofore.  As a result we have many pedestrians, cyclists and joggers on the roads during the day and in the evening at twilight.  Many of these people are a major hazard for our drivers because they do not wear armbands.  A person may be walking, running or cycling along the road at twilight, or in the dark, with no armband or light, and a driver comes around the corner not expecting to meet oncoming traffic and goes bang into the pedestrian, runner or cyclist.  The result is another death on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know drivers are the victims at all times in those situations The gossip is that the driver was drunk or a careless person, or perhaps he was even blind.  He wore glasses.  That is said after a tragedy which could be averted if we had proper <Col N="304" /> legislation.  What about the poor innocent victim who did not wear an armband? More pedestrians, cyclists and joggers are using the roads and of course we have more drivers.  The laws are loaded against the motorist.  Why?  Surely there should be equality within the law in both content and application for all road users. The wearing of armbands should be compulsory for all road users except motorists. The displaying of a tax disc is obligatory for a motorist and, in the same way, the wearing of an armband should be compulsory for all other road users.  I call on the Minister of State to draft the necessary legislation and bring it before this House as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to drunken driving. The law or perhaps the weight of medical opinion prevents an injured driver, drunken or otherwise, who is admitted to hospital as the result of an accident from having a blood sample taken, or a breathalyser test, or giving a urine sample.  Surely a blood sample would be a simple solution to a major problem with regard to the application of road traffic law and ensuring that justice is available to all our citizens?  The time has come for urgent action to eliminate this loophole in the law.  Those responsible for thoughtless actions culminating in the death of innocent law-abiding citizens must be brought to justice and the most severe penalties must be imposed for these savage breaches of the law.  I appeal to the Minister on behalf of the families of all the victims killed or maimed on the roads to remedy this problem immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an important measure which is somewhat overdue.  I fail to understand why we cannot devise some system of updating fines and penalties rather than waiting for new legislation to come before the Oireachtas.  It must be possible to find some way of reviewing every few years the levels of maximum fines which courts can impose. The level of fines in respect of some road traffic offences has become a complete nonsense and the same applies in many other areas of the law.  They are so outdated as to make a complete farce of the <Col N="305" /> judicial system.  Judges are frequently blamed for the levels of penalties they impose in certain cases and people do not often recognise that judges can only apply the law within the discretion which the Oireachtas allows.  It has been the case for the past few years that it has been much cheaper to drive uninsured and incur a penalty of £100 or £200 if caught than to pay an insurance premium.  It is ludicrous that things have reached such a stage.</P>
      <P>Many Members have dwelt on our appalling accident record.  It is a feature of media comment to blame high jury awards for the high cost of insurance.  I do not blame the media for this.  This comment is inspired by some insurance companies who wish to point out that the reason for high insurance is the size of these awards.  The reasons for the high cost of insurance are the appallingly high accident rate and the appallingly high rate of uninsured driving.  This Bill will go some way to deal with the latter point but it is only one step towards what needs to be done.  The Minister made the point during his speech on Second Stage that he would be introducing a further Bill later in the year.  I welcome this commitment but I am sorry he did not use the opportunity to set out some of the things he proposes to do.  There have been a number of reports on what might be done to get the problem under control.</P>
      <P>One of the major causes of high insurance is the rate of accidents.  The report published by the committee who reported in December 1982 on the cost of insurance indicated that in Ireland there are 7.2 road deaths per 10,000 drivers compared with 3.4 per 10,000 drivers in Great Britain and 2.9 in Norway.  Our record is appalling.  This problem could be approached in various ways.  There is something of a vicious circle because the high rate of road accidents must obviously lead to high insurance costs and this in turn must lead to a high rate of uninsured driving, particularly when the problem is out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make some suggestions, most of which will already be known to the Minister because of the report to which I have referred and other reports.  Our <Col N="306" /> laws compare very badly with those in other European countries with regard to driving and motor insurance.  The standard of our driving test is inadequate and it must be raised.  There should be no question of a backlog arising in the number of applicants awaiting a driving test. We must never have a repeat of the appalling mistake made some years ago when the Minister for the Environment, because of the large number of people awaiting a driving test, decided to abolish the queue altogether.  Everybody who was on the waiting list was given a licence without having to do a test.  If that is the measure of the seriousness with which we take the highest accident rate in Europe, Governments and the officials who advise Ministers have a lot to answer for.</P>
    <P>Alcohol consumption makes a substantial contribution to the level of accidents and our approach has been too simplistic. I would urge that the law be reviewed in two respects.  As suggested in the report on motor insurance, some differentiation should be made between the alcohol content which would be permissible for younger people and older people.  There is medical evidence to suggest that the level which might be acceptable in a fully grown adult might not be acceptable in a young driver.  There is a strong case to be made for reducing the present content level but it should not be an absolute reduction.  At the moment it stands at 100 so far as a blood test is concerned.  That could be reduced to 80 but the presumption of guilt should rest with the person charged who has an alcohol content between 80 and 100 in the bloodstream. A person who is found to have an alcohol content of 85 in his blood and brought before the court should be acquitted if he can prove that his driving was in order. An onus should be put on persons who have taken any alcohol.  It might be a bit harsh to reduce the level from 80 but there is a strong case to be made for reducing it from 100 to 80.  If a person driving a vehicle is seen to be at fault that person should be liable to prosecution for having taken alcohol and driven.  If, on the other hand, his or her driving can be shown not to have been at fault then that person should be acquitted.  A person <Col N="307" /> should certainly be convicted of an offence if the alcohol level is over 100.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Garda who, with very limited resources, are expected to police all sorts of activities.  If we are to tackle the problems of uninsured driving and the use of cars which are not road-worthy we must have more extensive checks by the Garda.  There should be a compulsory annual road test for cars aged three years or more.  Gardaí or special wardens should operate a constant checking system until we arrest the problem.</P>
    <P>Some insurance companies estimate that the level of uninsured driving is in the order of 20 per cent or 25 per cent. The Garda in a survey they carried out found the level to be 22 per cent.  Two or three years ago the level was estimated at about 10 per cent.  Somewhere between all those figures lies the truth.  It is impossible to estimate accurately what the true figure is.  We have an outrageously high level of uninsured driving which is multiples of the level of uninsured driving which occurs in other countries. If we are not prepared to tackle that problem by putting resources into it, we have no business complaining about it.  Insurance companies and consumers have no business complaining about the cost of insurance unless we are prepared to tackle this where it matters &mdash; the enforcement of existing laws.  I regard this as very important and I regret that something has not been done more urgently in relation to it.  The report I referred to was published in December 1982.  There has been adequate time to bring in something more than the increase in penalties proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There was a provision in section 57 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, where a judge of the District Court who was dealing with a charge of a person driving without insurance, could impose a penalty which was the equivalent of damage done to the other person's car if there was a crash.  That was known as a &ldquo;piggy back&rdquo; claim.  If the crash was the fault of an uninsured driver, instead of the victim having to introduce civil proceedings to recover money from the miscreant a district justice could impose a fine.  If there <Col N="308" /> was damage costing £1,000 done to a third party's car, the District Justice could impose a fine of £1,000.  I regarded that as a most efficient section in our law so far as these cases are concerned.  It worked quickly and put the onus for discharging the penalty on the person responsible.  It avoided duplication of legal proceedings and it also ensured that a person before a judge dealing with a criminal matter would have to respond realistically to facing up to the damage he had done.  At the moment, if a person driving an uninsured car causes damage and if the person injured thinks of suing that person, he can sue him; but, unless the person who causes the accident has means or assets that can be taken, the third party victim has no prospect of recovering any money.  He has to undertake the cost of bringing his own civil proceedings in order to obtain a judgment against the miscreant.</P>
    <P>Section 57 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, dealt with that problem.  Unfortunately it was found to be unconstitutional. I searched in the Library this evening to see if I could find a copy of the judgment but I failed to find it.  I recall reading that judgment very carefully at the time.  It was quite clear from reading it that there was a way out of the problem. There was another way of re-introducing the provisions of section 57.  I am sorry that the Ministers responsible for this matter over the last few years have not taken the trouble to re-introduce that provision.  It was a highly efficient and effective one.  In regard to the whole question of uninsured driving, this is very important.  I urge the Minister in the second Road Traffic Bill, which he has promised us later this year, to give serious consideration to the re-introduction of that provision.  I will be delighted to receive an explanation if there is some reason why that cannot be done.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with some suggestions which might help to solve the problem of uninsured driving.  There are two final areas I want to deal with in relation to this matter.  The first one is the constant attack on the system of jury awards.  I can understand people's frustration when they get their motor insurance premium <Col N="309" /> account which shows a charge of £400 or £500 and they pick up their newspaper and find a very abbreviated report that somebody has received an award of £500,000, £750,000 or some other amount.  I can understand their feeling of frustration and annoyance because their insurance premiums are so high, but I can also understand insurance companies constantly saying that jury awards here are far too high, particularly when they complain they lost money in the motor insurance business.  I am obliged to say from my own experience that one cannot generally offer the view that jury awards are too high.  I know of cases in which people succeeded in obtaining awards that seemed very high five and six years ago, but with the ravages of inflation these have been reduced to very little.  I am talking about people who have been very seriously injured in road traffic accidents and who require constant medical treatment and care as a result of injuries received.</P>
    <P>I am not just talking about those people who have been reduced to a state of being vegetables as a result of road traffic accidents.  It is tragic that those victims of road traffic accidents who get the high awards are not in any position to defend the awards.  It is sadder still that the people who will benefit from such awards in the future, if the system is left there, are not in a position to speak because they have not yet suffered their accidents.  There are thousands of people throughout the country who have yet to suffer the most appalling injuries on the roads.  We are codding ourselves about what is really wrong if we put the blame for high insurance premiums on our accident victims and the juries who give them the awards.  I object to the way insurance companies and other interest groups throughout the country have blamed the high level of jury awards for the high cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>I challenge those people to go through the awards and show me where in the generality of all awards made those awards have been too high.  I believe that the President of the High Court is the judge who is vested with responsibility for looking after wards of court.  As far <Col N="310" /> as road traffic accidents are concerned, wards of court would generally be people who are so seriously injured that they are unable to manage their affairs because of the mental damage caused to them.  I am told that the judge in charge of that section has been concerned that awards given to those people in the past simply have not been sufficient to meet their requirements as the years have gone on.  This is not a very popular thing to shout about. I know of instances of fatal accident cases and personal injuries cases where people who had not lucky investments have not been able to retain in their awards the necessary value to overcome the inflationary problems we have had.  I caution Deputies who tend to rush in to make comments about those awards to think very carefully about the people who suffer appallingly bad injuries and even the people who suffer injuries which are not quite so bad.</P>
    <P>We cannot blame the victims of motor accidents for the cost of motor insurance. We are going about the matter in the correct way if we reduce the number of victims or if we ensure that everybody who is driving pays into the system.  I find it reprehensible to say of those poor victims, some of whom were thrown on the scrap heap after their accidents, that it is their fault and that they are getting too much.  I am glad I have not heard any Minister make any remarks along those lines.  It is far too easy a line to take and is one which, if pursued, will not deal with the problem we have.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that there are some changes which should be made in our legal system which would help make the system more efficient.  I am glad to say that recently the High Court have significantly caught up with the arrears of work which had built up a couple of years ago.  That is very important.  There are other changes which could be made. Judges should be permitted to advise juries about the type of awards given by other juries and a certain pattern should be established for specific types of injuries.  That could be done to useful effect.  Aspects of legal procedure could be changed, for example the system of having two senior counsel in all cases. <Col N="311" /> However, effectively those are very small areas and we are only creeping around the side of the problem.  The real problem is our high accident rate and uninsured driving.  I have dealt with the problem of the high accident rate and made some suggestions that might be of assistance. I want to make a last comment on that. The National Road Safety Association should be funded sufficiently to allow them to carry out far more work in bringing to the attention of people the cost of our high accident rate in terms both of insurance and damage to life.  We have seen on television and through the other media some very effective advertising campaigns.</P>
    <P>In the last year or two we have not seen quite so much of that and I would be concerned if that is to develop into cost-cutting because that would be penny wise, pound foolish.  They should be given sufficient funds to enable them to carry out a constant, comprehensive, well-funded programme to draw to people's attention the cost involved in road traffic accidents and the appalling human misery resulting from them. Insurance companies should be encouraged to involve themselves in that field also.  I would like to compliment the Hibernian Insurance Company who involve themselves by advising people about how to reduce risks.  They do not confine themselves merely to road traffic accidents, but they refer to all sorts of risks on the various policies they offer.  That is a good and sensible approach from an insurance company.  I ask insurance companies to go along with the National Road Safety Association or perhaps go on their own in investing in programmes advertising and educating the public on the dangers involved in all of this.</P>
    <P>I want to move to the question of uninsured driving particularly among young people.  It is incomprehensible that it has become so expensive for young people to take out insurance that many of them are driving without insurance.  I do not think that there is any other explanation for the level of uninsured driving we have which amounts to somewhere between 20 and 25 per cent of all drivers.  We have about <Col N="312" /> three-quarters of a million drivers in the country and if 20 to 25 per cent of those are uninsured, then apart from the appalling law-breaking that is taking place, the amount of money that insurance companies are closing off for themselves by charging such high premiums must be significant.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies who operate in the motor insurance field give all sorts of commitments to Government that they will refuse insurance to nobody on the grounds of age alone.  I understand that an agreement called the declined cases agreement is in existence and was entered into by the motor insurance companies with the Minister in 1981.  Under that agreement insurance companies undertook to refuse insurance to no person because of age alone.  Again I understand that that system is meant to work, or works, as the case may be, that a young person who is refused insurance at six different insurance companies has the right to complain to a monitoring committee in the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who can then oblige the first company to whom that young person went to quote that person and give him insurance.  I say I understand that the agreement contains those provisions and that it works as I have outlined because I do not know what is in the agreement.  When I asked to see that agreement first I was told that it was a secret agreement and I could not see it.  Since then there has been a sort of breakdown in the attitude of the insurance companies or the Department &mdash; I do not know which &mdash; and there was some talk subsequently about giving it to me. I cannot for the life of me see the advantage in having an agreement to ensure that young people get insurance if it is a secret agreement, if it is not available for a Member of the Oireachtas to look at and judge its worth and it is of damn little use to people aged 18, 19 or 20 who are looking for insurance for the first time and who have never heard of the declined cases agreement.  How they can be expected to know what is in that agreement is beyond me.  The insurance industry, as they claim, are fulfilling their responsibilities under the agreement as <Col N="313" /> long as at least one insurance company is offering insurance to young drivers.  That to my mind is an outrage and could not possibly represent the intention of the declined cases agreement.  In addition to that, any insurance broker will tell you that if you are a young person then effectively you cannot get insurance.  That is an indication that the motor insurance industry has failed to discharge its responsibilities in that regard.</P>
    <P>I can understand the motor insurance companies saying that insuring young people is very expensive because of their high accident rate.  I cannot deny that if young people have a record of bad accident driving they must face a higher premium charge.  I am not sure that every young driver should be asked to pay for the bad driving of other young people. We must find some mix.  Perhaps a solution would be to insure a young person at an ordinary basic rate plus 50 per cent for, say, a year and see how he gets on. If he has an accident jump it up to the full whatever it may be to pay for the average accident committer.  On the other hand, if a person does not have an accident then it is time to bring the 50 per cent loading back towards the base. There must be an incentive for young people.  At the moment of all the insurance companies I could trace who operate in this field, only about one in 20 would even quote an insurance premium to a driver aged 20.  When I got in touch with that insurance company and asked them to quote a premium for a Ford Fiesta which we valued at £2,000 we were told that the premium would cost £1,034 to insure the vehicle.  That is a promise of insurance cover, but to charge over 50 per cent of the value of the car for insurance cover is making fair nonsense of the declined cases agreement, of other agreements and beliefs we have and of statements from Government Ministers in this House to the effect that young people could not be refused insurance on the grounds of age alone.</P>
    <P>I want to place on the record of this House the responses that insurance companies gave when asked to give insurance to young drivers.</P>

I must insist that I am dealing with the background to this problem. The reason the penalties are being increased is the higher insurance rate and that is precisely the problem I am dealing with.  It is most important that I be allowed make this contribution because I want the Minister to know my feelings on the subject so that the matter might be examined more comprehensively.</P>

      <P>Let me resume my contribution by making the point that the reason so many young people are driving without insurance today is that the insurance companies operating in the motor insurance field offered the following responses to people looking for insurance. In all instances we quoted to the <Col N="315" /> insurance companies a 20 year-old person seeking insurance for a car worth £2,000. The following are the responses from the companies:</P>
      <P>American International Insurance Corporation &mdash; will not insure anyone under the age of 25 years.</P>
      <P>Afia Insurance Company &mdash; will not cover private individuals.</P>
      <P>Castle Motors &mdash; will not insure drivers under the age of 25 years.</P>
      <P>Erin Syndicate at Lloyds &mdash; will not insure persons under the age of 25 years.</P>
      <P>Ecclesiastical Insurance &mdash; will not cover car insurance.</P>
      <P>FBD Insurance Company Ltd &mdash; will not take any new clients at all.</P>
      <P>General Accident Fire &amp; Life &mdash; will not take any new clients at all.</P>
      <P>Insurance Company of North America &mdash; will not take any car insurance.</P>
      <P>The PMPA, the one I mentioned, is the one exception and, I might add, that it is now a State-subsidised body.  Other responses were:</P>
      <P>Church and General &mdash; will not accept any proposals under the age of 30 years and then only on a comprehensive basis and if they are given supporting business at the same time.</P>
      <P>Hibernian Insurance Company Ltd. &mdash; will not accept any proposals under the age of 25 years and will only accept those if the proposal places supporting business with it.</P>
      <P>Shield Insurance Co. Ltd. &mdash; will not accept proposals from anyone under the age of 25 years.</P>
      <P>Irish National Insurance Co. &mdash; will not accept a proposal from anyone under the age of 25 years.</P>
      <P>Sun Alliance &mdash; will not accept any proposals from persons under the age of 28 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> Zurich Insurance Co. Ltd. &mdash; will not accept a proposal from anyone under the age of 28 years.</P>
    <P>Insurance Corporation of Ireland &mdash; will not accept proposals from anybody under the age of 25 years.</P>
    <P>Norwich Union &mdash; will not accept any new motor business at all and have not done so for the past year.</P>
    <P>Guardian Royal Exchange Group &mdash; will not accept any proposals under the age of 21 years and those between the ages of 21 and 25 years will only be covered if they take comprehensive cover which is expensive.  For example, a 21-year-old with a provisional licence for a Ford Escort car would pay £1,200.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it increases penalties, but do not let anybody believe for one second that it will deal with the problem of uninsured driving here.  The motor insurance industry stands indicted for, firstly, flouting the agreement they entered into with the Minister in 1981, namely the declined cases agreement.  I have the greatest of sympathy for insurers given the very high acident rate we have.  The House stands indicted for failing to deal with this problem. I urge the Minister to get on and deal with the problem in as comprehensive a way as he can to take due note of all the recommendations in the report on the cost of motor insurance.</P>
    <P>Something that can and must be done is that the Minister responsible must bring in the insurance companies straight away and come up with some system of giving young people motor insurance at a reasonable rate.  He should demand that the motor insurance companies offer insurance to young drivers because at the moment, due to their age, they are being denied the opportunity to drive at all with insurance cover.  I do not believe that it is proper and responsible of us to deal with this problem only in the manner we are doing at the moment, increasing penalties. Young people do not have £1,000 <Col N="317" /> if they are found guilty in court of driving without insurance cover and, perhaps, they will be sent to jail or have their driving licence suspended.  Young people are being encouraged to break the law and it is being made impossible for them to abide by the law.  If they have a job that is a few miles from their home the only way they have of getting there is by car.  Many of the jobs open to them would of necessity involve driving a car.  If they cannot get insurance cover they will break the law.  Insurance companies have contributed to the level of uninsured driving by the approach they have adopted. If they reduced their premiums to realistic levels and offered insurance to young people, as the vast majority of them do not at present, at realistic levels &mdash; not every young person is a bad driver &mdash; they would collect a lot more premiums. Certainly, in terms of the number of premiums they would receive, the premiums would have to be of lesser sums but they would get a lot more money.</P>
    <P>I regard this problem as extremely urgent and serious and I urge the Minister to take action at that level now.  He has the power to bring in the insurance companies. If the insurance companies are not prepared to deal with it then we have a very serious problem to deal with.  The quicker we tackle it the better.</P>

      <P>In replying to this debate I should like to thank those who contributed for their comments.  They have been helpful and encouraging.  The Bill is about fines and increasing fines and it is reasonable that they should have been looked at long before now.  Human nature being what it is, we will always weigh the costs up one way or another, whether it is the payment of a fine of £5 or £10, irrespective of the problems being caused in the whole area of road traffic.  One only has to go through our major urban areas to see the total chaos caused because people take the soft option when parking.  They park and commit other road offences without any thought.  What motivates them is the thought that if they are caught they will only have to pay a few pounds of a fine. <Col N="318" /> I have held the view for a long time that something should be done about those fines.  If people do not want to exercise good manners on the road we must impose them on such people.</P>
      <P>There has been criticism that the provisions of the Bill represent another attack on motorists.  Motorists, in more ways than one, feel hard done by as a result of many increases but the Bill does not represent an attack on them but an effort to protect and help them when driving.  Illegal parking around town causes total chaos.  People park on double yellow lines, on clearways and bus lanes. That is not helping traffic management. It is gumming up traffic.  Bus lanes and clearways were devised to make traffic move more smoothly but that is being impaired by selfish motorists who have no consideration for their fellow motorists. It is important that we look at the provisions in the Bill in that light and not as a type of witch hunt or further imposition on the beleaguered motorist.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that the law in regard to the use of safety belts is not being taken seriously.  We are aware that if all drivers and front seat passengers wore seat belts many lives would be saved and serious injury prevented.  If people chose not to wear safety belts it is time we protected them from themselves.  By increasing the fine for such offences we are hoping people will respond.  If they are found guilty of such an offence I have no doubt that the fine they will be asked to pay will ensure that in future they will take more care.  Speeding is another serious offence for which the fines have not been high.  There is nobody who will deny that speeding is responsible for many serious and fatal accidents from time to time.  They are some of the reasons why the fines are being increased for such offences.  I believe it will help traffic management considerably, and that is important, and it will also protect life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molony spoke at length about insurance and I have taken on board the case he put up particularly for young people.  If people want to drive a car and get insurance there should be a system under which this insurance can be made available. <Col N="319" /> Not only young people are not insured.  About 25 per cent of the people driving today are without insurance.  That is a scandal.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann welcomes the report of the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities on a development plan for the Irish Border areas, and calls on the Government to take all the necessary steps to ensure its early and successful implementation.</P>
      <P>We welcome this report.  I met the group involved when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Naturally there is a general welcome in the House for this report because we have at last seen the end result of the committees's deliberations.  I am not going into detail but the committee set out to ascertain what the Community could do to assist the areas in question which, being amongst the least economically and socially developed in Europe, have the additional disadvantage of being cut in half by a frontier that hampers normal economic development.  It is a fact that this area needs special help and I am glad the committee are recommending that a sum of IR£125 million will be made available from EEC funds to get this scheme under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I want to say that I welcome that move but I know the difficulties that are still ahead because this report has to go to the Commission for approval. If there is a sum of £125 million to be given to implement this plan, I ask the Minister for Finance to ensure that all the money be spent implementing the plan and that none of it will be siphoned off, or that not too much will be lost through administrative costs or anything else. There is a general belief that whatever funds are coming to us from whatever <Col N="320" /> scheme, so much is lost along the way that by the time it filters to the ground the benefits expected never materialise.</P>
    <P>I am also happy with this report because it confirms that there has to be cross-Border co-operation.  Unless we have that cross-Border co-operation we may scrap this report.  It is my belief that it is the intention of the people governing this part of the country to provide the co-operation necessary and essential for the implementation of this plan and for many other reasons, but I am very sceptical, worried and gravely concerned that the Northern Ireland administration and the United Kingdom authorities will not give the co-operation required to ensure that this plan can be implemented successfully for the benefit of the people in these disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>There has been strong evidence of this in recent times.  Only last week more roads were closed.  This is not the way to show that there is co-operation between the two communities, that they can exist and help each other.  Unless there is a change of attitude by the Northern Ireland Office and the British authorities this scheme will never get off the ground. There is a very serious obligation on our Government to ensure that there is that change in attitude which is essential not just for this plan but for normal everyday living between the two parts of this country.</P>
    <P>Experience must have shown everybody that the blocking of roads does not lessen the dangers of terrorism as we know it.  On a number of occasions as Minister for Justice and Minister for Foreign Affairs I took the opportunity to explain to those United Kingdom Government representatives the foolhardiness of their idealism in believing that by placing a barrier across the road they will prevent terrorism.  This has never worked, as has been proved in the past. I am amazed that the thinking of the British Government at the present time is that this will work.</P>
    <P>I expected the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be here tonight but I hope the Minister for Finance will convey to him my belief that he has been sadly lacking in his departmental responsibilities <Col N="321" /> because he was not aware of what was going on, or if he was, that he did nothing about it.  I have read reports of different statements made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In a private briefing to the political correspondents, as quoted in <i>The Irish Times,</i> 18 February, he said he was aware a review was taking place but he only communicated with Mr. Prior, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, on the day the roads were being blocked.  Yet the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, was aware for a considerable time of time &mdash; his phrase &mdash; that this review was taking place and he did nothing about it.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions in this House we discussed meetings that took place, some impromptu, some totally accidental, mar ea, between our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mr. Prior, particularly the meeting in Brussels where they had a lengthy unscheduled meeting.  I would like to know why our Minister did not take advantage of these many meetings to discuss this problem.  It is a little late in the day to expect that a letter which would be delivered on Mr. Prior's desk the day the roads were being blocked would have any effect.  There was another meeting between the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State for Northern Ireland &mdash; a new concept, one of which I do not entirely approve but I will deal with that on another occasion because I doubt I will have the time to do it tonight &mdash; but I wonder why there was not a discussion on road closures and potential road closures at that meeting which was called for the sole purpose of discussing security.  If there was such a discussion, why was not our Minister for Justice able to convince Mr. Prior that it was a foolhardy exercise on his part to believe that he would lessen the dangers of terrorism and that he would have a safer community by closing roads when experience showed that the only effect it had was pushing the population further from those whose job it is to maintain law and order?</P>
    <P>It was very bad form on the part of Mr. Prior not to consult with the Minister for Foreign Affairs specifically, and this is something I would be extremely worried <Col N="322" /> about.  There is one thing &mdash; and I am not blaming the Minister altogether for this &mdash; but the Department of Foreign Affairs knew this review was going on and I am sure the Department of Justice knew too. Why then were the Ministers not alerted to what was involved in the review of this type of arrangement?  If the Ministers were not alerted we would like to know, but if they were alerted and did nothing until it was too late, then we have got ourselves into a very serious mess.</P>
    <P>I resent the fact that a member of this Government went hiding behind the coat of an unnamed Garda local chief in the division concerned.  He said the garda had agreed to it but the following day there was a denial, an unofficial denial, by the Garda authorities that they were consulted or gave permission for these roads to be closed.  There has been a big slip-up here.  There has been an effort to try to cover it up, which is one we must expose for what it is.  A bad mistake was made.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs knew this review was taking place and did nothing about it.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs had many meetings with Mr. Prior.  We were told all about it here, in fact chided that they had more meetings than we had.  That is fine, but I would like to know why he did not avail of the opportunity to express our total objection to any more closing of roads.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know why the Minister for Justice, who had this very special meeting to discuss security matters, did not even know what Mr. Prior had planned or, if he did, he did nothing about it.  Having done nothing about it, one must pose the question: was he prepared to go along with it, or is it only now that he has become aware of it?</P>
    <P>I might read the following quotation from an article entitled &ldquo;British army may block more roads near the border&rdquo; which appeared in <i>The Irish Press</i> of Thursday, February 16 1984:</P>
    <P>The NIO yesterday admitted there had been contact between police and at political level on both sides of the border, but their statement indicated that these contacts had taken place <Col N="323" /> when the &ldquo;application from the security forces to the Secretary of State&rdquo; for the closure of the roads had been made.  The statement added there had been discussions &ldquo;in the normal way with Irish authorities at police and at political levels&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If that is so, then the Minister for Foreign Affairs is not giving us the full story; and, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs is giving us the full story, then the Northern Ireland Office are deliberately misleading us.  There is the following interesting extract from the same article:</P>
    <P>Rev. Ivan Foster, DUP Assembly man, claimed yesterday that work began on Tuesday but was stopped, as he understood it, following a phone call to the NIO by an Irish Government representative.  Mr. Foster claimed that he made a telephone call to the NIO after which an order was given for work to be resumed.</P>
    <P>It is worth commenting on that.  It is my belief that Mr. Prior is playing politics with security, playing politics at the insistence of certain personnel in the Assembly in Northern Ireland.  We have on many occasions pointed out that we believe the Northern Ireland Assembly will never work.  We pointed that out from the very beginning when it was not popular to do so, but we have been proven right as of now.  The Northern Ireland Assembly is not working.  It appears to me that Mr. Prior is deliberately playing footsie with the security situation in an effort to placate those who still attend the Assembly forum.</P>
    <P>The report we have here this evening of the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities on a development plan for the Irish Border areas can be implemented successfully only if there is this co-operation that must exist right across the board.  I know for a fact that Mr. Prior is afraid to take a political decision to re-open some of the roads that have been closed for a long time.  I remember personally raising with him the opening of a road, national primary road, No. 3, which runs from <Col N="324" /> Dublin to Enniskillen where it is blocked at Aghalane Bridge.  If Mr. Prior and those responsible for security in Northern Ireland have not sufficient faith or at this stage are not convinced that the Irish security forces are doing their very best and successfully doing a very difficult job in trying to contain the subversives, trying to maintain law and order and security, then Mr. Prior is really doing harm to their input, which is a very great one, by saying that roads will be closed.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Finance, who is present, was up as early as I was this morning.  I was listening to Mr. Prior on the radio before 7 o'clock, when he was played live to us on a tape from a function he attended in London last evening.  At this function he addressed over 100 businessmen from Northern Ireland and claimed that their job was to sell the financial stability of investment in Northern Ireland to industrialists in the United Kingdom.  In an effort to boost Northern Ireland Mr. Prior said that they had 27 subsidiaries of USA companies in Northern Ireland but that it was unfortunate that much of the United Kingdom investment in Ireland was in the southern part of Ireland.  He went on to say: &ldquo;Mind you, they have many problems down there; God knows, they have many problems down there,&rdquo; which was a deliberate effort on his part to try to prevent United Kingdom investment in this part of the country.  I would suggest to the Minister, in the interests of the Government, in the interests of the industrial promotional agencies we have, indeed in the interests of fair play, that Mr. Prior should not be allowed get away with that sort of snide remark.  If we are to co-operate &mdash; and this development plan can be successfully implemented only if we do co-operate &mdash; then it is wrong for Mr. Prior to behave the way he is.  I contend he is playing narrow politics with security by way of closing these roads for the purpose of trying to maintain existing support, which he has at a very limited level only, within the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
    <P>We all want to see the contents of this report implemented.  I hope its costs will be finally cleared by the EEC and that it <Col N="325" /> will get under way.  But that can be done only if there is proper, mutual understanding and co-operation between the two communities on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the interest of the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities in this area. Any report, theoretical or practical, whatever it is, that focuses attention on that area and its problems, its economic and social problems, will be welcomed. This one goes a little further in that it goes into more detail and does some costing. Therefore, this House should welcome the report.  This House should see to it also that its contents are implemented. It is a little only, but a little in this case would have more than the effect of the amount spent: it would have propagandistic value as well.  The Scots have a proverb: many a mickle makes a muckle. If we could get development going with co-operation between North and South then the whole area North and South would benefit.</P>
      <P>The objective is economic and social, as one might expect coming from that committee.  It is a committee drawing its personnel from many countries, whose chairman is Signor Giancarlo Zoli of Italy.  As well as the members from Ireland there are others from France, Germany and so on.  Their whole objective is drawing the regions together.  For that reason I endorse the remarks made by Deputy G. Collins in regretting that the Government are not more active in preventing such things happening as happened with the closing of Border roads again.  As Deputy Collins said, it is a sop to hard-line Unionists in the Six Counties. It has had no effect except to exacerbate the feelings in the immediate area of the road blockages which in turn will counteract any attempt being made by politicians, economists or members of committees to draw the two areas together and to develop them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins mentioned something about which I have been asking in this House now for some time &mdash; the bridge at Belturbet, the Aghalane Bridge between Cavan and Fermanagh which, if my memory serves me correctly, was <Col N="326" /> restored by Cavan County Council, blown up again, and the authorities in Northern Ireland have never allowed it be reconstructed or have any type of <i>ad hoc</i> bridge erected there which would aid commerce in the area.</P>
    <P>The very fact of the Economic and Social Committee's interest is of help to us who are trying to solve this very difficult, intractable problem.  These people came and saw the scene on the ground. I have not time to go over their report in detail.  They saw the situation, they visited the areas and met representative groups, North and South.  They decided that the region needs this development and said that this was a suggestion as to how it should begin.  There will be people who will be very critical of areas of it, that it did not cover enough ground.  We know, and they tell us in the report, that the Border stretches for 343 kilometres from Dundalk to Donegal, that is 1,697,000 hectares of land covered by the area which is dealt with in this report, and that there are 747,000 people.  That is a substantial percentage of the population of the two areas.</P>
    <P>The Government have a special responsibility to undertake to implement this report.  It may be a sop in ionad na scuaibe but it has the values mentioned already and there is a responsibility on this Government, and particularly on the Minister for Finance, because they have for some time hardened their hearts against that region in their taxation policies.  We who represent the constituencies of that area are tired of telling this House the commercial hardship which is being suffered in that area because of the wet decisions taken by the Government.  The traders and people involved in commerce and industry there have made representations time and again to the Minister.  Unfortunately, these have not had the slightest effect.</P>
    <P>This House listened to an argument about decentralisation.  The area from Dundalk &mdash; and I am dealing with the southern portion now &mdash; through Cavan to Letterkenny also were scheduled for measures of decentralisation by a Fianna Fáil Government.  That policy was scrapped, discarded, stuck in a pigeon-hole <Col N="327" /> by this Government, again to the detriment of the region.  This House has heard me frequently talking about a long overdue development in my county town, the building of a general hospital.  That, too, has been scrapped.  One hates the tendency to become paranoic but if one were to examine the scene as a result of Government action or inaction, one would tend to become paranoic and to believe that there is some kind of persecution of the area.</P>
    <P>The Government would have to fund this project one-third, the UK Government one-third and the European Economic Community one-third, if my understanding of the scheme is correct. What we are asking this House to do is to back us up, to insist that the Government will now give a firm undertaking, make a firm decision to implement this policy.  The whole costing would be 179 million ECUs, as far as I remember.</P>
    <P>It is important to read into the report of the House the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>Statistics indicate that the area is particularly handicapped and has a special claim on Community assistance.</P>
    <P>This is not Fianna Fáil political propaganda. This is the view of the Economic and Social Committee of the EEC.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>Farming is the lynchpin of the economy &mdash; particularly in the south &mdash; and there is relatively little industrial employment.  Very low incomes, acute unemployment, outward migration and in some parts, falling population, are further features.  Small farms, poor soil, population structure and inheritance and marriage patterns combine to impede the introduction of modern farming methods.</P>
    <P>Others will deal with their own specific areas.  The area in which I have a special representative interest is the central area as described in this report.  As early as 1930 a report was published on drainage for that area &mdash; the Report upon Remedial Measures to Alleviate Flooding.  It went to 285 pages and 36 pages of maps. <Col N="328" /> From that time to this, the people of that area &mdash; which is the central area and carries the highest recommendation for expenditure in this report &mdash; have been crying out for that Erne drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>The report also gives a summary on page 10 of the recommendations and the House will see that arterial drainage of the Erne catchment area is recommended at 50 million ECUs.  That would give employment in the short term to a large number of people, both skilled and unskilled, from ordinary workers to engineers, both north and south of the Border.  As a long-term benefit, for Fermanagh and for Cavan and Leitrim &mdash; and even north Longford, because the Erne starts in Lough Gowna in Longford &mdash; all that area which as of now suffers severely from flooding would gain considerably by this scheme.</P>
    <P>One of the economists involved in the preparation of the report indicated that there would be a greater advantage to Cavan, Leitrim and Longford than to Fermanagh.  I am not convinced that the advantage is that great.  Of course, the nearer to equilibrium, the better the chance that we would have agreement from both North and South to get that scheme under way and without delay. The people have waited a very long time for that scheme to be implemented and the Minister for Finance here present has a glorious opportunity of sharing its cost with the EEC and the UK Government. If he did that, on a cost-benefit analysis alone, he would be benefiting the country economically and all of us politically.</P>
    <P>One area which was partly neglected in the report is Killeshandra, a thriving little place mainly due to the co-operative movement.  The people of that town feel that they are somehow being cold-shouldered in the proposals, not merely of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry but also in this report.  There is a wonderful expanse of water, taking the area from the south, of Lough Gowna, Lough Oughter and Upper and Lower Lough Erne &mdash; something unique in this country. That brings me to the next recommendation on which I would like to comment, because I shall not have time to comment on everything.  That is <Col N="329" /> the matter of an inland waterways canal at a cost of 5 million ECUs.  This is a great area for fishermen from the UK and wonderful promotions are made.  However, there is a whole area for development in boating on the two Lough Ernes, Lough Oughter and Lough Gowna, as well as establishing a link between Enniskillen and Athlone.  The Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in Athlone came to see me here some time ago in this regard and with the Woodford Canal-Ballinamore link-up it would be very easy to establish a free waterway from Enniskillen at the very least &mdash; and one could go further north-west &mdash; right down to Athlone.</P>
    <P>The Norfolk Broads are a great attraction for boating enthusiasts in Britain.  I was there once and cannot see how people, except those who are very highly urbanised and very seldom see either water or the sky, could get enjoyment out of a place so crowded with boats, where the prow of one boat was practically touching the stern of another.</P>
    <P>I am speaking here of a great expanse of waterway on which not a great deal of money would have to be spent to make a big link-up between the Erne and the Shannon.  Indeed, there is an airport near Enniskillen which could be utilised for bringing people in.  The people in this area have shown great initiative and the tourist boards, both North and South, have shown that they can co-operate and can develop their respective industries to the mutual advantage of both parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Many projects are mentioned.  There are other aspects of what are recommended for the central region but I have not time to mention them.  However, I appeal strongly to the Minister for Finance who is present in the House to make a commitment here tonight to this expenditure which is relatively light, even though he has developed the reputation of being as hard as nails.  He will have the UK Government and the EEC sharing the burden with him and he will be advancing a political, social and economic cause.</P>

      <P>I wish to congratulate the committee, members of which are from six EEC countries, on the report.  In their introduction to the report they said they were embarking on a study of the Border areas and that the Economic and Social Committee's intention was to ascertain what the Community could do to assist those areas which, besides being among the least economically and socially developed in Europe, have the additional disadvantage of being cut in half by the Border.  Other speakers have dealt with the position regarding the Border and this matter has been highlighted in the past few days by the closure of Border roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many reports in the <Col N="331" /> past few years regarding cross-Border development.  There has been the Erne study report and the regional development organisation report carried out by Louth, Cavan and Monaghan.  Those reports mentioned a figure of £100 million. I made a submission on the Erne study, which I have with me now and I made all the points relating to agriculture and tourism that are included in this report.  It appears to me that most of this report is compiled from information collected in previous reports.</P>
    <P>However, there has been no specific action following the reports.  On 22 June in this House I made the point to the Minister for Finance that the money available under the special fund relating to the Border was not being taken up.  I contacted the Minister of State in Northern Ireland, Mr. Prior, following a speech he made in which he blamed us for the lack of cross-Border development. In a reply to me his secretary made the following comment:</P>
    <P>You also referred to the monitoring group which played an important role on behalf of the councils on both sides of the Border during the consultant's study of the Erne catchment area.  As you rightly say, the group fell into abeyance after the report of the study was published.</P>
    <P>I wrote also to Commissioner Burke and I will quote one paragraph from his letter:</P>
    <P>Speaking realistically, I agree that development activity in the regions in question is at a fairly low ebb.  In proposing the present specific regional development measures for the Border areas of Ireland, the Commission attempted to stimulate this activity but, of course, the measure must be exploited to the full by the member states involved and this perhaps is where the major effort should be addressed.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that cross-Border development is nobody's business.  Ten years ago we tried to initiate cross-Border development in the mid-Ulster region.  In January 1974 I contacted local authorities, <Col N="332" /> county committees of agriculture and the newspapers, pointing out the benefits that should accrue from our membership of the EEC as a result of the Regional Fund.  In the mid-seventies we set up monitoring groups of officials and members of local authorities.  A steering committee was set up by civil servants from North and South but I felt they had the brake on all the time to ensure we did not make progress.  There was a bad period during the H-Block campaign and since then we have not been able to regain the momentum that existed with regard to cross-Border development.</P>
    <P>This report pinpoints a number of areas but there are others that must be considered.  On 22 June I told the Minister that the Government agencies were not doing what they should and I asked him about establishing a co-ordinator-administrator in that area.  He rejected that suggestion.  Since that time Mr. Fanning has been appointed from Brussels for that job in the Munster region.  The Border region has been the poor relation of the country, it has been under-developed and neglected.  The 20 miles or 30 miles on each side of the Border is 20 per cent of the land area of the island and it has a population of 750,000, or about 15 per cent of the entire population of the island.  If we do not get an administrator-co-ordinator for the area we will not be able to tackle the problems.</P>
    <P>During meetings in the mid-seventies I stated continually that if we wanted to be serious about cross-Border co-operation and development all lines of communication would have to remain open, I said that every road, even those closed since the early seventies, should be opened.  In this report they speak about machinery rings and pilot farms.  My parish is divided by the Border and last week three roads were closed.  When it was quiet last Sunday I visited the area when the large obstructions were removed.  It is at the black spots in the region identified by Deputy Wilson and me that the Minister should be looking.  They are stifling the economy and something realistic and positive will have to be done.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the Report of the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities on a development plan for the Irish border areas and urges the Government to have its recommendations fully considered&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move the amendment not because I have any objection to what the Deputies opposite seek to bring about by the motion and not because I have any hesitation about taking up any positive projects that can help with the development of the Border region, but for a reason I will come to later.</P>
      <P>I read the report with considerable interest although there are some elements in it which we have seen before but they have not been put together in quite the same way.  If any work can be done to improve the situation on both sides of the Border to the benefit of the people of that area the Government will be more than ready to play a full part in bringing those measures into effect, in defining them and in seeking the greatest possible degree of co-operation from our neighbours in order to bring projects of that kind to fruition.  The problem is to bring them to fruition.  It is because I have some reservations about the financial aspects that I have proposed the amendment.</P>
      <P>There is a specific reason for tabling the amendment.  Members will be aware that the Economic and Social Committee are a consultative body.  On certain occasions the Council of Ministers must consult that committee.  Since the foundation of the European Communities, a practice has evolved over a period to the point when the committee can make reports on various subjects on their own initiative. That is a relatively recent development and this is one of what is known as the own-initiative reports by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When putting forward these reports, the committee, operating at the very <Col N="334" /> early stage of the decision-making process in the Community, understandably reflected their ideas.  Some of these recommendations relate to matters we all agree should be done, but some relate to matters which I think need deep discussion and examination before we could say that is the way to go about things.  It is interesting to note the way in which the suggestions are made and the way that the financial aspects are dealt with.  I will quote from the report to illustrate the point I am making.  Reference is made to the Newry-Dundalk road and I will quote from page 5 of the report:</P>
    <P>At a rate of 1.5 million ECU per mile, the new Newry-Dundalk road would cost approximately 20 million. The <i>European Investment Bank</i> and the NCI could support this scheme by providing loans coupled with interest rebates.  The <i>European Regional Development Fund</i> could also provide grants of up to 30 per cent from either quota or non-quota funds.  Aid may also be available under the multiannual transport infrastructure programme proposed by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>That has a series of conditional statements. The report identifies desirable projects and possible sources of financing and in this case seems to suggest &mdash; I think wrongly &mdash; that all of these different sources of finance could be accumulated in the financing of the project.  In relation to the Erne Development Scheme the report states:</P>
    <P>The EAGGF must provide substantial funding for all these projects.  The <i>European Regional Development Fund</i> should also play its part.  This would preferably entail a special quota-free programme (inland waterway projects to assist the tourist industry).</P>
    <P>There, again, is a condition, funding being suggested from certain areas without the mechanism necessary being properly in place.  The same is true in relation to the Industrial Triangle of the Western Zone: The European Fund could fund the agency's activities under a special <Col N="335" /> quota-free programme.  In the section in relation to the Industrial Triangle as a whole the report concludes with the sentence: &ldquo;Of course the entire package has still to be costed since all factors are not available at the moment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Similiar remarks apply to other suggestions in the report.  On page 9, for example, dealing with development schemes generally, the reports states that a special instrument or a new line in the EEC budget could be helpful in tackling such wide and varied areas of action. That indicates that the whole plan or series of measures is at a very early stage of development in regard to finance and it is fair to say that the total on page 10 of the report setting out a sum of around £120 million is somewhat hypothetical and open to question because the report recognises that not all of the factors are known or have been taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say the figure is too low, that the cost of carrying out all of these measures would be somewhat more.  This has a lot to do with the politics of the Community as it is now, something that could have a particular bearing and pose a particular requirement for North-South co-operation.  Deputies know that we are in the middle of very difficult negotiations on the overall financing of the EEC, that one of the difficulties is the British budgetary situation, the net contribution which the UK are making and the changes necessary to reduce it.  Deputies also know that in terms of the overall financing &mdash; and Deputy Wilson may mutter into his fingers but it is a very real problem which has been building up for a number of years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can be assured that I know about the problem. She was not entitled to the paybacks if she followed the rules she accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I would agree on that, but we still have to persuade <Col N="336" /> many other people to see it our way.  One of the matters in contention is how much funding in total the Community will have at their disposal in future years.  We already have budgetary difficulties this year.  We want to make sure that the resources available to the Community are on a scale adequate to allow the Community to make a real contribution in areas like this, and in other areas, to build and change the face of those areas of the Community.</P>
      <P>There is a very strong body of opinion, with which I agree, that until the overall Community budget goes above a certain critical level, it will have very little effect on the distribution of activities between the member states.  That is part of our objective.  We want to ensure that the Community have the funds.  Part of the proposals for using what we hope will be an expanded level of funding in the European Community, and a proposal which has been put forward, is that we should have a 20 per cent increase per annum over five years in the amount of money available to the European Regional Development Fund.  That is a proposal which I have supported very vigorously and I will continue to support it in the framework of the overall action we are taking in relation to the Community budget.</P>
      <P>It is essential that we get agreement on that proposal in order to make room for the kind of funding being talked about here, in addition to the funding we already get from the Regional Development Fund.  It is a very central point in our discussions on this report.  I think all Deputies opposite would agree with me when I say the funding for a programme of this kind which we would like to see coming from Community sources should be additional to the funding we now receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now in receipt of our full quota of assistance from the European Regional Development Fund.  If we want to put forward more projects in order to gain more assistance in volume terms from the fund, either our share of the fund has to be increased or the total fund itself has to be increased.  It is more likely that the total fund would have to be <Col N="337" /> increased.  Those are considerations we must bear in mind in looking at this report.  I do not think Deputies opposite want to divert funds from uses to which they are now being put in these areas. We would rather add to the total than redistribute in that way.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may feel a little bored and, if he wants to amuse himself with hair splitting of that kind, that is his privilege.  I want to put it on record, so that we can make it clear to the Economic and Social Committee and to our partners in the European Community, that that is the way we want this matter to be handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of the projects and a number of the areas identified in this report have already been and are the subject of action, in some cases with the assistance of European funding.  In the short time available to me I should like to outline a few of them.  I refer first to the Newry-Dundalk road.  In that case some time ago the Irish and UK Governments agreed to the appointment of the Transport <Col N="338" /> and Road Research Laboratory of Great Britain and An Foras Forbartha here to carry out a joint study in order to resolve differences in approach in the physical construction of that road.  That study was approved for aid from the Regional Fund in November 1982.  I am happy to say the study was completed recently.  I have not yet seen it.  It has been referred to a joint steering committee where we can assess the results and decide, in the light of the study, what is the best method to approach that project. The point is, we have already had some European assistance in relation to that study and work is going on and progressing.</P>
    <P>The drainage of the Ulster Blackwater is another project mentioned in this report.  A programme for drainage in that river catchment area was approved by the EEC Commission in March of last year.  The total cost of the scheme is just over £30 million sterling, of which roughly £17 million will be borne by the authorities here.  The European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund will be participating in the funding of that project.  That is another one of these projects on which progress can already be seen.  In relation to the Ballymore-Ballyconnell canal mentioned by Deputy Wilson, the Office of Public Works are currently engaged in a feasibility study on the restoration of that canal for navigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>How long is the study going on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The information we have obtained so far is now being examined and analysed.  It is expected that all the outstanding survey work will be completed and a preliminary design put in hand so that we can have a full report on the feasibility of the restoration with an estimate of the cost ready in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to roads generally in the Border counties, the total grant provisions for work on national roads in those areas in 1983 was £12½ million. Some of the projects are the Letterkenny to Derry route at Manorcunningham and Newtowncunningham and the N2 in <Col N="339" /> County Monaghan at Castleshane and Donaghmoyne.  An amount of work is already going on in infrastructure in the area which is relevant to the kind of programme suggested in this report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not additional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting they are additional.  Already we have made progress in a number of areas which were picked out in this report as being ones which need attention.  We could say the same in relation to the development of the sanitary services in the areas and the provision of cluster units and advance factories.</P>
      <P>Reference is made in the report to the need for improved customs clearance facilities and the simplification of customs formalities particularly in the Dundalk-Newry area.  I am happy to say the Revenue Commissioners are now planning a customs complex at Carrickarnon which will fulfil the functions at present carried out at the frontier post in Carrickarnon and the customs station in Dundalk.  We will need some further study of the requirements in relation to the road projects I mentioned earlier.</P>
      <P>Perhaps at a later date we could look in more detail at the final point I wish to make.  I want to refer briefly to the industrial zone proposals set out in the report. The concept is an interesting one, but it would need more development than the authors of this report have been able to give it.  There are different levels of incentives on the two sides of the Border. Unfortunately, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that there would be currency movements between the two sides of the Border.  Those seem to be two reasons why it might not be as easy as suggested in this report to have one authority straddling the Border and responsible for industrial development.</P>

      <P>If we were at the point where we could use ECUs nobody would be happier than I.  Nothing makes my <Col N="340" /> heart softer than the prospect that we might eventually get to that point.</P>
      <P>I commend the Economic and Social Committee on having put together a report in the way they have.  I emphasise the Government's commitment to having these recommendations properly examined. Above all, I emphasise our commitment to the kind of action required at European levels in order to make the proper amount of financing available for projects of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this report, coming as I do from the deprived town of Dundalk which is probably at its lowest ebb for 25 years.  I was heartened by the Minister's statement that he regards the ungrading of the Dundalk-Newry road as a priority.  Dundalk has been devastated economically in recent years, not due to the fault of this Government but due to a combination of circumstances.  In the seventies Fianna Fáil had three Deputies for the area and made no significant progress in any department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The area is at a low ebb and this report identifies the Border region as the most deprived area in western Europe.  Some years ago the west of Ireland was a deprived area but the scene has shifted.  There is real concern for the entire region.  While there is no doubt that the Ulster problems are the main factor, successive Governments have failed to take compensatory measures.  It must be said that Fianna Fáil were in Government during more recent years. Compensatory measures must now be taken and there must be increased capital spending in Border areas.  The Minister is particularly interested in this region and I thank him for the interest he has displayed during the past year.  Around the time of the previous budget I brought to his attention the enterprise zones which were created in Belfast in the early seventies and he came back to me on several occasions and made extensive inquiries into the practicalities or otherwise of such a project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> The major project in the Dundalk area must be the upgrading of the main road. Traffic in the area has been strangled for the past 15 years.  Only last Saturday there was a major protest by the residents of the Newry road during which they blocked traffic.  They did so as a protest against the endless wait to relocate the customs complex at the Border.  Louth County Council have bought land at Carrickarnon and they have been waiting for the publication of the consultant's report which, as the Minister said, has now been finalised.  I would exhort the Minister to make the findings public as soon as possible in order to allay concern in the Dundalk region.</P>
    <P>I would bring to the Minister's attention the need for more money to make the Lough Muckno project feasible within the next five years.  Dundalk cannot attract water-intensive industries and water is an absolute priority.</P>
    <P>Another priority is the matter of forestry. North County Louth is particularly suitable for increased forestry plantation. The report recommends the planting of sitka spruce and identifies the wet, mild climate as being particularly suitable for this form of development.  The entire country is crying out for afforestation and it could give gainful employment to thousands of young people.  I would encourage the Government to devise some type of scheme which would involve participation by the State and by the landowner over a period of years.  The potential benefits are enormous.  It would give employment to thousands of young people and provide a return which would in many cases be above the level of agricultural output.  I urge the Minister to encourage the Cabinet to produce a scheme for forestry, particularly in north County Louth.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the blocking of Border roads.  Much has been made of this tonight and in recent days by Fianna Fáil Deputies.  As a Border Deputy I share their concern but I suggest that they have been engaged in gamesmanship and green flag waving.  The blocking and spiking of Border roads is not a new phenomenon <Col N="342" /> which has occurred only in the past few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong to say it is gamesmanship.  I resent that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The blocking of Border roads has been a common occurrence for the past ten or 12 years.  We are having far more success in our representations to the British Government than Fianna Fáil Governments experienced.  It is irresponsible yet again to wave the green flag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no waving of the green flag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there was. Deputy Leonard has been very prominent in his demands for cross-Border co-operation and I applaud him for it but I do not admire the suggestion made tonight and last week that the Government have been remiss in making representations to the British Government over the blocking of these roads.  In the seventies there were as many as 50 or 60 roads blocked at one time when Fianna Fáil were in power.  That is undeniable.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his interest in the Border areas.  The real answer to our problem is the harmonisation of VAT rates in this country and in the Six Counties. The reason we cannot do this is that we are now paying the price for the profligate policies of the 1977 manifesto.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this motion.  Quite a few of the Deputies who have spoken have been very much involved in various committees who have been addressing themselves to the question of cross-Border co-operation.  This report by the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities is the manifestation of their efforts over many years. All the Deputies involved with these committees have put a tremendous amount of work into them.  It is unfortunate <Col N="343" /> that the committees to date have not made the progress on the ground we would like to see them making.  The concept of close Border co-operation has been gradually developed by the various committees which are straddling the Border. They have identified the various joint projects which can be undertaken which will be of mutual benefit to both sides of the unfortunate divide cutting across the country for far too long.</P>
      <P>I have been involved with the committee on the east-Border region.  This committee, which has been meeting regularly for quite a number of years, has identified many suitable projects.  Many of them are in the report which was released within the last ten days.  At the top of the list there is the question of the motorway from Dublin to Belfast.  The Minister for Finance spent some time tonight speaking on this subject.  While the benefit to our side and to the northern side of the Border is obvious to everybody who wishes to see it, the important aspect is the provision of the necessary finance to get on with the work on the development of this road.  In and around Dundalk we have phases 1, 2 and 3 of the inner by-pass. If the necessary money is provided, the Dundalk Urban Council can push ahead with the development of the Dundalk by-pass.</P>
      <P>Some of the speakers referred to the great difficulty which exists along the motorway because of the siting of the customs clearance station just north of Dundalk on the Newry road.  Last weekend there was a protest by the residents who are dissatisfied with the progress on the removal of the customs clearance station from there to Carrickarnon.  The site for the new customs station was acquired some years ago but unfortunately the progress on it is very slow.  People in that area, because of the volume of traffic on the route from Belfast to Dublin, have had their rights as citizens of the State in that area very much infringed on by the number of lorries parking along that roadway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works to use their good offices <Col N="344" /> to ensure that the new customs complex at Carrickarnon will proceed as quickly as possible.  The fact that the land has been acquired and the report has recognised that the work on the customs clearance station there can proceed without a firm decision on where the motorways will meet at the Border is a recognition that the work on the customs complex can proceed immediately.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works to address themselves to the very serious problem which exists north of Dundalk on the Newry road.</P>
    <P>Another matter with regard to the development of the Border regions which has not been touched on in the report is the supply of natural gas to Belfast.  I believe the development of the natural pipeline to Belfast will open up the prospect of the development of a much enlarged horticultural industry in the country.  Along the east coast from Dublin into the Cooley peninsula there is ideal terrain for the development of the glasshouse industry in general.  The industry has been on the decline in recent years because of the increased cost of heating and is in serious danger of going to the wall.</P>
    <P>The provision of spurs from the natural gas line going to Belfast could reawaken interest and could herald the creation of possibly thousands of jobs in the industry along the east coast.  The Ministers with responsibility in this area should look into this immediately.  It could be very relevant in relation to whether the route of the natural gas pipeline has been decided. The question of having spurs from that gas pipeline and making them available to small, medium and large horticulturalists along the coast with its natural terrain and adjacent to the sea could mean great expansion in the horticultural industry.  It is very important that the people involved know exactly what will be bought in relation to it so that they can plan their future strategy.  Natural gas going to Belfast for the towns of Drogheda, Dundalk, Ardee and other towns along the Border could herald a new beginning as far as industrial development is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> Some of the other speakers referred to the serious economic difficulties in Dundalk at the moment.  Those difficulties can be blamed to a large extent on the taxation measures pursued by the Minister for Finance.  The level of VAT and excise duties has meant there has been a considerable leakage of money northwards because of the price differential between North and South.  The Minister for Finance expressed concern about this. If he wanted to show real concern about this he should introduce some compensatory mechanism which will ensure that the economy in the constituency of Louth and in the other constituencies along the Border will not wither and die. If the Minister persists with the taxation measures which have been in operation for the last 12 months many people in industry and in commercial life generally will be in very serious trouble.  They are already in serious trouble but the risk of those industries and businesses going to the wall is very real.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the report to the research going on regarding willow growing, the production of biomass and the fast growing wood crops which could do a lot for our energy needs.  The Border areas are natural terrain for forestry and afforestation generally.  I sincerely hope that research work going on will yield possibilities for an area where the small holding and the small farm is predominant. Many of those small farms have not been economically viable for many years. The inhabitants of those areas have to depend on part-time employment outside agriculture.  I believe the research into and the production on different lands of these fast growing wood crops would do much for not alone the economy of the area but the country generally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The water supply scheme for the town of Dundalk is another cross-Border project which must go ahead immediately.  Dundalk's prospects of getting a water-dependent industry have been blighted by the serious deficiency in the water supply system, which <Col N="346" /> has been in operation in the town for many years.  There is a possibility of getting water via the plain from the Muckno-Lough Ross catchment.  If this scheme is to progress it is important that the money be provided for the work immediately.  It could mean much to the industrial development of Dundalk in the immediate future.  Because of the educational and industrial facilities which exist in Dundalk people have tended to gravitate there from the midlands and that has meant considerable growth in the population and many young families in the area will be looking for employment opportunities in the future.  Therefore it is important that the industrial development of the region is given proper priority.</P>
      <P>Another matter I refer to in the context of cross-Border development is tourism. The Newry and Mourne Council in conjunction with Louth County Council have produced a very useful holiday guide to the area from the Mournes to the Boyne. I hope that that is only a beginning.  The area has often been described as the Killarney of the North.  Unfortunately, because sufficient emphasis has not been put on its beauty and attraction, tourism there has suffered.  The opportunity to promote tourism on a joint basis is real. Not much money will be involved in the promotion.  It is a question of collective togetherness of effort in projecting the area properly.  The fund referred to earlier is very important from the tourism point of view.  Much valuable work has been done on tourist-related projects in County Louth under the ERDF non-quota fund and I hope that when this scheme ends in 1986 it will be renewed and perhaps expanded to bring in futher areas of expenditure in this region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should examine the possibility of providing a fund for the provision of recreational facilities.  I had a question down in this Chamber a week or ten days ago and the Minister for Finance was not very forthcoming on the issue, but the matter could be pursued.  In an area that has been recognised as deprived because of its location, it is inevitable that the necessary wherewithal is not there to provide proper recreational facilities.  I asked the <Col N="347" /> Minister for Finance if when the scheme is being renewed he will consider this area and endeavour to bring it under the umbrella of existing agencies.</P>
    <P>I cannot let the occasion pass without making reference to two villages in the Cooley peninsula.  Because of the levels of taxation that apply Omeath and Carlingford, two of the finest seaside villages in the country, are dead at the moment. As I said in relation to Dundalk and other towns, I appeal to the Minister to consider these places and perhaps decide to pay a visit to the area to see for himself at first hand the difficulties that exist for the people there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all the other Deputies, I welcome this report in principle, but I am disappointed at what I heard from the Minister for Finance, who at the end of the day will decide whether the aspects of this report with which we agree can go ahead.  He has not committed himself here tonight to agreeing in principle to make the moneys available together with the EEC and the UK Government to ensure that the aspects with which we all agree would at least work.  The Minister has suggested that this is only a report, that decision will be premature, that it warrants deeper discussion and it contains only recommendations. Many aspects of this report we would all agree with, and the Minister and the Government should do what we have asked them to do: take all the steps necessary to ensure the early and successful implementation of this report.  If the Minister cannot agree with this in its entirety surely he can agree with the aspects of it which warrant immediate attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said here tonight about Border roads and the difficulties which the closure of these Border roads has created, in particular a few days ago when three roads in Fermanagh were closed down without any prior consultation with this Government, we were told.  If the Government were to come clean and tell us that there was consultation then we would understand that there is co-operation between the two Governments. <Col N="348" /> The British Government tell us that there was discussion regarding these roads and our Minister for Foreign Affairs tells us that there was not.  The British Government try to deceive us then by telling us what a Garda superintendent along the Border told them.  If the British Government think that they are going to deal with a garda along the Border and that they and he are to decide what roads should be closed down, then we should think more seriously of the relationships which we are supposed to have, the relationship which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mr. Prior had when they were in Brussels and the relationships which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice had when they were in Dublin.  As was pointed out earlier tonight, obviously they did not discuss the serious problem borne out in this report, that of road closures.</P>
    <P>I doubt if any other Border Deputy or any Deputy in this House would believe that this report or any other report that has come in here over the years since we joined the EEC will be successful until that Border is abolished.  We must talk seriously about this.  Then and not until then will we have a successful area along the so-called Border.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The obvious step to be taken is to ensure that all these roads along the Border which are closed must be reopened and our Government must make the strongest possible representations in spite of the possibility of us breaking off some relationships with the British Government.  We cannot allow them to close off our roads and divide families along the Border in Fermanagh, Donegal and other border counties.  It was stated at the outset that this report covers 20-30 miles on both sides of the frontier.  I want to put on the record of this House that all of County Donegal is included in this, but unfortunately all of the west coast and half of county Donegal are not included for any development, industrial or otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for Education for taking the Adjournment Debate tonight.  The House will remember that in 1977 the programme for decentralisation of the Department of Education was launched successfully with the transfer of the examinations branch of the Department of Education to Athlone.  A lot of work was involved in this re-location of such a big section of the Department.  Many conciliation and arbitration meetings were held and there were a lot of behind-the-scenes activities before the project was finalised.  A lot of hard work was put into the matter in order to get a sufficient number of personnel to transfer to Athlone.  Many of those officers accepted the posts in the expectation that their careers would be in the examinations branch in Athlone.  From the information supplied to me I understand that the conciliation and arbitration meetings to formalise the transfer programme were extensive.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to some of the memoranda relating to the transfer of the branch.  One document stated:</P>
      <P>They, in common with the other officers transferred will continue in their present status, i.e. civil servants employed by the Minister for Education. All officers will retain their existing grading and will continue to work in Athlone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the position in 1977.  There was pride in the town that this branch was to be based in the town.  It was a matter of prestige that the town became known as the examinations centre for the Department of Education.  The transfer proceeded from 1977 in a satisfactory manner and the staffing structure today is that there are 129 on the staff in the branch. There are various grades of officials on the staff together with approximately 60 temporary staff who assist in the examination grading and six temporary porters employed from May to about October. <Col N="350" /> The employment of about 200 people in that branch has meant a lot for the town of Athlone.  The staff have security of employment but if the branch is allowed to diminish there will be serious implications for the town and its hinterland. The staff fear that their numbers will be reduced greatly or that the branch will cease to be located there.</P>
    <P>At present the staff consist of a principal officer, two assistant principals, four HEOs, ten EOs, seven SOs, 11 COs, 72 clerical assistants, eight messengers and 19 watchmen and general operatives.  I do not want the Minister to get the idea that we are against progress in the town. A head of an establishment in Dublin last autumn said that the examinations branch in Athlone could not stand like King Canute hoping to hold back the waves but that is not the position.  Officials there welcome the age of computerisation that will lead to greater improvement in the processing of examination papers and results.  They cannot be accused of standing in the way of progress. I have stated on the radio, television and in speeches that the new curriculum board has my wholehearted support.  It is an admirable board and I wish the Minister well in its interim structure.  It has a lot to offer our young people.  It is no harm to draw attention to the fact that many of the matters to be dealt with by the board were proposed by Deputy John Wilson when as Minister for Education he produced a White Paper on the matter.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that technology will reduce the work force in the branch and that is the fear which has led to the staff to question the Minister about their future.  Many questions have been raised about this by the groups representing the staff in Athlone but they have not received a satisfactory answer, apart from being told that their jobs are safe during the interim period of the activities of the examinations board.  In the course of a letter to the branch secretary of the Civil and Public Services' Staff Association, the general secretary of the group, following representations concerning the disquiet felt by members after the Taoiseach's Ard-Fheis statement, stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> With reference to your representations concerning the effect on the staff in the Department's offices in Athlone of the establishment of the proposed Curriculum and Examinations Board, I am to inform you that no change in the status and conditions of the staff of the Examinations Section is envisaged for the early stages of the operation of the board.</P>
    <P>It was identified that &ldquo;the early stages&rdquo; would mean approximately two years. The general secretary also told the Athlone branch that discussions would be initiated in due course.</P>
    <P>The only type of guarantee those officials have been given is that in the early stages of the change their jobs are secure. While the officials welcome the changes their fear about the results is well founded.  Many of them moved to Athlone after a lot of deliberation and thought.  Many young people living in Dublin sought to return to their home towns under the Fianna Fáil decentralisation programme.  Some of them for family reasons needed to return home and they contributed greatly to the economic well-being of the area.  However, they are in a period of uncertainty now. Members of the examination branch have put forward a reasonable suggestion and it is my intention to submit it to the Minister.  I do not expect the Minister to respond to it tonight but I trust that she will give it close attention.  It is one which was envisaged when Fianna Fáil were in power between 1981 and 1982 and proposed further decentralisation.  Circular E.142/32/81 gave the current position at 1 November 1982, and mentioned the various decentralisation programme centres and services, the first being Athlone. I am not talking about the 1977 decentralisation but the advanced programme of further decentralisation which Fianna Fáil and the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, envisaged.</P>
    <P>I am personally committed to the idea of decentralisation, not just to Athlone but to other provincial centres.  There is a sense of alienation, a feeling of disquiet <Col N="352" /> among the staff in the Department of Education, Athlone, because they feel political life is based on the idea that bureaucracy is too big and that they cannot make an input into the area of central government.  The idea of decentralisation is as attractive in reality as it is in theory. In Athlone we have had the opportunity to view decentralisation at work and it is a very good idea.  I regret that this Government did not see fit to continue with this forward programme which took in Athlone, Ballina, Galway, Killarney and Sligo.</P>
    <P>In the letter issued early in November 1982 it was envisaged that the salaries electronic processing sections of the Department would be relocated in Athlone. The staff numbers for such decentralisation would be 181.  It is coincidental but fortunate that that number almost matches the current number in the Department of Education in Athlone. Computerisation and the phasing out of the intermediate certificate, one of the suggestions put to the Curriculum and Examinations Board by the Minister, will lead to a reduction in employment but in my view this Government should reintroduce decentralisation.  While other Members may speak about decentralisation in national terms, my job is to discuss decentralisation as it affects my constituency.</P>
    <P>In my view it would not be just if the Minister allowed staff uncertainty to grow while expecting co-operation and enthusiasm among the people in the Department serving in Athlone.  I ask the Minister to put it to the Government as a positive suggestion that decentralisation continue in Athlone.  In November 1982 it was envisaged that the salaries section would be established in Athlone. That was not very long ago and therefore the idea cannot be held to be irrelevant. It would ease the growing uncertainty and fears of staff not so much about their jobs but about the final outcome of the location of staff.</P>
    <P>Let me summarise my arguments: first, we welcome the curriculum and Examinations Board and the emphasis they will have on computerisation and the partial reduction of formal examinations <Col N="353" /> at the early stages of secondary schools.  Second, I would like the Minister to spell out the staff implications for the Department of Education in Athlone of such computerisation and phasing out of examinations beyond the temporary years mentioned in the Taoiseach's letter. Third, and this is the main thrust of my contribution, that the second stage of the decentralisation programme as envisaged in the November 1982 document be reviewed in the light of current changes and that an announcement be made shortly to allay the fears of the present staff, or that the Government consider the idea that the salaries section of the Department of Education be transferred to Athlone to take the place of the reduced examinations board.  Fourth, the Minister should bear in mind what having the examinations branch has meant to the town and the surrounding area.  This has provided 200 jobs for people living in or around Athlone.  They contribute weekly to the economic and social well-being of the area, and all this helps to make Athlone a thriving midland town. As a Deputy for the area, I do not want to see Athlone lose what we regard as a very valuable resource.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to clear up any confusion which might exist and to allay the anxiety of staff members of my Department.  I hope to make it clear that this anxiety is not justified, but since it has been said that certain members of my staff are anxious about the future, I am glad to have this opportunity to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Deputy O'Rourke's approval of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  On the question of computerisation of examinations, while obviously it is good to hear the Deputy express her approval of computerisation we must all be quite clear why we are interested in computerisation &mdash; because it will result in a better, faster and certainly a more comprehensive service to schools and to the public generally.  I believe also &mdash; and I believe a great many people working in the area consider &mdash; that computerisation will increase the job satisfaction of those who work in the <Col N="354" /> Examinations Branch, and will increase their professional pride in the service they provide to the community.  Computerisation, like some other questions raised, is not something to which one can give straight-down-the-middle answers. I am sure the Deputy is aware of this. Studies are going on about the question of computerisation.  Studies will take some considerable time to ascertain what might be computerised and what might not or what course it should or should not take.  At this stage it is utterly impossible to talk about what precisely will happen if and when computerisation is implemented. It is very important to make that quite clear.</P>
    <P>To come back to the Curriculum Examinations Board, that board was something to which all concerned with education in the country looked forward for some time.  Despite there being some differences on the establishment of the board I believe there was general agreement that it was extremely important that it be established.  I know I can count on the co-operation and the goodwill of all those involved in education in their work with the board.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the staff in the Examinations Branch in Athlone it is important to realise that the board in being at present is an interim one.  This interim board is not involved in running the certificate examinations and will not take over any of the functions or duties of the Examinations Branch of the Department of Education.  The establishment of the statutory board, which will assume responsibility for the examinations, will take time; two years is what is envisaged and it will involve planning and consultation.  In the meantime the work of the Examinations Branch will proceed.  Indeed in the interests of better communication I have appointed the Principal Officer of the Examinations Branch as one of the Department's advisers to the board.  The establishment of the statutory board, as the Deputy will realise, involves legislation.  Needless to say all Deputies and Senators will have an opportunity of discussing the details of that legislation in its passage through the Oireachtas.  However, before that <Col N="355" /> stage is reached, the relevant recommendations of the interim board will have been received and considered.</P>
    <P>I want to stress at this stage that the Department's staff in Athlone, or anyone else for that matter, need not fear that their interests will be compromised by decisions taken by the interim board unknown to them.  The interim board will have wide-ranging consultations.  The final decision on basic issues, such as questions affecting the future of the Department's staff in Athlone, will be a matter for me, as Minister, and for the Government, which I am sure the Deputy will realise, as indeed were the original decisions taken to establish the branch in Athlone.  Exactly the same process will have to be gone through if there was any other change envisaged.  In deciding any such issues I shall have full consultation with the people affected.  Their views and concerns will be taken into account in final decisions, which is of course the way the original move to Athlone was undertaken.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that I appreciate the concerns of the staff in Athlone.  They have succeeded in relatively few years in establishing the Examinations Branch in Athlone on a very solid footing and have carried out an increasingly complex and onerous task each year with dedication and competence. They can be proud of their achievements and I want to build on that pride for the future.  It is perhaps understandable that, being separated from the rest of their colleagues in their Department, they sometimes might fall prey to unnecessary anxiety.  It is a good thing that I have an opportunity to allay that anxiety.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear also that it would not be appropriate nor indeed possible for me &mdash; and I am sure Deputy O'Rourke would not ask me &mdash; to pre-empt consultations and decisions.  If we were to pre-empt those kinds of consultations what would be the point in setting up any advisory board?  There is an in-built contradiction there.  Therefore, it is not possible to pre-empt future decisions. <Col N="356" /> These decisions must be taken following full consultations with experts and with all the bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one point I should like to clear up here and now: there has been concern expressed that the staff in Athlone might somehow lose their status as civil servants. Let me say categorically that the staff of the Department's Examinations Branch in Athlone will not lose their status as civil servants.  Indeed the three executives to be appointed to the Curriculum Examinations Board will also have the status of civil servants.  Senior officials of my Department have already met representatives of all the unions involved in Athlone and it has been agreed that further meetings will be held if the unions so request.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention briefly the question of further decentralisation.  I know that is a question on which the Deputy does not expect any kind of a definitive answer.  Apart from the general Government decision, the moving of the Salaries Branch of the Department would be tied up with the discussions on restructuring of the Department which are being carried on with the Department of the Public Service at present.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to my staff in Athlone: there is very good work being done in Athlone, we hope you will keep it up; we know you will keep it up; your Civil Service status will not be taken from you; your views and concerns will be taken fully into account and no decisions affecting any future careers will be taken unknown to you.  The staff in Athlone have shown that they agree that we are all in the business of ensuring that young people will have the best curriculum and examinations system we can provide collectively.</P>

      <P>A grant of £25,000 was allocated from the Dublin Inner City Group Fund to the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee in February 1982 to assist in the development of an inner city literacy programme.  A further grant of £25,000 was allocated in March 1983 in respect of the continuation of the programme. The 1982 allocation was paid in full in December 1982 on the basis of a certificate from the VEC regarding the costs incurred in setting up the programme and a claim for recoupment of the expenditure incurred in 1983 has just been received.</P>

      <P>Under existing law, maintenance of public roads entails the duty both to prevent danger to road users and to clear roads of obstructions and is the responsibility of the road authorities concerned.  Local authorities also have specific powers under section 34 of the Local Government Act, 1925 to require the cutting or trimming of trees which may cause obstruction to a road or cause danger by obstructing the view of persons on the road.  The procedures available under this last provision cannot, however, be used in relation to trees which are potentially dangerous.  While there is no evidence of local authority operations in this area being seriously constrained by any inadequacies in the legal position, I intend to have this examined.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a standing instruction from my Department, of which they have just been reminded, as to the performance of their functions in this area.  In addition, An Foras Forbartha are holding a one-day seminar on 6 March 1984 on the assessment of safety in relation to roadside trees.  This is designed to assist road authority engineers to make effective surveys of potentially dangerous trees and to take appropriate action.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of State grants to meet the full cost of work on national primary works is dependent generally on the extent to which the scheme of work meets the policy aims set out in the Road Development Plan for the 1980s.  The allocation also takes into account the extent to which development alongside, or with <Col N="194" /> access to, national primary roads in an area complies with the advice and guidelines relating to development control functions which were circulated by my Department on 26 October 1982.  Subject to these considerations, grants will continue to be allocated to Monaghan County Council for work on the national primary road in the county.</P>

In the case of the grants in relief of rates and in lieu of the agricultural grant, rating authorities have been informed that the overall 1984 Estimates provision should enable the allocations to each local authority to be increased by about 0.8 per cent subject to allowance for commitments from previous years.  Information on the 1982 and 1983 allocations are as follows together with details of the 1984 allocations for house purchase and improvement loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that VAT on sales of agricultural machinery in 1983 amounted to £19 million.  VAT-registered farmers can, of course, take a credit in their VAT returns for the VAT charged to them on agricultural machinery.  Compensation for unregistered farmers in respect of VAT on agricultural machinery and other farm inputs is provided through the VAT system by means of a flat-rate percentage addition to prices, when selling agricultural output to VAT-registered persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The removal of VAT from agricultural machinery combined with a consequential reduction in the flat-rate compensation would not lead to any Exchequer loss in respect of purchases of agricultural <Col N="199" /> machinery by farmers.  There would, however, be a loss of about £2 million per year in respect of agricultural machinery used by unregistered persons other than farmers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following is the information requested:</P>
      <P>(a) The cost to the Exchequer of abolishing advance corporation tax, to which applies the transitional arrangement whereby only one-half of the tax is payable in respect of distributions, is estimated at £5 million in a full year.  The corresponding loss from the abolition of advance corporation tax if it were payable at the full rate is estimated at £10 million.</P>
      <P>(b) It is estimated that the annual cost to the Exchequer would be £30 million if registered traders having net annual VAT liability in excess of £500, were permitted to retain £500 per year against administration costs and if persons with an annual liability of less than £500 were allowed relief up to the amount of the tax payable.  Such an arrangement would, however, provide full benefit for only some 54,000 traders out of the total number registered of approximately 97,000. Of the remaining 43,000 it is estimated that a relatively small number would receive varying sums less than £500 depending on the amount of their annual liability while the vast majority would not receive any benefit, as they are, in general, in a permanent VAT repayment situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is presumed that the question refers to section 26 of the Finance Act, 1980, which imposed a restriction on the amount of free depreciation and initial allowance which could be claimed in respect of machinery and plant (other than fixed machinery or plant used in a farm building) in charging farming profits to tax.  Such allowances are granted only up to the point at which the sum of all capital allowances to be granted equals 30 per cent of the chargeable profits before deduction of all capital allowances. Beyond this point, machinery and plant may be written off at normal rates of depreciation only.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not available which would indicate a reliable cost to the Exchequer from abolishing this restriction.  It is, however, very tentatively estimated that the annual yield from the restriction is of the order of £2 million.</P>

      <P>The refund scheme offers a subsidy to all households which are not covered by a medical card to ensure that no family has to pay more than £28 for drugs prescribed for use in a calendar month.  If the payment of £28 monthly constitutes hardship for a family, even where their income exceeds the medical card guidelines, they can apply to their local health board for a medical card.  I am confident that all such applications receive sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>Persons with speech or language defects are normally referred by their family doctor to an ENT consultant.  The causes of language and speech defects are many and it may be necessary for the patient to see a number of different specialists before a comprehensive diagnosis is made.</P>
      <P>While delays may occur from time to time, particularly where a number of specialists are involved, whether the existing level of diagnostic facilities are adequate would depend largely on the nature and extent of the individual patient's defect.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 5 January 1984 and was paid from 9 January 1984, fourth day of incapacity, at the reduced rate appropriate to a person with 41 contributions registered in 1982-83, the contribution year governing his claim.  A minimum of 48 contributions, paid or credited, is required in the governing contribution year for payment of benefit at the maximum rate.  All benefit due to 2 February 1984, date of the latest medical certificate received, has been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be entitled to payment of either disability benefit or unemployment benefit a claimant requires a minimum of 26 contributions, paid or credited, in the <Col N="220" /> contribution year governing his claim. The contribution years governing payment of both disability benefit and unemployment benefit in 1982 and 1983 are 1980-81 and 1981-82 respectively.

      <P>There is no minimum age for entitlement to a supplementary welfare allowance.  The determination of entitlement in any case, however, is a matter for the health boards who administer the scheme.  It is understood from the South-Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme in County Wexford, that an application for an allowance in the case of the particular person concerned was disallowed as he is regarded as a dependant of his father, who is gainfully employed.  The applicant has been advised of the decision and of his right of appeal.  Persons under 18 years of age living at home would normally be regarded as dependants of their families since increases of social welfare payments and of supplementary welfare allowance are payable in respect of children up to that age.</P>

      <P>A routine review of the entitlements of the person concerned revealed that there had been an increase in his means consisting of half the weekly value of his wife's earnings and a holding. A question for reduction of his old age pension to the weekly rate of £2.60 plus £1.40 adult dependant allowance and £24.55 dependant child allowance in respect of three qualified children with effect from 6 January 1984 was therefore referred to the local pension committee for decision.  The reduction in the rate of pension has been implemented on a provisional basis pending the committee's decision.  If he is dissatisfied with the committee's decision he will have the right to appeal against it.  His means are assessed at £40.42 per week and are made up of half the weekly value of a holding and half the weekly value of his wife's earnings less all allowable expenses such as travelling and deductions from her salary. The statutory deduction of £312 in respect of three children was also taken into account.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 19 January 1983 and as she satisfied the contribution conditions she was paid at the maximum weekly flat-rate of £27.80.  She was entitled to pay-related benefit at £31.24 weekly from 2 February 1983 at £19.53 from 4 April 1983 and at £15.62 from 20 July 1983 and combined payments of flat-rate unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit continued to be made to her until 24 January 1984, when she exhausted her entitlement to unemployment benefit as a married woman on the completion of 312 days.  The rate of pay-related benefit payable to her was governed by her reckonable earnings during the relevant income tax period, 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982, and was not affected by the 85 per cent limitation applicable to the average net weekly earnings of an unemployment benefit applicant.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The length of time depends on the type of application.  Most of the applications consist of dealings in registered land such as transfers of whole properties or parts of properties.  The average delay for County Galway in processing such applications is about three months, within a range of three weeks to six months.  A small proportion of applications are applications for first registration or for establishment of title by possession (known as section 49 applications).  These are usually complex cases as already explained in reply to previous questions from the Deputy on 14 December, 1983 and 26 January 1984 (Dáil Official Report, Volume 346, No. 10, column 2280 and Volume 347, No. 5, column 1146).  At present, the average delay in processing them in respect of County Galway is about 17 months.</P>
