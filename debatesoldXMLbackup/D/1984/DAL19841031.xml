    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware of the difficulty in getting reasonable insurance cover for private dwellings in certain parts of the country; <Col N="679" /> and if he will take immediate steps to rationalise the whole question of general insurance with a view to providing reasonable cover for those seeking it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of a general difficulty in getting cover for private dwellings, although there may be problems in particular cases.  If the Deputy has particular cases in mind he could let my Department have the details.  He must bear in mind that while such cases can be investigated I cannot compel an insurer to take on a risk.</P>
      <P>I am not certain what the Deputy means when he refers to me taking steps to rationalise the question of general insurance.  The difficulty in private dwelling insurance stems basically from the crime rate.  As for problems in other areas of general insurance and prospective action by me, I would refer the Deputy to the replies to questions which are on the Order Paper relating to these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the premium increase in house contents cover has become so exorbitant that many people cannot adequately insure their premises?  Will he tell the House if he agrees with the practice of premium costing which is being carried on by the insurance companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the substantial increase in the cost of insuring house contents.  This is primarily due to the increase in the crime rate, particularly in Dublin, and the number of burglaries. The method of assessing price increases is well established in my Department. Last Thursday I informed the Deputy that I had carried out a review of the pricing mechanism.  I am satisfied that the method of calculating the price increase in relation to household contents is a sound one in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reply to the second part of my question.  Does he support the practice of premium costing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="680" />
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy explain what he means by premium costing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Premium costing&rdquo; is the terminology used in the trade where you can charge higher rates in certain areas in certain circumstances.  Does the Minister accept that as proper practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not premium costing.  Some insurance companies apply specific rates in certain geographical areas.  I have an obligation to allow companies price increases where the underwriting experience of the company reflects a need for such consideration.  I am satisfied that the rates applying to house contents in Dublin reflect the risk factor involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that insurance companies are refusing to quote premiums for houses which are unoccupied for long periods?  Will he make arrangements to have that cover provided for any householder who fails to get quoted an insurance premium for household contents, irrespective of the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it quite clear that I would be happy to investigate any specific cases the Deputy brings to my attention but, as I said in my reply, I cannot compel an insurer to take on a risk.  I am aware that insurance companies are taking a stricter line with regard to dwellings which are unoccupied for long periods.  However, I am prepared to investigate any particular case the Deputy brings to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that insurance companies are also refusing insurance cover to young people who set up business under the enterprise allowance scheme?  Will he examine this position and see what he can do to help these people?  There is not much point in the Government giving these people money if the insurance companies will not cover them for workers' and public <Col N="681" /> liability.  One business set up last year is about to close for this reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This question refers to dwellinghouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This arises out of the part of the Minister's reply which covered general insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question related specifically to private dwellings.  The other aspect of the question dealt with general insurance and I replied to that. Deputy Reynolds asked a separate question, but if he has specific queries in any field of insurance I will be happy to deal with them.  I cannot compel insurance companies to provide cover.  However, I am particularly interested in the enterprise allowance scheme and if the Deputy has any problems I will be happy to investigate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to give the details to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware that insurance companies are refusing to give insurance cover on flats in Cork city; and the proposals he has to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised this matter with me some time ago and I took the matter up on a general basis with the insurers representative bodies.  They informed me that, while the insurance of contents of flats presents extra risks, there was no specific policy of refusing cover generally.</P>
      <P>I invited the Deputy to let me have details of any cases where cover was refused.  If he can supply these details, I can have the cases followed up with the insurers, but he must bear in mind that I cannot compel an insurer to take on a particular risk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always anxious to help Deputies.  The number of burglaries increased from 25, 390 in 1981 to 32, 141 in 1982, an increase of 27 per cent, and it increased in 1983 to 35,826, a further increase of 11 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is the national figure, I think; but, if not, I will contact the Deputy.  In relation to fire and other damage to property, the underwriting results since 1979 have been particularly unfortunate for the companies.</P>

      <P>My Department are examining submissions received recently from interested parties arising out of the options I outlined in May 1984.  A number of further submissions are expected.</P>
      <P>When these have been examined I will bring forward proposals.  I hope to deal with this subject as quickly as practicable in the context of the parliamentary timetable; but, as the Deputy will appreciate, I am not in a position to specify a particular date by which legislation will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I am anxious that the legislation will be comprehensive and effective, and I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that.  I would need to have full consultation with the industrial interests to ensure that whatever legislation I introduce is effective.</P>

I am aware that the members of the National Association of Regional Game Councils were offered an insurance policy at a certain premium which I admit was higher than what was offered previously.  My officials have been in touch with the insurance companies in connection with this matter.  I would advise members of the council to consider their position carefully, not only in regard to possible injuries to their own members but also to members of the public.  While I do not wish to say too much about what the council has in mind for its members, I would advise members that they take proper steps to make sure they are fully insured while out shooting.</P>

    <P>1.  The above are approximate figures based on best estimates.</P>
    <P>2.  Import penetration is the estimate of Imports as a % of Apparent Home Consumption (Imports + Production &mdash; Exports).</P>
    <P>3.  Column (i) comprises articles of apparel and clothing accessories including knitwear.</P>
    <P>4.  Column (ii) comprises textile fibres and their wastes, textile yarn, fabrics, made-up articles, and related products, a large proportion of which are raw materials for further processing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I have a fair idea of what is in the tabular statement.  I think the Minister will agree that it will show a very extensive level of import penetration in the area of textiles.  Will the Minister agree that it is due largely to the conditions of competitiveness that apply here and have done for the past number of years?  Further, will he agree that the recently announced increase in ESB charges will make that competitive situation considerably worse.  Is he concerned about that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this subject quite comprehensively in May 1984.  By far the most significant share of imports are of EC origin and, because of our membership of the community, they must remain unrestricted.  Furthermore, it is important to realise that a large proportion of our imports of textiles are raw materials for further processing and reexport. The complex nature of the industry must be appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the level of textile production here has decreased substantially year after year for the past decade?  Does he accept that it is open to him and to his Department to make representations to the EC both so far as their own production is concerned and also so far as imports into the EC are concerned for a special arrangement for Irish textile producers that would enable a reasonable level of employment in that sector to be maintained here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1981 we imported £565 million worth of clothing and textiles and we exported £419 million worth.  The comparable figures for 1982 are £579 million and £436 million respectively, and for 1983, £628 million and £475 million respectively.  As can be seen from those figures, while imports have grown successively in those three years so also have exports grown.  I give those figures to emphasise the complex nature of the clothing and textile industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will indicate the extent of building material imports into this country; the <Col N="689" /> number of job opportunities lost because of these imports; and the steps he proposes taking so as to reduce the level of these imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that building material imports in 1983 amounted to about £370 million and that some 50 per cent of these imports could be manufactured here and generate direct employment of about 10,000 additional jobs.</P>
      <P>The development of the building materials sector is a matter primarily for individual firms themselves. However, there is a wide range of incentives and services available from the state agencies to encourage their development, and these agencies are already working closely with firms towards this objective, including the exploitation of the significant import substitution opportunities which exist.</P>
      <P>I understand that the sectoral development committee is at present finalising a report on the building and construction industry, including recommendations for the future development of the building materials sector.  This report will be carefully considered by the Government, on receipt, with a view to taking appropriate action to assist the development of the sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having increased both in 1980 and 1981, imports of building materials declined by 6 per cent in 1982 and by a further 1 per cent in 1983.  This reduction is due to the continuing recession in the building and construction industry, and also because there is a greater realisation on the part of Irish <Col N="690" /> manufacturers of the importance of increasing their share of the Irish market. The principal imports in 1983 were timber and related products, £80 million, iron and steel, £34 million, electrical, £33 million, and floor covering £31 million.  I will be happy to try to get some indication of the origins of the imports for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>While we all accept that the very deep recession in the building and construction industry has brought <Col N="692" /> down the level of imports, would the Minister agree that there have been very serious job losses in Border counties? Will he accept from me that special facilities were made available at a specific custom post in Ballyconnell in County Cavan to accommodate importers of those types of products which are causing job losses down here?</P>

      <P>I understand that a question about customs and excise matters has been put down to the Minister for Finance.  Obviously it is not a responsibility of my Department to answer for the Minister for Finance.  I have no proof that concrete product imports from Northern Ireland are at unrealistically low prices.  The IDA are willing to talk to companies facing difficulties in the concrete products sector. They are encouraging companies to use feasibility or R &amp; D grant programmes to identify new products and processes. The majority of concrete products are non-traded and large-scale export opportunities do not exist.  I want to assure the Deputy that the IDA are very well aware of the position.</P>

      <P>Further arising from the Minister's reply and a reply he gave to a previous question, would he agree with me that the very good reason behind the setting up of the import substitution unit in his own Department by me in 1982 was specifically to take note of what was happening in relation to imports and to replace them by import substitution products? Is he now saying that unit has been disbanded?  If so, when was it disbanded, and does he not see a reason for its existence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware of the serious level of food imports that exists at this time; the considerable job opportunities that are lost because of these imports; and the steps he will take to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the question of food imports has been under serious consideration for some time.  It is clear that the level of these imports, which reached £845 million in 1983, should provide opportunities for the provision of jobs and import substitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been seriously concerned, as <Col N="697" /> indeed has my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, about the apparent lack of success in supplying the market from home sources.  Opportunities for import substitution are constantly studied, and there are several on-going activities relating to efforts to expand the food processing sector.</P>
    <P>A number of actions have been undertaken which I feel have clarified the true position in regard to the level of substitution which may be possible.  An interdepartmental committee was set up to carry out an in-depth study of imports, based on the 1982 figures.  It is interesting to note that this committee concluded that, of the £753 million worth of food imported in 1982, only £200 million worth could reasonably be said to be substitutable. This indicates that the situation in regard to imports, while serious, is not as bad as might be generally believed.</P>
    <P>At another level, last January the IDA concluded their study of imports as revealed at retail outlets.  This study more or less confirmed the level of substitutability mentioned previously.  It also indicated specific areas of opportunity for private enterprise to exploit.  The Deputy may be assured that the appropriate financial and other assistance will continue to be made available in respect of viable projects in this area.</P>
    <P>An important initiative in the food area which has been undertaken by the Government is the establishment of the Ministers of State Co-ordinating Group on the Food Industry.  This group, which consists of the Ministers of State at the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Fisheries and Forestry, Agriculture and Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism have been given the task of examining the roles of the various Departments and State agencies involved with industry, with a view to streamlining their activities and maximising their contributions to the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point out that membership of the EC means that we are in a free trade situation.  This means that our market is open to imports, but it also entitles us to free access to other EC <Col N="698" /> markets and to the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy.  These have enabled us to export £1,743 million worth of food in 1983, that is, over twice the value of imports to this country.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, while efforts will continue to be made to achieve the maximum level of import substitution, we must remember that, if the Governments in our principal export markets pursued a similar strategy, serious difficulties could be caused for our food processing industry, which relies so much on export markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very comprehensive reply from the Minister.  Would he include in it, if possible, the type of statistics he gave in answer to Question No. 8?  That is, the value of the total amount of food imports competing with the home manufactured product and also the number of jobs which could be created?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot indicate the number of jobs, but I have given a clear indication of the value of imports that could be substituted.  That is around £200 million.  How that would reflect on employment is difficult to ascertain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the estimated value of competing products would be in the sum of £600 million and that food imports have grown eight-fold in the last eight years?  Would he agree that with fruit and vegetable imports totalling £155 million last year, he should be taking some positive steps? I must reiterate what Deputy Reynolds <Col N="699" /> said &mdash; it is a pity that the imports substitution unit has been disbanded.  Would the Minister agree that the Government have thrown in the towel as far as imports in this area are concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>As previously announced, the IDA in July of this year concluded negotiations with a US company for the establishment of a project in the factory premises of the company referred to by the Deputy.  At that time it was envisaged that the project would commence operations around now but, unfortunately, the company have encountered a number of difficulties which have led them to delay proceeding with the establishment of the proposed Irish operation. The Industrial Development Authority, who are maintaining close contact with the company, are hopeful that, if present problems can be resolved and no new difficulties arise, the company will decide <Col N="702" /> to proceed with the project in the not too distant future.</P>

I would not like to say more at this stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Charles J. Haughey has been given permission to put a Private Notice Question to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will appoint a Cabinet Minister to take full personal charge of a national campaign involving the mobilisation of all available resources to ensure the immediate flow of food and other necessary supplies by the quickest and most direct method possible to Ethiopia and other famine stricken countries of Africa; and if he will also, as President of the European Council, personally contact all the Heads of Government to arrange for the immediate release of all suitable food surpluses in Community hands and their immediate transportation by whatever means are necessary to the same areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, very ably supported by the Minister of State at his Department, is already exercising, most actively and with considerable success, his ministerial responsibility to direct and co-ordinate Irish efforts to secure the objectives to which reference is made in the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have agreed, and the Minister announced in the Dáil on 25 October, an additional allocation of £250,000 to the Disaster Relief subhead <Col N="707" /> of the vote for International Co-operation for the relief of famine in Ethiopia, in addition to previous allocations to that country of £60,000.  This will bring the total allocation for disaster relief this year to £550,000.  In proportionate terms, the additional allocation is on a par with additional sums decided by some other member countries of the Community.</P>
    <P>The previous allocations for the relief of distress in Ethiopia were allocated to the relief programmes being conducted in that country by Irish non-governmental organisations.  The activities funded have included emergency feeding operations and the internal transport of food aid within Ethiopia.  These organisations have been doing magnificent work and, on behalf of the Government, I wish to express our appreciation of and support for their work which has evoked a most generous public response, fully in accord with the best traditions of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Up to £750,000 had been collected up to recently by appeals launched by the various non-governmental organisations, and it is already clear that further significant amounts are being subscribed, as public consciousness of the tragedy threatening, not only in Ethiopia but in other countries in Africa and indeed, elsewhere, has grown.  Moreover, the impact of Irish personnel in the field is such that the amounts of funds being channelled in direct relief work through them by other funding agencies, including the European Community, is much larger than the funds collected from Irish sources.</P>
    <P>While quite a number of organisations are involved in fund-raising in Ireland, I understand that there is good co-ordination between them, both in Ireland and in the delivery of aid in the field in Ethiopia. It is clear from detailed reports from the field, in particular from the Christian Relief and Development Association, the main co-ordinating body for the voluntary relief effort in Ethiopia, that aid is getting through to the people in need, largely through the non-governmental organisations.  However, <Col N="708" /> in order to ensure the best possible co-ordination, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of State, have had lengthy consultations with the Irish voluntary agencies primarily concerned on all aspects of the current emergency, including how the Government might best liaise with them in deploying efficiently the additional funds made available by the Government for emergency relief.</P>
    <P>I should mention here that one purpose to which these funds are being put is to cover the cost of transporting Irish grain being purchased with £60,000 being provided for that purpose by the Irish Farmers Association.</P>
    <P>In view of the magnificent efforts over a long period by so many organisations, it is perhaps invidious to refer to any single initiative.  However, I hope I will be pardoned if I avail of this opportunity to refer, for the information of Deputies, to the airlift today in an Irish Boeing 737 aircraft supplied by Guinness Peat Aviation Ltd. of six and a half tons of supplies, comprising medicines, milk powder, crushed grain, spare parts for trucks, blankets and plastic sheeting.  A second plane load of 22 tons of food and medicine will leave Dublin next week, with the transport costs being borne by the Government.  A further aircraft carrying supplies will leave Dublin on 12 November.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State and the Government, are sparing no effort in mobilising resources and in ensuring their delivery by the most direct methods possible, through the network of contacts established over a long period by the Minister's Department and through the distribution channels of which they have an intimate knowledge.</P>
    <P>In regard to action by the European Community, I can tell the Deputy that, even before our Presidency commenced, it had been agreed at a meeting of Ministers chaired by me that special efforts should be made during it to ensure a more substantial Community response, both in the short term and in the long term, to the problems of hunger in the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> At the Foreign Affairs Council on 17 September, the Minister of State raised the food crisis in Africa with a view to emphasising its dimensions and the need for exceptional assistance to alleviate the deteriorating situation.  In the subsequent discussion in the Council, there was a general desire to take further steps to help in addition to the level of assistance already provided and the Commission indicated that they would bring forward proposals.</P>
    <P>Following constant contact, recently greatly intensified, with the Community institutions concerned, the way has been cleared to transfer 32 million ECU, about IR£23 million to the emergency relief line of the Community budget.  This will enable the Commission to commence an immediate plan of emergency action for Ethiopia and other countries affected by famine.  This money will be used to cover internal transport costs, medicines, blankets and the purchase of food locally, where available, in the African countries affected.</P>
    <P>This programme will be put into action with the support of Commission delegations, governments and organisations operating on the ground and in close co-operation with the competent international organisations and with Community member states, both under existing co-ordinating procedures and at a meeting on the Sahel and Ethiopia, to take place shortly in Brussels.  In the short term the Community is also moving to provide an additional 100,000 tonnes of cereals, in addition to the 45,000 tonnes already provided in normal and emergency food aid to Ethiopia this year under the Lomé Convention.</P>
    <P>In view of the estimates of food requirements over the next 12 months for people at risk, major further efforts will also be required by other, non-Community donors.  The Secretary-General of the United Nations issued an appeal on 26 October and the Foreign Minister of Australia has called for a UN lead for co-ordination of international relief.  This is clearly a sensible approach.</P>
    <P>It is our intention that the Foreign <Col N="710" /> Ministers of the Ten would review the situation at their informal meeting in Ireland next weekend, and the Irish Presidency are proposing that there be detailed discussions at the meeting of the Council to be attended by Development Ministers on 6 November.  The Deputy can be assured that the Presidency will take all steps that can be effective in evoking a Community response, commensurate with its place in the world, to the emergency in Ethiopia, in many other countries in Africa and elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the deep, widespread, emotional impact on the Irish people of the famine situation in Ethiopia, in particular, and in the other surrounding African countries? Would he agree with me &mdash; I am sure he would &mdash; that nothing less than an assurance that everything possible is being done on as large a scale as possible will satisfy public opinion about this tragic situation?</P>
      <P>Furthermore, would the Taoiseach accept that in proposing that a Cabinet Minister be put in full charge of the national campaign I was speaking from long experience of these matters?  I know that in a situation like this &mdash; and I am sure the Taoiseach will agree &mdash; it is necessary to cut through bureaucratic delays and log jams, that while the Minister for Foreign Affairs will do what he can in co-ordinating the efforts, nevertheless it would be desirable that some one particular Minister be given authority and responsibility by the Taoiseach and the Government to do everything possible within this country to ensure that the maximum possible effort is put into this exercise.  I am sure the Taoiseach would agree also that, while an individual Minister might exercise his maximum efforts in co-ordination and co-operation, nevertheless what is concerned here is a job of mobilising every resource we have inside the country, and getting the co-operation of other Ministers, Departments, institutes and State bodies so that the maximum effort is undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Taoiseach agrees with me <Col N="711" /> on the whole tragedy of the situation in Ethiopia, but would he not consider appointing such a Minister with overall authority and responsibility for mobilising everything we can within the country, making a maximum effort in this regard, not taking in any way from what individuals or charitable organisations are doing, but getting all organisations, private and public, particularly State companies and Government Departments, activated and motivated in an all-out effort?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's assessment of public concern that everything possible be done in this country, and indeed by other countries with which we are associated, to relieve this situation. I do not think anybody would demur from that.  The question is how best to organise this effort.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of State in his Department with particular responsibility for development co-operation, between them have the contacts with the organisations in this country which have been effective in developing non-governmental aid, both in organising the collection of funds, resources and in arranging for their distribution on the spot.  I am quite clear that the appropriate Minister to be in charge of this whole activity is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, assisted by his Minister of State. To involve any other Minister in the process would be only to divert the single-minded effort away from the area in which it is being undertaken.  I am convinced that the arrangement we have of giving the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Minister of State full authority in this matter &mdash; and here they have the full backing of the Government in everything they decide to do in this regard &mdash; is the best way of handling the situation and that any other arrangement would only carry the risk of confusion or delay as against the arrangement we now have which has been tried, tested and has worked extraordinarily well.  The relationship between the Minister, his Minister of State and the agencies concerned <Col N="712" /> is very close.  I will do nothing to disturb that.  I will do everything I can to encourage its further development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not press the Taoiseach any further on that point.  I must say, however, that I would not be satisfied that a Minister for Foreign Affairs, as such, would be in a position, for instance, to direct An Bord Bainne, Aer Lingus or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question, Deputy, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;anybody else.  I shall leave that point for the Taoiseach to consider further.</P>
      <P>May I ask him about his position as President of the European Council where perhaps his efforts could be even more efficacious than anything we could do in this country?  Would he advert to the fact that my question calls for the release of all suitable food surpluses?  I accept that some surpluses may not be suitable, but all available and suitable food surpluses should be released and then transported as expeditiously as possible?  In that context might I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that every day there leave this country refrigerated trucks carrying Irish meat and products to the middle of Africa.  On one occasion, because the countries of Western Europe were determined that it should be done, they were able by an air lift, to support the city of West Berlin for a long and considerable period using nothing but aeroplanes. When there was an armed conflict in Nigeria different countries experienced no difficulty in flying in an unceasing stream of arms to that particular part of Africa?  I am merely mentioning these matters as an indication to the Taoiseach of what has been done in the past and what could be done now if Europe dedicated and committed itself to doing something on a vast scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Taoiseach accept from me that the ordinary person in the street finds it very difficult to understand how we have all these mountains, lakes and surpluses <Col N="713" /> in Europe and why they cannot be made available to the starving peoples of Africa?</P>
    <P>In response to a particular part of my question would the Taoiseach indicate whether he has been in touch, individually and severally, with the Heads of Governments of the Community and, if not, whether he thinks it would be profitable for him to do so at this stage with a view to securing some major, dramatic breakthrough in this appalling and tragic situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have secured a major and dramatic breakthrough in terms of Community aid in the decision recently taken.  The Irish Presidency has played a significant part in bringing that about.  As I indicated in reply to the original question, we have been concerned since the beginning of our Presidency with this problem, concerned that the Community should act at a level of effectiveness in providing the financial resources and in making available relevant and appropriate forms of food surpluses.  We put a particular effort into securing that this be achieved.  It might be fair to say that consciousness of this problem is greatest perhaps in Ireland and in Britain, for particular reasons of the publicity that this appalling tragedy has secured in these two countries.  Therefore we have played a particular role in activating the concern and interest of other countries in the Community in general.  I think that has been done effectively and that we now have for the immediate future adequate resource and an adequate supply of food, grain in particular, available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems remaining are primarily of distribution in Ethiopia &mdash; I shall concentrate on the short term at present &mdash; that is those envisaged in the next month or two.  As I say, the primary problem is one of distribution within Ethiopia. There are difficulties, like congestion in the ports.  There is the possibility of bypassing the ports by air or otherwise and delivering the goods by trucks to affected areas.  These problems are being tackled. We have non-government organisations which are being used by us and indeed <Col N="714" /> by other countries to get supplies through.  We are concentrating our efforts on the problems that remain to be solved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>How much of the £250,000 referred to last week has been allocated and in use?  The Taoiseach said earlier that some of the money would cover the cost of transporting drugs and the grain from the IFA.  What is being done with the balance of the money?  The Taoiseach said that 100,000 tonnes of EC surplus grain was being allocated.  How soon will that grain reach Ethiopia, apart altogether from the distribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately half of the 100,000 tonnes of cereals will go to Ethiopia.  This matter was discussed in Brussels today among representatives of the ten countries.  Already, substantial supplies have been allocated to Ethiopia. The total requirements in the next 12 months will be 600,000 tonnes.  Therefore, the amount allocated already will be sufficient for a short time and then the position will have to be reviewed.  The important thing is that we have reached this stage of allocating the resources and providing the food aid for the immediate future.  We will now have to pursue the matter to ensure that the aid will get to the affected areas as rapidly as possible. Later we will have to review the position to ensure continuance of this assistance by the Community and other countries who can provide the means.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann extend its deep sympathy to the Parliament and people of India on the death of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have been shocked to learn this morning of the assassination of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of India.  The loss of this great leader is indeed a profound tragedy for India with its population of many different races and religions.  India is a country with which Ireland has close friendships and many ties dating back to the foundation of our State.  Reflecting these ties our two countries have exchanged Presidential visits on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>I know Deputies will want to join with me in expressing the hope that the aftermath of this terrible event will be peaceful in that great democracy, and also in conveying our sorrow to the Government and Parliament of India, and to the family of the late Mrs. Gandhi, on this appalling tragedy.</P>

The news of the assassination of the Indian Prime Minister will be received with horror and dismay throughout Ireland.  A great leader of the world's greatest democracy, with all its daunting and complex problems, Mrs. Gandhi dedicated herself with remarkable devotion throughout her life to the service of her country and all her people.  She <Col N="804" /> followed devotedly in the footsteps of her illustrious father, Pandit Nehru, a friend and admirer for many years of Éamon de Valera.  Because of the special ties, political and cultural, which have long bound our countries together, the news of Mrs. Gandhi's death will be all the more keenly felt here.</P>
      <P>His Excellency, the Indian Ambassador, this morning spoke to me of the fact that when the State of India was being established they drew very heavily on the Irish Constitution for the formulation of their own Constitution.  That shows how important and significant and historical are the ties between our two countries. Our prayer is that the people of India will overcome successfully this tragic event in the history of their country and that India's future will be one of progress and peace.</P>
      <P>In joining with the Taoiseach's expression of sympathy I wish on behalf of my colleagues in Fianna Fáil and on my own behalf to extend deepest sympathy to Mrs. Gandhi's family and to all the people of India on their grievous loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1984.</P>
      <P>The proposed regulations are being made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, which was introduced by a previous administration mainly to secure a financial contribution from the farming sector towards the cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication programme. The Act provided that the levies could be varied by regulations and rates of £1.90 per bovine animal slaughtered or exported live and 0.3p per gallon of milk produced were introduced with effect from 1 January 1984.  The original levies introduced by the then Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Gibbons, on 1 September, 1979 were withdrawn on 1 February 1981.</P>
      <P>In the national plan 1985-1987, the Government decided that, from November 1984 to the end of 1985, an increased contribution should be sought from the farming community towards the cost of the disease eradication programme.  The rates of levies proposed &mdash; a doubling of the present rates to £3.80 per bovine animal slaughtered or exported live and 0.6p per gallon of milk &mdash; will apply from 5 November 1984, and are expected to yield an additional £7 million in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the live export of cattle, I would refer to a matter raised a few minutes ago by Deputy O'Keeffe.  We as a Government are very interested in continuing to trade with Libya.  We have nothing but the highest admiration for the wonderful work that has been done <Col N="809" /> in this regard by some leading cattle exporters.</P>
    <P>We would like to reciprocate the very strong market which has been generated. We would like to do as much trade as possible with Libya.  I want to clear up any confusion or misconception which may have arisen on this matter.  There have been a number of statements to the effect that the Government were not interested in doing business with the Libyan Government or buying Libyan oil.  We would be only too glad to do so but &mdash; and this I must stress &mdash; the price has to be competitive.  If the terms of the sale of Libyan oil are competitive we will be only too glad to do business with them. We have nothing but the best relations with the Libyan Government, and I would like to contradict any impression which some people have attempted to give to the contrary.  We are very anxious that that trade continues.</P>
    <P>In 1983 we sold 77,000 head of live cattle to Libya and almost 7,000 tons of beef.  That is a very valuable trade and we want to retain it.  At present a technical delegation is preparing to go to Libya to discuss the terms of any such sale.  As I have repeatedly stated, I would be only too glad to go to Libya to conclude any such deal if the terms are right and the oil prices are competitive.  I have been willing to go there over the past few months and I will gladly go there in the coming weeks if necessary.</P>
    <P>It has been made clear that a meeting of the Joint Commission would not take place unless there was a commitment to buy Libyan oil.  That has been an inhibition because we have said that we are only prepared to buy at a competitive price.  As everyone knows, there is a very difficult situation in the world oil market because of moves by a number of countries to undercut the prices being demanded by most oil-producing countries. That has created an uncertain climate and it will be some days, if not weeks, before the situation is clarified.</P>
    <P>We export live animals and beef to a number of oil-producing countries.  I would like to give the House an indication <Col N="810" /> of the volume of that trade.  In 1983 we exported 191,000 head of live cattle to the United Kingdom, 138,000 head of live cattle to Egypt and 77,000 head of live cattle to Libya.  Deputies will gather from that that the live trade is thriving. Our main importer of live cattle is the United Kingdom, our second importer is Egypt and our third is Libya, but those statistics can change from year to year. Libya has been our most constant customer over the past number of years and we value that trade.</P>
    <P>In 1983 we exported 110,000 tonnes of beef to the United Kingdom, 52,000 tonnes to other EEC countries, 623,000 tonnes to Iran, 6,616 tonnes to Libya, 9,694 tonnes to Egypt and 67,824 tonnes to other destinations.  Deputies will see that we are not exporting to only one particular country.  We are exporting enormous quantities of beef and other agricultural products to many oil-producing countries.  If we had to pay all those countries the top price for oil, it would mean a considerable expense to the Exchequer and, indirectly, to the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, there is a need for prices to be competitive.  We cannot impose additional burdens on the Exchequer and the taxpayer if we can buy the commodity cheaper elsewhere. If the Libyan Government wish to do business with us at competitive prices, we will be only too glad to do so.  I want that message to go out very clearly from this House.  There has been a great deal of confusion about our intentions.  There is no political consideration involved.  I read a startling headline in one of yesterday's evening papers which said this was mainly a political consideration, and we have read similar stories in recent weeks.  I want to repeat: there is no political consideration involved.  This is strictly a business deal.</P>
    <P>The following six Middle East countries are major oil producers: Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Iran and Saudia Arabia.  In 1983 the value of our agricultural exports was as follows: Algeria, £35.3 million; Libya, £41.1 million, Egypt, £77.6 million, Iraq, £9.8 million &mdash; a little low <Col N="811" /> perhaps but the previous year the figure was £40.7 million &mdash; Iran £32.2 million and Saudia Arabia £31.7 million.  Deputies can see the significance of those exports to these oil producing countries which are members of OPEC.  We could also add to that list Nigeria to whom in the past we have exported a colossal amount of fish.  If we were to have reciprocal trade with all those oil producing countries, paying the top price for oil, there would be an enormous extra cost to our Exchequer.  That aspect has to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The bovine disease levies were, of course, introduced in 1979 by the then administration.  I would point out that at that time they fixed the rates of levy at 0.5 pence per gallon of milk and at £3 per head of cattle.  Translated into present-day values those rates would amount to fractionally less than 1p per gallon and just under £6 per head of cattle, whereas the rates now proposed are substantially lower at 0.6 pence per gallon of milk and £3.80 per animal.  Adding to this the fact that cattle and milk prices today are much better than they were in 1979 it is readily apparent that the impact of the levies now is far less than it was then.  I would ask the Opposition to bear this in mind when speaking on the motion.  The rates of levy now proposed could be increased by about 60 per cent before they would represent the same burden on producers as applied when the levies were originally introduced in 1979.</P>
    <P>These increases must be viewed in the context of the quite massive investment of Exchequer moneys in the eradication programme to date and the substantially increased funding being allocated for the schemes over the next three years.  The fact that we are no longer in receipt of an EC contribution towards the cost of eradication measures must also be taken into account.  A sum of £31.5 million is being provided for the operation of the schemes in 1985, that is, an increase of £10.5 million on the 1984 allocation.  It is a very sizeable amount for disease eradication, a programme that has not met with the kind of success we would have liked, <Col N="812" /> especially in recent years.  The figure of £31.5 million is exceptionally high when compared with figures in previous years which averaged around £20 million.  In fact, in 1979 the figure was as low as £14 million.  We are providing a very considerable amount of extra money for the disease eradication programme but we want to get results and we intend to get them.</P>
    <P>While brucellosis eradication is at a very advanced stage and ultimate success is now well within our grasp, efforts towards eradication of bovine TB have been less successful.  For some years past, our eradication measures have managed only to contain the disease at an incidence of around 2.5 per cent of herds.  The result is that potential for growth and development of the livestock and livestock products sector is being seriously hampered, with consequent losses to the farming community.  The incidence of bovine TB in herds increased in the period 1981 to 1983 despite the vast amount spent on the scheme.  This must give cause for alarm.</P>
    <P>In their national plan, the Government have cited the final elimination of TB as a priority and to that end a fresh onslaught is to be made against the disease. While substantially increased funds have been allocated to the eradication programme over the next three years, including an additional provision for stock replacement, the Government have made it clear that availability of these moneys will be subject to the introduction of a number of radical changes in the operation of the disease eradication schemes.  These are set out in paragraph 7.36 of the Government's national plan and include direct nomination of veterinary surgeons for TB and brucellosis scheme testing; payment of testing fees to a veterinary surgeon who carries out the scheme test thus making the veterinary surgeon personally responsible for the proper execution of the test; earlier removal of reactor animals; tighter official supervision of all trading at marts; strict enforcement of all procedures and prosecutions in all cases for breaches of disease regulations; the establishment of <Col N="813" /> a central epidemiological unit in my Department to co-ordinate and assist in the analysis of disease outbreaks, prevention of disease and so on.  In addition, I have arranged for the establishment of an advisory group on research and investigation into various aspects of TB. Experts from UCD, An Foras Talúntais, the practitioners and my own animal health research staff will be involved. The general aim of the group will be to pinpoint areas of research which they consider require further pursuit.</P>
    <P>The health status of the national herd is of major importance to the future development of Irish agriculture.  In the interest of our very valuable meat and livestock trade, both domestic and foreign, it must be obvious to all that bovine TB and brucellosis must be totally eradicated. The cost of the schemes to date &mdash; over £750 million at present-day values, excluding administration &mdash; has proved a massive drain on Exchequer funds over the years.  If administration costs were included, the total cost would be in excess of £1,000 million in present-day values. The Government are convinced that, with the co-operation of all interests concerned, the extra funding now being provided, allied to the changes set out in the national plan, will give renewed impetus to the eradication programme and will bring about a significant reduction in disease incidence levels.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I wish to give notice to the House that we are opposing this motion for many reasons which I will outline.  The approach by the Minister and the Department with regard to the eradication of bovine TB is vague, to put it mildly.  The emphasis they have put in their approach to eradicating the disease is not in accordance with the facts.  I welcome what the Minister has said regarding the importance of the national herd to our economy and to our meat exports and I agree with him.  I have said in this House and elsewhere that the Minister will have my full support in the eradication of bovine TB.  When the Minister was appointed about two years ago he made the same remark that he <Col N="814" /> intended to get results.  He went so far as to say that he would be prepared to stand on corns if necessary to get results but after two years in the Department I am afraid the results that have been achieved have fallen short of what is necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the amount of taxpayers money involved in disease eradication.  I question the percentage that goes to the farmers by way of compensation in the grants, the hardship fund and the special restocking grants that are now available.  I should say about 25 per cent of the total cost has gone to farmers and the rest has been spent elsewhere. Now the farmers by way of increased levy are being asked to contribute more but, at the same time, their power, in particular their right to nominate their own veterinary surgeon, is being taken from them.  This is a step in the wrong direction. If the Minister and the Department are interested in eradicating this disease they must realise they will not get it by coercion but will only get it by encouragement. I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>
      <P>There are many other very laudable suggestions in the document <i>Building on Reality,</i> but I wonder will they be implemented? Can they be implemented? Have they been implemented in the past? One bone of contention I always had was the slowness of the procedure in bringing people to court who do not co-operate with the disease eradication regulations. This procedure has taken many years.  I should like to see an improvement in it, but there is no mention of that aspect in the suggested improvements.  I cannot see how the &ldquo;farmer nomination to be replaced by direct Department of Agriculture nomination of veterinary surgeons to carry out all testing and blood sampling (other than thirty-day testing) under the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication programmes&rdquo; will speed up the eradication of disease.  I fully endorse the suggestion in chapter 2.51 on page 45:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final clearance of bovine TB from the national herd remains one of <Col N="815" /> the most urgent problems facing agriculture. It is evident that despite substantial cost to the Exchequer, little progress towards complete eradication has been achieved over the last few years.</P>
    <P>It is worth examining why we have not achieved the progress we would like to have achieved over the past years.  I will outline ways and means of how this can be achieved.  The chapter goes on:</P>
    <P>Faced with a situation where it is essential to get rid of the disease in order to safeguard our exports of livestock and livestock products, the Government must be satisfied that funds committed to the eradication programme in future are spent effectively.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>Since the present arrangements for tackling the disease have not proved effective, the Government believe that there must be radical changes in those arrangements.  Subject to the introduction of these changes, details of which are set out in chapter 7, substantial additional funding is being set aside for disease eradication, including new special assistance for herd depopulation. There will also be an increase in the bovine disease eradication levy...</P>
    <P>Increased moneys are being made available but at whose expense?  At the expense of the farmers.  The farmers' own money is being spent on the eradication of disease.  The right of the farmer to nominate his own veterinary surgeon to carry out bovine TB testing is being removed. At the same time, the amount of the levy is being doubled.  This is not acceptable to farmers in all fairness and justice.  On the one hand there are increased penalties and, on the other hand, his right to nominate his own veterinary surgeon is being removed.  This is the veterinary surgeon who knows the health status of the herd and the other circumstances of the farmer.</P>
    <P>In my contribution to the debate on <Col N="816" /> the plan from which I have just quoted, I welcomed the steps proposed for the elimination of bovine TB and I promised the Minister my full support in the implementation of these measures.  It was a pity that the Government decided in the very next paragraph to double the disease eradication levy paid by farmers and take a further £1 million out of farmers' pockets. The impression is given that only the Government are seriously concerned about the progress and the deficiencies of our TB eradication programme.  Farming organisations and various organisations representing veterinary surgeons have already outlined how the disease should be eradicated.</P>
    <P>It is very wrong to give the impression that the Government are the only people concerned about the disease eradication programme.  No one is more disturbed about the lack of progress than the farmers themsleves.  They have contributed very largely over the past number of years towards the eradication of that disease. They need the positive assistance of the Department's officials and particularly the administrative section of the Department. I should like to see more flexibility at local level and at county level in our efforts to eradicate disease, rather than having the technical people at local level hamstrung by bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>Like everybody else, farmers contribute indirectly to the cost of this scheme. They also contribute directly in milk and livestock levies.  Those levies are now to be doubled and quite rightly farmers will be more critical than ever about how the programme is managed.  Through their representatives farmers should have a major say in how the programme is managed in the future.</P>
    <P>There are dangers in imposing such levies for specific purposes.  At first glance £3.80 may seem a small deduction from the price of a bullock, but it could be a substantial proportion of the profit on fattening the animal.  It is the same with the milk levy.  The farmer's own livelihood is threatened by disease.  It is his herd and it is in his best interest to see that everything possible is done to secure disease eradication.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> For the benefit of the House I should like to outline the amounts being paid by farmers in respect of animals slaughtered. The disease eradication levy will now be increased to £3.80 per animal slaughtered.  The cost of the veterinary inspection amounts to something in the region of £3.25 per animal.  There is also the CBF levy of 70p per animal, which makes a total of £7.75 a year.  When talking about the disease eradication levy one is also including other levies as well. The House should see this matter in its proper context.</P>
    <P>Part of the statutory contributions of the dairying sector, of all of which I have not details, would comprise of the co-responsibility levy of 2.9p per gallon, which levy was allowed to be increased substantially, at the last review of agricultural prices by the Minister in addition to the super-levy which will be imposed on a number of our dairy farmers in the very near future.  We have the increased disease eradication levy of 6p per gallon, making a total contribution of 3.5p for every gallon of milk delivered.  That is only part of the story.  There are other levies, butter inspection levies and so on, which could amount to anything between 4p and 5p per gallon deduction on every gallon of milk supplied.  This will give the House some indication of the contribution being made by the farming community towards disease eradication up to now and the concern of that community.  This certainly gives the lie to the statement made by the Minister and his Government in their document that there is only concern about disease eradication at departmental level.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House, I would like to outline the amount paid on the disease eradication levy by the different sizes of dairy farmers.  To take the example of a dairy farmer with a herd of 30 cows, he would pay £1,050 in a full year. A farmer with a herd of 40 cows would pay a total of £1,400 in a full year; with 50 cows, £1,750; with 60 cows, £2,100; with 70 cows, £2,450; with 80 cows, £2,800; with 90 cows, £3,150, and so on. Again this is a very sizeable contribution <Col N="818" /> from the farming community, in particular the dairying sector.  It is a clear indication that our farmers are making their contribution towards disease eradication. That is in addition to all the other levies which are being imposed upon the farming community at present.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the present system whereby the farmer would nominate his own vet who should be the vet attending his other calls and that the local district veterinary officer instruct this veterinary surgeon when a test has to be carried out.  It is now suggested that this right of the farmer to nominate his own vet be removed.  I wonder what is the real purpose behind the suggestion.  It is not in the interest of disease eradication.  The Department know only too well that the serious problem does not lie in that area. I assume that there is a more sinister involvement, that this goes far deeper than specifically disease eradication.  I hope that I am wrong, but I am practically certain that I am right in this.  I say that the Minister for Finance could have a say in this decision and that the background to it is not totally confined to the Department of Agriculture.  I cannot see an improvement following on getting rid of this right of the farmer.  I ask the Minister to spell out specifically the reasons for this.  There are objections from the farming organisations and, indeed, from other interests involved.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister will have an opportunity to reply afterwards.  I ask him to deal specifically with that aspect.  Now that the farmer will be making a greater contribution towards <Col N="819" /> disease eradication, the Department, the Government and the Minister, have an obligation to carry out more research into the root cause of bovine TB.  I suggest that the Minister consider carrying out a blood test, which I understand is the practice in other countries.  This practice may have to be introduced here to accelerate eradication of this disease.  Testing, even with the best will in the world, is not 100 per cent perfect.  There are many problems, the time of testing and many other matters.  Would the Minister outline his views with regard to the suggestion of a blood test to ensure a more speedy eradication of the disease?  I understand that this method has been successful in some countries.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated, we have fallen down very badly in the area of research.  I should like to see the research section of the Department improved and strengthened.  In recent months we had a very serious breakdown in the scheme in a number of parts of my county for no apparent reason and my inquiries only within the past few days have not resulted in ascertaining why that sudden breakdown occurred.  We should be equipped fully with research facilities that can identify the source speedily and readily so that we can eliminate that source immediately when this happens.  In this situation there was a test which indicated that all was clear and a few weeks later the farmer concerned was carrying out the test for the disposal of the animals and it was found that these animals had a disease.  Some of them with lesions were killed.  Again there is no apparent reason for this sudden breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of the type of germ.  It is the same in this country as in other countries?  We have carried out research in this area.  When the disease is chronic in herds does the germ live in the soil?  Does it live in sheds?  What is the outcome, if any, of research that may have been undertaken on wildlife as a carrier of this disease?  It is appropriate when we talk about the eradication of disease and a greater financial contribution by the farmer, to carry out more <Col N="820" /> research on wildlife and possible further slaughtering of wildlife &mdash; to consider all this in order to improve research facilities. The Minister might like to give the House his views on this when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister also if any other types of tests can be carried out. He has an obligation at this time in the interest of the herd owner and of the economy to examine every possibility to ensure that this disease is eradicated as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I suggest that two reads of testing each year in all herds should be carried out by the veterinary surgeon nominated by the farmer and paid by the Department.  Perhaps we should do away with the DEDs as areas for this purpose and replace them with a system using natural boundaries such as rivers, roads etc.  In this way everybody is taken in and a whole block could be tested, depending on the size, in about four to six weeks, certainly within eight weeks.  The district electoral division would not necessarily take in all farmers in a block.  A farmer living on one side of the road could have his herd tested whereas the farmer at the other side who would be in a different DED may not have his herd tested at the same time. My suggestion should be considered in order to ensure that all the animals in a block in an area are tested at the one time.  The system we are adopting at present is not foolproof in so far as carrying out tests on every animal in an area is concerned.</P>
    <P>What I suggest may be a radical change, but we need radical changes if we are to eliminate this disease once and for all.  I agree with the Minister that perhaps we have been tinkering around for far too long with this.  Again I emphasise that the veterinary surgeon should be nominated by the farmer because this veterinary surgeon makes normal calls to the farm.  He knows the status of the herd and of the land the farmer would have and the land he would take in grazing. He would know the complete scene with regard to that farm and the herd on the <Col N="821" /> farm and would be fully aware of the situation.  We need full and total co-operation from the farming community in disease eradication.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the reads of testing are carried out speedily over as short a period as possible I suggest that the veterinary surgeons concerned would have an opportunity of employing assistants who would be provided by the Department.  This might be only a 12-month operation.  According to this motion the double levy will be in operation until the end of December of next year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the identification of reactors, the veterinary surgeon who reads the test should issue the reactor permit on the spot.  We all know that at present the herd is read and if there are reactors it takes some time to have these punched and from the time of punching until the removal of the animal further time elapses and in the meantime the disease could spread further.  The veterinary surgeon who reads the test should also issue the reactor permit there and then.  I do not think that that is impossible. It could be done and this would obviate the delay which is very apparent at present.  At present also a herd owner can sell his reactors to a dealer.  Once a reactor is identified that animal should go straight to slaughter, to the factory.  I hope that this arrangement will be in operation in this great drive that the Minister is suggesting to eradicate this dreaded disease.</P>
    <P>The grant system will have to be examined carefully.  There is a need to update the amount of grants paid and to increase the amount in the hardship fund.  Above all, a replacement fund must be introduced to compensate those whose herds are liquidated.  The Minister should consider increasing the grants for small and young cattle.  If those grants are introduced the farming community will co-operate.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have held the view that if we had an adequate compensation system, it need only be a once-off effort rather than a mediocre scheme like that <Col N="822" /> operated for many years, the disease eradication programme would be speeded up.  If farmers were fully compensated they would not hesitate to liquidate their herds if required to do so.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions have been made with regard to the administration of the scheme.  The introduction of computerisation in the operation of the scheme is essential.  Identity cards should be abolished and replaced by a movement permit for all animals.  A lot of time is wasted writing up cards under the present cumbersome system.  On every occasion that an animal is moved a movement permit should be issued.  There would then be a record of the movement of all animals. We must bear in mind that in Ireland, unlike continental countries, there is a greater movement of cattle.  Cattle can be moved three or four times in their lives here while the movement of cattle on the continent and in the UK is very limited. The introduction of a movement permit would also speed up the disease eradication programme.</P>
    <P>The increasing of the national herd will be a key factor in determining agricultural output in the future.  I agree with the Minister when he said that we must be conscious of the importance of our cattle export trade.  The export business is the most important agricultural enterprise we have.  When one considers the numbers employed in our meat factories one realises the importance of our export trade and of the disease eradication programme.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the remarks of the Minister concerning the Libyan deal. I disagree with his impression of the deal. I agree it is important that we continue to recognise the importance of the Libyan trade to the cattle industry and our economy. The Minister has said that he has done everything possible to ensure that the deal continues but I do not think so. I accept that there is an imbalance in our trade with Libya but I do not think the Libyans are too concerned about that. They do not hold any strong views that we should buy their oil.  The Government should recognise the value of the trade with Libya for our economy.  I understand <Col N="823" /> that the Government did not meet their commitment in regard to arranging a meeting of the Joint Commission.  The Minister should make himself aware of the facts of the case and ensure that the trade with Libya is copperfastened.  He must ensure that the trade continues.  It is within the Minister's power to ensure that the trade with Libya continues.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of the cattle industry to Ireland I urge the Minister not to introduce any changes that will slow down the disease eradication programme.  I have my doubts about the decision to deny farmers the right to nominate their own vet to carry out the tests.  That is a backward step and one the Minister will regret.  Vets are aware of the disease status of herds and the position with regard to the number of cattle on a farm and any land taken on conacre away from the main farm. Nobody has advanced a reason why that right should be taken from farmers.  If the Minister comes forward with a good reason for that decision I will accept it, but his case will have to be very good.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken about the procedures adopted when reactors are identified by veterinary surgeons carrying out the testing.  We all know that under the system obtaining the relevant veterinary surgeon sends his report to the district veterinary office which report is then interpreted by the district veterinary officer.  In order to obviate this delay I reiterate that the farmer should not be allowed to sell reactors to dealers.  I know that the vast majority of farmers send their reactor animals straight for slaughter but there are the odd few who do not do so.  These are loopholes that must be closed.  It is in these areas that problems have been caused over the years.  The process of bringing people to justice, whether they be farmers, veterinary surgeons, dealers or anybody else who do not comply with the regulations obtaining, should be speeded up.  In this respect the course of the law is much too slow and there is so much damage perpetrated in the meantime.  There must be inbuilt safeguards to ensure that there is no selling <Col N="824" /> of reactor animals to dealers, rather that they go straight to the factory for slaughter.  Indeed, the veterinary surgeon identifying such reactors should issue a reactor permit on the spot.</P>
    <P>The experience of recent years has clearly shown that the progress of eradication of bovine tuberculosis has been most unsatisfactory, that the present national incidence of this disease cannot give anybody satisfaction.  The recurrence of the disease within herds and within districts clearly confirms the ability of the infection to persist in the environment, which is where further research is needed.  Modern methods of intensive animal management renders the rapid spread of infection more likely.  In addition the transportation of animals over long distances renders more difficult the task of retracing the paths of such spreading infection.</P>
    <P>The current incidence of bovine tuberculosis poses a serious crisis to the health of our national cattle herd, indeed one might add to human health also, as exemplified by the disruption of trade and the effects of the restrictions occasioned under the eradication scheme.  The disease has serious implications for farm incomes.  The eradication of bovine tuberculosis requires an appreciation of the characteristics of the organism at all levels, which would include its survival in the environment and its mode of infection. I doubt that sufficient research has been carried out in that area.  That is why I reiterate that the Minister should strengthen the research section within his Department.  This would ensure that when we do have an outbreak of the disease from time to time it can be speedily detected with the necessary action being taken as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Because tuberculosis is transferred or transmitted very quickly from animal to animal all off-farm movements of cattle should be conducted on the basis of there being a movement permit granted, that the identity card should be replaced by a movement permit.  I would strongly recommend such movement permits because of the likelihood of transmission <Col N="825" /> of the disease in the movement of cattle. This stipulation with regard to a movement permit or pre-movement test should apply to movements of all cattle, of young calves, of cattle destined for slaughter or for export as well as in regard to farm-to-farm movement.  All cattle should be identified by means of an approved ear tag at the time of sale.  I am now talking about calves, all of whom should be identified by means of an ear tag at their time of sale.  This is now possible with the implementation of the calf premium under which system all calves must be tagged and identified.</P>
    <P>It is important also that records be kept of the transport of cattle together with information relating to their movement being retained and being made available by the registered haulier for regular inspection over a period of, say, one year. This might prove to be inconvenient.  But if we are serious about eradicating the disease such a system could be introduced on a trial basis for, say, one year.  At this stage we should grasp the nettle ensuring that every avenue is explored in the speedy eradication of the disease irrespective of how radical any suggestions may appear.</P>
    <P>There is another area in which the illegal movement of cattle within or without the State should be controlled rigorously. Here I am referring to herds adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of known infected herds, which cattle would be likely to be exposed to infection.  The relevant herd owners should be informed officially of the presence of the disease in their neighbourhood as soon as possible, have their herds checked, tested and encouragement given them to adopt every precaution necessary to maintain the disease free status of their herds. I understand that this is being done at present, but nonetheless I should like to see a more positive approach being adopted in this area.  I am aware that on occasion, in some places, the approach may have been somewhat haphazard.  I should like evidence of greater monitoring of that aspect, that where there is an outbreak of the disease, neighbouring <Col N="826" /> farmers be notified immediately with the necessary fire brigade action being taken.</P>
    <P>I should like to see also a situation obtaining which would bring inspections within the jurisdiction of local authority areas.  Perhaps this is an area which should be carefully examined.  It may require a fundamental reorganisation of present structures and procedures.  There should be adequate provision for the statutory reporting of all cases of the incidence or suspected incidence of the disease in cattle at slaughter.  This procedure should be revised at local authority level because this can constitute an enormous source of infection, with widespread slaughtering of cattle without such cattle being monitored, without reports being drawn up, if they are found to have the disease &mdash; in other words, that there is no control being exercised at this level. I ask the Minister to indicate whether ways and means can be worked out to have greater control at this level.</P>
    <P>The system of financial aid for herd owners, and the payment of routine and hardship compensations should be rationalised.  Consideration must be given to young pedigree stock and compensation should be considered for the loss of the potential progeny of infected animals.  It has been suggested to me that grants for fodder should be given.  It may not be possible to introduce all these benefits but they must be considered if we are fully in earnest about eradicating this dreadful disease.</P>
    <P>It is important to appreciate the crucial role of the cattle industry in regard to our economy and the necessity to increase our exports by about 20 per cent in volume in a short time.  It would mean a vast increase in earnings of about £130 million because of the relatively low levels of agricultural imports compared with manufacturing industry.  Considering that, our export potential could be £400 million.  We have guaranteed markets and we should particularly concentrate on the Libyan trade.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the importance all of us place on the total eradication of this disease speedily.  Now that we are to have increased contributions from farmers I <Col N="827" /> hope their organisations will be given a greater say in the allocations of these moneys and how they will be spent on disease eradication.  Our immediate target should be to reduce the incidence of the disease in the coming 12 months through embarking on a campaign of encouragement and co-operation, not of coercion.  We should particularly emphasise the importance of a disease free cattle herd to the economy.  Such a course should help us substantially to reduce the disease in 12 months.  We must have co-operation between farmers, veterinary officers and departmental officers, administrative and technical.  We must ensure disease free status for our herds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The bovine TB eradication scheme is of the utmost importance to our dairy, meat and cattle trades with serious implications for the agriculture and food industries at a time when health certification is vital to successful marketing. The tool of levy impositions is not the only way surpluses can be controlled. No one will dispute the wisdom of returning to the annual round TB test as announced in the national plan.  Nobody will disagree that &ldquo;the final clearance of bovine TB from the national herd remains one of the most urgent problems facing agriculture&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the enormous cost to the Exchequer, for more than 30 years little progress towards complete eradication has been achieved.  The Minister used the expression that &ldquo;the programme has not met with the success we would have liked&rdquo;.  I would put it much stronger than that.  I would say the programme has been an abysmal failure to date.  Further funds must be committed to the eradication programme.  Hence the increase in the levy for one year, from November 1984 to December 1985, which will yield £7 million.  This figure pales when viewed together with the total cost of the scheme in the next three years &mdash; £31.5 million in 1985, an additional £27 million in 1986 and £27 million again in 1987, a total in the next three years of £85.5 million.  This <Col N="828" /> figure, added to that spent in the last 30 years of £346 million, demands that immediate stock should be taken of the position.</P>
    <P>A question has been asked whether we will get better value for money than heretofore.  A price cannot be put on the importance of a TB free status for our herd, as an agricultural net exporting country.  I must refer to the figures disseminated by the Department of Agriculture in relation to it.  I would urge that the Department's information office would cease to issue figures based on the incidence of the disease.  Their last figures are at best misleading and, at worst, an effort to paint a rosier picture than that which exists.  The figures given for disease incidence only include the results of the round test and do not take into account animals that go down on the pre-movement test, the check test or tests at meat plants.  It is questionable whether the figure for inconclusive re-tests is included in the figures for incidence given by the information office of the Department. Frankly, a false impression of the seriousness of the position has been given by the Department, perhaps inadvertently. Farmers know, vets know, the DVOs and the middlemen know the facts, and these facts make grim statistics.</P>
    <P>These facts would be included if the Department of Agriculture issued figures relating to the prevalence of the disease rather than the incidence.  To the uninitiated there is not a lot of difference between prevalence and incidence, but in practice there is.  The prevalence figure includes all herds which have broken down or are restricted from any check test, round test, factory test or pre-movement test, that is, any and all positive reactors should be included in the figure for the prevalence of the disease.  This is the figure we want to know from the Department.</P>
    <P>I urge the Department of Agriculture to stop treating the agricultural community either as fools or genuises because very few except the latter will detect the subtle difference between incidence and prevalence of disease, but most realise that the figures given by the Department <Col N="829" /> are painting the wrong picture.  It is time we spoke the truth plainly.  Give us the figure for prevalence of tuberculosis in our cattle population, the total number of restricted herds.  I need not add that this figure for prevalence of the dicease bears no relation to the official figure for incidence.</P>
    <P>Only 17 per cent of reactor herds showed up in the round test.  In 1983, 49 per cent of the reactor herds showed up on a special check test, 10 per cent at meat plants, another 8 per cent in the pre-movement test and 16 per cent from inconclusive re-tests.  In other words, of all the reactor herds only 17 per cent were revealed through the round test system. Enough said.  I hope the message is quite clear.</P>
    <P>Approximately one million animals were subject in 1983 to the 30-day pre-movement test.  A similar test is in operation in most European countries.  Of these animals, 1,200 reacted in 770 different herds.  This was apart from the round test.  The 1984 round test figures are highly suspect as they are calculated against 70 per cent only of the herds which were tested.  In selecting the areas to test, the district veterinary officers did not just use random sampling, to give credit where it is due.  They were highly selective samples chosen with a great deal of knowledge of the local situation.  The herds selected for testing were those where problems were suspected or known to exist.  This last round of tests completed in February of this year involved 175,895 of the 195,488 herds in the country.  The official figure for incidence of reactors is 2.24 per cent.  Bearing in mind that this represents according to the disease prevalence figures only 17 per cent of infected herds for the 12 months up to February 1984, one in 500 animals reacted in the round test.</P>
    <P>The tuberculin test used here involves Weybridge avian serum and Rotterdam bovine serum, a British top and a Dutch bottom, as they are referred to in the trade.  The comparative analyses of the reaction was originally worked out using a British top and bottom.  I am unaware of research work done on the efficacy <Col N="830" /> of the present system.  It is perhaps a questionable scientific practice to introduce a differently sourced serum without assessing its implications on the graph, as it were.</P>
    <P>In February last I put down a question to the Minister for Agriculture asking if he was satisfied that the actual test being used in the TB eradication scheme was sufficiently accurate and specific, the research that had been done on the problem and the funds allocated for it in the last 30 years.  I also asked if any other country was using or had used this particular test, the number of reactors subsequently slaughtered that turn out to be free from any symptoms of the disease, the number of clear herds that have spontaneous outbreaks of TB and if he would make a statement on the matter.  The first part of his reply stated that the tuberculin test was the most reliable test available and that it had been the basis of bovine TB eradication programmes throughout the world.  I take issue with this reply because I would prefer him to have stated that a tuberculin test is the most reliable test available at present.  We are not using a test that is used in any other country inasmuch as our serum is not sourced in the same way as the serum used in other countries.  I question the scientific efficacy of the practice of using a British top and a Rotterdam bottom.  A tuberculin test is perhaps the most reliable test available, but nevertheless it is not very reliable.  Surely we cannot claim that our test is identical to any other when we are the only country in the world using it. The principle may be the same as any tuberculin test but our source of serum is quite different.</P>
    <P>Reactors killed at factory level show a 25 per cent incidence of lesions.  Hidden in the overall reactor figures is a high proportion of the &ldquo;false positives&rdquo;, that is, cattle that have gone down in the test but when examined histologically at <i>post mortem</i> have shown no sign of the disease. This is a very worrying and difficult aspect of any eradication scheme.  All reactors must be examined histologically and a report sent back to the vet and the <Col N="831" /> farmer concerned.  We need their ongoing operation and understanding if we are to come to terms with the situation.  If the farmer is kept fully informed and up-to-date on all his animals that go down he will appreciate the reasons, financial and otherwise, for his appalling dilemma. Eradication of TB must be based on the histological examination of all lesions rather than the interpretation of an inaccurate test based on the measuring of lumps on cattle.  This cannot be overstressed.</P>
    <P>Double strength serum is used for testing reactor herds and questions can be asked about this.  A recent incident illustrates what I mean.  Eleven cattle went down in a locked-up herd.  On subsequent post mortem examination the lesions showed that there were 11 cases of timber tongue and not one case of tuberculosis among them.  The double strength serum was offered as part of the explanation.</P>
    <P>Given tuberculin of 80 per cent sensitivity, I could perhaps accept that the test sensitivity as to the status of herds could be as high as 98 or 99 per cent.  However, when it comes to isolating the individual reactor animal the sensitivity drops dramatically, despite the claims to the contrary by officialdom.  It is a good test from the overall herd status point of view but it is not very specific in picking up all the individual reactors.  Over the years the test has consistently failed to pick up the TB animals.</P>
    <P>It is considered in many quarters that the epidemiology of the disease could be even more important than the TB test. It has never been established how TB spreads from animal to animal or from herd to herd.  Many theories abound concerning deer, badgers and watercourses. At last the Department have agreed to issue a licence to test badgers in County Longford.  We have been asking for this for years in Wexford but without success. There has been great reluctance on the part of the Department in this regard.  I accept that there is no such thing as a spontaneous outbreak of TB but there are sudden outbreaks and breakdowns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> The sudden breakdowns in herds which have been clear for years cause heartbreak on our well-run, well-managed farms.</P>
    <P>The badger poses an interesting question. There was a sudden outbreak recently in a herd which had been clear for years.  The farm was bordered by a river and a wood which were covered by badger sets.  The farmer in desperation took a bulldozer to the sets and cleared them away.  He was clear in the next test, yet the proper licence for TB testing those badgers was not forthcoming from the Department.  I am glad to see they appear to have had a change of heart in this regard.  The evidence may be circumstantial but it is surely strong enough to investigate it at any rate.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the Minister for Agriculture took the conjoint report of the IVO, IVA and IVU into account when arriving at the proposals in the National Economic and Social Plan as outlined at page 139.  We must remind ourselves that the farmer will no longer be allowed to nominate the veterinary surgeon to do his testing, that the same veterinary surgeons, farmers and middlemen co-operated in the virtual eradication of brucellosis.  The goodwill is there The network is there and it has proved that it can and will work in disease eradication.</P>
    <P>I am not privy to the logic behind the removing of the right of farmers to nominate their own veterinary surgeon to do the testing.  It could be to weed out the small percentage of rogue vets &mdash; you get these in every section of society and I stress that they are a very small proportion &mdash; or it could be to give young veterinary surgeons a chance, or it could be to ensure that they get paid the full value for their testing work.  While the disease eradication scheme owes no veterinary surgeon a living &mdash; it is far too serious a problem to look at it in those terms &mdash; I question the wisdom of the Government's policy of interfering with the practice structures in a free enterprise society.  I urge the Minister to handle this problem diplomatically and with the agreement of the veterinary profession <Col N="833" /> and the farming organisations to come to a satisfactory arrangement for next year's complete round of tuberculosis testing.</P>
    <P>I was delighted by the reference in the Minister's speech to his research project. This is an area we have shamefully neglected.  Last February I asked about research in a parliamentary question.  The reply I was given said that no such research had been undertaken here but that all batches of tuberculin were laboratory tested to ensure that potency was maintained at the highest levels.  We have spent the bulk of £350 million in 30 years on an issue as serious as this, and yet we can stand up and say that no research has been done on the problem in this country. In a country where our scientific and medical endeavours have been hailed throughout the world for generations, we have done no research on the problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome wholeheartedly the Minister's reference to establishing an advisory group on research and an investigation into the various aspects of tuberculosis.  He said that experts from UCD, An Foras Talúntais, the practitioners and his own animal research staff would be involved.  He said that the general aim of the group will be to pinpoint areas of research which they consider require further pursuit.  I would like to expand on the possible areas of research because this is an area to which I have given some thought over the past months. We should study the problems associated with bovine tuberculosis eradication in general and try to establish the reasons why eradication in this country has been so slow and so unsuccessful over the years.  We should try to establish the common root of the spread of infection in individual animals and herds.  We must find out if possible the reasons why herds which have been cleared following several tests become re-infected so quickly, and why bad herds and bad areas seem to remain indefinitely in that category. We must try to clarify the real status of the passed animal in infected herds by detailed <i>ante-mortem</i> and <i>post mortem</i> examination.  It would be important to try to establish if re-infection occurring from animals missed by the test results <Col N="834" /> from the farm environment, from animal or human contact or from outside areas of new infection.  This appears to be the nub of the problem&mdash;epidemiology.</P>
    <P>A very detailed study of a limited number of difficult herds should be undertaken, especially in isolated closed herds.  We must try to establish the role played by wildlife, pets and other carriers in the spread of the disease.  An important part of any project such as that mooted by the Minister would be the follow-up at the abattoir of all reactors and all passed cattle for the limited number of difficult herds under examination.  This would involve the slowing up of the kill rate of these animals in the abattoirs and a follow-up with microscopic and cultural examination of the lesions.  It comes back to what I said earlier: we must have a histological examination of all reactors and that must be the basis of the eradication of tuberculosis, not just an objective assessment of lumps on cattle.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that the research is independent and directed by the veterinary faculty of the veterinary college.  It is most important that the research be independent.  We do not need more of the same.  We have very wise men in our Departments and semi-State organisations up and down the country who have grown up trying to solve the problem of tuberculosis, but, in my view, at this stage we need new initiative and a fresh approach to the problem.  We have dozens of young veterinary surgeons coming out of our veterinary college every year looking for jobs.  I urge the Minister to consider incorporating a scholarship scheme for two or three young veterinary surgeons each year with the research project.  These young people with initiative and new ideas are hungry to get to grips with problems such as these.  As I said, the research project and the scholarship system could go hand in hand and could prove very valuable to solving this appalling problem.</P>
    <P>If we can insist on getting value for money in the next three years, which has not happened over the last three years.  I would have no hesitation in supporting <Col N="835" /> this motion but when we remind ourselves that by 1987 we will have spent £431.8 million since 1955 on this problem, I sincerely hope we are not just offering the agricultural and industrial community more of the same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to examine this area which has caused grave concern to farmers.  This is a very expensive scheme.  The Minister told us that to date it has cost £750 million, excluding cost of administration. This scheme has been operating in a very haphazard way in many areas.  Irrespective of what the Minister said, we still have not clearly identified the cause of tuberculosis.  This problem has taxed the brains of many people.  In my view, the Department should introduce pilot schemes throughout the country.  I maintain that in areas where there were breakdowns, the Department should have done their best to identify the root cause of this disease.  It has caused more damage to the development of agriculture than anything else.</P>
      <P>As far as the super-levy is concerned, we would have been in a much more favourable position were it not for the loss incurred by brucellosis.  There is also the question of the psychological effect on the farmer whose herd is suffering from brucellosis or bovine TB.  While progress has been made in eradicating brucellosis, it is very worrying to read about the fairly high incidence of bovine TB.  A farmer who has very carefully built up his herd in the hope that it will be a very valuable asset for the future can suffer grave hardship if his herd is affected by disease.  Some of the most careful farmers have been hit, irrespective of the care they have taken in not allowing their stock to mix with other herds, in not buying in stock and in having good fencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milk suppliers and meat producers have had to pay ever-increasing levies.  In August 1983 for each animal slaughtered in the factory the total deduction was £2.90, in September this year the deduction was £5.85 and from 1 November the <Col N="836" /> amount will be £7.75.  The deductions have almost trebled in 15 months.  There has been much talk about the cost to the Exchequer but the farmer has also paid to a considerable extent.  A farmer with a herd of 30 cows will have to pay more than £1,000 and that is a substantial amount.  People would not begrudge paying the levy if they thought progress was being made in the eradication of disease.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers asked the question how the disease might be eradicated.  I have heard veterinary surgeons from the Department mention the advisability of ploughing land and reseeding it in the hope that the germ responsible for the disease might die.  It has also been suggested that badgers might be responsible. There is no doubt that they have increased considerably in numbers in the past few years.  People who drive at night are well aware of the damage badgers can cause to cars.  There is also the possibility that infected water courses might be responsible for transmitting the disease. For this reason, many farmers have availed of group water schemes because they realise the dangers when animals stand in water courses.</P>
    <P>We can no longer depend on the EEC. It is a pity that their contribution has been discontinued.  There has not been adequate co-operation between farmers and the veterinary profession in the job of tackling bovine diseases.  In many instances people were inclined to keep animals whose test showed they were inconclusive rather than disposing of them quickly.  In north-west Monaghan we were practically disease-free for years but in the past seven or eight years there has been a recurrence of brucellosis and bovine TB.  Many herds were cleared out and this caused not only a financial loss but also a disruption of farming practices. It is a case of desperate cases needing desperate remedies.  I doubt if the matter will be remedied by the proposals in the national plan.  We have been very wishy-washy in our approach to eradicating bovine TB.  We have shown leniency towards many people to the detriment of other good farmers and the industry.  It <Col N="837" /> will take much courage to tackle the problem but we must do something because the future of our livestock industry and our exports are at stake.</P>
    <P>Our spokesman on agriculture referred to the disposal of reactors.  These animals should be disposed of immediately. Dealers should not be allowed to purchase them because there cannot be the necessary supervision in such cases.  For years there was a considerable amount of tag-switching but that has been reduced considerably by the use of tamper-proof tags.  The disposal of reactors must be given very serious consideration.  They should be monitored from the time they leave the farm until they reach the slaughter house.</P>
    <P>Figures have been bandied about regarding the cost of administering the scheme.  However, one must relate it to the amount of money given to people who had to get their stock replaced.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Adding to this the fact that cattle and milk prices today are much better than they were in 1979 it is readily apparent that the impact of the levies now is far less than it was then.</P>
    <P>Many people would question that.  The Minister also mentioned:</P>
    <P>... payment of testing fees to a veterinary surgeon who carries out the scheme test thus making the veterinary surgeon personally responsible for the proper execution of the test; earlier removal of reactor animals, tighter official supervision of all trading at marts; strict enforcement of all procedures and prosecutions in all cases for breaches of disease regulations....</P>
    <P>Those are the very sentiments we have listened to time and again and we still have a very high incidence of TB.  I hope the Minister will use his muscle to ensure that the regulations will be strictly enforced and that we will overcome this terrible disease which has cost so much and done so much damage to agricultural development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time we got the act together.  Probably every Minister who is appointed in any Cabinet would like to do something in his Department.  I have no doubt the Minister for Agriculture and the two Ministers of State want to do something about this appalling and most serious problem.  If they do nothing else other than make the farmers aware of the benefits to themselves of cutting down by whatever method possible on the incidence of disease, they will have done a good job.</P>
      <P>The basic requirement to get rid of the disease exists, but we have not got the act together yet.  A requirement for a productive livestock industry is tight control over all diseases.  This is particularly true in Ireland, and it is specifically true in the case of the lifestock industry which contributes so much to the national economy. The 1966 Act consolidated the various disease Acts, and under that Act the various levies and related matters are imposed by law.  The reasons why it is necessary to have disease control in the first instance are very clear and have been expounded by other speakers.  First there is the danger of transmission of the disease to humans.  Secondly, there is the loss of health and productivity in the country's cattle stocks.  Thirdly in the case of the TB eradication scheme to maintain exports of live cattle to the United Kingdom. This has since altered radically.</P>
      <P>In the early fifties when the scheme began, the tests were free and full market value was given to the farmers in respect of animals which went down as reactors. Other incentives were given such as the water supply grant and the double byre grant in order to have proper facilities on farms so that practitioners could carry out their testing in a reasonable degree of comfort and also because there was a need to tighten up on the incidence of the disease.  The present position warrants very serious discussion.  I hope the Minister's statement here today is not simply a bland expression of what has gone on since 1954, but is the start of a determined drive to achieve effective results in this very serious area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> There are two root causes for the incidence of TB and the present position of the scheme.  The first is the relationship between the Department of Agriculture and the profession of veterinary medicine. When the scheme was launched in 1954 there were no fixed fees and increases were negotiated at irregular intervals.  While on the one hand, it was a source of income to practitioners, and in many cases businesses flourished and expanded, on the other hand it led to serious discussions and lack of confidence on the part of some practitioners about the scale and irregularity of the increase in fees.  This came to a head in 1974.  It is not for me to apportion blame to anybody, but the whole episode had a serious effect on the scheme.</P>
    <P>The second cause is the actual operation of the scheme which was a relatively late starter in comparison with Great Britain.  One of the reasons for the scheme in the first place was to maintain exports of live cattle to Great Britain. Therefore, it was tackled with a sense of great urgency.  When any scheme has to deal with hundreds of veterinary practitioners, thousands of farmers and millions of cattle there will always be cases where inadequate details or irregularities may tend to offset the full extent and effectiveness of the scheme.</P>
    <P>At column 1192 of the Official Report of 17 June 1976 the Minister said a few practitioners had thrown their professional and ethical standards out of the window and some farmers whose interest in disease eradication was less than their desire to make money quickly had devised ways and means of defeating the purpose of the testing.  He went on to say he was concerned about those farmers.  As I said, I am not here to apportion blame but the whole episode had serious repercussions for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The incidence of disease has risen. There has not been much change in the past 16 years.  In reply to a Dáil question on 15 November the then Minister for Agriculture indicated that out of the 26 counties 20 had an increase in the incidence of bovine TB from 1980 to 1982. <Col N="840" /> He gave details about each county.  Other speakers have already pointed out what should be done in their estimation to rectify the problem.</P>
    <P>The scheme itself could not have worked to date without the help of the private practitioners.  This was of benefit to themselves in terms of the fees paid to them.  In 1982, while compensation to farmers for reactor cattle was £3.684 million, fees to veterinary surgeons totalled £7.557 million.  The scheme also assisted them in setting up in business.  Being younger and probably stronger in many cases, they were able to get out on the farms and become acquainted with the farmers.  They got to know the land and they got used to handling cattle.  Had one proposal been implemented it could have led to a decrease in travelling expenses paid by the Department.  Some private calls could have been fitted in between bovine TB testing and blood testing.</P>
    <P>One of the best barometers by which to judge the efficiency of the scheme is to examine the number of lesions found in post mortem examinations of cattle officially passed as being reactor free.  A report from the EC in 1982 indicated that an average of 1,000,000 bovine would be slaughtered every year in export registered premises.  In 1980 the cattle population of Ireland was 6.934 million animals contained in 211,686 herds.  The number of positive reactors to TB in 1980 was 1,841 with a lesion incidence of .18 per cent.  If 1,841 lesions were to be found in 1,000,000 cattle, with a total population of 6.934 million cattle, it is easy to calculate that you would find 12,700 in the total population.</P>
    <P>Of all the animals tested in that year only 6,980 lesions were found in reactor cattle, giving an indication that at least 5,700 infected animals were not discovered during the tests.  That calculation can be made for the years prior to 1980, and probably since then with little or very minor deviations.  There has not been any great improvement or acceleration in the Irish bovine TB eradication programme. In the early seventies about 50 temporary veterinary inspectors were employed by the Department to carry out tuberculin <Col N="841" /> testing on a random sample of herds normally listed to the veterinary practitioners for testing.  At the time, they tested about 18 per cent of the national herd over a number of years and it was found that they discovered approximately three times as many reactors and reactor herds with lesions as did the practitioners.  The vast majority of practitioners do a first class job but, as in all professions, there are a minority who do not measure up. The Minister has more or less covered that point.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, and the Minister in particular, should define the fundamental principle of where we stand on TB eradication.  Do we seriously mean totally to eradicate this disease, or are we going to continue as we have been doing, rather than aiming for the European standard, hoping by annual testing and effective controls to keep our incidence below the European level?  This may resemble the myth of full employment, but I would like definite answers as to whether we can make a genuine effort totally to eradicate this disease which is the scourge of our land and has had devastating consequences for many farmers whose herds have been wiped out.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has referred to a special section for epidemiology in his Department.  It is high time that this was brought about.  There is need for a special task force to define and determine the how, why, when and where of this disease.  The structure is there to work with the farmer, the DVO, the middleman and the practitioner.  Brucellosis has been wiped out and it should be possible to do this in the case of bovine TB.  There is need of swift action when reactors are discovered.  There is also need to show the farmer benefit of a good disease-free herd.</P>
    <P>Much talk has been made of our animals. Probably the Protection of Badgers Society will be up in arms about this, but in other countries experiments have been carried out on badgers although not with any great degree of success.  In Cornwall and Devon many thousands of badgers were gassed and killed and the incidence <Col N="842" /> of TB was not directly attributable to them.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the facilities available on farms.  An economic report issued on 27 October 1978 by the National Prices Commission on the veterinary practice in Ireland stated that the work of the vet on many farms in rural Ireland can be extremely demanding physically and that it often occurs in filthy conditions and can involve some physical danger.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is fair to say about most dairy farms that the animals are used to being handled more frequently than on non-dairy farms.  By and large the standards for cattle crushes, concrete yards, availability of water hoses and so on are to a high standard.  That is very important. The Department should set about determining the incidence of facilities not being up to standard.  They should continue to encourage those farmers who have not been in a position to provide the proper facilities, or who have not bothered to do so, to rectify the position. Fencing, cattle crushes, yards and so forth need to be looked after.</P>
    <P>We have all heard stories of the vet using the same needles twice and using different concoctions of serum, the vast majority of which stories have been unproved.  The responsibility lies on everybody &mdash; the Minister, his Department, the practitioners, the truckers in the middle and, most of all, on the farmer himself.  He is handling the livestock and he is the person to whom the income will come.  He should have most responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>If John B. Keane or Brian McMahon were to visit some farms which have not adequate holding facilities on the morning of a round test they would certainly find the equivalent of a western rodeo.  One would want a young, physically fit vet who would spend perhaps three-quarters of an hour rounding up the cattle.  It really is a case of blood, sweat and tears, with a certain amount of physical danger involved. Of late, with the abuse in many cases of the hormone implantation in cattle, there are bullocks who neither think nor <Col N="843" /> act like bullocks and a vet or his assistants can have trouble.</P>
    <P>The facilities available to vets and practitioners should be on a par with the best possible standards and I call on the Department and the Minister to continue to encourage this, either by grants or incentives.  The tuberculin serum itself should be researched more adequately. Deputy Doyle has given a very adequate scientific explanation and scientific reports on the type of serum used.  As she says, we are now using the Weybridge and Rotterdam serum, but I wonder how effective this really is.  Are the Department satisfied with an 85 per cent or 80 per cent effective rate?  Is there an Irish tuberculin strain?  I trust that the special task force on epidemiology will try to determine this.  Should we be using a serum developed for Irish cattle in respect of a potential Irish tuberculin strain? This should be looked at over the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the spread of the disease was intermittent testing due to rows and problems of one sort or another. A new test would be announced with an appropriate scale of fees and the administration section dealing with it might take some time to get the show on the road, as it were.  The resultant intermittent testing has not been a good thing.  There should be two rounds of nine monthly tests.  The Minister should lay down the rule of law very stringently in this regard.  Any vet not measuring up in terms of submitting his reports of work should not be employed again by the Department.  That would be a very small minority of practitioners, but this is much too serious a matter to allow that to continue to happen as in the past.  Very stern and strict action should be enforced in this area.  Two rounds of tests with specific reports issued by each practitioner, one test following closely on the other, would cut out the ineffectiveness caused by intermittent testing.</P>
    <P>With the brucellosis disease practically eradicated in many of the north-western and western counties, it might be feasible to have a lesser scale of testing for brucellosis <Col N="844" /> and transfer some of the available finance to the tuberculin area.  The double strength serum is available for problem herds and I wonder why this has not been used on a general scale.  I would like to hear some reference to the costing of this.  Would it be more effective in determining the incidence of TB on a large scale?  Should it be used on an annual, or on a double annual test once and for all?  I should like a reply to that.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister go into the question of the right of the farmer to choose his own vet?  I know that the National Prices Commission Report of 1978 recommended, in its concluding remarks, that the Minister should have the right to make the appointment.  I want to raise the case where a vet might have set up a firm over a long number of years and might employ three, four, five or six assistants. If the testing is to be done by the veterinary surgeon himself and he only is to be paid, the firm set up by the veterinary surgeon stands to lose substantially. Is there some clause in this providing that if an assistant in a firm of veterinary surgeons carries out the testing the money is paid to the firm, or is it paid to the assistant himself directly?</P>
    <P>The facilities on farms have been referred to.  I would like some word on the people who transfer the cattle from the farms to the abattoirs to be slaughtered and to the factories.  There is need for examination of the trucks used and for spraying areas in all factories and abattoirs.  No truck carrying TB reactor cattle should be allowed on the public road without being sprayed with the appropriate disinfectant, but that is not the case.  Movements of cattle all over the country are in trucks with slurry falling out over the public road which could be a potential carrier of the disease.  In many countries for much less, cars and vehicles of all descriptions are sprayed and must pass through disinfectant ponds etc, before being let out on the public road.  I understand that this week one of the major meat plants in the country is not taking reactor cattle and has not done so for the past week.  What happens to people in the west whose herds go down, <Col N="845" /> who have nowhere to send their cattle, who cannot send them the further distances involved?  Something needs to be done there.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to raise the question of disposal of reactor animals which has been referred to.  There is need for further examination by the Department of Agriculture in relation to the quality of the meat being consumed; secondly, by the Department of Health regarding the meat going on display; thirdly, by the Department of the Environment in relation to hygienic quality and facilities available in abattoirs and plants.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on setting out to tackle this problem.  The farmers realise the importance of the livestock industry to the economy.  I think the scale of fees proposed will be acceptable in the light that an effective result will come from determined action by the Minister and his various task forces.  As I have said, it is past time that the act was got together and I hope that in the lifetime of this Government effective strides will be taken to eliminate once and for all what has been a scourge of Irish farmers and the cancer of the livestock industry over the last 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not given us more information on a regional basis or on a county basis about the incidence of disease, particularly TB.  We are all quite appalled at the amount of money &mdash; the Minister stated £750 million in present day values &mdash; that has been spent on disease eradication.  During the year when I asked the Minister a question concerning the cost of vaccine and tuberculin he replied that the cost of that alone was £3.5 million.  Consideration of the amount of money that has been spent gives us an opportunity to discuss the value we have got for the money and the success or otherwise of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies representing rural areas are constantly hearing from farmers that they are being asked to pay levies again.  They put the case to us that these levies are not in any way related to their income <Col N="846" /> or ability to pay.  We had disease levies between 1979 and 1981 whereby farmers paid a total of £13.47 million.  Now we have these further levies which, no doubt, will be redrafted or ordered again so that farmers will be continually paying levies. Naturally, the farming community are concerned about levies which do not relate to their income.  This is not the only area where they are asked to do this. We have proposals now for a land tax.  I hope that the Minister when replying will give us some more information than he has given concerning the incidence of disease in various regions of the country.</P>
    <P>Perhaps too he can give us more information on the research programme. Every Deputy who has spoken this evening has mentioned that, with all the money that has been spent on the disease eradication programme, we still have no definite information on the causes of disease. Last year I received a reply from the Minister that 75 people were employed at the central veterinary research laboratory in Abbotstown, but he went on to say that for about a quarter of their time they were engaged on research and the remainder was devoted to diagnostic and investigative work.  So, even though a large number of people work in direct research there, they are engaged in that work for only a quarter of the year and for the other three-quarters of the year they are engaged in other types of work.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister mentioned in his opening remarks that the question of the early removal of reactor animals will be investigated by the Department. Deputies here have given examples this evening of delays in having animals removed. I cannot understand why the Department, in co-ordination with the district veterinary offices, cannot arrange for identification and removal much earlier.  We are all aware of the problems of lorries bringing reactors to factories and within a very short period the same lorries bringing animals to marts.  I remember that in 1976 the Department dealt with this whole question themselves. When you have direct Department supervision for the disposal of reactor cattle you will have a 100 per <Col N="847" /> cent foolproof system.  Again I ask the Minister to consider this system, which was very satisfactory, under which the Department were directly involved.  I would like the Minister now to tell us what action he is taking to monitor this situation.</P>
    <P>Farmers have contributed under bovine disease levies acts in the past and will continue to contribute if these proposals are implemented.  What is the situation now for farmers whose herds are hit with the disease and completely wiped out by it?  The Department have a hardship fund.  Will such farmers get something realistic out of the fund for restocking and replacing?</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny mentioned the meat trade and in the past he has highlighted some of the problems there.  Obviously, the first people we must think of here are the farmers who lose through disease, and when they get little or nothing for their cattle the Minister's priority must be to help them out through the grants system.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to give us more information on why he is going to have direct examination by veterinary surgeons for TB and brucellosis testing. Will the veterinary surgeon who lives nearest the farmer in question be nominated, or is the Minister talking about allowing young veterinary surgeons who may have difficulty in getting employment to be brought in and nominated directly and given assistance in getting work?  I do not see the need for that in a free enterprise system.  I do not see why the Department should in future nominate the veterinary surgeon to carry out these tests.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not widen the scope of the debate and I hope that in the course of his reply he will outline to the House the extent of the disease throughout the country.  When we are discussing agricultural matters in the House in future I hope we will not be considering imposing more levies.  Irrespective of the size of the levy they do not relate to the farmer's income or his ability to pay and the Minister <Col N="848" /> should be concerned about that at a time when farmers are going through a difficult period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I welcome the change in attitude by the Minister in an effort to ensure that by the end of 1985 we will have a full round of testing.  That decision will ensure that disease is eliminated in all counties.  In my constituency in the last 12 months 140 herds have been restricted and in the Kells-Oldcastle area alone 80 herds are restricted.  Another area that is badly affected is adjacent to Enfield.  Most of the farmers in those areas are involved in the cattle business and, consequently, attend marts frequently and that may be one reason why disease is widespread in those areas.  I have suggested on many occasions that when diseased animals are being conveyed to factories a special truck be used for that purpose only.  Reactor animals are being transported to factories on trucks that frequent marts and sales yards.  We should be doing something positive to ensure that reactors are conveyed to the factories on a specially designed vehicle.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand how in herds that have been disease free for many years four or five reactors crop up in a herd of 24 or 25 animals.  That puzzles many farmers and vets.  I hope that the medicine used in the testing next year will be the same throughout the country. I do not think there would be any objection to such a system.  Some farmers are annoyed with their own vets as far as testing is concerned.  It is pleasing to note that we have been successful in securing sale for our cattle abroad.  It is because of the importance of the export market to our economy that we must make every effort to rid our herds of disease.  A lot of money has been spent on the disease eradication programme in recent years but we still have many diseased herds.  I am aware that one area of Longford is pretty bad at present.  We must get to grips with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most counties are brucellosis free and I do not see how the disease is being <Col N="849" /> transmitted to disease free herds.  There has been a lot of co-operation in regard to notifying neighbouring farmers of TB outbreaks but that has not happened in some instances.  The veterinary office should get in touch with neighbouring farmers when an outbreak is confirmed to ensure that the disease does not spread.  It is important that all reactors are removed immediately.  It is wrong that reactors are left with herds for 30 days because in that period the disease may spread.</P>
    <P>The hardship fund should be increased greatly to help farmers obliged to destroy their herds.  Farmers with dry stock or a dairy herd in a short space of time have had their income wiped out if the disease spreads to their herds.  They should be given relief until they are permitted to restock.  I should like to know why reactors are left on farms although farmers may have requested that they be removed immediately without waiting for a further test in 60 days.  Diseased animals must be got rid of immediately to prevent it spreading to the rest of the herd.</P>
    <P>There are many loopholes that must be closed as these increases are being sought from farmers to ensure that this round of testing takes place.  I am sure there are not many farmers who would disagree with the proposals because the mere incidence of the disease in anybody's herd is devastating.  There was one case in my constituency in which a neighbouring farmer had replacements of 260 reactor cattle over a period of 18 months.  We want to ensure that reactors are taken away in good time, that their owners receive adequate compensation, thereby ensuring eradication of the dreaded disease which may have ruined a farmer's livelihood over a number of years.  Any farmer who loses that number of cattle will be unable to get back into large numbers of stock again within a short period. It is interesting to note the figures since 1980, which have run in the region of 26,000 to approximately 29,000 reactors. I am sure the figure for this year will be somewhat similar with the outbreaks of which we are so far aware.</P>
    <P>If there is a large outbreak of disease in any given area it is important that work <Col N="850" /> be concentrated there in order to ensure its elimination.  In recent years there has not been an intensive follow-up where there has been an incidence of the disease in a number of herds.  In normal times there may have been one yard or shed only in which perhaps five, six or seven farmers' cattle were admitted for testing purposes, thus constituting a problem.  I know the Department have been asking farmers to erect their own yards or sheds ensuring that testing can be carried out on their own premises.  I am sure this policy would be advocated by departmental officials, that all farmers have such sheds erected to ensure that their animals can be tested on their premises.  When this round of testing has been completed I would ask the Minister for an assurance that, if there remain problem areas, these will be eliminated and thoroughly investigated on the basis of the intended intensive testing to be carried out in 1985.</P>
    <P>Many people have complained about the amount of money spent already on the eradication of this disease, contending that we have not received value for the money expended.  Here it should be remembered that tuberculosis was one of the most dreaded diseases among humans.  The medical profession were able to eliminate this disease over a period of intensive research and the administration of the right medication.  It is ironic to think that £750 million having already been spent on the elimination of this disease in herds we have failed abysmally.  This begs the question: why there has not been implemented a more intense policy on the part of all Ministers, all Governments over the past five to ten years to ensure its absolute elimination.</P>
    <P>When the problem of brucellosis first arose farmers themselves were the first to want to eliminate that disease as quickly as possible because of its effects on herds and on humans, effects it still has on those unfortunate enough to be affected by it.  There was a lot more money expended on countrywide testing in an attempt to eradicate the incidence of tuberculosis in herds, for which there are many people to be blamed, in some cases the farmers themselves.  At the <Col N="851" /> beginning of my contribution I mentioned some small farmers who visit marts on many occasions, people who did their own thing, without taking into consideration the rules or regulations obtaining until we find ourselves in a serious situation in many such farmers' areas.</P>
    <P>We have a long way to go in this respect. Without the co-operation of everybody involved &mdash; the farmers, the veterinary surgeons, the Department and others &mdash; we shall find ourselves in the same situation ten years hence particularly when one views what has happened over the past ten years throughout the length and breadth of the country.  Some people have a vested interest in ensuring that the disease is not eliminated totally. That being so, it is up to the Minister and his Department to ensure its total abolition within the period of this round of testing and, additionally, that farmers affected be adequately compensated.</P>
    <P>I know there is much sympathy felt for farmers whose herds happen to come in contact with those of neighbours who have been affected by the disease.  If the expenditure of this additional amount of money ensures the elimination of the disease no farmer will object, at least any to whom I have spoken.  Let us be honest with ourselves.  It will be of enormous benefit to our exports when we can say to people with whom we are negotiating contracts to supply beef in future years, whether on the hoof or otherwise, that we have a disease-free herd here.  Because of the worth of these animals to our economy and exports generally it is in our interests to ensure that we eliminate all such problem areas.  I know that the Department are in earnest in their desire to do so on this occasion, which we fully support.  I shall be anxiously awaiting the results of the round testing system in 1985.</P>

      <P>I am thankful to the Deputies who contributed <Col N="852" /> to this debate, which was highly constructive and in which many interesting ideas were put forward.  I do not think any of us is much apart in our analysis of the situation obtaining.  We all realise that the scheme has not worked effectively in 30 years and it is realised that we must do something different.  Deputy Noonan spoke about treading on people's corns.  I would not tread on their corns, I would tread on their toes if necessary. Treading on their corns can be a very painful experience but if it has to be done it will be done.</P>
      <P>The cause of the outbreaks has been raised by nearly every Deputy.  Basically it is an Irish problem because of the number of times cattle are moved in Ireland in their lifetime.  Statistics indicate that they are moved five or six times in their lifetime whereas on the Continent cattle may be moved once, or perhaps not at all.  Initially that presents a serious problem here but it is hard to change it because of our system of farming.</P>
      <P>Recent surveys and investigations indicate that lateral spread is the main cause of the high incidence of bovine TB here &mdash; cattle coming in contact with one another, within the same herd or neighbouring herds, mainly by touching noses or breathing in close proximity of each other across fences.  Therefore, proper fencing is very important.  As well, using common sources of water such as streams can help to spread the disease.  The spreading of slurry can often cause it because recently there was an investigation which showed that the tubercle can survive for two years in land if contaminated slurry is spread on it.  Unclean lorries is another area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies and others have suggested the spread by wildlife.  From our investigations we have concluded that that assumption is overstated.  Wildlife are believed not to be a very serious cause for the spread of the disease.  Badgers have been blamed and so have deer. Seagulls, starlings and other feathered wildlife have been referred to.  It is possible they are a contributory factor but not a major one because we know that <Col N="853" /> lateral spread is the greatest cause.  Of course, there is the human element, like fraudulent behaviour by one or a number of people.  That is human nature and I am afraid that illegal practices are pretty widespread.  Precautions are being taken to stop them.</P>
    <P>A problem that has to be faced up to is that the test is not 100 per cent effective. Latest scientific investigations indicate that the test is only 70 per cent to 80 per cent effective.  In those circumstances we are faced with a serious problem.  Deputy Noonan asked why do we not have a blood test.  If we had a blood test as we had in the case of brucellosis our problem would be largely eliminated.  We do not have a blood test in spite of the best efforts of scientists throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The inadequacy of the present tuberculin test is a major drawback.  We have nothing better.  It is used by virtually every country in the world.  I was asked if those other countries have a bovine TB problem.  The common point of view is that they do not, they all got rid of it. That is not strictly true.  The outlying areas of Britain, the west coast of Scotland, the Lake District and Wales and Brittany in France have bovine TB problems but not as serious as ours.  It flares up there from time to time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked me about the breaking of the link between the vets and the farmers.  That is one of the more drastic proposals outlined in my opening statement.  I am doing it for a number of reasons.  Obviously the present system is not working.  The new system will give us in the Department central control for co-ordination of the scheme.  We can direct it.  We can carry out operations on a planned basis.  There can be block testing. The vet is in charge of a parish or half a parish and he can cover every single farmer in that region.  That is an effective way.  At the moment you could have six vets testing in one parish and if there were discrepancies in the standards of the testing &mdash; there are discrepancies &mdash; you will not get rid of the disease.</P>
    <P>The block testing will be effective. Deputy Noonan asked many times about that.  We want better co-ordination, <Col N="854" /> better control.  We want to do it in an organised manner.  I want to see every vet in the country, old, middle aged or young, getting a fair crack of the whip. We are providing £10.5 million extra and I want to see that money spread around. I want to see the best people possible in there testing.  I do not want to see any discrimination in that regard.  That is the right way to tackle it.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell Deputy Noonan that I have the full backing of the farming organisations in this battle, the ICMSA, the IFA and the ICOS.  They are all fully behind the breaking of the link and I defy anybody to contradict me on it.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that the farmer is the person who suffers most at the end of the day from the continuation of this disease and this scheme.  He is the person who takes the real knock.  Thousands of farmers have been virtually ruined financially. I am bringing in something more than the £31.5 million for testing.  I will introduce a scheme which will be worth £2 million annually to help people who have had to de-stock because of a high incidence of disease.  That may not come in 1985, though I hope it will, and it will be extremely helpful.</P>
    <P>Logistically I am told that it is possible for the vets to do only one round per year.  Normally they would do it in nine months but more often it takes 12 months.  It is not practical to do two rounds a year.  Farming organisations suggested that the Department might pay for one round and they would pay for the other.  I do not think that would help because as we all know some might not pay.</P>
    <P>The tubercle which causes the disease is very worrying and it has increased in virulence in the last couple of years.  It is very worrying to the veterinary profession and the Department.  A number of Deputies have based their arguments on the importance of research and epidemiology. I fully agree with that.  We are setting up such a unit within the Department and I am also establishing an advisory council drawn from the veterinary people in the universities, An Foras <Col N="855" /> Talúntais and from amongst the practitioners. Research is the basis of our whole drive against TB.  We feel it will prove <Col N="856" /> to be the most fruitful way of tackling the problem.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to Seanad amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In the third line to delete all words after &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;have been enacted by the Oireachtas for the investigation and adjudication of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána by or under the direction of an independent Complaints Commission, and until regulations under section 7 have been approved by the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We put down that amendment because we believed that the Seanad amendment put down by the Minister was very inadequate, and the Minister has recognised that fact because he has put down the following amendment which states:</P>
      <P>In the third line to delete all words after &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána not above the rank of chief superintendent and the adjudication by a body other than the Garda Síochána of such complaints have been enacted by the Oireachtas and have come into operation and until regulations under section 7 have been made&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We put down our amendment because the Seanad amendment by the Minister merely stated &ldquo;... until provisions relating to the investigation and adjudication of complaints... have been made.&rdquo;&ldquo;Provisions&rdquo; is a very open term, and it could mean virtually anything.  We welcome the fact that the Minister has come here with an amendment from the Seanad because it is going some of the way towards what this House sought to do, and his additional amendment goes somewhat further. In the course of this debate I hope to show that only by going as far as our <Col N="860" /> amendment goes can we provide properly for a full independent complaints commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment does not do what he says it will do.  Here we must be concerned about what is in the amendment, not what the Minister is saying outside the House.  He has been saying various things outside the House which are not in his new amendment.  For instance, he has been saying that the investigations will be under the control of this body which will be separate from the Garda Síochána, but his amendment does not say that and that is why we have to question his amendment.  It does not say specifically that the investigations will be under the control of the complaints commission.  He may have it in mind that eventually he would see them under that control, but that is not said in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The other reason we are not happy with his amendment is that it separates the adjudication from the investigation of complaints.  It goes a good way towards what we are looking for by talking about adjudication by a body other than the Garda Síochána, but it does not include the investigation under such a body.  It separates the adjudication from the investigation, but we believe both should be by or under the control of the complaints commission.  Our amendment seeks to have both adjudication and investigation under the control of the complaints commission.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Minister's amendment to ensure that this body will be an independent body.  It is said it will be a body separate from the Garda Síochána, but this could be a body comprising of any person: for instance, one could say that the Garda Club is a body separate from the Garda Síochána.  We want the Minister to come across clearly and honestly and to say he is interested in having an independent body which is separate and seen to be such.  If that is what the Minister is interested in having, we do not know why he will not put that down in his amendment.  We believe that the independent complaints commission should apply to everyone and that senior <Col N="861" /> gardaí should not be excluded.  There should be no discrimination between the members of the Garda Síochána, they should all be equal before the law.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come here from the Seanad with his tail between his legs.  He would not listen to the House when we put down amendments along these lines asking him to include such provisions in the Bill.  We spent a great deal of time in this House discussing the matter before the Bill went to the Seanad.  I know there were fairly dramatic developments in the Seanad that may have brought home to him the wisdom of the line put to him in this House.  However, he would only give the House vague promises that if it was left to him he would in due course bring in some form of complaints procedure and some form of regulations and we were to take it on that basis.</P>
    <P>We are very glad to see that he has come before the House with the amendments. It is far better for us in this House in relation to this Bill to be wise rather than to be clever, and I say that quite genuinely.  Many of us here tried hard to be wise about sections of the Bill and it was not an easy thing to do.  Certainly Members on both sides tried very hard not to be just clever about this matter. We must bear in mind that we are making provisions that will apply for a long time in the future.  Perhaps our interest has been sharpened by recent events.  Perhaps our sense of commitment and conviction about some of the measures we were suggesting from our limited experience and our theoretical knowledge of the situation have been strengthened by recent events.  It is the duty of the Oireachtas to set down principles and to provide for the checks and balances.  It is not enough for the Minister to speak outside this House about such checks and balances if they are not provided in the legislation.</P>
    <P>On 5 July when the Bill was leaving this House I wished the Minister the best of luck in the Seanad, and they seem to have been prophetic words.  At column 1810 of the Official Report dated 5 July I made the following comment:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> We have here a legislative bird without two wings, the regulations and the complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>That was the way we felt about it.  We had done a great deal of work on the Bill but at the end of the day we were sending it to the Seanad without these two wings. Consequently we are glad that the Minister has come before the House again.</P>
    <P>The two areas we are discussing here are particularly important.  We are talking about arrest and detention on suspiction. The primary purpose of their legislation is to enable the Garda Síochána to interrogate suspected persons in Garda stations.  On page 316 of the <i>Irish Law Reports,</i> 1980, the Chief Justice said:</P>
    <P>It has been stated many times in our courts that there is no such procedure permitted by the law as holding for questioning or detaining on any pretext except pursuant to a court order or for the purpose of charging and bringing the person detained before a court. Any other purpose is unknown to the law and constitutes a flagrant and unwarranted interference with the liberty of the citizen.  The only exceptions are section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and section 2 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>Both of those deal with subversive crimes.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with detention after arrest.  In an article which the Minister wrote for the <i>Irish Independent</i> of October 27 the Minister said the Bill gives power to detain persons for questioning not, be it noted, power to arrest, because there are no new powers of arrest in the Bill.  The whole purpose of this section is to provide for detention after arrest.  As we understand it, these are arrested people who are being detained.  Section 5 deals with access to a solicitor and notification of detention.  Section 6 relates to the powers of the Garda Síochána in relation to detained persons.  Section 8 deals with the destruction of records. <Col N="863" /> Section 9 deals with applications to persons in custody under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939. Section 7 deals with regulations regarding the treatment of persons in custody.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with this very important area and the new developments which are taking place under this Bill.  From the time this Bill was first introduced the Minister has been promising us a complaints procedure.  There was a supplementary memorandum to the Bill in October 1983.  We asked why this small extra supplementary memorandum came with the Bill.  It seemed to be a last minute decision or a small hiccup in the Minister's programme in bringing the Bill before the House.  That little memorandum said that &ldquo;the Minister wishes to state, for the information of Deputies and Senators, that the Government have decided on his recommendation that those provisions in the Bill giving increased powers to the Garda Síochána, and which will come into operation only when a ministerial order to that effect is made, will not be brought into force until a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal has been established.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It went on to say that &ldquo;it has not yet been decided whether legislation will be necessary to establish such a procedure or whether it will be introduced at least in the first instance on an administrative basis.&rdquo;  It concluded by saying that if legislation were necessary it would in any event have to be a separate Bill as the present Bill is concerned with criminal law procedures and could not appropriately deal with non-criminal procedures. We were very concerned about what that supplementary memorandum meant, and we questioned it in the House.  We wondered what was going on.  Since that time the Minister has been promising us a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal.  The Minister seemed to be fairly clear at that stage that it would be an independent person or tribunal.</P>
    <P>At different stages we tried to establish what the position was in relation to this <Col N="864" /> complaints procedure.  It was promised again on the Second Stage of the Bill.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question on 8 March 1984 the Minister told Deputy Mac Giolla and myself that the provisions giving increased power to the Garda would not be brought into operation until a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal had been established.  He said:</P>
    <P>The new procedures will not be brought into operation until both Houses of the Oireachtas have had an opportunity to discuss it.  I am dealing with this matter with all possible speed, and although some further work, including consultations with garda associations and so on, is necessary, I expect to be in a position to inform the House of the proposals in the near future.</P>
    <P>He concluded by saying:</P>
    <P>I can say that at present the indications are that the scheme will be a statutory rather than an administrative scheme.</P>
    <P>In April we had the Committee Stage of the Bill and again the Minister promised that a complaints procedure would be forthcoming.  In July it was not available when the Bill was being finalised in the House.  We pleaded with the Minister to bring in a complaints procedure in parallel with the Bill or as part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In June of this year a document was leaked which indicated that certain things were happening.  On June 15 1984 an article appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> which said that a Garda Síochána complaints board composed of a chairman and up to six members, with a permanent secretariat, whose chief executive officer would have significant powers of investigation would be proposed shortly by the Government in line with the commitment given by the Minister for Justice when the Criminal Justice Bill was introduced in the Dáil.  It said the board would be able to investigate allegations against the Garda.  Further down it said that the proposals <Col N="865" /> were finalised recently by the Department of Justice and had been circulated to the office of the Attorney General, the Garda Commissioner and several other senior officers plus the Garda representative organisations, and the board members would include the Garda Commissioner or an assistant commissioner nominated by him.  It went on to give various other details of the Minister's proposals.  On June 15 we got some indication that the Minister was doing something further about the whole question.</P>
    <P>Why did not the Minister come forward with these provisions?  How can it take so long to make such a document available to us?  It cannot be so difficult that it takes such a long time.  When you look at that background and at the amendments before us, you wonder what exactly is happening.  In an article in the <i>Garda News</i>, volume 3, No. 2, March 1984, the views of the Garda are given and a number of points are made.  One is that in Britain the most dramatic changes in police complaints procedures have occurred in recent years.  It goes on to say that a police complaints board was established in 1976 and that a copy of every complaint had to be sent to the board, which had no investigative role.</P>
    <P>Further it said that following a White Paper issued by the Home Office in 1981, a new complaints system was incorporated into the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill, 1983 and the principal changes proposed were the appointment of independent assessors to oversee policy investigation and a wider investigative role for the Police Complaints Board.</P>
    <P>We get some idea of what is happening in Britain from these articles and the conferences which are taking place.  The conclusion in this country was that, reservations apart, most reasonable people would probably favour a scheme if it conformed to certain principles.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors set out their views in relation to the principles on which the scheme should be based, and it is to be noted that it should incorporate an independent element at the adjudication stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> Are we beginning to see how the Minister now separates out adjudication from investigation?  Again, the <i>Garda Review</i>, volume 12, No. 4, April 1984 had an article under the heading of &ldquo;Extracts from the address of Michael F. Murray, AGSI National Executive on the Criminal Justice Bill&rdquo;.  This referred to a speech which Mr. Murray gave on April 2, 1984.</P>
    <P>The article stated:</P>
    <P>It is now over five months since the Criminal Justice Bill was introduced and we still have no knowledge of what is intended in the complaints procedures.</P>
    <P>It is stated further:</P>
    <P>The basic question we must ask ourselves here is, do we agree with the introduction of an independent element?</P>
    <P>Further down it is stated:</P>
    <P>On balance, I favour the second view.  If we honestly and sincerely want to have contact with and support from the community, we must stop thinking of ourselves as a brotherly band beleaguered by hostile forces and start thinking of ourselves more as public servants within a specialised law enforcement organisation.  I put it to you, therefore, that it is in our best interests to be in favour of some from of independent element in our complaints procedures.</P>
    <P>Here we see the scene changing and developing outside the House.  Mr. Murray stressed:</P>
    <P>(1) The investigation of complaints must be conducted by gardaí.  We cannot have independent investigators involved.</P>
    <P>He summarises the position then as follows:</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am suggesting that we should agree in principle to some independent element in our complaints procedures and (2) that element should not be extended beyond the adjudication stage and the new system should be along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> When we try to see why the Minister is at such great pains to separate adjudication from investigation, it becomes fairly clear that he is subject to other pressures and that these are being exerted in favour of a particular system.  I have no objection to that.  Any organisation have the right to bring forward their own view, but the Minister has a duty far beyond that.  He has a duty to the people and to the House to ensure that this proposed complaints procedure is clearly seen to be independent, both in its powers of investigation and adjudication.</P>
    <P>From the outset we have maintained a consistent position in relation to this area. I might comment on the Minister's article, again in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of October 27, page 8, in which he referred to the complaints procedure.  This made quite a few people wonder what exactly was happening.  The Minister's style seems to be to talk outside to the media in special articles like this one and not be quite so forthcoming here in the House, or certainly to put the House after the articles outside it, which I think is an affront to the House, but that is a matter of personal opinion.  We find under the heading of complaints procedure that the Minister says:</P>
    <P>The establishment of a body other than the Garda Síochána to deal with complaints against the gardaí from members of the public and to supervise the investigation of complaints and in appropriate cases to carry out the investigation itself is a further safeguard.</P>
    <P>When I read that, I asked what we were talking about.  We looked at the Minister's amendment which separated quite clearly investigation from adjudication. We look at what the Minister writes under his own hand &mdash; it is not a source close to the Minister, or a spokesman or spokesperson, or anything else, it is the Minister as a guest writer writing under his own hand.  If this is what the Minister intends, I do not see why he does not accept the amendment which we are putting before him.</P>

      <P>Quite clearly, the amendment which we have put down will give power and will say quite clearly when these investigations will be by or under the control of.  The Deputies and Senators will have agreed to it, it will be clear and written down and there will be no questions afterwards.  I do not want a loose term like &ldquo;revisions&rdquo; in the Bill in relation to investigation.  We would be relying then on what the Minister said in an article in <i>The Irish Independent</i> for what that might mean.  Subsequently, as many of the learned members of the legal profession here will tell us, that does not mean anything when you come to court. It is what is down in the Act that matters. That would be our question and I found that somewhat confusing.  If it means that the Minister is prepared to go further and be clearer here in relation to the Bill itself, that would answer most of our questions, or the bulk of them in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Minister's amendment No. 1a, our position has been fairly straightforward and consistent from the outset. We went to the stage of putting down an amendment in the House for establishing a complaints procedure and then an additional amendment defining what the procedure was.  They were defeated in the House.  We are back to the same ground again in these amendments.  According to the Minister's second amendment to amendment No. 1a the body will only have power to adjudicate, as I read it. The investigation will remain with the gardaí.  The body will have no function or power to control or direct the investigation. The Minister may say when we come to having the complaints procedure <Col N="869" /> before the House that he is prepared to write in certain powers which would enable the body to have control over the investigation and to do it on the lines of the amendment we are suggesting.  They would have to rely entirely on what they are told by the garda investigating complaints against a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in relation to the Minister's amendment, the adjudication is by a body other than the Garda Síochána.  This body, of course, may be comprised of members, a majority of whom could be members of the Garda Síochána, or there may be an individual, single member, or as the leaked document in <i>The Irish Times</i> said, a commissioner or a member representing the commissioner.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment does not even provide for a body which will be completely and fully independent of the force in their adjudication.  They are not, therefore, an independent body and appear to have no function in investigation. As the Minister proposes in his amendment, the senior staff will be above the regulations and complaints procedure. We find that difficult to accept. Obviously, the staff down the line will be directed by the senior staff, and if that is the case we believe that the same procedure should apply to all members from the bottom to the top.  We often ask, &ldquo;where does the buck stop?&rdquo;  In this case the buck must stop at the top, and the procedures should allow for that to happen.</P>
    <P>The question of &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; which is still being used in the Minister's amendment 1a can, of course, mean anything. It can mean a committee, an internal investigation or even just a financial provision. We feel that the term &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; is something of a toothless dragon.  That is why in using, as the Minister does, the word &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; in relation to the investigation, you are left with a fairly open situation in relation to what these provisions might subsequently be.  The Minister's amendment says &ldquo;provisions for the investigation of complaints from the public against members of the Garda <Col N="870" /> Síochána not above the rank of chief superintendent&rdquo;.  We feel that &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; in that sense is too loose and too open.  If the Minister is going to tell us that what he said to Independent Newspapers on Saturday is what he is going to say here tonight, I would be happy if he would put that down as an amendment to his own amendment and put it into the Act itself.</P>
    <P>On the question of excluding assistant commissioners, deputy commissioners and commissioners we must ask why the Minister wants to exclude the senior staff. The Bill in England at present includes a similar term, but why exclude the senior staff?  Surely this is an opportunity for the Dáil to provide an independent body who will review the conduct of all members of the force against whom a complaint has been made, from the ordinary member of the Garda Síochána to the top level. There was a time when the Minister talked about de-politicising the Garda Síochána.  He even spoke of a Garda authority.  Now he is being put to the test.  This is an opportunity to provide an independent, non-political body to deal with these matters.  The House deserves to be told in a simple yes or no if the Minister is going to retain political control over the upper echelons of the Garda Síochána in this respect, or will he allow an independent body to deal with complaints by members of the public against such persons?  After all, the Minister may tell us that the Government, if they are not happy with the behaviour of the top echelons of the gardaí, the most senior members, can take their own action, but we still come back to the question of what action the ordinary member of the public can take.  The whole purpose of this complaints commission is for the ordinary members of the public to have recourse to an independent complaints body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have an opportunity to finish them now, and there is a duty on us to deal with them extensively.  This, therefore, is the Minister's opportunity to provide a truly independent, non-political body to deal with this situation.  The Government have their own means of dealing with complaints of their own.  On the other side of the coin, the commissioner, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners have a right to be heard by an independent body of high standing if allegations are made against them by members of the public, without the intervention of any political pressure or forces.  Therefore, there is good reason for having all the members subject to this independent complaints commission. Our amendment provides for a complaints commission who would be independent in their functions, in particular independent of the Garda Síochána.  We believe that this is essential to ensure mutual confidence between the Garda and the public at large.  It is not only good for the Garda and the public but it is essential that the amendment which we are putting before the House is passed and that the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; is used. Needless to say, various views on this will be expressed, and I leave further comment on that until we see what the Minister's reply is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point to the fact that the Ombudsman was set up as an independent person, independent in the performance of his functions.  In the Ombudsman Act, 1980, section 4 (1) it is clearly set out that he is independent in his functions and in the First Schedule to that Act we see quite clearly that the Ombudsman has Departments of State and other persons subject to investigation including the Department of Justice. <Col N="872" /> Therefore, the Department of Justice and the Secretary of the Department of Justice and all members of the Department of Justice are subject to investigation by the Ombudsman.  It is difficult to say then why there should be particular exclusions at the top levels in the Garda Síochána when even the top administrators in the Department of Justice are not excluded.  I am sure the Minister will have various comments to make in relation to the whole question of &ldquo;independent&rdquo;, but I would point out that we have independent arbitrators appointed by the Government.  We see this body which we are proposing as a complaints commission, an administrative tribunal with quasi-judicial functions, and we feel that they must be independent especially in relation to the investigation of complaints.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are concerned about the Minister's amendment and that in his amendment he has gone away from the use of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  He has used it at various stages on the way along. In the <i>Fine Gael/Labour Programme for Government</i> of December 1982 on page 26 the Minister was not afraid to use the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  He said:</P>
    <P>An effective Independent Complaints Procedure will also be established to safeguard both the public and the Gardaí, who are often the subject of false allegations.</P>
    <P>I emphasise, an independent complaints procedure.  Our amendment does this.  It is a necessary amendment if the Minister is pursuing the line which he has told us he is pursuing.  We are concerned about the situation, as are many Members of the House.  Our concern has been intensified by recent happenings and events and we are anxious that there will be a procedure which is fair to the public and to the Garda.  We believe that we owe it to the public and the gardaí to set up here in the House the parameters within which we expect the Garda to work on our behalf.  Essentially we are looking for the two functions to come under the control of the independent complaints commission, and I accept that in many instances <Col N="873" /> the Garda may themselves carry out investigations on behalf of the commission and under the direction of the commission. This should be left to the commission to control and organise.  That is why we want to see it by, or under the direction of an independent complaints commission.</P>
    <P>We are glad that the Minister is coming nearer to our position.  If he has further proposals which will follow on his statement on Saturday, and if he has some amendment which will bring this into the Bill at this stage, we will certainly welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The amendment made by the Seanad proposes that the sections relating to detention in Garda custody, withholding information about guns or stolen property, as well as those dealing with inferences, will not come into operation until a statutory complaints procedure and treatment regulations are in force.  I moved this amendment in the Seanad to meet similar amendments moved by Senators Mary Robinson, Michael Higgins, Eoin Ryan and Brian Hillery.</P>
      <P>In moving the amendment there I made it clear that, although I considered that it was unnecessary in view of the undertakings that had been given by the Government and by myself about the complaints procedure and the regulations, I had put it forward in the hope that it would achieve a greater consensus. I was conscious also that similar views had been expressed in this House when we were considering the Bill.  Indeed, Deputy Woods tabled amendments on Committee Stage and Report Stage to the like effect so far as the complaints procedure is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am moving my amendment, No. 1a, to the Seanad amendment with a view to providing some reassurance to those Members of the House who may feel that that amendment may be too widely expressed in so far as it could envisage the adjudication of complaints under the <Col N="874" /> new procedure by the Garda themselves. This will not be the case as the commitment by the Government is to a complaints procedure with a strong independent element so that there could be no question of complaints being adjudicated on by the Garda alone.</P>
    <P>In particular, I hope that my amendment will go some way towards meeting the concern of Deputy Michael Woods that there should be some reference at this point to the independent character of the new complaints body while not pre-empting the decision of the Oireachtas as to the best form that that independent body should take.</P>
    <P>The main difference between Deputy Woods's amendment and the amendment made by the Seanad is the inclusion of a reference to an independent complaints commission.  I see a difficulty about using the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in the text of the amendment.  The inclusion of such a reference would mean that we would be anticipating at this stage what the ultimate decision of the Oireachtas would be on the forthcoming legislative proposals relating to the investigation and adjudication of complaints.  I do not think that it would be appropriate, or even useful, for us to try to do that.  Otherwise, when the detention provisions and the Complaints Bill are duly brought into operation, the case might be made that the detention provisions were invalid because, it would be argued, the complaints commission was not given that particular title or was not 100 per cent independent and so on. This possibility is not entirely fanciful because, if the case succeeded, any detentions and subsequent convictions could be rendered invalid.  It is in fact for this reason that the wording of the Seanad amendment was carefully expressed so as to avoid any such possibility.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that we are bringing in a complaints procedure by means of a Bill which will have to go through all Stages here and in the Seanad.  If we try to lock the detail of that complaints procedure into a short form of words here, the form of words we adopt may prove subsequently to be in conflict with what the House decides the complaints <Col N="875" /> procedure should be.  This would leave us in a situation where provisions of this Bill, and prosecutions taken subsequently as a result of certain of these provisions, could be ruled invalid.  For example, if the standard procedure that the Government could remove a member of the complaints board was included, would that board be then independent? Would the Supreme Court see that as &ldquo;independent&rdquo;?  Would the Supreme Court decide that &ldquo;independent&rdquo; means the kind of independence the Judiciary have, no diminution in status or remuneration? Is that what we are talking about?</P>
    <P>It is not a lack of commitment to the independence of the complaints procedure. I have repeated all along that it must have a strong independent element and that it must be a body other than the Garda Síochána.  My concern is with the use of a word in an amendment which could subsequently be deemed to be in conflict with the complaints procedure which this House, and the other House, decided was the appropriate one to accept.  That is the difficulty in the use of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is on other difficulty &mdash; it is a minor one &mdash; in relation to Deputy Woods's amendment.  His amendment provides that the detention provisions etc. will not come into operation until the regulations under section 7 have been approved by the Oireachtas.  On the other hand, the Seanad amendment, and my amendment to it, refer to the regulations having been made.  The possibility exists with Deputy Woods's amendment that although the regulations might have been approved by the Oireachtas they might not be made by the Minister before the detention provisions are brought into operation.  That is the difficulty.  In an attempt to make the obligation on the Minister tighter Deputy Woods, in effect, has tabled an amendment which makes it weaker.  I can only make regulations as a Minister, or any subsequent Minister, under the provisions of section 7.  That section states that these regulations must be brought before this House, and the other House, and positively approved. <Col N="876" /> It is only then that I can make them. However, in the manner Deputy Woods has framed his amendment, it would only require that the two Houses approve the regulations without any obligation on this Minister, or any subsequent Minister, to make those regulations.  As soon as the Dáil and Seanad approve the regulations, even if they were not made by a Minister, the sections I have mentioned could be brought into operation by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>I accept that Deputy Woods was trying to make it a tighter obligation but, in fact, he has weakened it rather than making it tighter.  The main issue raised by Dr. Woods's amendment is the extent to which there should be involvement by the Garda in the complaints procedure.  In my view the appropriate time to debate this issue is on the second stage of the complaints Bill when the House will have the advantage of having a detailed text before it.  It may be worth mentioning however that from research it is a lengthy piece of legislation.  The intention of the amendment I have brought in from the Seanad, on the advice of the Seanad, is that certain sections of the Bill should not be brought into effect until this House does certain things.  First of all, that a Bill establishing a complaints procedure which it is satisfied with is passed, and, secondly, that it approves regulations which it is satisfied with.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is not to go on to specify the detail of the complaints procedure because it is not appropriate to do that.  The complaints procedure is not being brought in by ministerial order or by regulation.  It will be established by an Act of Parliament.  It will have to go through all Stages in this House.  I am not in any way withdrawing from any type of commitment.  Deputy Woods referred to various delays on my part but I should like to point out to him that one of the reasons for this was that although quite a lot of work on the Criminal Justice Bill had been done by the previous administration, and by administrations previous to that, the administration of which Deputy Woods was a <Col N="877" /> Minister, did not envisage a complaints procedure going hand in hand with the Criminal Justice Bill.  In effect, we had to start almost from the beginning in framing a complaints procedure.  My proposals for a complaints procedure went before Government in April last and I have done my best since then to get them drafted.  We are very near the stage of having a Bill which can be circulated to Members.  I would like to be able to give the details of that Bill tonight but some Member would surely say that this was not the appropriate way to behave, that if a Bill is within a short time of circulation, the appropriate thing to do is to circulate it to all Members with a debate to follow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods spoke for a long time but I do not see a particular conflict in general with the ideas he has put forward and the ideas I am putting forward.  In the newspaper article to which Deputy Woods referred I attempted to summarise the type of proposals on which the Bill is being drafted.  I do not think there is a conflict of content here.  I cannot accept an amendment which is technically flawed on the use of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; because that leaves a problem. I cannot accept an amendment which, in effect, reduces the commitment I gave to the Seanad.  I gave the Seanad a commitment that the amendments and regulations would have to be made.  Deputy Woods's amendment says that the regulations have to be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is less of a commitment. The amendment I am making myself is adding to the commitment I gave to the Seanad, and I am sure they will be happy with a strengthening of that commitment.  Certainly I am sure they would not be happy with a loosening of that commitment.</P>
    <P>With respect, I do not think there is a major difference of policy or approach between what I am saying and what Deputy Woods has advocated.  I know some of Deputy Woods's views because, when we were discussing the Criminal Justice Bill, he put forward proposals himself for a complaints procedure very similar to the kind of procedure which <Col N="878" /> operates in Great Britain.  For that reason I have an idea of his mind on the matter. Deputy Woods referred to an article in <i>The Irish Times,</i> to a leak, which did not come from me but certainly gives an indication of what was the approach at the time.  Substantially the approach remains the same, substantially, but not in all details or matters.</P>
    <P>Basically what I am saying is that the commitment stands.  We are now writing it into the Bill in a firm way because the Seanad thought that an appropriate thing to do.  There will be plenty of opportunity here, on all Stages of a complaints Bill, to debate the issues involved.  But I do not think it is practical, possible or appropriate that, in a complicated piece of legislation, we should attempt &mdash; by way of amendment of another Bill &mdash; to tie in the detail of a complicated piece of legislation.  The intention of the amendment, as proposed in this House, as proposed in the Seanad, and as moved by me subsequently in the Seanad, is that certain sections of this Bill will not become law until this House is happy and has passed a complaints procedure, until the other House is happy and has passed a complaints procedure and until regulations have been approved by this and the other House, and subsequently made by the Minister.  Then, and then only, can sections of this Bill come into law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see the Minister back in this House with an amendment indicating that the sections to which I was opposed on Committee Stage when it was going through the House will not be brought into effect until a complaints procedure, commission or tribunal &mdash; whatever one likes to call it &mdash; is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the question the Minister has raised as to the use of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in the Fianna Fáil amendment and the possible conflict that that might create in subsequent legislation could be easily overcome by the Minister introducing here, in the first place, the complaints procedure in law and leaving the finalisation of this Bill until such time as that complaints procedure has been dealt with <Col N="879" /> by the House.  It should be remembered that the Bill itself is not dependent on a complaints procedure or tribunal, that it does not at present contain within it any indication that it could not work or its provisions not be operated without a complaints tribunal.  It would be a disaster to have its provisions implemented without a complaints tribunal, but the Bill itself is not dependent thereon.</P>
    <P>Certainly there is very grave public disquiet about the fact that the Garda investigate complaints against themselves. Recent events in Kerry and Cavan have heightened that concern.  It is concern which has been raised by a number of Deputies in this House in the course of the debate on this Bill.  Recent events have, if you like, borne out the reservations many of us expressed as it progressed through this House.  Therefore I do not see the validity of the Minister's argument that to accept the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; would in some way conflict. Indeed the necessity for the amendment would be abolished were the Minister simply to say: we will not take this Bill any further until such time as we have the complaints procedures dealt with by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That would be the beginning and end of it.  We would not have to spend the next day or two debating this amendment if the Minister made such an announcement here this evening, which would be a very useful thing for him to do.</P>
    <P>The other point I should make about the complaints procedure is that it is not entirely dependent, or does not arise simply because there are certain sections being introduced in this Bill.  The need has existed for many years.  The need arises for independent investigation of allegations against the Garda, not only in situations in which people have been arrested and held in Garda stations.  It arises in relation to allegations in which people have been arrested and held in Garda stations.  It arises in relation to allegations before a person even enters a Garda station.  There have been two recent incidents in my constituency, the details of which I do not propose to go <Col N="880" /> into at this stage, one in which a young boy of 16 years of age was assaulted and kicked outside his own home by gardaí and a separate incident in which a young girl of 18 years of age, who was six months pregnant, was kicked, by gardaí.  I referred those matters to the superintendent in my area and they are being investigated by the Garda.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly the urgent need for independent investigation of complaints against the Garda.  I make this argument as much in defence of the Garda themselves as I do in defence of people in general.  Everybody is aware that there is a growing alienation, that there are trends developing within Irish society trying to alienate young people in particular from the Garda.  They are using every opportunity &mdash; in particular on the question of the drugs issue &mdash; to alienate both adults and young people from the Garda, to attempt to establish an independent police force, or independent policing, if you like, a vigilante-type policing.  Anything lending itself to that type of alienation must be opposed; anything lending towards its diminution must be supported. An independent complaints procedure constitutes one of the key elements in ensuring that the confidence of the general public is retained in the Garda, that they are allowed continue with their work.  I would ask the Minister to take the position that the legislation on the independent inquiry into allegations against the Garda be brought into this House before we proceed any further with this Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the regulations under section 7 &mdash; clearly regulations which cannot be put before this House until the Bill itself becomes law &mdash; it should be pointed out that there is nothing to prevent the Minister from presenting this House with draft regulations, proposed regulations, he intends introducing.  We would then know, when discussing this Bill &mdash; and I argued this point in Committee State before the Bill ever went to the Seanad &mdash; exactly what were the regulations regarding the conduct of Garda in relation to the questioning of suspects, detention and so on.  We would <Col N="881" /> then know precisely what regulations would be enforced or made available.  I must stress that what I, and I am sure every other Deputy, is arguing is for the protection of the innocent, that is the vast majority of people.  We have produced various statistics to show that the vast majority of people who have been detained under the Offences Against the State Act subsequently were released without charge.  Only one in seven of those arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act and detained for up to 48 hours are subsequently charged as a result of their detention.  Large numbers of innocent people could be taken in under these detention provisions.  It is absolutely essential that we know before we agree to pass this Bill what protection there is going to be for the person being detained.</P>
    <P>The third point I would like to make is that in approaching this amendment and on Committee Stage we felt that it was also necessary to ensure that before the sections on detention and related sections came into effect, regulations under section 27 should be introduced.  That is the regulations which concern the electronic recording of questioning.  The Ceann Comhairle has ruled that amendment out of order.  I do not propose to discuss the amendment except to stress and appeal to the Minister for Justice to ensure that before the sections referred to in his own amendment are introduced, a system of recording or of overseeing the detention of suspected persons in Garda stations should be introduced.  The Ó Briain Report, in its recommendations, suggested a custodial guardian who would be present at all questioning and oversee the detention of a person.  The Minister has a section which does not introduce that particular concept but proposes the electronic recording of questioning.  It is essential that recording, whether by electronic means or by hand or whatever, should be introduced before the sections on detention are brought into effect.</P>
    <P>Despite the long debates that have taken place on the Bill in the House and in the Seanad, I have yet to see any concrete evidence produced to show that <Col N="882" /> the Bill will have the effect which is being claimed for it, in other words the detection of crime and a reduction in the crime rate.  I have asked the Minister for Justice to produce this evidence on a number of occasions.  In the Seanad a Labour Party Senator requested that a White Paper be produced on the question of crime which would give us a basis for discussing the question of crime and the approach to crime.  But the only response we have had from the Minister for Justice in relation to the aspect of proving the effectiveness of the Bill is that he said it is not the total response to the question of crime.  I have no evidence before me to show that it is not the total response.  It appears to me to be the total response.  Also in the National Plan there is no reference whatsoever to what the Government's policy is in relation to tackling the question of crime, its causes and how it can be dealt with other than by strengthening the law, dealing with the sentence rather than the causes of the problem.</P>
    <P>Consequently, while I welcome the amendment the Minister has brought in as a further improvement to the Bill, I cannot see myself supporting the Bill in principle because I do not see the sections on detention and related sections are the answer to the problems the State faces in relation to crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to these two amendments I cannot see much difference between them.  Much of the debate here this evening is more relevant to the further debate which will take place when the Bill comes before the House.  There is no doubt that there is a very strong consensus within the House that it is absolutely necessary that an independent complaints tribunal be set up.  It is in the interests of the Garda Síochána, as much as in the public interest, to ensure that the complaints tribunal is fully independent and seen to be fully independent.  In the past when Members of this House have been raising questions about complaints relating to a minority of Garda Síochána, they had the very distasteful experience of being virtually <Col N="883" /> attacked by people who were described in the Press as spokesmen for the Garda. They are not spokesmen for the Garda, they are trade union leaders who have failed to acknowledge any fault whatsoever with the present situation.  Some Deputies, like myself, have spent quite a long time, up to 1983, calling for stronger powers and action on crime but only to find that because of the resulting publicity people were coming to me to put the other side of the coin.  I was one of the Deputies who highlighted certain abuses but who was attacked by what were described as spokesmen for the Garda. They almost slander anybody who disagrees with their line and say that people are playing into the hands of subversives no matter how anti-subversive people are, like myself.  Members of this House are open to attack and almost slander by inference or by declaration by certain spokesmen who have done a total disservice to the Garda Síochána by their approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the whole appropriateness of Garda representative bodies being cast in the role of pressure groups or potential lawmakers.  What would happen if we were to extend the same widely used liberties of some of the Garda representative associations to the Army or the Judiciary?  We must be very clear about this.  There is no doubt whatever about the support of the legislature for the Garda Síochána.  There is no doubt whatsoever about the decency of 95 per cent of the Garda Síochána.  But Members of this House cannot be cajoled, blackmailed or bullied against doing their duty by speaking out about the small percentage of gardaí who are not only not doing their duty but who are undermining the whole of the Garda Síochána.  I want to make it very clear that there is nobody in this House out to attack the Garda Síochána, but out to uphold the Garda Síochána to ensure that they can go about their duties, to ensure that they do not have to put up with this innuendo themselves.  There should be no doubt whatsoever in any reasonable person's mind about the need <Col N="884" /> for a fully independent complaints tribunal to investigate complaints of this nature.</P>
    <P>I am worried because of the reaction of some of the spokesmen because they have failed to recognise that there is any problem or accept that there is a problem.  That is not doing a service to the Garda.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy has been given permission to raise the subject matter of Questions Nos. 1 and 215 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me permission to raise this matter.  I am very sorry that I have found it necessary to do so.  I had put down two questions to the Taoiseach, one merely seeking to establish the population residing on each of the offshore islands and the main question asking whether he agreed that the needs of these islanders required special treatment and the steps his Government proposed to meet those needs.  When the Order Paper appeared that question had been transferred to the Minister for Finance. I was seeking a statement from the Taoiseach on Government policy to provide for the needs of the people residing there.  I am somewhat puzzled as to why the question should have been referred to the Minister for Finance, and I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me to raise the matter.  It would not have been necessary if it had been dealt with in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise that there are possibly over 10,000 people residing on our offshore islands.  All these people are located on islands in remote areas far removed from modern facilities, transport etc.  It is more difficult for them to survive than for people living in urban areas.  Some of these islands are connected to the mainland, but a large number of them are very isolated, some <Col N="885" /> as far as ten or 12 miles out into the ocean.</P>
    <P>The central development committee which is located within the Department of Finance was established some years ago and reported in 1979, making recommendations for improvements to facilities which were deemed to be absolutely essential for the residents of those islands.  That report was accepted by the then Fianna Fáil Government and some of the proposals were implemented. Since the Coalition Government have come into office there has been a great silence in regard to the needs of islanders. I would appreciate it if the Minister for Finance would state categorically the Government attitude towards the people living on remote offshore islands, especially those islands which are not connected to the mainland.  These people have many difficulties in trying to survive and it is important that the Government should give a clear indication of their commitment.</P>
    <P>It is well known that there is a body of opinion within Government Departments that it would be much wiser and much cheaper to transfer all these people from the islands to the mainland.  It would cost the Government a lot less and remove what is considered by some people in the Government service to be a problem.  I want to establish whether the Government subscribe to that notion. If they do not, there is an obligation on them to proceed with the provision of proper services for the people living on these islands.</P>
    <P>Many services have already been provided, but in the main transport has been the intractable difficulty confronting most people living on the islands. Roughly 1,200 people live on the two large Donegal islands, Arranmore and Tory.  In my constituency of Galway there are four large islands with a population of over 1,500.  I consider these people to be a very important part of the nation, a section of our community whom we should cherish.  We should make every effort to ensure that they can continue to reside in their home place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> The islands are very much part of our heritage.  There are many great historical connections going back over the centuries and some of our oldest and most valuable monuments are located on these islands. There we can see the only remaining examples of the traditional Irish way of life.  Many of the islands are Gaeltacht areas, which gives them a special importance, and the islands have been a great fountain of Irish culture through the years.</P>
    <P>It is important to know what Government policy is in regard to these islands. If there is a commitment to provide for the needs of the islanders then let us see some action.  I have very close connections with the islanders in my constituency and I am fully aware of the frustration they have been experiencing due to the great silence from the Government and the doubt as to whether the Government believe in maintaining the population on the islands.</P>
    <P>Residents living on the three large Aran Islands off the Galway coast have been wondering for two years what decisions will be made in regard to transport. The life blood of the Aran Islands is the sea transport facility.  For the past 25 years CIE have been charged with the responsibility of providing a freight service with a vessel known as the <i>Naomh Eanna,</i> which is now coming to the end of her seaworthy life.  It is doubtful whether she will pass her seaworthiness test next year.  I understand she may have just scraped through it this year.  There are rumours about the condition of the boat and some of the islanders fear for their lives when travelling on it.  Her sea life is coming very rapidly to an end.  The only other vessel serving the islands is the <i>Galway Bay,</i> a passenger vessel which operated during the summer months, but it has been sold and will not be available next year.</P>
    <P>An island community of about 1,500 people are dependent on transport by these boats, for food, furniture, building materials and everything needed to sustain life.  The antiquated system of serving the small islands will not do in the eighties.  The island communities on <Col N="887" /> Inisheer and Inishmaan have had to row out in small canvas currachs in all types of weather to transport goods off the <i>Naomh Eanna.</i>  Anybody who has witnessed this operation must agree that it is absolutely inhuman.  It is an antiquated system which must be brought to an end as quickly as possible.  Men have had to submerge themselves in the sea in the middle of winter and there is a high prevalence of arthritis among the male community due to the severe wettings involved in transporting goods to and from the <i>Naomh Eanna.</i>  That cannot be allowed to continue much longer.</P>
    <P>There has been silence from every Government Department regarding the facilities to be provided to replace the transport arrangements.  The frustration of the islanders has reached a stage where they have come together and put forward their own proposals for the building of new ships with roll-on roll-off facilities, thus eliminating the necessity for the use of currachs.  Animals had to swim out to the boats and be hauled on board by the use of ropes.  This caused great cruelty to the animals and grave risk to the lives of the islanders.</P>
    <P>Why the Government are not in a position to state what their actions will be is a matter of great concern and is causing dissatisfaction among the island communities. I hope the Minister will not pass the buck and say that is a matter for the Minister for Communications.  If the Government are committed to providing proper facilities it will do me tonight if the Minister says that a commitment is there and that he, as Minister for Finance, will be prepared to make funds available for the new vessels which are so urgently required.</P>
    <P>It is coming close to the time when timetables for the 1985 tourist season will have to be published.  Even at this stage we do not know what vessels will be available. We do not know what will replace the <i>Galway Bay,</i> which has a carrying capacity of 400 or 500 passengers, nor do we know what facilities will be available to replace the <i>Naomh Eanna,</i> if she passes her sea test this autumn and is put <Col N="888" /> back into service for possibly her last year at sea.  She is a most unsatisfactory craft. She is not able to come alongside the islands, thus imposing a terrible hardship on the island men who have to row out to collect food for the islands.</P>
    <P>The small industries which are trying to survive on these islands have to tolerate these antiquated facilities.  It was a great shame that the Government allowed the situation to go so far that the community had to come together, appoint their own consultants, approach their own shipbuilder and nearly design the ideal type of craft which they know will best meet their needs.  To this day, they do not know if the Government will support their proposals nor do they know what type of transport facilities will be available in 1985 and the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister for Communications has remained so quiet nor why there has been so much toing and froing of reports.  At an early stage the B &amp; I were brought in and they reported.  That was then referred to the Department of Transport who referred it to CIE.  Then CIE referred it back to the Department of Transport, who referred it back to B &amp; I.  They sent it to the Department of Communications again. No decision was made at any stage.  The islanders' frustration is justified.  The Minister must have some concern for the conditions these worthy citizens have tolerated over the years and I hope he will indicate tonight that the Government have a positive policy.  If he cannot make a comprehensive statement tonight surely he will give an assurance that such a statement will be made in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the meetings which have taken place on Clare Island and the meetings which will take place in Donegal this weekend, the second such meetings of representatives of all the inhabited islands around the coast.  Why has that frustration been allowed to develop?  It has developed because of a total lack of interest by the Government in the needs of those people.  Previously the Department of the Gaeltacht provided funds to the local authorities to <Col N="889" /> repair and maintain roads on Gaeltacht islands.  Now that the Coalition have decided to withdraw all Gaeltacht road grants, there are no funds available for the repair and maintenance of roads on Gaeltacht islands.  The Minister probably is not even aware of that.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties with the electricity system on the Aran Islands and the co-operatives have encountered many difficulties when dealing with the ESB.  If a proper policy were to be implemented the Government should be asked to take complete control and responsibility for the generation of electricity on those islands.  There is a long litany of complaints which can be made of matters which we do not expect the Government to solve overnight, but it would be very helpful if they gave an indication of their concern and said they had a policy which they intended implementing and so help reduce the fear which is genuinely held among our island community that this Government do not care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister gives a commitment that he will treat the off-shore islands as a special case.  Up to now under this Government the islands have been completely ignored.  I intend to confine my remarks to Donegal.  The Fianna Fáil Government made money available for the provision of a ferry in Donegal.  While Fianna Fáil were in power from 1977 to 1981 £15,000 was made available each year to Donegal County Council for the repair and maintenance of those roads.  Immediately the Coalition came into power the provision of this money was stopped.  It is no wonder that the Coalition candidates got only ten votes on all the islands off the west coast of Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Arranmore there is a factory about which I made representations to the Minister for the Gaeltacht on a number of occasions.  Repairs to this factory are urgently needed.  There is no way we can attract industrialists to the islands until the necessary work is carried out.  I hope this Government will give an assurance tonight that second level schools will be available on all the islands.  We have a <Col N="890" /> new slipway on Arranmore island and I am very proud of the ferry service but unfortunately it will not be able to operate during the winter because a bollard is needed so that the boat can be guided in properly when the seas are heavy.  On Inishboffin all we are asking for is the erection of a winch step.  In fairness to the Department of Finance it must be said that the money has been provided but I hope the Minister will use his good offices to ensure that this is erected as soon as possible.  Tory Island requires harbour development and a ferry service. I am asking for very little compared to what is being given on the mainland and I hope the Minister treats the island as a very special case.  These islands have been completely ignored by this Government. The boats could land at an area on Arranmore Island known as Aphort, but unfortunately they have to go to Burtonport because this Government will not provide funds to extend the slipway and the pier.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Fianna Fáil members of the European Parliament who have taken the initiative and tabled a resolution in that Parliament calling for measures to assist the islands of the Community which are under threat of being abandoned.  I call on the Minister to give full support to that resolution and to ensure that a detailed study of the social, economic, educational, health and cultural issues on the islands are carried out.  I ask the Minister to ensure that second level education is available on all islands, regardless of population numbers.  The islands are unique.  They are a special case and should not be bound by the regulations which apply to mainland Europe.</P>

      <P>I want to begin by refuting the allegation of both Deputies on the opposite side who claimed that this Government do not care about the people who live on the islands off the west coast.  Neither has any foundation for making an allegation of that kind nor has either Deputy, particularly Deputy Molloy, any grounds for saying in the House this evening that we have never even considered such matters <Col N="891" /> when he knows quite well that he and I discussed a number of those matters in this House during the budget debate this year and also I think during the budget debate last year.  I am afraid the Deputy is suffering from a certain lapse of memory.  I wish to assure the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy has a very short fuse &mdash; and it is sparking now as usual &mdash; but since I am making the kind of statement he wanted me to make perhaps he would be good enough to be quite and listen.  I want to assure the House that nothing could be further from the truth than to say that we wish to ignore the islands off the western coast or any other islands.  I do not know where the body of opinion is to which the Deputy referred that holds it would be cheaper to ship all the people from the islands and install them on the mainland. Perhaps the Deputy would have a word with me afterwards and inform me about this.  I have never come across it, and it is not something to which this Government would subscribe.  I do not think the Deputy needs any telling about that.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few technical points if I may, because I was somewhat surprised to find this matter coming up on the Adjournment this evening.  If I may say so, Sir, without being offensive to the Chair, it seems to me rather curious that we should be discussing on the Adjournment the subject matter of a question that is on the Order Paper.  I leave it to the Chair to give me guidance as to whether that is a usual practice.  I do not think it is, but I am open to correction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From his long experience as a Deputy and from the fact that he was a member of a Government, Deputy Molloy knows that when Deputies put down questions that relate to two different areas of competence in the Government they are usually &mdash; in fact almost always &mdash; split up for answer between the two Ministers concerned.  The Deputy put down a question that had to do with population and <Col N="892" /> with general policy.  The Taoiseach answers questions regarding the statistics of population and I answer questions on general policy for the non-Gaeltacht inhabited islands of the west coast.  The Deputy should not be surprised to find that I do that because we travelled over this ground on Question No. 115 which the Deputy tabled and which appeared on the Order Paper for 28 June.  We dealt with the matter on that date, and for the Deputy to say that the Government have never said anything about what they intend to do with regard to these islands is not true.</P>

      <P>He is not even taking account of the fact that he himself put down the question some months ago.  I was outside the barrier in this House this afternoon when the Deputy's fuse lit up on this question and I was amazed to find him doing that.  I really felt, if I might use the vulgar parlance, that he had &ldquo;thrown the head&rdquo; and he was probably as surprised as I was to find the matter appearing as a question on the Adjournment this evening.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, and as I told him last June, my particular area of responsibility is the inhabited non-Gaeltacht islands.  Both of the Deputies on the other side have raised questions that refer to Gaeltacht islands which are properly the province of the Minister for the Gaeltacht, and I do not intend to trespass on his area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

So far as it comes within my competence under the Central Development Committee we are working to provide these <Col N="893" /> facilities.  I do not know if it is the proper thing to do, but in order to respond to the Deputy I propose to give him the answer I had intended to give to the question he has on the Order Paper.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that, because I think the Deputy deserves an answer having found himself here, probably somewhat to his surprise.  A number of Departments are involved in services for the islands.  The Deputy has pointed out that Roinn na Gaeltachta are involved, as are my own Department and the Department of Communications.  I do not intend to go over the history of the CDC with which the Deputy is familiar. Under the schemes and studies of the CDC a number of special provisions were made for islands off the west coast.  They include housing grants and loans and grants under the supplementary housing accommodation scheme operated by Bord Fáilte.  In addition to that, a number of proposals regarding water and sewerage services were made to local authorities and the ESB extended their service to a number of islands.  Progress on the implementation of that decision following a report of the CDC in 1979 is monitored by a sub-committee of the CDC.</P>
      <P>Both Deputies referred to landing facilities which are of particular importance to the islands.  I am glad to say we have made some progress in this area in recent times.  The Office of Public Works recently completed work on the improvement of landing facilities at Clare Island and in July of this year work began on improvements to the pier at Roonagh Point which serves Clare Island.  The OPW are currently finalising contract documents with a view to inviting tenders for work on improvements to the landing facilities at Inishboffin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies also referred to the situation in relation to Arranmore.  All the necessary steps have been taken to facilitate the starting of the ferry service there, including an initial financial provision to <Col N="894" /> ensure that the service gets into operation. In relation to the service to the Aran Islands as raised by Deputy Molloy, I have seen one proposal for the provision of vessels for a service to these islands but that was found to be unsuitable.  I have not seen any other proposal.  If another proposal is put forward, I assume it will go in the first instance to the Minister for Communications and if there are expenditure implications it will come to me.  I can assure the House and the Deputies that any such proposal &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">

      <P>The general penalty for road traffic offences of the kind mentioned by the Deputy, was increased by the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1984 which came into force on 18 July 1984.  The maximum fine for a first offence was increased from £20 to £150 and from £50 to £350 for a second or subsequent offence.</P>
      <P>While I consider the recently increased penalties to be adequate, I am concerned that the increase in pedal cycle travel, particularly in urban areas, has not been matched by improved road behaviour by pedal cyclists.  Breaches of the rules of the road by pedal cyclists are without doubt a contributory factor to the rising number of injuries in recent years.  However to put matters in context, pedal cycle fatalities in 1983 were 46, six more than 1982.  This figure has to be compared with an average of 49 over the last 10 years and a peak of 74 killed in 1971.</P>

    <P>The National Road Safety Association in co-operation with local authorities and <Col N="729" /> the schools is working to promote safe cycling through its national cycling training scheme for young child cyclists.

In the case of motor cycles, the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 1964-1984 provide that a person who has not reached the age of 18 years may only be granted a licence to drive a motor cycle, the engine of which does not exceed 150 c.c.s in cylinder capacity.</P>
      <P>A review of the regulations is currently in progress, but I am not in a position at this stage to indicate what changes if any, may be made.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a question put by Mrs. Lemass MEP in the European Parliament answered by Commissioner Burke on 23 October 1984.</P>
      <P>I have considerable reservations regarding the introduction of an integrated development plan for Dublin, or indeed for any limited geographical area of the country, as I have already indicated in reply to similar questions.</P>
      <P>Ireland is treated as a single region for purposes of Community regional policy and the financial assistance received from the Community under the Community's European Regional Development Fund is used mainly to finance national programmes of infrastructural expenditure which benefit the country as a whole.  The development needs of particular areas of the country must therefore be considered in the context of overall national priorities. Integrated development plans of the type in question would have the effect of diverting scarce financial resources from other expenditure programmes and could lead to serious distortions in the pattern of public expenditure which is based on these priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> In addition the financial participation by the Community in integrated operations of this kind would be by means of existing Community funds and would not result in an increase in assistance to Ireland from those funds.</P>

      <P>The percentages of Gross National Product spend on health in each EEC country in 1982 are set out as follows: Belgium, 6.5 per cent; Denmark, 7.2 per cent; France, 9.3 per cent; Germany, 8.2 per cent; Greece, 4.3 per cent; Ireland, 8.4 per cent; Italy, 7.1 per cent; Luxembourg (1981), 3.6 per cent; Netherlands, 8.6 per cent; United Kingdom, 5.8 per cent. These figures are based on OECD estimates of health expenditure for each country and on gross national products of each country published by the International Monetary Fund.  The most recent Irish figure for gross national product was used.</P>
      <P>The OECD estimate that in order to make it comparable with other OECD countries Ireland's health expenditure figure should be reduced by one-seventh to exclude community welfare and other expenditure which are not included for other countries.  This would reduce the above percentage in respect of Ireland to 7.2 per cent.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit in respect of an incapacity resulting from an alleged accident at work on 22 December 1983. Pending investigations he was allowed disability benefit from 27 December, the fourth day of certified incapacity.  To qualify for injury benefit the claimant is required to satisfy the statutory conditions that the accident arose out of and in the course of insurable employment.</P>
      <P>The claimant indicated that he finished work at 4 p.m. on the date of the accident and that he suffered a road accident after leaving his place of employment.  The claim to injury benefit was disallowed on the grounds that it was considered that the qualifying condition was not satisfied. The question had been taken as an appeal against the decision of the deciding officer.  An appeal form is being issued to the person concerned and when it is returned, the case will be referred to an appeals officer for decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The resulting overpayment of £2,625.25 arose because the person concerned failed to disclose his full means at the original investigation of his claim.

His claim was reviewed on 26 October 1984 and he was assessed with means of £7.65 weekly derived from the profit from his holding, effective from 2 November 1984.  Accordingly, the rate of unemployment assistance payable to him from 2 November 1984 will be reduced to £55.30 weekly the appropriate rate £62.95 less means £7.65.

      <P>The person concerned who is a postal applicant claimed unemployment benefit from 10 September 1984 to 29 September 1984.

No unemployment benefit was payable to him during the three day waiting period from 10 September 1984 to 12 September 1984.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the calculation of means for unemployment assistance purposes in the case of smallholders allowance is made for all expenses incurred in connection with the running of the farm.  Where capital expenditure is incurred in connection with the normal running of the farm as, for example, in the purchase of machinery, the interest repayments arising from this would be allowed as an expense.  Repayments of capital would not be allowed but annual depreciation of the capital asset would be allowable. It is considered that the method of assessment where capital expenditure is incurred is reasonable and there are no plans to alter the method of assessment in these cases.</P>

      <P>There is no record in the Department of a claim to either disability benefit, unemployment benefit or any social assistance payment having been received from the person concerned in his own right.  Under the EEC regulations on social security responsibility for a claim to benefit rests with the member state under whose legislation the claimant was last insurably employed.  If the person concerned was last insurably employed in Great Britain any claim to benefit would fall to be dealt with by the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  These regulations also provide that such a claim must, in the first instance, be made to the designated authority in the country of residence.</P>
      <P>The wife of the person concerned is in receipt of unemployment benefit and is in receipt of an allowance in respect of her husband as an invalided person.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I answered a question by the Deputy on 16 October in relation to promotions made in the force over ten years ago because I assumed from the nature of the question that the Deputy needed the information for some particular purpose.</P>
      <P>As far as the present question is concerned, however, I must adhere to the position traditionally maintained by successive Ministers for Justice that the assignments of members of the Garda Síochána to particular duties and centres, whether in the context of promotions or not, is a matter of internal Garda administration. In the absence of any indication that the information is needed for a specific purpose justifying its provision, I regret that I could not undertake to supply it. Indeed, if the position were otherwise, I could be asked about the location of over 11,000 members of the force.  I might add that when promotions are made to the ranks mentioned in the question they are publicly announced.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> This is an application by the Land Commission for registration of title to lands which had already been vested by the Land Commission in the person concerned.  Applications for registration of title to lands which are already vested by the Land Commission are generally not as urgent as other applications because registration of title takes effect, retrospectively, from the date of vesting.  There is at present an unavoidable delay in completing registration in these cases due to the pressure of other more urgent applications.</P>
      <P>Apart from that general problem, the application which is the subject of the question is in respect of a property which forms part of a block of 35 properties covered by one Land Commission vesting order.  For this reason the application could not be considered in isolation and, in fact, it has been necessary for the Land Registry to raise a number of queries with the Land Commission in respect of the vesting order as a whole.  When the Land Registry has received replies it will proceed as quickly as possible with the application.</P>
