    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension.  I said nothing at all about the quality of Dublin Corporation. I was asked by a journalist about our intentions in regard to local government reform and I said I could make no statement with regard to that but that looking at the structure of the local authorities in <Col N="1959" /> Dublin it is fairly evident that any change in local government structures would be likely to involve changes affecting Dublin County because of the increased population there and the divergence of interests in different parts of the county.  I said that the matter had not come before the Government and that obviously it would take some time before it would be brought to fruition.  The Deputy was probably misled by the form in which my remarks were reported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £64,186,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1984, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education (including Institutions of Science and Art), for certain miscellaneous educational and cultural services and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The total gross provision for 1984 in the five Votes of the education group of Votes as provided for in the revised Estimates volume and taking account of the revised Estimates circulated for the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education, is £965,525,610, including £42,643,610 as appropriations-in-aid. The comparable outturn in 1983 was £894,322,084, including £40,702,630 as appropriations-in-aid.  The amount being sought for 1984 represents an increase of £71,203,526 or 8 per cent over the 1983 outturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £965,525,610 being sought for 1984 includes provision for the cost of the general increases in public service pay provided for in the 1983 public service pay agreement but does not provide for special increases, or for the full parity for public service pensioners provided for in the budget.  Provision for these increases is made in the Vote for increases in remuneration and pensions.  The cost of these increases is estimated at £2,771,300.  In addition, a sum of £14,800,000 is being provided from youth employment levy funds towards the cost of secretarial and pre-employment courses.  The total overall amount being provided for the education services is thus £983,096,910.  The comparable outturn figure for 1983 was £918,637,684, of which £894,322,084 was a charge on the education Votes, a sum of £9,325,600 was charged to the Vote for increases in remuneration and pensions and <Col N="1961" /> £14,990,000 was received from youth employment levy funds.  This overall provision of £983,096,910 represents an increase of £64,459,226.</P>
    <P>The capital provision for 1984 is £82,400,000 including an additional £2 million for primary school building provided for in the budget.</P>
    <P>The gross non-capital provision contained in the £965,525,610 sought in Votes 29 to 33 is £883,125,610.  The corresponding outturn figure for 1983 was £804,874,324.  The provision for 1984 represents an increase of £78,251,286 or 9.75 per cent over the outturn for 1983. The non-capital content of the overall provision of £983,096,910 is £900,696,910.  The corresponding 1983 outturn was £829,189,924.  The overall non-capital provision thus represents an increase of £71,506,986 or 8.62 per cent over 1983.</P>
    <P>The gross provision for pay and pensions for 1984 in Votes 29 to 33 is £726,283,600 or 82.24 per cent of the non-capital provision.  The comparable outturn figures for 1983 were £657,717,104 and 81.7 per cent.  The provision for 1984 represents an increase of £68,566,496 or 10.42 per cent over 1983. The pay and pensions content of the overall non-capital provision, taking account of the Vote for increases in remuneration and pensions and the subvention from youth employment levy funds, of £900,696,910 is £740,194,900 or 82.18 per cent.  The comparable 1983 outturn figures were £678,282,704 and 81.8 per cent. The overall provision for pay and pensions for 1984 represents an increase of £61,912,196 or 9.13 per cent.  The increase in the provision for pay and pensions represents 96 per cent of the total increase.</P>
    <P>The gross provision for non-pay non-capital expenditure in Votes 29 to 33 is £156,842,010 or 17.76 per cent of the non-capital provision.  The comparable outturn for 1983 was £147,157,220.  The provision for 1984 shows an increase of £9,684,790 or 6.58 per cent over 1983. The overall provision, taking account of the subvention from youth employment levy funds, is £160,502,010 or 17.82 per cent of the overall non-capital provision. <Col N="1962" /> The comparable 1983 outturn figures were £150,907,220 and 18.2 per cent. This overall provision represents an increase of £9,594,790 or 6.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The main objective in framing the 1984 Estimates was to maintain the existing level of services.  This objective has been achieved.  The Government recognised, however, that even in the current difficult financial circumstances, provision for some improvements would be made reflecting the commitments in the Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987. The Estimates, accordingly, include over £7 million for improvements including: (I) an increase of £4 per pupil in the rate of capitation grant payable in respect of the running costs of national schools, costing £2.3 million in 1984; (II) a special fund of £0.5 million for primary education in disadvantaged areas; (III) an increase of £8 per pupil in the rate of grant payable to secondary school authorities in lieu of tuition fees, costing £1.6 million in 1984; (IV) an increased provision of £781,000 for in-service training (£146,000), aid for school books (£235,000), and micro-computers in secondary schools (£400,000); (V) an additional £2 million for primary school building and £300,000 for grants to sport organisations provided for in the budget; (VI) £300,000 for the curriculum and examinations board.</P>
    <P>The provision in the vote for the Office of the Minister for Education is for: (A) the administrative costs of the Department; (B) the services in relation to art and culture in the National Library; (C) miscellaneous educational services.</P>
    <P>The net amount being sought this year for this Vote is £64,186,000 an increase of £5,423,000 or 9.2 per cent over the 1983 outturn of £58,763,000, including a charge of £168,500 on the Vote for increases in remuneration and pensions.</P>
    <P>The administrative costs of the Department in 1984 are estimated at £14,331,400 as against an outturn of £13,650,100 in 1983.  This is an increase of 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The functions of the Minister for Education in relation to the National Museum, the Irish Manuscripts Commission, the Chester Beatty Library and Marsh's Library have been transferred to <Col N="1963" /> the Taoiseach with effect from 27 January 1984 and expenditure from that date is being provided for in a revised Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach.  In addition, the Government have decided that the functions of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to school buildings should be transferred to the Minister for Education.  Pending finalisation of the administrative details of this latter transfer the provision for this service continues to be shown in the Vote for Public Works.</P>
    <P>The capital provision for school building is already included in my Department's Votes.</P>
    <P>A sum of £11,045,000 is being provided for higher education grants, an increase of almost £2.5 million or 29 per cent over 1983.  The increase in the cost of this scheme is mainly due to improvements in the means test provisions and in the value of the maintenance element of grants introduced in 1981 by the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy John Boland.  The cost of these grants have risen from £5.49 million in 1982 to £11.045 million in 1984, an increase of 101 per cent.  The number of grant holders has increased from 6,263 in 1981-82 to an estimated 8,650 in 1983-84, an increase of 38 per cent.  When one takes into account the scholarships awarded by vocational education committees and the ESF grants, it is estimated that some 16,760 students at third-level are in receipt of grants.  This represents 35.6 per cent of the total estimated student body at third-level.</P>
    <P>The provision being made in Subhead D.6 for grants to students at Thomond College of Education shows a similar increase &mdash; from £648,000 in 1983 to £942,000.  This reflects an increase in the number of grant-holders and in the value of grants.  A further £654,000 is being provided in subhead C.2 for scholarships, research grants and fellowships.  This is 12.5 per cent more than in 1983.</P>
    <P>Provision is again being made for a grant-in-aid fund for cultural, scientific and educational activities.  The organisations which receive grants from this fund include the Irish Countrywomen's Association; An Cumann le Béaloideas <Col N="1964" /> Éireann; the Music Association of Ireland; Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland; Comhdháil Múinteoirí na Rincí Gaelacha; the National Film Institute; Dublin Institute of Adult Education; An Cumann Scoildramaíochta; Irish Committee of Historical Sciences; Royal Zoological Society of Ireland; People's College; Aontas; An Foras Éireann; the Planetarium, Armagh; Slogadh; and Dublin Philharmonic Society.  For the first time this year, the National Adult Literacy Agency are being given a grant-in-aid.  A sum of £10,000 is included in the overall provision for that agency.</P>
    <P>The provision of £706,000 for international activities shows an increase of 21 per cent.  This provision is for a contribution to the UNESCO budget and incidental expenses of the UNESCO National Commission; costs relating to participation in the European Schools' Day Competition and in the international apprentice competitions; contribution to and scholarships at the College of Europe, Bruges; educational tours to the USA for teachers; expenses in connection with the organisation of any international conference of EEC, Council of Europe, OECD etc., which may be held in the country; scholarships and other expenses arising from participation in the European University Institute, Florence; EEC study visit schemes and exchanges under cultural agreements.  Provision is being included this year for membership by Ireland of the Standing Conference of the International Baccalaureate.</P>
    <P>The provision being made for operating costs of the school transport service is £28,925,000 in 1984 as against £27,762,400 in 1983.  This will allow the current level of service to be maintained without an increase in charges.  A further £70,000 is being provided as capital for the provision of a small number of mini buses.</P>
    <P>A sum of £120,000 is being sought in Subheads E.1 to E.4 for various expenses of the National Library as against £96,630 in 1983.  The increase is mainly for the purchase of books etc.</P>
    <P>The provision in this Vote is for Primary Education, including national school teacher superannuation.  The net <Col N="1965" /> amount sought is £350,847,000, an increase of £28,915,180 or 9 per cent over the 1983 outturn of £321,931,820 including a charge of £6,168,000 on the Vote for increases in remuneration and pensions.</P>
    <P>Salaries, allowances and superannuation of national teachers account for £311,791,000 or 85 per cent of the gross total provision for the Vote.</P>
    <P>At present approximately 20,650 national teachers are employed in 3,400 schools.  The provision sought reflects the full year cost of an additional 150 teachers appointed in autumn 1983 and includes provision for an additional 200 teachers in 1984.  Recoupment of costs incurred in the employment of substitutes during teachers' absences will cost an estimated £4,630,000 in 1984.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, the provision sought in Subhead C.1 for salaries and allowances of national teachers has been for the gross amount less 5 per cent superannuation contributions.  For 1984 the amount provided for is the gross amount and the 5 per cent contributions are being included as appropriations-in-aid in Subhead F. While this does not affect the net amount sought for the Vote as a whole, it does give a clearer picture of the cost of salaries and pensions.</P>
    <P>The gross provision for national teachers' superannuation is £43,378,000.  This is offset by appropriations-in-aid of £15,041,000.  Pensions are currently being paid to 4,778 former teachers as well as to spouses and children of former teachers.</P>
    <P>A sum of £13,060,000 is being provided in subhead C.5.  This includes provision for an increase of £4 per pupil from £17 to £21 in the rate of capitation grant payable towards the running costs of national schools which will cost an estimated £2.3 million in 1984.  In addition, a special fund of £500,000 to aid primary pupils who are educationally disadvantaged is being established this year.</P>
    <P>A sum of £28,750,000 is being provided for the building, equipping and furnishing of national schools, including the additional £2 million provided for in the budget.  Projects for which grants may be paid include the provision of new schools <Col N="1966" /> in new housing areas, additional classrooms in existing schools, essential facilities such as sanitation, heating, lighting and furniture in existing schools, new schools where necessary for mentally and physically handicapped children, upgrading of existing schools to meet modern requirements and replacement of prefabricated accommodation.</P>
    <P>A sum of £6,677,000 is being sought for the non-capital costs of the colleges of education for primary teachers.  A further £944,000 is being provided for loans and grants to students of the colleges.</P>
    <P>The net amount being sought for post-primary education in 1984 is £405,499,000, an increase of £23,207,310 or 6.1 per cent over the 1983 outturn of £382,241,690.</P>
    <P>Pay and pensions account for £322,709,000 or 75 per cent of the gross £432,401,000 being provided.</P>
    <P>A sum of £161,747,000 is being provided for incremental salary and allowances of secondary teachers.  There are currently 11,900 secondary teachers in receipt of incremental salary.</P>
    <P>A sum of £93,559,000 is being provided in subhead A.2 as grants to vocational education committees as compared with an expenditure of £92,913,490 in 1983. The 1984 provision does not include, however, a sum of £14 million from Youth Employment Agency funds which will be made available to vocational education committees towards the cost of secretarial and pre-employment courses, £2.2 million more than in 1983.  In addition, the provision of capital for vocational school building as a voted capitalservice since 1 January 1983 has reduced substantially the loan repayments to be made by VECs.  Direct comparison between the grant being provided in this subhead for 1984 and the 1983 outturn does not, therefore, reflect accurately the increase in funds at the disposal of the committees.</P>
    <P>A sum of £35,751,000 is being provided in subhead D.1 in respect of the running costs of comprehensive and community schools compared with an outturn of £29,964,940 in 1983.  Provision is also being made for a subvention from Youth <Col N="1967" /> Employment Levy Funds of £800,000 in 1984 against £1,600,000 in 1983.  The total amount being made available for the service is thus £36,551,000 as against £31,564,940, an increase of £4,986,060 or 15.8 per cent.  This increased provision reflects the continuing growth of the number of pupils in these schools and the opening of a number of new schools.</P>
    <P>In addition to the grants to vocational education committees provided for in subhead A.2, which are mainly in respect of second-level education, a sum of £51,569,000 is being provided in subhead D.2 towards the running costs of regional technical colleges and technological and other colleges run by VECs.  The corresponding figure for 1983 was £46,870,230 of which £1.59 million came from Youth Employment Levy Funds.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, money was provided in subhead F.1 to enable payments to be made to the Secondary Teachers' Pension Fund to meet any shortfall between income from teachers' contributions and the expenditure on pensions and other awards.  As the fund has not had capital assets for some time, it has been decided, with the agreement of the Ministers for Finance and the Public Service, that it should be discontinued, that the cost of pensions and other awards should be made a direct charge on the vote and that pension contributions should be appropriated in aid of the Vote.</P>
    <P>The gross provision being made for secondary teachers' superannuation is thus much greater than the provision which would have been made if the fund were being continued but the net provision sought, after taking account of contributions being shown as appropriations-in-aid, remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>A sum of £29,064,500 is being provided in Subhead C for six different schemes of grants to secondary school authorities, an increase of 10 per cent over 1983.  The grant in lieu of tuition fees is being increased by £8 per pupil from £92 per pupil to £100.  Approximately £400,000 is being included in the provision for science and other equipment grants for microcomputers in secondary schools. <Col N="1968" /> The provision for grants towards the cost of school books is being increased by 11.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The capital provision in this Vote is £37,600,000.  The provision for secondary, vocational and community-comprehensive schools is £33.2 million and includes provision for expenditure on construction, furniture, equipment and fees, and for sites other than secondary school sites.</P>
    <P>The investment in post-primary school building forms part of the ongoing programme designed to meet the increase in enrolments arising through population growth as well as population shifts; replacing unsatisfactory and uneconomic accommodation; and meeting the backlog of places for which short-term arrangements were made, mainly in the form of temporary prefabricated accommodation.</P>
    <P>About 113,000 permanent places &mdash; 73,000 new places and 40,000 replacement places &mdash; were provided in the period 1966 to 1982 against a growth in enrolments in that period of 176,000 students. In the period to the end of the decade it is estimated that, subject to the availability of funds about 80,000 places will be required &mdash; 30,000 to meet new enrolment growth, 20,000 to meet the backlog of places for which temporary arrangements were made and 30,000 replacement places either in the form of major upgrading or replacement where use of existing accommodation is no longer economic.  About 13,000 places &mdash; 7,400 new places and 5,600 replacement places &mdash; were provided in 1983.</P>
    <P>The provision of £4.4 million for regional and other technical and specialist colleges is mainly related to costs arising from final accounts and work on ongoing projects, as well as projects in the course of planning, namely, Tralee RTC and Colleges of Technology at Bolton Street, Kevin Street and Bishop Street and minor capital projects.</P>
    <P>The net amount sought for residential homes and special schools is £3,740,000 an increase of £716,690 or 23.7 per cent over the corresponding outturn of £3,023,310 for 1983.  Arising from the recommendations of the Task Force on <Col N="1969" /> Child Care Services, the provision for grants to residential homes which are certified industrial schools under the Children's Act 1908, has been transferred to the Vote for Health with effect from 1 January 1984.  The expenditure in 1983 on the services transferred was £615,000. Subheads A and G are being retained in this Vote with a reduced provision as my Department have retained responsibility for one school which is a certified reformatory school for girls.</P>
    <P>Subhead B provides for the operational costs of the institutions for young offenders &mdash; Finglas Children's Centre, Scoil Ard Mhuire, Lusk, St. Joseph's Special School, Clonmel, Trinity House, Lusk and Cuan Mhuire Assessment Centre, Whitehall.  A sum of £730,000 is being provided for capital development in respect of work at Trinity House, Lusk, St. Joseph's Clonmel and other minor works.</P>
    <P>A sum of £98,660,000 is being sought for the Vote for Higher Education which provides for grants-in-aid of an tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas in respect of its own general expenses and the current and capital costs of designated institutions of higher education, and of the Dublin Dental Hospital, the Cork Hospitals' Board and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.</P>
    <P>A sum of £448,000 is being provided as a grant-in-aid of the general expenses of the Higher Education Authority, an increase of 5 per cent on the 1983 outturn of £428,000.  A sum of £80,309,000 is being provided as a grant-in-aid to the Higher Education Authority towards the general non-capital costs of the universities and other designated institutions of higher education which are funded through the HEA.</P>
    <P>A sum of £15,000,000 is being provided in the Vote for capital costs.  £14.85 million is for projects funded through the Higher Education Authority and is intended to cover building and equipping costs in relation to Phase II at the NIHE, Limerick, building work on Phase II of the library at UCD and on an extension to the Albert College building for NIHE, Dublin, equipment renewals and small capital projects; £150,000 is being provided <Col N="1970" /> in respect of third-level institutions not funded by the HEA, mainly for equipment and furniture.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn to some general educational issues.  I do not propose to refer in detail to the Programme for Action or the Curriculum and Examinations Board which were the highlights of my first year in office.  The House will recall that on 6 March last, I opened a debate on the Programme for Action &mdash; a debate which stands adjourned.  I do not intend to go over the same ground. Instead, I propose to address myself to a couple of major areas.</P>
    <P>First, I want to talk about parents and their role in education.  I do so because their role is crucial.  The process of education takes place as much in the home as in the school.  The pre-school years of any child are as important as the later formative years in the school environment. The educational process should be a co-operative venture between parents and teachers.  Parents are an essential element in education since they are legally responsible for their children's education.  Our own Constitution lays down that the parent is the primary educator.</P>
    <P>Increased formal involvement of parents should be an essential feature of educational planning.  The main parties in education are, of course, the churches, the State, the teachers and the parents. Up to ten years ago, the parents were sleeping partners in the process.  Since then, they have become organised and have developed a new dynamism in place of their former passive role.  They have established national parent organisations and have become participants in school management.</P>
    <P>They are now poised to make their full contribution to discussion and decision-making in education.  For my part, I was most impressed with their contribution to the preparation of the Programme for Action.  It was of a very high professional standard.</P>
    <P>What has amazed me is the fact that it has taken so long to recognise in a formal way the involvement of parents in education. I was not long in office before I realised their potential.  Accordingly, for <Col N="1971" /> the first time ever, I involved them in our educational planning.  The national bodies were invited to participate in the preparation of The Programme for Action. The Working Party in my Department which helped me to prepare the programme met them on two occasions.</P>
    <P>I have stressed in the programme the need for parents to organise themselves with a representative parents' council.  I have promised that I shall facilitate the setting up of a council in any way that I can and that I shall continue the consultative process with the new council when established.  Towards this end preliminary meetings with the existing national bodies of parents have been held to discuss the setting up of a council.</P>
    <P>It is important that the council should be representative of all parents and not just those of one type of school, secondary, community-comprehensive, vocational or primary.  I would like to emphasise the fact that the success of a National Parents Council will depend in large part on the effectiveness of parental involvement at the level of the individual school. Ideally I would like to see the existence of a parents council in each school in the country.  Such councils would then form the basis from which to elect representatives to regional committees from which the national body would be drawn.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that parents are represented on the boards of management of primary and community schools.  I am now arranging for parents to be represented on boards of management of comprehensive schools.  None of us in this House needs to be reminded of the efforts and the sacrifices which Irish parents have made down the years for the education of their children.  I look forward in the years to come to a constructive role being played by them.</P>
    <P>Now I want to turn to the area of third level education.  One of the greatest problems facing any Minister for Education in this country up to the end of the century is how to cater for the demand for third level education.  The increase in enrolments at primary level is tapering off and the rate of increase in enrolments at second level is also declining.  On purely <Col N="1972" /> demographic grounds alone, therefore, the pressure for places is moving up the educational ladder and will be intense at third level for the remainder of the century. This pressure is accentuated at present, and will be for some time to come, by the employment situation with very many able young people who might hitherto have transferred from school to employment in the public services or other major semi-State or private utilities being unable to do so and opting instead to pursue their education and acquire more marketable qualifications in one or other of our third level institutions. Despite the daunting problems, the Government are determined to provide, as far as possible, third level education for all those seeking it.</P>
    <P>If the most recent projection of enrolments in third level education over the rest of the decade prove to be correct, the number of students would rise from about 47,000 in 1982-83 to about 67,000 in 1990-91, an increase of 20,000.  These projections are based on the application of current participation rates to increasing student numbers in the senior cycle of second level and do not postulate any change in the transfer rate from leaving certificate to third level education.  If the latter transfer rate were to increase for whatever reason, then the projected increase in third level enrolments would, of course, be even greater still.  These numbers, tentative though as projections they must be, give us a good idea of the task which faces us if we are to provide third level education for as many as possible of our young people who have the ability to benefit from it.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to providing third level education for as many qualified young people as possible, but must have regard to the level of resources likely to be available.  If we had endless resources, our problems would be solved relatively easily, but I am convinced that given good management and the co-operation of all the interests involved we can cope with our difficulties in a way which will not militate against the prospects of our young people and the contribution which they in turn can <Col N="1973" /> make to the development of this country in the new technological era.</P>
    <P>The development of the regional technical colleges, the colleges of technology, the national institutes for higher education, Thomond College and The National College of Art and Design has transformed the face of third level education in Ireland.  The intake into these colleges is now greater than the intake into the universities although the total numbers of students in the latter is still greater because of the longer average duration of courses.  When one also takes into account the science and technology elements in university courses, particularly the engineering, science and commerce departments, one appreciates the true extent of the development of science and technology in our third level education system.  Figures published some time ago by the Higher Education Authority show that in 1980, for example, over 40 per cent of all new entrants to third level education enrolled in the combined fields of science and technology and a further 20 per cent enrolled in commerce.</P>
    <P>The point I wish to make is that there has been a tremendously high investment over recent years in science and technology in the third level system.  Not only that, but all of the massive proposed new investment over the rest of the decade is also in that area, and none of the projects at present before the Department relates to the provision of additional arts or social science places.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to emphasise this point because many people still seem to suffer from the after-effects of the traditional image of the third level system.  In saying this I wish to make it clear that I am not in any way denigrating the value of a good liberal arts education; indeed, I was very struck recently by the contribution of an expert from a Nordic country to an international symposium on third level education in which it became clear that they are deeply concerned about over specialisation at undergraduate level and are coming round to the view that the thing to aim at is a broad general groundwork to which specialisms can easily be added later, different specialisms at different times if necessary.  If the <Col N="1974" /> thinking underlying that trend becomes general, the wheel will certainly have come full cycle.</P>
    <P>As indeed also with second level education, there is a need for closer links between the third level institutions and the world of work.  A good deal has already been accomplished in this area and links have been forged between the industrial and commercial world with a number of our third level institutions. This kind of linkage is mutually beneficient; the needs of the business world become known to the institutions and have an influence on their courses, while the business world in turn can use the institutions for research and development work and sponsor the kind of developments in the institutions which would have a spin-off for the business world.  In this context, I would like to pay tribute to the work of the NBST with which my Department and the HEA have established good relationships and the various schemes mounted by the NBST have been of great value to the third level education system in the field of science and technology.</P>
    <P>A good example of co-operation between higher education institutions and industry sponsored by the NBST is the very successful development by the Dairy Science Faculty in UCC and a County Cork co-operative in the processing of cheese for export.  Another project involved the NIHE in Limerick and the development there, with funding from the NBST, of an automatic power supply test system.  The success of this venture led to the formation of a new company to produce and market the product.  The company is now selling automatic power supply test systems in Ireland, the UK and the US.</P>
    <P>An expanded higher education-industry links scheme sponsored by the NBST and the IDA with a current budget of £1.5 million was initiated last September and a number of joint ventures will benefit under this scheme.</P>
    <P>There is not, perhaps, a great public awareness of the extent to which our third level institutions are in tune with developments in modern technology and are co-operating with industry in this field <Col N="1975" /> but this is, in fact, a very important and growing feature of the higher education scene.  The National Microelectronics Centre attached to University College, Cork, is a good example of what I mean. It has twin objectives of, on the one hand, educating engineers to work in the microelectronics industry and, on the other, serving as a centralised research and development laboratory where co-operative university and industry projects can be carried out.  I recall that at the opening of the centre my colleague, the Minister for Industry, pointed out that the existence of this centre was a determining factor in attracting some major electronics firms to Ireland.  This is a demonstration of the most practical kind of the important role to be played by our third level institutions in the industrial development of the country.</P>
    <P>Plassey Technological Park, attached to the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick, is providing a major resource attractive to high level international technological investment and research.  The park is operated with a flexibility which ensures that all participating bodies derive maximum benefit from a sharing of facilities and resources. Experience in other countries has indicated that the concept of a technological park alongside a major third level technological institution has been of great benefit to the institution and to the organisations sited in the park.  I am confident that the Plassey development will prove equally beneficial for those involved.  The Faculty of Engineering in UCD, conscious of the importance of maintaining strong links with the industrial world, has plans for the development of a university-industry centre to be sited in Belfield.  I mention these developments as examples to demonstrate that our third level institutions are not academic backwaters but are playing a major role in the technological development of our society.</P>
    <P>My Department have under consideration at present proposals from the IVEA as to how the regional technical colleges might make a greater contribution in this area, particularly in relation to the development <Col N="1976" /> of the regions in which they are situated.  I hope shortly to introduce a more flexible system which will enable the RTCs within the limits of the available resources and without impinging on their primary function to make a greater contribution to research and development work in their regions.</P>
    <P>The total current provision for the designated institutions of the Higher Education Authority in Vote 33 of the 1984 Estimates is £80,309,000 in addition to which a sum of the order of £1 million will be provided out of Vote 49 &mdash; the vote for increases in remuneration and pensions &mdash; for these institutions.  The Department of Agriculture Vote also contains provision of over £9 million for the agriculture-related faculties of UCD and UCC.  The provision in Vote 31 for the regional technical colleges is £51,569,000 and the provision for grants to the colleges of education in Vote 30 is £6,927,000.  The total current provision for higher education is, therefore, in excess of £150 million.  Given a total full-time student population in the present year of around 50,000 it will be seen that the current State expenditure per student is of the order of £3,000.</P>
    <P>The level of fees charged to students varies considerably as between the different types of institutions and even within institutions depending on the course being undertaken.  The general fee level in the universities now is about £800, but it is much less in the technological sector despite a very substantial increase in fees in that sector for the current academic year.  I am conscious of the fact that fees have been increased in recent years by amounts well in excess of inflation, and I realise that such increases have placed a heavy burden on students and on their parents.  It will be evident from the figures I have quoted above that fees still form less than a fifth of the overall cost of third-level education.  In the year 1982-83 the percentage in the HEA sector was about 17 per cent, and less than that in the technological sector. The increase in fees in the current academic year and for next year will increase that percentage.  The dilemma facing me as Minister for Education in <Col N="1977" /> developing a fees policy is the extent to which fees could be made to meet a greater proportion of the overall costs and yet be at a level which would not place an intolerable burden on students and their parents.  It was these two, possibly conflicting, factors which led the Government to consider the question of a loan scheme for third level education. Decisions on this issue cannot be taken lightly, involving, as they do, questions such as the level of fees, the provision of capital, levels of interest, debt burdens on students and parents, repayment periods and several other matters of principle and practicability.  The Government are not unaware of the fact that many parents are already borrowing from the banks on a personal basis in order to finance third level education for their children.  I am not at present, therefore, in a position to make a definitive statement on the question of a loan scheme other than to say that it is one which is receiving the most careful consideration.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government have a good record in relation to student support in the context of the schemes for the provision of higher education grants and scholarships.  For example, the provision in the 1984 Estimates for the higher education grants scheme is over £11 million, as compared to about £4 million before the introduction, for the academic year 1981-82, of major improvements to the scheme by the Coalition Government. Even more significant increases have taken place in the scheme for the provision of vocational education scholarships in the same period.</P>
    <P>In 1980-81, the year before the much improved scheme of higher education grants was introduced by Deputy John Boland, when Minister for Education, there was a total of 9,852 students or 26.1 per cent of the student body in receipt of a grant or a scholarship.  For the present academic year 1983-84, the numbers have grown to 16,760 or 35.6 per cent of the student body.  I refer to these statistics not to make a political point but to point out that over one in three of students at third level has their fees paid for them and the vast majority of them also receive a maintenance allowance.  These students <Col N="1978" /> are cushioned against any increase in fees.  It is well to bear this fact in mind when people complain about fee increases at third level.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provision of new or improved accommodation at third level, I pointed out in the <i>Programme for Action in Education,</i> that a number of projects were on hands in my Department. Work is proceeding on the second phase of development at the NIHE in Limerick and on UCD's new library in Belfield.  Planning of a new Regional Technical College in Tralee is at an advanced stage and building work is due to commence in the autumn.  Major developments are also in train for the colleges of technology in Bolton Street and Kevin Street, the college of marketing and design and the college of commerce, Rathmines.  Consultants have been appointed and planning is proceeding on regional technical colleges in Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Dún Laoghaire.  The proposals for a new school of engineering for UCD and a clinical sciences complex for TCD at the St. James site, planning for both of which is at an advanced stage, will be considered in the context of the Public Capital Programme for the years 1985-88.</P>
    <P>The action programme draws attention to the need for the third level system to become more cost effective and to improve productivity.  If we are to cater for greatly increased numbers of students at third level, we need to adopt a twin-pronged approach, to provide such additional places as we can afford and particularly to increase investment in equipment and technological hardware generally, but, secondly and no less importantly, to improve the cost effectiveness of our institutions and to spread available resources fairly over institutions and courses.  I appreciate that people in the institutions can make comparisons with other countries and argue that third-level education is achieved relatively cheaply in this country, but we have not the resources of those countries and we have proportionately a far higher percentage of our population in the younger age groups.  We need, therefore, to look at our institutions and to see in <Col N="1979" /> what way, without sacrifice of quality, we can make them more efficient and more cost effective.  The action programme put forward a number of proposals in this area, and these will now be taken up by my Department with the interests involved.  I have on previous occasions expressed my appreciation of the contribution which these interests made to the deliberations of the working party, and I look forward with confidence to their full co-operation in considering and implementing the various proposals made in the action programme.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of my intention to reactivate the question of providing legislation in regard to the structure of our Irish universities.  The parent Act, The Irish Universities Act, has now been on the statute book for more than three-quarters of a century without any major changes being made in the legislation. What were in 1908 small colleges have now grown to be major institutions in their own right.  The question must be asked if the NUI constituent colleges would now benefit by each being established as a university in its own right. Special consideration will have to be given to the place of the recognised colleges of the NUI that is to say the colleges of education, the Royal College of Surgeons and, in particular, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  I propose, as soon as possible, to initiate discussions with all the interests involved with a view to evolving structures which are more appropriate to the present-day requirements of university education.</P>
    <P>In speaking of legislation, I should refer also to my intention of amending the Vocational Education Act of 1930. This will be necessary, in any event, to deal with such mundane matters as the payment of travelling and subsistence expenses for committee members, but much more fundamental matters arise for consideration.  These include the enlargement of committees to provide for teacher representation and the position of regional technical colleges.  The management of the RTCs is provided through sub-committees of the VECs under section 21 of the Act.  There is a body of <Col N="1980" /> opinion that this management structure is inappropriate for these institutions and that a structure more in line with that of other third-level institutions ought to be established.  This is a matter on which no decisions have been made at this stage but it is one which, I think, merits further consideration and I look forward with interest to hearing the views of the appropriate interests on it.</P>
    <P>The management boards of the RTCs as presently constituted are restricted in membership to 12 persons.  This provides a particular problem in relation to student representation on the boards.  I have stated that my aim is to have student representation on the governing boards of all third-level institutions, and any review of the 1930 Vocational Education Act will involve a resolution of the problem of student representation on the boards of RTCs.  Student representation exists already in respect of the governing bodies of the NUI constituent colleges, but only by way of Ministerial nomination. A review of the university legislation, which I mentioned earlier, will deal also with the question of students being represented on the governing bodies in their own right.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Action in Education, I dealt at some length with another important area of third-level education, that is teacher training.  I indicated that it is proposed to undertake a comprehensive review of the structure and content of the Bachelor of Education degree courses for primary teachers.  The professional training of second-level teachers too will be reviewed in consultation with the appropriate interests.  In a society which is constantly changing it is imperative that our schools should reflect these changes and be in a position to educate each generation of its pupils to meet the demands of modern society. It is relatively easy to make adjustments in the initial training programmes so as to produce what we might term &ldquo;modern&rdquo; teachers.  The fact is, however, that following initial training many teachers spend more than 40 years in service. When one considers the developments that take place in all areas of life in such a period, it becomes clear that teachers <Col N="1981" /> must be given opportunities throughout their career of partaking in refresher courses.  It is for this reason that so much emphasis is placed throughout the Programme for Action on in-service courses. There is no doubt that in the past the provision of in-service courses has been less than adequate.  In-service education is, of course, quite costly, particularly if undertaken during normal school periods when replacement teaching would need to be provided.  Nevertheless it is a facility which needs to be greatly improved, and it will be a major plank in my policy for teacher training.</P>
    <P>I have discussed two major issues &mdash; the parents' council and third-level development &mdash; because time has not allowed me to develop these on previous occasions when I have spoken in this House. It is important also, however, in the interests of balance, to remind Deputies that the Programme for Action in Education sets out our priorities in all the areas of education.  I have spoken before, for instance, of our making primary education the major priority for new investment, with pupils who suffer educational disadvantage being the major target for extra help.</P>
    <P>The crucial area of curricular reform at both primary and post-primary levels is under way, principally being addressed in the work of the Curriculum and Examinations Board</P>
    <P>The increases in capitation grant at primary level this year were the highest ever granted in a single year and are a very real expression of our commitment to this sector.  The increases in grants to secondary schools also reflect our recognition of their financial needs.</P>
    <P>Much work is going on in implementing the many proposals in the action programme. I expect to be in a position to give a progress report on this in the near future.</P>
    <P>In the earlier part of my speech, I outlined the main details of the Estimates for 1984.  The gross provision for the education services is now approaching the £1,000 million mark.  The increase in the non-capital provision in the group of Votes for education is 9.75 per cent compared with 1983 while inflation is <Col N="1982" /> expected to be less than 9 per cent.  This is a measure of the commitment of the Government to the provision of the best possible education for our young people.</P>
    <P>The percentage of GNP which this country devotes to education is the second highest of the EEC countries.  It is estimated that 6.7 per cent of GNP was spent on education in 1983 compared with 5.7 per cent in 1978.  The amount of GNP spent on education is the objective criterion on which to judge the performance and the commitment of a Government. By any standards, the performance of my Government ranks high.</P>
    <P>In evaluating the capital budget for education, it is necessary to remind ourselves that, because of our burgeoning population, we as a community spend a significantly large proportion of our total education budget on school building and equipment.  This is an aspect of our financial structure that is ignored.  The facts are that, compared with other EEC countries, we devote a far greater percentage of our financial resources to capital spending.  In 1978, for instance, our capital expenditure as a percentage of current expenditure on education was 15 per cent compared with a European average of 8.9 per cent.  The United Kingdom spent 6.9 per cent on capital projects. When comparing with other countries expenditure on current services many people conveniently overlook the fact, first, that we have to have a large capital budget because of our growing school population and, secondly, that most other EEC countries have a much higher income per capita.</P>
    <P>I have spent some time today discussing the spending of £983 million.  Where has this money come from?  It has come from the men and women at work in this country who are paying extremely high rates of tax, whose disposable income is much smaller than it should be.  Whether or not they have children in the education system, they massively support it.  They pour money into the school experience of each child or young person.  It is my job as Minister to direct the spending of that vast amount of money so that the children and young people will be the beneficiaries.  A huge amount of this <Col N="1983" /> money pays teachers' salaries; a much smaller amount goes to provide the physical facilities and equipment in which those children and young people are educated.  Sheer growth of numbers alone forces an increase in spending on education every year, in salaries of new teachers and new buildings.  Any increase on top of this means, quite simply, a further burden on the taxpayer - either by increased taxation or further debt payments: the alternative to this increased taxation is to find the additional funds from some other area of education or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Anybody from the opposite side of the House, therefore, who intends to call for more this and more that, increased facilities here or more teachers there, should bear in mind that it is no longer credible in 1984 to behave as if there was no tomorrow.  I suggest that this Estimates debate could be conducted in a more realistic manner if suggestions for increased spending were accompanied by a clear statement of where the resources will come from.  It is no use sidestepping the issue by protesting that this is the job of Government.  Every Member of this House is well aware of the financial situation and the taxpayers' difficulties.  It is opportunistic to pretend otherwise.  The challenge is to treat education, the general public and, indeed this House, as seriously as they deserve.</P>
    <P>I commend the Estimates to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with much pleasure that I reply to the Estimate for the very important Department of Education. I should like to refer first to something the Minister said towards the end of her speech because I consider her remarks to be in the form of a sermon. Sermons have their place, and that usually is in churches.  I decry very much the tone of the Minister's remarks.  She said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody from the opposite side of the House, therefore, who intends to call for more this and more that, increased facilities here or more teachers there, should bear in mind that it is <Col N="1984" /> no longer credible in 1984 to behave as if there was no tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>It is opportunistic to pretend otherwise. The challenge is to treat education, the general public and, indeed, this House as seriously as they deserve.</P>
    <P>I take that as a reflection first on myself in my portfolio as Opposition spokesman on education, on my years in education, my standing and my record in that respect, and also on the record of Fianna Fáil in what they have given to education down through the years.  I regard my role as seriously as anyone else regards his or her role in public life.</P>
    <P>Sermonising does not sit well on anyone, least of all on one who should be setting a headline.  I am well able to manage my own affairs and to see to the duties and responsibilities that have been vested in me.  My record can stand up to any scrutiny, as can any remarks I make in relation to education.</P>
    <P>Lest the Minister should think that in &ldquo;calling for this or that&rdquo; I am dealing in fantasy, I would recommend to her, to the Government and to the House the proposals contained in the report of the National Planning Board in respect of the years 1984 to 1987.  The Board say &mdash; recommendation 4 &mdash; that they agree with the general thrust of the recommendation in the Programme for Action and recommend that because of the demographic pressures on the education system there should be no cutback in overall public expenditure in this area in the years to 1987.  I am not dealing with fantasy or speaking irresponsibly.  That board was set up by the Taoiseach.  In early December I spoke on a similar debate and said that because of the increased consumer demand for education &mdash; by that I meant the increased numbers of young people entering the system &mdash; we could not afford to cut back in real terms on either current or capital spending.</P>
    <P>The statistic that we have the second highest GNP spending on education in Europe should have been taken in conjunction with the fact that we have by far <Col N="1985" /> the greatest number of young people in the educational system.  Many of the points which were put forward are selective and do not show the whole picture. That is probably the prerogative of Ministers but when it is coupled with sermonising it jars and there is something dishonest about it.  It would have been more honest if the Minister said that we had the second highest GNP spending on education and then said that we had by far the greatest number of young people in the educational system and gave the figures for those attending primary, second and third levels as a proportion of the total population.  She should then have compared that with other European countries.  I do not make this point to be cantankerous but just to put the record straight.</P>
    <P>The Coalition provision for capital and current spending is shortsighted and shabby.  I might not agree with all the recommendations made by the board but I agree with that one on education.</P>
    <P>In some instances services have decreased, in others they have remained static or diminished.  The capital programmes are seriously affected.  I applaud the Minister and the Department for the increases they have granted. The increases were shown in large print and were expanded on by the Minister. When it came to the decreases and cutbacks we were given a statement of what was spent and that was all.  I take it as my right to give the other side of the picture. I would be failing in my duty if I did not do so.  The most severely affected areas are vocational and technological, the provision of equipment and the allocation of guidance, remedial and specialist teachers. There has been an outright attack on third-level institutes.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a disturbing pattern of Ministerial statements which seem to give an air of hope and optimism. I agree with optimism and hope but we should not raise people's expectations too high.  The presentation of the action plan for education and the way it was heralded in led many people to believe that all the educational ills would be righted.  That is not so.  I have spent many years in education.  In the past five <Col N="1986" /> months many people told me that they felt this was a plan for action and not a list of objectives.  Many of the plans were not costed nor was it stated when they would be implemented.  Any teacher could have listed many of the ills in the educational system.  It is up to the Government to ensure that those ills are corrected and that shortfalls are made up.</P>
    <P>The Curriculum Development Board was launched with high hopes.  I am totally committed to it.  If I was made Minister I would encourage my party to give the utmost support to the board and give them the necessary backing to allow them continue their work.  However, if it does not have the goodwill of practising teachers it will be a non-event.  I know that there is goodwill towards the board. I ask the Minister not to raise expectations or advance the cause without committing the resources.  The Minister may ask where she will get the resources but I say that is her job.  There should be more teachers on the main committee and sub-committees of the board.</P>
    <P>I have met young people who say that there is no longer an intermediate certificate examination.  I do not blame the Minister for that kind of heady optimism. I was in a Dublin school recently and spoke to young students in second year.  They said they would not be doing the intermediate certificate, there were not set timetables, there would be different teachers and subjects.  I said I was all for change.  They said that the Minister, Mrs. Hussey, had told them all about it. I asked if she had visited them and they said: &ldquo;no, we read it in the papers&rdquo;.  The response to the board from members of the Opposition, teachers and students was one of relief and joy that it had got off the ground, although on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis at first.  Do not lead the people to believe that changes will be made but show the rate of progress which can be made and when the first target will be achieved.  Then you move on from that. It is unkind and unjust to lead people to believe that changes will be made when that cannot happen.</P>
    <P>Over the past 18 months the Minister quite rightly has been speaking about the <Col N="1987" /> need for girls and young women to take their proper place in society, but to do this they must be able to take certain subjects at second level.  The all-party Committee on Women's Rights have spent 12 months investigating education and have come up with certain proposals. I do not want to pre-empt the interim report because the chairman, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, will be making a report to the Dáil very soon.  All our findings indicate that the schools are not preparing girls to take their proper role in industry, in public life, or other walks of life.  The subjects which would best equip them to go into management or to take up scientific or technological positions are not available in the schools because the principals must give priority to the hard core subjects.  Subjects such as music, art, continental languages, apart from French, technological subjects, science and so on, will be curtailed because of the Government's pupil teacher ratio policy.</P>
    <P>It is fine to stand up and make a speech and to lead people to believe that now is the time for girls to take their place in society and for young women to study certain subjects, but the reality is that girls cannot take carpentry, woodwork, technical drawing, chemistry, higher mathematics and those other subjects. The teachers are not available because the principal has to make very hard choices.  No amount of window dressing or subscribing to equality can hide that practical fact.</P>
    <P>I speak as a current member of a vocational education committee.  Many members of such committees are confused and worried about the circular letters and guidelines issued on teacher allocations. Some of them are confused as to whether the allocations they got refer to the special arrangement they have with teachers who are servicing other second level schools in their areas.  There has been a cutback in real terms in teacher allocations to vocational schools as evidenced in the correspondence and circular letters which were read out at VEC meetings.  This will have a very adverse effect on vocational education in general <Col N="1988" /> because this is the type of schooling where these subjects are more practically expressed.  I ask the Minister to bear this in mind.  Perhaps she would ensure that the lines would be more firmly drawn and that the teacher allocation could at least remain at last year's level.</P>
    <P>I was at the INTO and ASTI conferences in Galway last Easter but I was not there the morning the Minister made her speech.  She said in her statement: &ldquo;My Department is pressing ahead with school building provision as a matter of urgency and it is my intention that this effort will be maintained.&rdquo; Regrettably, however, this is not supported by the Estimates which have been laid before this House. The provision for national school buildings, equipment and furnishings at £26.75 million is a reduction of 6 per cent on the 1983 outturn.  The real extent of the slow-down in the rate of modernisation of our primary schools and the replacement of some of the nineteenth century schools is apparent when one compares the current estimates for national school buildings, equipment and furnishings of £26.75 million with the actual amount spent in 1981 of £30 million.  These are the figures to which I referred earlier but which were not spelled out in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to capital expenditure on schools is even bleaker in the post-primary education area where there is a cut from £45 million to £37.6 million or a reduction of 16 per cent.  This is particularly heavy in the case of vocational schools, whose capital expenditure allocation has been cut by one-third from £15.6 million to £10.5 million, and is also severe in respect of secondary schools where the capital allocation is cut from £15.3 million to £12.7 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister has held the increase in the total vote for post-primary education to 5 per cent but this hides a very disturbing trend.  For instance, the Estimates show an increase in running costs for schools under the direct control of the Department, ranging from 12 per cent to 16 per cent, or an average of 10 per cent above the general level of increases.  This has been partly compensated for by the reduction of 12 per cent in the Estimates <Col N="1989" /> for the training of secondary and vocational teachers and a reduction of 16 per cent in the proposed capital expenditure on post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the capital investment in our school buildings is also reflected in the allocation in the higher education Vote, which has been reduced from £17 million in 1982 to £14.5 million in 1983 to £14 million in 1984.  Higher education generally seems to be losing out very much in the total education sector.  The total Vote for higher education in 1981 was £84 million.  In three years this has been increased by only £12 million to £96 million, despite a 50 per cent increase in the cost of living in the meantime.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to comprehend a reduction in the non-capital grant and aid to University College, Dublin, and University College, Galway.  Either they enjoy super-efficient management or can we expect a substantial hike in fees once again?  Does the Minister seriously expect anybody to believe that the day-to-day running of higher education colleges, which cost £79.3 million in 1983, will cost only £80.3 million in 1984?</P>
    <P>I want to speak briefly about the student loan scheme to which the Minister and I frequently refer &mdash; she proposing and I opposing. I make my opposition on the basis of the present economic climate. If we were living in more favourable economic times where there would be a certainty, or a near certainty, of jobs when a graduate leaves college, then a student loan scheme would have much to recommend it.  I am thinking of a scheme which was operated by the Department of Education many years ago.  An amount was deducted from the students salaries when they took up positions as national teachers to repay the money which had been advanced to them by way of student loans to enable them to continue their studies.  In better economic times it would be quite a fair system, because the person concerned would be going straight into a job and so be able to repay the grant. However, at present there is no certainty of a job and a mortgage would immediately be placed around a young person's neck which would have to be repaid at <Col N="1990" /> some time, even on deferred conditions. A deferral might mean that an extra mortgage would come on top of a house mortgage or one connected with starting a family.  In the nature of events, thankfully, that is what happens with young people.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has apparently shelved the student loan scheme for the moment.  The language used is somewhat ambiguous because we read at one stage that it is going ahead and then that it is not.  One of the most constant queries to me when going around third level colleges or second level schools and meeting parents is, &ldquo;Will there be a student loan scheme or not?&rdquo;  Obviously, it will not be put into operation in 1984, but the Minister will make no definite statement yet.  My advice to the Minister and her departmental officials would be that unless the economic climate were to change radically for the better &mdash; and unfortunately we know that it will not within the short term &mdash; a student loan scheme is not a realistic proposition. Also, it would discriminate against girls because of perhaps selectivity of lending agencies in the type of student to whom the loan would be allocated.  They might think, wrongly, that young men would be better bets for a long-term job.  I should not like a lending agency or institution to have the power to select what course a student might take.  That would be wrong from an educational point of view.  I think this scheme should not be introduced at all.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the student grant scheme in relation to higher education, as it appertains to local authorities, scholarships and the vocational education committees. Parents wonder about a possible raising of the eligibility level and whether the level of grant aid will be increased. The Minister, quite rightly, pointed out that her predecessor, Deputy Boland had introduced a hefty raise in 1981.  We are now in 1984 and another Government have intervened, but it is three years since there has been a rise in either the grant itself, or in eligibility levels.  This is keeping more young people from eligibility under that scheme.  I ask the Minister to give this matter her very urgent attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1991" /> I understand that the county councils, including my own, have not yet received notification of their grants for this coming season.  Will the Minister indicate when she will be giving this notification to the local authorities and also details of the scheme for higher education grants and scholarships and income eligibility levels for 1984?  It is not quite fair to parents to leave them in doubt.  We are now at the end of May and leaving certificate examinations will be taking place.  Parents will be making plans for the autumn, budgeting and trying to work out whether they will be able to let their children commence or continue in third level education.</P>
    <P>The Minister, quite rightly, has paid tribute to parents.  They take the education of their children extremely seriously and spend much time and effort in that respect because of their great belief in education.  This is an historic thing with us, going back through the centuries from the time of the saints and scholars travelling to Europe spreading the Gospel, through the times of oppression and famine when we kept the Irish colleges going on the Continent where our young people were educated.  This could not have come about if parents had not realised the value of education for their children.</P>
    <P>The parents are worried at present because education is costly.  The Minister has mentioned how much it costs to put a child through each level of education, but the parents contribute in their taxes to the Estimate for Education before us today.  It is not some single beneficiary who is putting in money &mdash; everybody in the land, in paying taxes, is contributing. Nobody begrudges money for education. If the Minister asks where she is to get the money, I would say&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is the people of the land who, through taxation, are making this input into education.  Nobody begrudges this, but the people have rights.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke in general, as distinct from giving statistics, in her discussion on education and this is always the most interesting part.  She referred to the role of parents and her hopes for them and, in particular, of her efforts and hopes for the setting up of a parents' council.  In my Ard-Fheis speech in March, which was published, I said that our party were committed to the setting up of such a council.  It was the first time that I had seen this in print.  The role of parents in education has been greatly under-valued and I commend the Minister for her very admirable expressions towards the more formal recognition of parental role in education.  This is enshrined in our Constitution, but from time to time we merely give it lip service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My years in the education scene have led me to believe that it is of great value that parents' wishes and opinions be taken into account.  A teacher might come across a child in the classroom who is termed &ldquo;difficult&rdquo;, but there is not really such a child.  The teacher, being worried about how to cope, might notify the parents and the mother or father, or perhaps both, might call to see the teacher.  Light is then thrown on the situation which enables the teacher to look at the child and his or her difficulties with fresh understanding.  There may be some environmental or family problems preventing that child from getting the optimum benefit out of education.  It is the parents' child and they are entitled to know how he or she is getting on and how <Col N="1993" /> the parents can help the teachers.  This should be a complementary role.</P>
    <P>The Minister will quite shortly have an opportunity to do something on these lines because this autumn elections for primary school boards of management will take place.  A very good suggestion would be to emphasise this by advertisements in the national newspapers, alerting parents to these elections.  This would involve them in a more democratic process of election.  I know that selection is left to each individual school and some parishes conduct a very full process of election, having returning officers and ballot boxes.  The Department could play a role here in showing their interest in parental involvement, by organising a national awareness programme at national school level of the role of parents who could be put forward as representatives for boards of management.  This suggestion bears merit.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the third level industry link.  We commend all that is happening in that regard.  I would like to speak about the school-industry link at second level.  It was set up some years ago in a formal way by the Department of Education and the Department of Labour.  I was on one of the pilot committees set up in the Athlone region by the National Manpower Service and the teachers.  This was very successful.  I learned in a reply to a question I asked recently that there is to be a report on this national survey about the efficacy of the school-industry link at second level. Athlone is an industrial town with an industrial tradition but parents were reluctant to see their children in industrial roles.  They were reluctant to see their boys or girls going into industry.  To some of them industry was a dirty word and they were looking towards civil service jobs, teaching jobs and all the other jobs like that which are no longer available.  We must be realistic about that.</P>
    <P>We found this very effective in heightening the awareness of parents and young people of the potential jobs which would be available in industry for young people even getting in at the ground floor and the opportunities which would be available <Col N="1994" /> to them to advance later on.  We found the industries of the region very co-operative and, without any prodding, they came together and formed themselves into an <i>ad hoc</i> group of the major industrialists in the region.  They came to the schools and the schools went to the industries.  We had seminars also.  This was very worthwhile and I look forward to the results of it.  I hope that can be maintained in a formalised way.  This could be recommended to the Curriculum and Examinations Development Board because they could be incorporated into some of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's statement about RTC's and their role I would like to deal with the role of the boards of management of regional technical colleges.  Changes are envisaged in the make-up of the management boards of the RTC's.  We are not given the reason behind the wish to see changes in their make-up.  I am a bit at sea by not having seen the Minister's proposals.  From my experience of the existing boards of management I believe they have served the colleges very well.  They have been drawn from Chambers of Commerce, the VEC and they represent various sectional interests within the VEC.  If it is a case of de-politicising the make-up of the boards of management that is not a very good idea.</P>
    <P>Since the VEC's were set up they have been representative of the people and this has made them very effective.  The RTC's are representative of the people in a political, a business and a commercial sense.  The Minister should look at the record of the men and women who have served on those boards of management. She should look at their record of attendance and their input into the meetings and see what they have given in a voluntary way for many years.  I remember interviews going on from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in the Athlone RTC.  A person could be there all day in a purely voluntary capacity as chairman of the board of management. They fulfil a great role.  I am wary of changes in their make-up, particularly if it is for the facade of de-politicising. VEC's have been run very well over the years and fulfilled their functions.  I <Col N="1995" /> believe the RTC's have done the same through their management boards.  Their make-up should not be lightly changed.</P>
    <P>I agree with the amendment of the Vocational Education Act, which will allow RTC's to go into research and development.  I was in Tralee recently &mdash; I have heard this in Athlone constantly &mdash; and I was told that the RTC's under the VEC Act cannot go into research and development.  They regard their role as being that of research and development particularly if they are to serve the needs of a region and must keep pace with the growth of that region or the change of emphasis of industries within a region from traditional type textile industries to plastics or to whatever field of endeavour is the coming thing in that particular area. It is important that the RTC's are allowed engage in research and development. The present Act does not allow them to do so.  I hope, in the general amendment of this Act, that the role of RTC's with regard to research and development is looked at.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak about student participation on the boards of management. I believe the Minister's statement about democracy and student representation on the boards of management.  I wish she had spoken to her party members on the VEC, of which I am a member.  When I brought up the matter last year, it was heavily defeated by a combination of Fine Gael and Labour councillors.  They later had a change of heart due, I hope, to some pressure from me and agreed to my proposal that we allow student representatives to at least attend meetings and later on, hopefully, become members.  I believe that student representatives on boards of management of RTC's as well as on other third levels have a great role to play and should be allowed their very natural expression.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister's statement that she is looking into the Universities Act and the possible amendment of this legislation which has been so long in operation.  It has served the country very well since it was initiated but in many instances it is not relevant now because of the change of circumstances.  The <Col N="1996" /> whole role of some of the colleges has changed and this Act needs to be amended.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that she hoped there would be general involvement by people, especially parents.  She praised their commitment to the action plan and their hope to contribute further in it.  I go along with much of what she says in that respect. Debate is now beginning about the academic slant <i>vis-á-vis</i> the technological area.  I am very aware that there will be many technological changes, as well as changes in the structures of society. Everything will be in a constant state of flux.</P>
    <P>I would enter another <i>caveat</i> in that if we become too technologically minded we will be making a grievous mistake.  A proper academic education will be a bulwark later in life, a resource upon which a person will be able to draw.  I refer to the kind of education which gives a proper grounding in the basics and in history, poetry, literature and so on. When a student is going through the school system these matters may not seem so important, but I have found in discussions with former pupils that these things have stood to them later on.  While we must advance in the field of technology, it must not be at the expense of a general education.  Some people might call it an academic or liberal arts education. We must not throw out the baby with the bath water and run after everything that is new without taking account of a person's real needs and powers of receptivity in relation to our culture, traditions and history.  If we forget all that we will not provide a real education for young people.</P>
    <P>In their <i>Proposals For Plan 1984-87</i> the National Planning Board quote from <i>The Programme for Action in Education</i> as follows:</P>
    <P>Priority in financial support will be given to those academic developments, either by way of new courses or extensions to existing courses, which are geared to the developments in modern society and thus ensure that our graduates are kept abreast of rapidly changing <Col N="1997" /> technology and can compete with graduates of other countries.</P>
    <P>The board goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The Board welcome these statements, but would stress the importance of balance in third level education between its contribution to economic growth and its contribution to cultural and social development for producing a well-educated population.</P>
    <P>It is very nice to see in print something one has been saying.  More than ever the balance must be maintained.  We must gear for jobs but also for uncertainty and unemployment.  People must be mobile in regard to employment.  A broad education gives a person receptivity to ideas and enables him or her to cope with the complexities of life.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak on this most important Estimate. Education is the most important aspect of life.  It is the most important Department to which a Minister could be appointed.  I have taken my duties very seriously since I was appointed.  I do not go out to lecture anybody; neither do I receive well lectures given to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy opposite for ensuring a large gathering.  I am not normally accustomed to such an honour. Listening to Deputy O'Rourke I thought we had reached the stage for which many commentators on education have been yearning where we could provide everything we wished.  She called for the appointment of more teachers in order to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio, higher grants, more capital allocations but not student loans.  I expected her to indicate how she proposed to finance these proposals, but I was very disappointed when she said it was up to the Minister to find the money.  We do not do ourselves any great service by merely hiving the responsibility away to some other area and by not being prepared to <Col N="1998" /> face the reality that if we are to improve standards and increase the scope and extent of services we must say exactly how we will pay for it.  I would ask everybody to give serious thought to qualifying their statements rather than merely throwing out the kind of thing which sounds good on public platforms at election times.  I reckon that the Deputy's proposals would cost between £150 million and £200 million.  She did not say by what means she proposed to raise that money, whether by way of taxation or direct charges.  It was not to be done by way of student loans.  Those involved in education would be ill-advised to take such calls seriously.</P>
      <P>This Estimate is important because it affects the lives of a great many people. We have a great mass of young people whom most of us regard as our greatest asset and we like to spend time talking about the importance of our investment and how we can realise it.  Every household in the country is affected by how we run our education budget and the effect that can have on our general level of taxation.</P>
      <P>The increase this year in the provision for pay and pensions represents 96 per cent of the total increase in the Estimate. That is something we should ponder on for a moment when we talk about extending services.  I have been listening to the discussions in the various teacher conferences. Of course I agree they are fully entitled to put their points of view, which they do very forcefully, but at the same time they should accept, when they speak about hundreds of teachers being unemployed &mdash; there are, because the system seems to generate more teachers than the market can provide for &mdash; the reference in the Minister's speech today, as we must accept it, that teachers have to be paid but at the same time the bulk of the increased provision this year goes on teachers' pay and pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw attention to the increased number of primary school teachers for which provision has been made this year. The increase is 200.  Last year it was 150. This has been causing some concern, particularly from the point of view of large class numbers.  Though the Minister <Col N="1999" /> can only move at a certain speed because of financial considerations, this will require careful attention in the next few years to ensure that our primary pupils will get reasonable attention and that their efficient training will be continued.</P>
    <P>When educational matters are being considered there always has been talk and debate about the merits of the vocational education system and the secondary schools.  In the last number of years, with large numbers unemployed and with little prospects of getting employment in the public service, many of our young people coming out of colleges with BAs and H. Dips., seek teaching posts which are not there and for which the State, in any case, is not able to pay.  Therefore, there is greater need than ever to emphasise practical subjects.  Perhaps I am speaking in favour of the vocational education system but there is no sense in educating people to a high degree and letting them out on the job market where there is nothing for them at that level of education.  For that reason it is essential to ensure that we will prepare as well as we can our student population so that they will be able to fend for themselves. In the past one could expect that young people coming out of the secondary school system could expect to get jobs in the public service.  It was a relatively safe bet, but in recent times it is not so easy and it will not be easy &mdash; I refer to Deputies across &mdash; unless we find some easy way to finance pay for the jobs that we provide in the public service.</P>

      <P>We have a duty to indicate to young people what their prospects will be when they leave the secondary school system.  Having regard to our experience in the last three or four years we should be able to tell them what their prospects will be in the practical and academic spheres.  The career guidance system should have greater regard for what will be available for students at the end of secondary school education.  The people opposite choose to interpret that as a call not to educate them.  That is untrue.</P>

We should be realistic and not build castles in the air for them, not to increase their expectations and later to dash their hopes.  The people opposite are nodding their heads but they should remember before they nod in assent that they have done more to dash <Col N="2001" /> the hopes of young people than any other group in the country in the past ten years.</P>

      <P>I do not think that remark deserves a response.  We need to tell the young people the realities of the situation and also the opportunities that exist. There is no use educating them for the technological arena or for the academic life unless opportunities exist or unless we have in mind ways and means to create such opportunities.  Our experience in the past five or six years has not shown us that there are enough opportunities in either area.  Greater emphasis must be placed on educating young people to go out into the world and, so far as possible, to provide jobs for themselves rather than encouraging them to think they will be provided with jobs in services that must be paid for by the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Nowdays there is a common theory that we should educate young people for leisure and for unemployment.  That kind of theory needs qualification.  We will not give young people much hope if we tell them that they are just being educated for leisure or for unemployment.  The right balance must be found.  They must be given sufficient knowledge to survive in a situation where there may not always be jobs available.  On the other hand, if they are led to believe that they face total and absolute unemployment that will have the unfortunate effect of killing their spirit and initiative and it will reduce them to total dependence on the system. It is important that we point out to them that job opportunities will not exist to the same extent as in the past.  We have to do our utmost to improve the situation, but we should not go overboard to the extent that these young people will think they are condemned to everlasting unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Estimate in respect of areas relating to high technology.  Those areas offer great scope for development, because this country seems to have come of age at the right time in respect of this development.  We should ensure that everything is done to <Col N="2002" /> encourage students to go into those areas.  It can be said that high technology reduces jobs, but it can improve productivity and output and that, in turn, will create the need for further jobs in the services area.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two matters that relate to my constituency: I am sure I will be forgiven if I am a little parochial in this instance.  For a number of years there have been discussions in County Kildare with regard to setting up a regional technical college.  This county has a big population that is expanding quickly and it would be no harm to give some consideration to that proposal.  Obviously the market is there.  There are other colleges in the adjoining counties but not in that area.  I hope that in time the Minister will be able to do something about this matter, notwithstanding her other commitments.</P>
    <P>I live in the precincts of the university at Maynooth, County Kildare.  Such an institution requires the substantial recreational facilities which exist in Belfield and in other places.  When the provision of further facilities is being considered, which must be done at some stage in the not-too-distant future, I ask that there be co-operation between the various bodies, including the Department of Education and the Higher Education Authority.  I know co-operation will be readily forthcoming from the college authorities and from local interest groups who are most anxious to become involved in assisting financially with regard to the provision of recreational facilities in a modern university. By this I mean provision for track and field events, swimming facilities and so on which are normally provided in a university.  The Higher Education Authority have a primary role in these matters, but the Minister might consider inviting the other interest groups into discussions with that authority.  From my knowledge of the area I know there will be a high degree of co-operation with regard to financial assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the importance of the role of parents in <Col N="2003" /> education generally, and that is something all of us should welcome.  In the past few years the increased interest of parents and their growing role in the educational system has been obvious.  It has been of considerable help and is appreciated by the teachers.  The more co-operation and involvement there is from the parents the more beneficial will be the system from the point of view of parents and students.  Parents have taken the initiative in many areas, and their role is increasing in extent and importance.</P>
      <P>My final point deals with school library services.  I am a member of a local authority, and each year at estimate time we find ourselves short of funds.  The county library services do a very good job in providing a service for schools.  In recent times the allocation has not been sufficient, with the result that, taking other pressing requirements into account, local authorities have found themselves unable to give as they would like to that area.  It would be very sad if that service was downgraded as it is very important and is held in high regard by the local authorities who operate it.  Charges have been introduced in libraries in some counties but I am not suggesting that that should be done in relation to schools.  I ask the Minister to at least give favourable consideration in future years to improving the allocation to local authorities in respect of school library services.  No doubt, Deputy O'Rourke wants to know where I would get the money, but that is the only suggestion I have made so far which I did not qualify.  Deputy O'Rourke set a very high standard by indicating where the money would come from and she expected the same from me.  I, like Deputy O'Rourke, will have to leave that to the Minister.</P>

      <P>To the many students already sitting their exams and those who are about to commence them I wish each and every one of them well, in particular for the pressures they are under, not merely those of the be all and end all certificates, allegedly, that they will get at the end of their examinations if they are successful but also the pressures they are under from living which are bearing heavily on them.  More importantly, they are under pressure as to where they are going and what future they have if they attain standards in their examinations, because the prospect of employment is very dismal. It must be very troubling mentally for students, and it is regrettable that in the long Estimate speech made by the Minister no hope is being held out to students at school, much less to those who have left school and who are numbered among the 200,000 unemployed.  I contend that there are many more unemployed who are not included in that figure because many of them are not qualified to be included in the statistics for various reasons.  I say to students to do the best they can and be satisfied with that whatever the outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modern world is being transformed by the application of science and technology.  This applies to the production of goods and services in the home and the workplace, and new systems are changing every aspect of the way we live. Like young people, I am also concerned at the lack of encouragement or incentive to them from the Government, the Minister and the Department of Education. I hope to be positive in giving a ray of hope to these people.  Our ambition must be to take a leading place in the emerging world.  We are ideally equipped to do so and to become a high technology and high income economy.  We have a young, educated, intelligent and, most of all, adaptable population.  We have a growing community of highly qualified scientific and high technology people who have ideas, initiative and enthusiasm, and it would be a pity if we and the Government did not recognise that.  The Government should use the skills and <Col N="2005" /> talents of those people who have them brought more directly to bear on the management of our affairs and our economy.</P>
    <P>I hope that the next Fianna Fáil Government, agus más maith is mithead, is not too far away and that they will appoint a Minister for Science and Technology with specific responsibility for this area to co-ordinate the efforts of those involved and to ensure that the work is directed to our particular needs.  The same Minister would have responsibility for the National Board of Science and Technology with a mandate to make it the key agency in directing the economy into the new high technology era.</P>
    <P>If we are to give hope to our young people we must specialise in growth industries, not just in the more sophisticated production of existing products but in the development of new ones.  We must concentrate on agricultural food processing, marine developments and mariculture, which are energy related industries, micro-electronics, information and biotechnology, medical and chemical products and new products based on our own natural resources.  We should also develop resources which are not natural with the purpose of providing for our young people.  This will require a new concept of national economic management, taking clear and precise decisions about the areas in which we are going to specialise.  We must then mobilise all our resources, adapt our educational and training programmes, secure the full co-operation of the trade unions, invest heavily in the right research and development and, in particular, harness the skills and the expertise of our scientific and technological community.  I contend that serious consideration should be given to the suggestions I have made.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the very important matter of schools and school buildings.  Our spokesperson, Deputy O'Rourke, said that the provision for national schools, equipment and furnishings of £26.750 million is a reduction of 6 per cent.  Many other Deputies wish to speak on this Estimate.  Because of the time constraints it would be very foolish <Col N="2006" /> of me to be repetitive.  There has been a lack of progress by the Department in carrying out capital programmes for building schools and providing extensions, many of which have been planned and designed over a number of years. That is not be be wondered at, when the figures outlined today show a drastic reduction in the amount of money available for these capital projects.  The Ministers responsible have had representations from Deputies from Cape Clear to Malin and from Ireland's Eye to Aran Island about extensions to schools, new schools and the replacement of inadequate buildings.  This work has been retarded over the past year and a half.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency how long more will we have to wait for an extension to Dripsey national school?  What about Clogheen new school?  We are celebrating the centenary of the building of the old school this year, coincidentally with the GAA.</P>

      <P>The rate of progress in these developments in the constituency of Cork North-Central has been retarded.  Every excuse is given, but there are no physical operations on the ground. How long more will we have to wait for a block upon a block for the Blarney boys' national school?  In Knocknahgeeny where we have a growing population we need an extension to the boys' school.  The dithering goes on and it is passed from John to Mick to Harry, but building on the extension has not yet begun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Government announced the principal proposals they extracted from the task force in the Cork area. Deputies know how long we waited for action to be taken by the Government on the report of the task force.  I do not know why the report was kept secret.  One of <Col N="2007" /> the proposals to emanate from the Government as a result of the task force report was in regard to an extension to the Farranree school which the Minister knows well.  It was announced to some of the Deputies in Cork North-Central in the middle of March.  The extension to the North Presentation School in Farranree was hailed as something wonderful for Cork.</P>
    <P>How much longer must we wait before work on Brooklodge first and second level schools begins?  The Minister and the Department must be aware that it has been established that there will be no further intake of pupils into the Ballincollig community school in 1984 because of the need for an extension or a new school.  Mayfield school is full to capacity. The only suggestion made by the Ministers was that the children from Mayfield, which is in the suburbs of Cork city, should travel to various other schools in the city because there is no room for them in their local school.</P>
    <P>I want to condemn without reservation the total lack of progress by the Ministers concerned in the provision of capital investment which would create a number of jobs in the Cork area where they are so badly needed.  All these plans have been with the Department for a considerable time.  The excuses given are unacceptable to me.  I appeal to the Ministers to encourage whoever is holding up these developments to get on with the job.  We do not need the report of a task force for that.  We are all aware of the need.</P>
    <P>Gaeilge is a subject which is very dear to many of us.  I wish to express my concern to the Minister based on recent information which I acquired.  More than one-third of the students either failed or did not bother to take Irish in the group, leaving and intermediate certificate examinations last year.  I have to question the relevance of any examination which 30 per cent of students did not take and 40 per cent of those who took it failed. This denotes a decline in interest in the subject in recent years.</P>
    <P>In 1973 only 2 per cent of leaving certificate students did not take the Irish language in the examination.  Last year <Col N="2008" /> the figure had jumped to 9.52 per cent. In the same period the failure rate jumped from 5.3 per cent to 23.4 per cent.  In the same period the number who failed the intermediate test in Irish more than doubled from 11.6 per cent to 26.24 per cent, while the number who failed in the group certificate rose from 25 per cent to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>These statistics indicate that attitudes towards the use of our native language will have to be changed and more encouragement will have to be given to students. It is regrettable that this trend should be emerging and that we appear to be losing our badge of identity.  The badge of identity of any nation is surely its language. I appeal to the Minister to encourage &mdash; I am not suggesting for a moment that we should brú síos a scoranach &mdash; the learning and the use of Irish.  I should like to make a few suggestions.  Ba cheart ar dtús feabhas a chur air thré anáil agus cáilíochtaí múinteoirí ionas go dtuigfidís cúrsaí an dá theanga.  Nílim ag iarraidh tosaíocht a thabhairt don Ghaeilge thar aon teanga eile ach ar a laghad bimís dhá-theangach.  Tá sé an-deacair do pháistí sna Gaeltachtaí ina bhfuil leabhair acu agus nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge sna leabhair sin oiriúnach don cheantar, cuir i gcás na páistí i dTír Chonaill, an Mhumhain agus Connacht.  Ba chóir go mbeadh gach rud curtha dos na daltaí seo i nGaeilge a gceantair agus go mbeadh sé soiléir dóibh sna téacsleabhair.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cláracha oideachasúla radio agus teilifíse nach bhfuil sé in am dúinn iarracht a dhéanamh ar níos mó cláracha a bheith le feiceáil agus le cloisteáil ar Radio Teilifís Éireann chun an sprid a mhúscailt chun an Ghaeilge a choimeád beo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó idirbheartaíocht idir an Ghaeltacht agus na scoileanna lan-Ghaelacha.  Agus ag tagairt do na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha molaim Bord na Gaeilge agus na daoine ar fud na tíre atá ag iarraidh na scoileanna seo a bhunú.  Tá cuid acu i mo cheantar féin agus le cúnamh Dé beidh tuilleadh dóibh ann.  Molaim na tuismitheoirí agus na daoine go bhfuil aon chúnamh tugtha acu.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh torthaí na scoileanna seo le feiceáil. <Col N="2009" /> Molaim go n-úsáidfí an Ghaeilge i ngach scoil i leith rudaí simplí cosúil le leagan Ghaelach a ainmneacha agus sloinnte agus go gcinnteofaí go mbeidh gnáth chaint an lae trí Ghaeilge chomh fada agus is féidir chun an spríd a choimeád sna scoileanna.  Tá roinnt samplaí eile a bhí le tabhairt agam don Teach ach de bharr gairide an ama caithfidh mé éirigh as.  Is mór an trua é.</P>
    <P>In passing I should like to mention that we had a lot of rí rá about the allocation for schools in disadvantaged areas.  On 4 April 1984 I tabled a question to the Minister asking her when she proposes to spend the £500,000 budgeted for the depressed areas of Dublin and Cork; if she has identified the areas in Cork needing allocation and if she will make a statement on the matter.  I received a long answer that did not bear any relevance to the question asked.  I was given an assurance that the information I require would be given to me.  I should like to put it on record that I have not yet received from the Department the information the Minister said she would supply to me.  I am not saying that that is the Minister's fault although it may be her responsibility but it is wrong if information is not supplied following a commitment to do so in the House.  I was hoping the Minister would expand on what was meant by &ldquo;disadvantaged areas&rdquo;.  It seemed to me that the disadvantaged areas scheme was being confined to schools in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, all urban areas.  The Department must realise that the scheme should be extended a little further.  Of course, it is not possible to do very much with £500,000.  I am aware that one of the most disadvantaged areas in my constituency did not qualify to be included in the allocation of funds.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the RTC in Cork, a very important institution.  I have a copy of a document submitted on 10 February 1984 to the Taoiseach when he visited the college.  I wonder if any action has been taken on the problems that exist there and if any action proposed will be outlined to the students.  The position in the RTC in Cork &mdash; other RTCs may have similar problems &mdash; is intolerable. It is time action was taken to correct the <Col N="2010" /> problems in the canteen, the library and accommodation generally.  The canteen has a capacity for 200 students but the daily turnover is 2,500 students.  Naturally, that leads to overcrowding.  It has been alleged that the high prices there are due to the inefficiency of the operation. A turnover of that sort could mean that conditions are somewhat unhygienic. The library has a capacity for 160 students but the registered number of members is 1,500.  Again, there is overcrowding, inefficiency and a less studious atmosphere.  The accommodation was established long ago.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the problems in the college are cleared up as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We all acknowledge the contribution made to education through the centuries by the religious orders who are today described as the voluntary schools.  The Minister should give consideration to the position they find themselves in financially. The decision of the Department to discontinue the provision of school secretaires for such schools is reprehensible. I suggest that the Department look at the VAT charge on extensions, buildings and supply of materials and furnishings and so on to these schools.  It does not make sense to give a grant for the building of a school and then for another Department to take a slice of it back in VAT.</P>
    <P>We have seen no progress at all in the pupil-teacher ratio in these voluntary schools, as in all other schools.</P>
    <P>I and many other people are concerned about the lack of discipline in our schools. I am not for a moment suggesting a reintroduction in any shape or form of corporal punishment but I am suggesting that we must find a way to introduce discipline into all our schools.  In her recent action plan the Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey, refers only briefly to this matter.  In section 2.28 and in section 2.29 the problem appears to be solved by appealing to youth organisations and associations.  It is naive to think that peripheral activities such as youth clubs and associations could in any way ameliorate the classroom situation.  If education is given direction it is extraordinary that the action programme makes <Col N="2011" /> no reference other than the passing reference I have mentioned to any code of discipline.  It is useless to talk about vandalism, disadvantaged areas, etc., if no direction is given.  Discipline involves no financial expenditure.  Right through the action programme the Minister refers constantly to constraints in this regard.  It is a pity that when the infamous former disciplinary measures were taken away &mdash; I agree that they should have been&mdash; an alternative in some shape or form was not thought out and introduced.  That was an error of judgment.  The present Coalition Government through the budget, for instance, ask the public to discipline themselves and they enforce discipline through Special Powers Acts, the Garda and the Army, while lack of discipline in schools, where society is moulded, reflects coldly on the type of society the Coalition Government hope to create.</P>
    <P>I wish to put forward some suggestions in this matter.  I emphasise that communication between teacher, principal and parent is essential, as is the involvement of the parent from the very early stages. I suggest that discipline would begin with a verbal warning from the principal.  If this does not succeed the parents should be consulted.  All communication between principal and teacher and between principal and pupil should be documented, and to this end the Department of Education should provide some sort of official card to record frequency and degrees of disruption.  On perhaps the third communication between the teacher and the principal the teacher would have the right to remove the child from his or her class and continue in the job of educator.  The problem would then be in the principal's hands.  The principal could place the pupil in a new class at the same level where that would be possible, that is in larger schools.  I recognise that this option would be impossible in the smaller primary schools, and so from this point a separate system would have to obtain.  In that situation temporary expulsion from the school might be considered. However, I leave it to the people in the Department to examine the situation so that where necessary &mdash; it is not needed 100 per cent of the time and never was <Col N="2012" />&mdash; a scheme of discipline for teachers, pupils and parents would be formulated to be brought into operation where necessary.</P>
    <P>School transport is the bane of all our lives as public representatives with all the debates about it that have taken place here and, I could say, all the mess that went on in the scheme.  I hope that all that is behind us and that the Ministers, the Department and everybody else concerned will profit by, first of all, experience of the scheme as it was introduced in 1966, its operation up to recent times and the dreadful tinkering and messing around with school transport since this Government came into power. I am sure that the Ministers have learned lessons sufficient to enable them to produce a reasonable plan or set of proposals to get children to school.  I am pleased to hear from the Minister of State that he, the Minister and the Department are open to suggestions from public representatives all over the country, whom I would encourage to make suggestions and give them to the Department where, experience or not, that little extra is always necessary.</P>
    <P>I condemn the attitude of the Ministers involved in the removal of medical cards from students during the year.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, and a thought occurred to me that our Combat Poverty organisation wasted money in the leasing of a building that would go a long way towards meeting the £2 million that was reputed to be saved by the withdrawal of medical cards from students at third level.  As a member of that committee I will be watching these developments closely.  The situation is put in perspective when one considers the amount of money that was wasted on the Combat Poverty Committee.  I have seen no evidence of success on the part of that committee in combating poverty. One recalls also the withdrawing of medical cards from third level students.</P>
    <P>We owe a debt to teachers, both lay and religious, who have given so much by way of the development of sporting activities among young people.  Wherever that fine tradition may have been diminished we should make every effort to awaken it, whether at bun-scoíl, mean-scoil or <Col N="2013" /> ard-scoil levels.  We all realise the importance of sport in the development of the individual as a whole.  While complimenting those teachers who are still involved in this area, we must encourage those who have never become involved to become involved.  Despite the area of sport being transferred to the Department of Labour I urge the Department of Education to give every possible help in encouraging young people to engage in sporting activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking to this Estimate I am very conscious of something said to me recently by a student at a regional technical college.  We were discussing various requests and demands of the college and this student said he hoped public representatives realised that it is in education we can find the only long-term solution to social inequality. The more one thinks about that remark the more one is inclined to agree.  Many of us who have been removed for some years from formal education can learn a lot from young people particularly those who are now at the third level stage.</P>
      <P>Because of our very nature as human beings equality is not attainable but equal opportunity should be the right and the prerogative of all our children.  Regardless of which side of the House we are on I think all of us would agree that that is what we are striving for, particularly in the area of education.  When we mention equal opportunity for all we must think in terms of discriminating positively in favour of the disadvantaged so as to endeavour to bring them up to the level of children born with more talent and with more aptitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a debate, though of only a few hours' duration, on the Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987.  That programme encapsulates the Government's policy on education.  I commend the programme to everybody and I commend the Minister for the tremendous thought that went into compiling it.  It marks a highly significant initiative in education.  At last we can see clearly where the priorities are.  Rightly, the document is entitled a programme for action and not, as it was referred to by Deputy <Col N="2014" /> O'Rourke on the occasion on which we discussed it a programme for deferred action.  This is a realistic document and it is nonsense for the Opposition to claim otherwise.  The programme sets out what can and will be done within the obvious limited financial resources available.</P>
    <P>Many of the reforms arise by way of reallocation rather than by involving additional expenditure or they involve structural reforms which do not carry cost implications.  For example, the programme includes the expansion of boards of management of comprehensive schools to include parent-teacher representation and also teachers in the VECs, students and governing bodies of third level institutions, the establishment of parents' councils, a review of the scheme of posts of responsibility, the rationalisation of the Department's control and funding procedures, a review of the regional technical colleges, the new basis of paying capitation grants to secondary schools, the transfer of primary school buildings from the Office of Public Works to the Department of Education.  None of these issues involves additional expenditure but we have waited years for this reform.  I commend the Minister for taking the initiative in moving in these matters.  They are matters that could have been tackled long ago but many of the reforms have been achieved in only six short months and it will be only a short time before the remainder are achieved.</P>
    <P>In addition there is suggested an extensive range of cost-efficiency measures for third level education.  These changes are significant.  In the action programme the special priorities have been identified. These are primary education, remedial education and aid to the disadvantaged. These are not pious aspirations.  They have been backed up by hard cash in the 1984 Estimates and they will remain priorities in each year as the programme is implemented.</P>
    <P>On the previous occasion on which she spoke, Deputy O'Rourke criticised the lack of commitment to provide resources for the programme.  There is no such lack of commitment as the following figures will show.  A sum of £7 million has been identified specifically by the Minister for <Col N="2015" /> items in 1984 that are directly related to the implementation of the programme. Within the £7 million we are providing an increase of £4 per pupil in the rate of capitation grant payable in respect of the running costs of national schools.  This will cost £2.3 million.  There is provision also for a special fund of £500,000 for primary education in disadvantaged areas.  There is an increase of £8 per pupil in the rate of grant payable to secondary school authorities in lieu of tuition fees. This will cost £1.6 million in 1984.  There is an increased provision for £781,000 for in-service training, aid for school books and micro-computers at secondary level. There is an additional £2 million for primary school buildings and a grant of £300,000 for sporting organisations. There is a further £300,000 for the Curriculum and Examinations Board.</P>
    <P>This £7 million has been identified as being spent in 1984 but let us not forget that the Programme for Action in Education is really the programme for the £1,000 million we are discussing here today.  In these circumstances the Opposition cannot accuse us of not having a financial commitment to the programme. We are talking about £1,000 million being collected from the taxes of those men and women who are working and paying their taxes.  We all agree that the taxation system is penal, that there is not enough disposable income at the end of the week. Those calling for additional expenditure should bear that in mind whether their particular issue is that of pupil-teacher ratio, remedial teaching or whatever.  All these matters are very important and we would all like to bring about improvements in respect of them but we must ask where the additional money is to come from.  We must be responsible and be able always to put our money where our mouth is on this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke has adopted a totally irresponsible attitude in her criticism of the programme for action.  She called for a greatly expanded budget for education and for a reversal of the 1983 economy measures, measures that were designed by Fianna Fáil but subsequently disowned by them.  The Deputy called, <Col N="2016" /> too, for more guidance teachers, more remedial teachers, the extension of preschooling as in the Rutland Street project, computer courses for parents and adults generally, reduced pupil-teacher ratios at primary level, increased thirdlevel grants, more in-service courses and sabbaticals for teachers.  That was Deputy O'Rourke's shopping list in March.  These are all very laudable issues but there was no mention of how they were to be paid for.</P>

      <P>It is disappointing that the Fianna Fáil spokesperson did not make realistic constructive suggestions. Therefore, her comments cannot be taken seriously.  As regards the Programme for Action in Education one of the first matters dealt with by the Minister was the new Curriculum and Examinations Board which was set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis last January.  This will be put on a statutory basis within the period of the plan.  Whether parents, teachers or legislators we all have much to say about the curricula for primary, second and third levels.  Anything that can be done to make education more relevant to the needs of today, to the increased leisure time and the new developments in technology has to be welcomed.  I welcome the freedom to adapt the curriculum to local needs.  This will be interpreted at local level in a way which will meet the situation on the ground.  There are vast differences in the needs of children headislator <Col N="2017" /> ing towards a job market in the inner city of Dublin and in the needs of those in the rural parts of the west.  Agricultural areas have different needs and expect different results from the educational system to industrial areas.</P>
      <P>The mathematics course needs to be looked at, particularly up to intermediate and leaving certificate pass level.  Those who are fit to do honours mathematics are well catered for except in the case of girls who do not have sufficient access to these courses.  The mathematical course should be more relevant to what children will face when they leave schools.  Currencies, the EMS and the dollar should be dealt with and also percentages, income tax bands, interest rates, loans, HP, the metric system and stocks and shares.  These items are barely touched on in the present curriculum.  I appeal to the Minister and to the board to make these courses more relevant to the lives students will lead when they leave school.</P>
      <P>Priority in the action plan is given to the use of available resources, particularly for disadvantaged pupils.  We must discriminate positively in this area, even with scarce resources.  The Minister has recognised this and everything possible will be done in this area.  The Department of Education will take action on the proposals contained in the plan for Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an area which is difficult to deal with because, no matter how one tackles it, one is open to misinterpretation. In Wexford we have very active committees interested in setting up Gael scoileanna.  We all encourage the establishment of such schools.  Anything that can be done to interest young people in Irish must be commended.  I have had many approaches from the INTO in recent months expressing their concern about the establishment of these schools. My initial reaction was one of great surprise, particularly since the INTO are committed to the national language and its propagation among our children.  We all owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to them for the way they have preserved and kept our heritage going over the years.  It was with great surprise that I saw teachers coming to clinic after clinic expressing concern about the development <Col N="2018" /> of these all-Irish schools.  It took me some time to get to the bottom of the problem.  I had letters written by various secretaries of schools and chairpersons of the different branches of the INTO pointing out the difficulties that might be experienced.</P>
    <P>After analysing the position for a few months the problem appears to be that, in time of scarce resources and when the Government cannot give extra teachers as they might want to do and cannot give all the remedial teaching they might want to, people resent special schools of any kind getting more attention than their own.  The INTO support these schools provided they are treated financially by the Government in the same way as ordinary primary schools.</P>
    <P>There are problems with the extra transport allowance.  Children will travel from wide areas.  This has to be so, otherwise the schools would not be filled.  This has led to a fear of canvassing for pupils. In Wexford there is a real concern that they may lose a teacher in a school because of interest being expressed in and canvassing for a new all-Irish school which is about to be set up.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at this.  I should like to see more Irish schools.  It is in our interest to see this development continuing.  It has been the policy of successive Governments for years.  The Minister should look at this to see if anything can be done to alleviate the fears of the INTO, not only in Wexford but in other areas.  She should look at the questions of finance, the size of the capitation grants, transport and the extra teacher, one over the ratio for primary schools, which is another bone of contention.  The problem brought to my notice by the INTO deserves thorough investigation. It cannot be lightly that any committed member of the INTO would question the policy of having such schools.  I ask the Minister to look at this area and ensure that the matter can be resolved to the satisfaction of all, particularly to that of the children who want to be educated in their native language.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest and was somewhat quizzical about the fact that the INTO took this motion in committee at their <Col N="2019" /> conference.  Perhaps they also had difficulty in discussing this in the open and resolving their problems.  As the Minister pointed out, a task force is to be set up in relation to the teaching of Irish.  No matter how successful we are at this in our schools there is still the problem of getting children and adults to use Irish in their daily life.  In-service courses are to be provided to enrich teachers' knowledge of and skills in the arts.  As a nation we fail to teach young people to appreciate and enjoy the arts, particularly the visual arts.  We all know about enforced leisure time but this time need not be wasted.  We should ensure that while our children are going through the school system, particularly through the compulsory years, something is done to awaken their appreciation of the arts.  I do not know why we have failed for so long to give our children an appreciation of the arts.  Perhaps it was because it was not fashionable or the thing to do.  Young people, particularly boys, find it amusing if one tries to develop their interest in the arts and discuss it with them.  This is an area where a lot more could be done. Additional music organisers and regional art organisers will be recruited.  When one speaks of the arts one must include music. This is an area where all Irish people have a tremendous appreciation, but we could extend that even further.  Proper development in these areas could ensure that enforced leisure or unemployed time could be gainfully occupied and a great deal learned from it.</P>
    <P>A programme is to be undertaken to eliminate sexism and sex-stereotyping in education &mdash; less emphasis on the traditional roles.  On this point it was with interest that I read the Minister's speech when she was awarding prizes at a computer competition recently.  The interesting point that came from this was that in Ireland we have a much higher percentage of girls who are actually interested in computers and who are efficient and competent in their handling.  This fact does not compare with other European countries where boys seem to have taken very easily to computer studies of one type or another.  I quote from the Minister's <Col N="2020" /> speech on Wednesday, 16 May at a prize-giving reception for an Irish computer company:</P>
    <P>A significant outcome of this competition is that approximately 40 per cent of the entries have been submitted by girls.  This has been achieved in spite of the fact that the girls in most countries tend not to take the same interest in computers as boys do.</P>
    <P>Many conferences abroad have endeavoured, so far without success, to isolate the cause of this phenomenon.</P>
    <P>Here in Ireland, however, we have a competition which seems to attract almost as many girls as boys and I will keep myself informed of the trend in 1985.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we have done more than we realise over the last few years in avoiding sex stereotyping in our schools, and I am delighted the Minister will continue her efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>Literacy provision will be a priority in the programme of adult education.  In the Action Programme for Education we are promised that a report will shortly be issued on this problem &mdash; the report of the commission published yesterday or the day before.  The Minister welcomed the report and referred those listening to her to her Programme on Action for Education when she committed herself to implementing as many of the commission's proposals as possible.</P>
    <P>The Curriculum and Examinations Board are to be asked to encourage the development of health education in the school curriculum at primary and post-primary level.  Here one could speak for a long time, but I do not intend to.  A proper health education programme in our schools would result in less abuse of drink and drugs, more understanding of true sexuality and less abuse of the person by children leaving school, because they would understand physiology and the damage they were doing to themselves. Young people especially have a particular interest in physiology and metabolism and if we continue to ignore this and let them leave school without proper instruction in this, we are failing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2021" /> Under the Health Education Programme a comprehensive programme of education for child care and home management both in boys' and girls' schools should be undertaken.  This is compulsory on the Continent where there is a two-year programme in child care for both sexes.  No matter what we choose to do with our lives, those of us who marry and have families find that the rearing of children is the most important, if not the only, role for many years.  How can we continue to allow children to leave school without any education or preparation for the most important role in their lives?  I cannot understand how this situation has continued for so long.  I hope it will be possible to implement a full health education programme as soon as possible to take care of this and many other aspects.</P>
    <P>The 1930 Vocation Educational Act is to be amended to allow for teacher representation on vocational education committees and in this context a review is to be undertaken of the arrangements for teacher appointments to VECs.  There will be a review, I presume, of the vocational education structure in general, along with a review of local government, because the method of selection of members of VECs depends on the local government system of the day.  The TUI had a campaign recently for VECs to be included under the 1977 Worker Participation Act.  This, I hope, will be unnecessary in view of the Minister's commitment to allow for teacher representation under the Vocational Education Act. The Worker Participation Act would be totally unsuitable as the bodies which come under it are semi-State which work under the umbrella of boards of managment, and there is a totally different structure for selecting people to those boards compared to the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The position of regional technical college boards and subcommittees of the vocational education committees is to be examined, as will the question of student representation on governing bodies of third level colleges.  The sooner we can deal with this issue the better because there is still considerable disquiet particularly in the regional technical colleges <Col N="2022" /> since they do not have, as yet, student representation on the college bodies.</P>
    <P>The presence of an RTC in a particular area is of tremendous significance in attracting industry.  IDA regional officers will tell you that some of the first questions asked by industrialsts coming into an area are: &ldquo;What are the third level facilities?  Is there an RTC, if there is not a college?&rdquo;  Wexford in particular has lost out drastically because of the absence of an RTC.  At the moment we have a request before the Minister for such a college.  I am as critical as any other Member on the Government side of those who ask for everything without saying from where the money will be provided. However, I hope that sooner or later we will be in a financial position to accede to such requests.  Areas of high unemployment &mdash; Wexford town has 25 per cent unemployment &mdash; would benefit tremendously from such provision, particularly from the point of view of the industry they would attract.  At present we are serviced very well by the Waterford RTC but many young people cannot avail of the facilities there because of the distances they have to travel and because of the transition in moving from home to Waterford at a fairly young age.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that parents will be facilitated in the formation of a national parents' council. We are constantly reminded that parents are the primary educators of their children. This is enshrined in the Constitution. The Minister's announcement is most welcome.  It was with some amusement that I read of Fianna Fáil's conversion to our way of thinking on this matter. Deputy O'Rourke welcomed this and commended the Minister, but Fianna Fáil's record over the years has been that they completely excluded parents.  They appear to have had no interest in parents' involvement in children's education.  I hope Deputy O'Rourke's views on this correspond with her party's views because it has not been Fianna Fáil policy up to this.  I venture to suggest that she check this out with Deputy Haughey because we all know what happens to Fianna Fáilers who take unilateral decisions. I welcome their change of heart <Col N="2023" /> and their conversion because this is a matter on which we must all agree.  We must involve parents on school boards of management and on the parents' council.</P>
    <P>Economy measures are to be introduced into the school building programme in expanding areas.  This is essential because it is the one taxpayer who must pay for all.  He must keep putting his hand into his pocket while his disposable income is being eroded week in and week out, year in and year out. We know from population growth figures and statistics that for the next 15 years or so there will be tremendous demand on school buildings and school places in general, but around the turn of the century we will have empty classrooms, if the present population growth figures continue, and plenty of places at third level institutions.  However, between now and then there will be a few very difficult years.  It is questionable whether we should keep going on a very expensive capital building programme for facilities which will not be necessary in 15 or so years' time.  We must look at the possibility of making better use of existing facilities.  The capital cost of building our schools and third level colleges is so great that one questions whether they can be left empty for months of the year and many hours of each day as at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we shall be looking at the possible reorganisation of the academic year, the possibility of changing the term structure as we now know it, of perhaps changing the length of degree courses, but in any event, gearing ourselves to making optimum use of existing facilities without immediately thinking that the only solution to the problem of finding places in our educational levels for the next few years is providing ever more buildings.  We shall also be using temporary accommodation for the peaking population, particularly in our urban areas.  This might not be ideal, but once we know that the demand for this accommodation will be for only approximately ten or 15 years, particularly when one speaks of the primary and secondary level, that is acceptable. <Col N="2024" /> However, these temporary buildings must be kept up to acceptable standards and I think that the Minister is on the right path in this area.</P>
    <P>The Department are pledged to encourage development of sport for all activities in both primary and post-primary schools.  Indeed, like the health education programme about which I talked earlier, and which I hope we shall soon see in our curricula, increased awareness of the value of sport would at the end of the day result in less drug abuse, less vandalism and less crime in general.</P>

      <P>We do need more effective administration in this area.  We need more improved coaching, a review of the PE schools.  The Minister has provided an extra £300,000 in the budget for 11 different sporting organisations and this is evidence of her commitment to what she says.  Aspirations are one thing; policy is something else.  When we are prepared to put the money down we are on the way to implementing our policies.  We are not just talking about pious aspirations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken before in the House of the school transport system and do not intend to go over that ground again.  It is an essential back-up, particularly for our primary and secondary school children.  A sum of £28 million was spent on this in 1983.  The buses which we are using to transport our children around the country are not fit to transport animals.  Quite frankly, the present rules and regulations governing the transport of animals are stricter than those governing the transport of our children, and that is an appalling thing to have to admit.  The other side of the coin is that the capital cost of replacing a bus fleet which this Government inherited 18 months ago is prohibitive. The buses are safe, but are old, decrepit and dirty.  This is an area which will have to be tackled.  Further rationalisation of the school transport system must come if we are to continue to provide this essential service for our children, particularly those in remote areas. <Col N="2025" /> The bus is not just a means of getting to school; it is a means of keeping them in contact with the villages, the nuclei of the country, where they can socialise and enjoy the amenities which are quite easily accessible to urban children.</P>
    <P>The special needs of gifted children must not be forgotten, also.  Indeed, these children are such a small percentage of the population that one does not refer to them too often.  However, if these children are not properly looked after they will become a great problem to the community.  They will either contribute greatly to society or cause massive problems. In this area we must consider where we are going and what can be done.</P>
    <P>The funding in national schools generally will be a priority in the allocation of available resources, with additional support being given in disadvantaged areas.  I have already mentioned £2.4 million of additional capitation grants coming in here and, indeed, I recognise the very onerous position of many boards of management of primary schools.  It is at present very difficult to keep the schools maintained in good condition, properly cleaned and properly heated.  I commend the boards of management for their trojan work.  I can safely say that none of our children is suffering, even though some of the boards of management are stretched to solve the problems which they experience.</P>
    <P>The question of making special provision for painting the inside and outside of our national schools is to be examined.  It is most important that the environment in which our children are taught be the correct one.  Cleanliness and general tidiness of their environment will help to make them civically minded.  This provision is economically sound.  I must commend the Minister and hope that she is in a position to provide some funds in this direction.</P>
    <P>Special attention will be given to the learning difficulties in literacy and numeracy.  This whole area, we all appreciate, needs tremendous attention.  Pupils who fall behind at the age of eight or nine years, which is the age of the basic skills and proficiencies, will have problems for the rest of their lives.  Many children are <Col N="2026" /> not so academically gifted but if they can all leave school, particularly at the end of the compulsory period of schooling, with proficiency in literacy and numeracy, most of them will have a certain confidence to manage their lives and get themselves through life.  We would not have the tremendous demand for literacy provision from adult education centres of one type or another if the job were being done properly at primary level.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the greatest handicaps we can inflict on our children is for any of them to leave school without being fully literate.  Special resources must be made available to national schools which will cater for socially and economically disadvantaged children.  This is specially important in larger urban areas where there is not perhaps the same home motivation in some disadvantaged areas and where the job for the teacher is made all the more difficult as a result.  Extra resources have been given over and above the capitation grants.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for national school building is to be transferred from the Office of Public Works to the Department of Education.  Every man and woman lauds this announcement.  Quite frankly, rightly or wrongly, boards of management in particular considered the old system, whereby they trudged between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Education and back again <i>ad nauseam,</i> to be only a delaying factor.  Perhaps that is slightly unfair, but that was the perception on the ground.  I am afraid that in the short few months I had to deal with the system, I was beginning to wonder exactly what the necessity of it all was.  A very wise decision was made to tidy up the situation in that area. The Construction Industry Federation also had a lot to say in this and welcomed this change.</P>
    <P>In Wexford, we have a very large primary school building programme.  At the moment 50 schools are either just completed or under various stages of construction. Those who criticise the Government commitment to the capital programme for primary schools should examine it in the context of the long-term needs of our community.  As I have said, <Col N="2027" /> we will have to accept temporary accommoderation as a solution in the short term. In the long term, by the turn of the century we will not need all the extra classrooms for which we now have a demand.</P>
    <P>A difficult area is the amalgamation of small urban schools &mdash; the two and three teacher schools.  This will only be done as these schools come up for replacement. This area needs the utmost sensitivity in handling.  The local school is a landmark in a community and there is tremendous pride in rural villages with regard to it. This matter will be dealt with competently by a Minister such as Deputy Hussey, who has the sensitivity to understand what is involved, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Pilot projects will be undertaken in the teaching of science and in the use of computers at selected national schools. Often children know more about computers than their teachers do, particularly the younger children because of the great interest being shown.  An area which we can look at is how the leisure time of young children and their particular hobbies and interests can direct them towards tremendous educational facilities.  The various games and interests of children over the last few years have all been based on electronics, with particular emphasis on computers.  This will have a tremendous spin-off over the years as these children go up through the educational system and come into the work place.</P>
    <P>Under special education many provisions have been made.  A number of teachers will be appointed and trained to provide a programme of instruction for the severely mentally handicapped.  The present provision for the education of the mildly handicapped in post primary schools by way of additional teachers will be expanded.  I favour the integration, if at all possible, of all mildly handicapped people into the ordinary national school system.  Any back-up which we can give to teachers in our national schools to help them to include these children in their classrooms would be most welcome.  To go through life with any type of handicap is isolating enough.  If you have to be <Col N="2028" /> hived off at a very young age into a special category in a school confidence is shattered and it is very hard for these people to take their rightful place in the community after their school years unless they are educated with their peer group.</P>
    <P>It is also very important for children who are lucky enough not to have a handicap of any sort to learn to cope with, and appreciate, the position of children who have these different problems.  For years in this country &mdash; I suppose it was the same elsewhere &mdash; our answer to these children was to lock them behind the doors of institutions and it was very much a case of out of sight out of mind.  I am delighted now with the enlightened policy in which there is hardly a national school that does not have in many of its classes a child with a handicap of some sort.  The importance of this for the handicapped child and the child not so unfortunate cannot be over-emphasised.  We must accept these children as part of our country and ensure they take their rightful place in the community with all of us.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister during the year removed the condition that an Irish qualification was necessary to teach handicapped children.  This issue had not been tackled.  I had many representations during the 18 months I have been here from eminently qualified people to teach handicapped children who, because they did not have an Irish qualification, could not, for example, teach deaf children.  If we get deaf children communicating adequately in one language we have done a very good day's work.  I am delighted this matter has been tackled.  It has opened the door to some people with tremendous qualifications to have access to our children and the systems in which they have been taught.</P>
    <P>The capitation rate which obtains in special schools will be applied to special classes in national schools.  This emphasises what I have just said about the acceptance of these handicapped children in our normal school system.  Good back-up services are needed.  These services exist at the moment for deaf children in ordinary schools.  I do believe they are as adequate as they should be <Col N="2029" /> for children suffering from other types of handicap.</P>
    <P>When we talk about special education it is salutary to remind ourselves that only 50 per cent of all travellers' children are yet at school.  The recommendation of the review body on travelling people underlined this particular fact and recommended that appropriate action be taken.  Before educational action can be taken more action needs to be taken at local authority level to house the travellers. Once we get them settled we can get the children to school.  I know that the children in Wexford integrate very well in the local national schools if they are given a chance.</P>
    <P>Under second level education the programme for action indicates tremendously important areas where action needs to be taken.  I have already referred to the greater flexibility which will be given to schools to introduce alternative curricula at primary level.  This is very welcome at secondary level.  The Curriculum and Examinations Board will be spending time providing greater harmony between the curriculum at primary school and the transition into secondary school I have already mentioned my views on the maths curriculum.  I feel that this curriculum up to sixth class in primary schools bears little relevance to what is taught in first class at secondary level. The transition from primary to secondary school is difficult enough for many children but to have the curriculum out of step and out of harmony adds to the problem.</P>
    <P>Special emphasis is to be given under this particular section of second level education to pupils who are likely to drop out before they complete compulsory education, those who terminate their schooling at the end of the compulsory cycle.  The 15 to 18 year old group need special attention here.  There needs to be a better relationship generally between education, training and the world of work.  More relevance in this area and more understanding of what is before the children would appear to be on the cards. A discussion paper is to be prepared on the number of years to be spent at the post-primary school level and on the general <Col N="2030" /> question of restructuring post-primary courses.  It is felt by many that a sixth year is necessary if the child is going on to higher education.  At 16½ or 17 years they are often too young and immature to know their own minds.  As a result this contributes to a high drop out rate in some courses at third level.  This aspect has to be considered with enlightened discussion on the age that the child should enter the primary school cycle for the greatest educational benefits.  The primary school entry age, the secondary school entry age, the number of years in secondary school must be considered together by our educationalists.  We must listen, talk and have a proper dialogue and come to an agreed solution as to what is best for the educational requirements of our children in this matter.</P>
    <P>The granting of school fees and the capitation grant are to be combined to form one <i>per capita</i> grant for schools within the free educational scheme and from the school year 1984-85 this will be based on enrolment numbers of pupils rather than on attendance as heretofore. This will be welcomed.  When it is such an obvious issue one wonders why it was not done long ago.</P>
    <P>Secondary schools will be empowered to appoint part-time teachers within the quota of full-time posts instead of the equivalent number of full-time teachers. This will give more flexibility in introducing different subjects into the curriculum. We are committed to improving the pupil-teacher ratio as circumstances permit but to call for increased ratio at every different level now without indicating where the resources will come from is irresponsible.  I, like many Deputies, have beaten the path to the Minister's door with requests from schools in Wexford for an extra teacher for different subjects for schools in particular difficulty. Many, when there was an essential subject involved, resolved their difficulties but others could not because they did not conform to the guidelines for the pupil-teacher ratio as laid down by the Minister.  She has an extremely difficult job to do in this area.  All I can say is that I hope circumstances will permit, as soon as possible, that attention can be given to <Col N="2031" /> this.  I feel if we could improve the pupil-teacher ratio at primary and secondary school levels there would be less demand for remedial teachers.  There would be less demand for some other type of institutional reform in our community generally if we could get at the children when they are young enough and give them the attention they need.</P>
    <P>The co-operation of industry and business will be sought in providing opportunities for post-primary school pupils to familiarise themselves with new developments in technology.  I will take this point up again when I refer briefly to third level institutions generally and the industrial world.  I welcome oral examinations in modern continental languages which are to be introduced in 1986 as part of the leaving certificate examination. We must encourage the use of modern languages and skills because we must never forget that we are a committed partner of the EEC now.  Indeed, the EEC is providing a tremendous source of experience and jobs for many of our qualified third level graduates who have expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>Urgent consideration is to be given to the review of the place of participative citizenship in the school curriculum.  This will really be an example of democracy in action in our schools.  Issues of citizenship in general and political awareness can be dealt with.  If our children are taught to understand the system and the alternatives available they will be in a position to choose wisely and to know what they want from the very systems of administration we have when they are old enough to have an input.  Suitable structures are to be introduced between the Department of Education and the various State agencies involved in education and vocational training with a view to avoiding unnecessary duplication of scarce resources.  This is long awaited. The appointment of Deputy George Birmingham as Minister of State at the Department of Labour and at the Department of Education shows the co-ordination we can expect in this particular area.</P>
    <P>Many problems are being experienced' <Col N="2032" /> by those involved at third level.  The Government will continue to provide third-level education for as many young people as possible but it is essential to get the best possible value at this level for the taxpayer, though it is also important at primary and second level.  Priority and financial support will be given to academic developments which are geared to ensuring that graduates are kept abreast of rapidly changing technology. We have mentioned the importance of interesting our children in this area.</P>
    <P>The first report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses was published recently.  I am a member of this committee and the report relates to manufacturing industry in general.  The committee recommended as follows:</P>
    <P>Third-level institutions should be specifically responsible for obtaining and disseminating information on new developments in technology.  The wealth, talent, expertise, experience and facilities of these institutions in every industrial discipline should be made available for the benefit of industry. A framework should be introduced on a pilot basis to develop active partnerships between third-level institutions and manufacturing industry, to use third-level skills and experience in raising industrial performance and improving technology, to train graduates for careers in industry and to provide teaching staff with direct industrial experience on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>Funds should be made available to bring student ideas up to the stage where a proposal could be considered under the Feasibility Study Grants Scheme.  Students must be encouraged to seriously consider the possibility of starting their own businesses as an alternative to seeking employment in the traditional fashion.  Funds of £5,000 per college should be provided.</P>
    <P>Here again we are suggesting that money be provided without saying where it should come from.  This report is an excellent document and I commend it to those who are interested in third-level <Col N="2033" /> education.  That section of the report, taken with what the Minister said this morning, shows that we have already gone down the road to a greater or lesser extent.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to links with business and industry and stated:</P>
    <P>As indeed also with second-level education, there is a need for closer links between the third-level institutions and the world of work.  A good deal has already been accomplished in this area and links have been forged between the industrial and commercial world with a number of our third-level institutions.  This kind of linkage is mutually beneficent: the needs of the business world become known to the institutions and have an influence on their courses, while the business world in turn can use the institutions for research and development work and sponsor the kind of developments in the institutions which would have a spin-off for the business world.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to give the example of the tremendous co-operation between the dairy science faculty in UCC and a County Cork co-operative in developing the processing of cheese for export.  This is an excellent example of what can be achieved by the envolvement of the two interests.  She also mentions the NIHE in Limerick and the developments there which, with funding from the NBST, have resulted in a company which produces and markets an automatic power supply test system in Ireland, the UK and the US.</P>
    <P>Many of us believe that one of the major solutions to our appalling unemployment problem rests with the encouragement of small business.  Anything we can do in the educational field to co-ordinate and co-operate with third level to achieve such an outcome must be applauded.  I commend the Minister and the third-level institutions for what they have done already and I urge the Minister to refer to the report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses to see if anything more can be done to co-ordinate the efforts of Members of this House to achieve the essential outcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2034" /> The CII back the Minister in regard to new technology.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 19 March 1984 stated:</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry has pledged it will play its part in a constructive debate on the education system sought by Minister Hussey.</P>
    <P>They welcomed the publication of the Action Programme for Education and backed many of its proposals and stressed that the emphasis on developments in new technology was particularly important to the economic growth of the nation.  We are indeed lucky that we have a Minister who recognises the essential priority that must be given to this area if we are to deal as capably as possible with the unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>A review is to be undertaken concerning the extent to which the regional technical colleges have succeeded in achieving the goals originally set out.  I referred earlier to Wexford's wish for its own RTC and the importance of such an institution to an area in attracting industry.</P>
    <P>There is still a general bias against vocational and technical education.  This is rapidly diminishing but it is a matter which must be faced.  At secondary school level in Wexford we have sufficient places for applicants but they are not always the places of their first choice. There is a preference for the traditional type of education, particularly in rural areas, and parents would rather use the traditional schooling system in giving their children the education they themselves, in many cases, did not receive.  It is in the interests of all of us to show that the vocational system is what it is meant to be.  Perhaps a public relations programme is necessary.  The education, training and curriculum are second to none.  I speak particularly about Wexford since I have little knowledge of other areas.  We find it very difficult to convince parents that this is the case.  Time will prove us right but in the meantime there will continue to be problems as each year pupils look for places in secondary schools.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve a greater throughput of students at third level without incurring major capital costs the feasibility <Col N="2035" /> of redesigning courses on the basis of a four-term academic year will be examined. Perhaps there should be a similar assessment of capital facilities at secondary school level.  If we continue to have very expensive buildings we will have to work out a system whereby they are utilised more, particularly during the holidays and perhaps the weekends and evenings. If the taxpayer is paying for this system, we will have to ensure that he gets maximum value and return for it.</P>
    <P>I would mention again the futility of demanding more of everything, of accepting a shopping list such as Deputy O'Rourke gave us last March, without putting our money where our mouth is. I commend this Estimate.  Our education system is in very sound hands.</P>

      <P>While I accept the norm that a Deputy can speak on an issue such as this for as long as he or she wishes, I understood there was an agreement that each Deputy would speak for half an hour.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Durkan gave as the reason for so many teachers being unemployed that the number of teachers available was more than the market could bear.  Let me remind Deputy Durkan and the House that in so far as primary teachers are concerned the Department of Education <Col N="2036" /> rigidly control the intake to the colleges of education and permit only the number they regard as necessary in any year. Therefore the Department have a moral responsibility to unemployed primary teachers to see to it that they are employed immediately.  Many people are without employment because the present Minister made changes in the pupil-teacher ratio since she assumed office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the debate in Private Members' Time on 14 and 15 February 1984 which dealt with the issues raised in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, an amended motion put down in my name and in the name of the Minister for Finance calling on Dáil Éireann to note that deposit taking institutions are subject to statutory regulations and that it is the intention of the Government to take such further steps as it may consider necessary to strengthen control in this area, was agreed.  In the course of the debate the Minister for Finance and I indicated certain areas which were being looked at. I have nothing further to add in the matter at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the continuing anxiety in the minds of thousands of small investors whose money is at risk because it was invested in the society named in the Dáil debate?  Would he indicate for the benefit of the general public if any profits have been made so <Col N="2037" /> that those small investors can be guaranteed repayment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that during the seventies it became a practice for the provident societies to take deposits because these societies were exempt from the controls that applied to deposit taking institutions generally under the Central Bank Act.  Since 1978 legislation has been introduced with a view to eliminating such societies over a five-year period because it was felt that such societies represented a serious danger to the security of depositors' savings due to the absence of controls.  At the time of the 1978 legislation and since, warnings were given to people that it was not in their best interests to place investments with societies which did not have the relevant assurance provided in the Central Bank Act.  Court cases have been taken in regard to the validity of the legislation. Efforts are being made to wind up the societies.  Many of them have gone out of business and it is expected that the remainder will be wound up in the reasonably near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important issue because there are many thousands of small investors who are continually writing to Deputies, including me, in the hope that the Minister might give them some hope that their deposits will be returned.  How many societies have been wound up, how many remain to be wound up and can the Minister say if any direct action has been taken since the society we are talking about came to prominence a short time ago?  Does he know it is common knowledge that that society was and would still be viable if it were not for difficulties in another area in which they had a joint interest?  Will the new Central Bank Bill make provision whereby the depositors can be indemnified against losses they might suffer because of that collapse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will. The position in regard to the society referred to has been dealt with.  Considering the warnings that were given over an extended period it would not be <Col N="2038" /> appropriate to ask the taxpayers to recoup investments made by people despite those warnings.  There is no intention to move in that direction.  However, legislative proposals are in train in regard to the new Central Bank Bill which will improve safeguards in future in respect of deposit taking by various institutions and individuals.  There is also the possibility of legislation to control such activities by insurance brokers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the estimated market share of the food distribution system in the country controlled <Col N="2039" /> by multinationals; the percentage market share controlled by the four major multiples operating in the country; the estimated number of independent retail grocers now in operation in the country; and the estimated number of people employed in the grocery retail trade generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent official statistics published by the Central Statistics Office for this sector, which I regret relate to 1977, show that supermarket outlets, defined as self-service establishments having three or more check-out points, accounted for about 48 per cent of the total turnover; the remainder being accounted for by independent and symbol group stores.  The published returns do not give individual market shares for reasons of confidentiality nor is any distinction made as between Irish and non-Irish multiple supermarket groups.  It should be noted however that two of the top four supermarket groups operating in this country are Irish owned.</P>
      <P>The total number of persons engaged in the retail grocery sector was estimated to be 24,634 of which 18,598, or over 75 per cent, were accounted for by independent or non-supermarket establishments, which numbered 7,305.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is now estimated that four major multinationals control 80 per cent of all retail grocery sales in Dublin and 50 per cent of all country operations?  Does he not agree that the time has been reached when some measures must be taken to contain and to control the spread of multinationals which are having a detrimental effect on independent retail traders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Powers exist under the Mergers and Monopolies Act to deal with problems which might arise because of the creation of monopolies.  However, in the case of these retail outlets it must be said the four major groups control a substantial share of the business, that they are in a very active competition with one another, but there is no evidence that they are engaging in concerted pricing <Col N="2040" /> practices to the detriment of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his predecessor, Deputy Cluskey, indicated to the House that legislation to control the spread of multinationals was almost ready?  Further, is he aware that a previous Minister, Deputy Kelly, had in mind proposing legislation &mdash; this was the way he put it.  In fact, the Minister's party in 1981 put forward a Private Members' Bill for that purpose.  Does he intend to continue on the lines suggested by his predecessors and his party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the points made by the Deputy.  I have studied this matter carefully.  I have noted the controls introduced under the Planning Acts in August 1983 by a previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Burke, where a large number of factors now must be taken into account by the planning authorities and the Planning Appeals Board, including the effect on local retailers, the availability of retail outlets to old and disabled people who might not be able to travel long distances to supermarkets and all the other social considerations the Deputy may have in mind.  All of these must be taken into account by the democratically elected planning authority and, subsequently if there is disagreement, by the Planning Appeals Board.  I am anxious to see how that legislation works in practice.  I had a discussion with representatives of IADT and RGDATA yesterday on this subject and I have asked them for their assessment as to how the existing legislation is working.  I hope to have concrete discussions with them on individual cases where they feel the legislation may not have worked adequately.  I would be reluctant to promote new legislation with possibly unforeseen effects until I was fully satisfied the existing legislation was not working reasonably.  I am actively considering the matter.  I have had a meeting in the past 24 hours with representatives of the small retailers and I have also met the supermarket groups.</P>

Will the Minister not agree that any attempt to deal with the situation through the planning process would be unlikely to be adequate?

I do not necessarily agree with the second and the third parts of the Deputy's question. There are inherent dangers in getting involved in over-heavy regulation of what should be a competitive trade in the interests of the consumer.  However, if I thought the development in the trade was leading to a monopolistic situation to the exploitation of the consumer or the destruction of necessary outlets for the retail trade, of course I would be prepared to take action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware of the difficulty being experienced by independently-owned cinemas in gaining access to first run films and of the sale of Rank circuit to a company <Col N="2043" /> (details supplied); if he is also aware of the monopoly situation in the distribution of first run pictures; and if he will outline the steps he proposes to take to see that a fair and equitable system operates in the distribution of motion pictures in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the question of supply and distribution of cinema films in Ireland has already been the subject of a public inquiry carried out by the Restrictive Practices Commission under section 5 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  The commission's findings and recommendations were that conditions in the trade were not such as to warrant the making of a ministerial order under the 1972 Act.</P>
      <P>In particular the commission found that the major cinema groups and distributors were not party to any agreements designed to create monopolies in Dublin city centre.  Neither did they find that the terms of rental applied to different cinemas by various renters, while varying in different locations and situations, were unfairly discriminatory.  Furthermore, their examination of the accounts of the principal cinema companies did not lend support to a conclusion that terms had been unfairly discriminatory.  In the circumstances, I do not feel that any further action is necessary in this respect.</P>
      <P>As regards the sale of the Rank circuit, this proposal was notified to me under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, and I decided to refer it to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices for investigation.  The examiner has now submitted his report to me and I will be taking a final decision on the proposal shortly.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission.  1978 &mdash; page 61, section 7, subsection (16) (2) &mdash; it was suggested that the independent city centre cinemas should enjoy a second run status at least on a par with suburban cinemas but that the renters are not prepared to accommodate themselves to that?  Thus we have a problem.  That report made a <Col N="2044" /> recommendation that has not been complied with.  The major cinema groups and the distributors are virtually a monopoly. The examiner in the presentation he made to the commission said a monopoly existed but they did not uphold that.  My other question related to the independent cinemas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The trouble is that the Deputy is asking several questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that if I get in with two supplementary questions the Chair may be more lenient.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of the Deputy, I wish to point out that at least one of my illustrious predecessors, and perhaps more, ruled it is not in order to ask more than one supplementary question at a time.  I am afraid I overlooked that ruling and I am thinking of invoking it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a part supplementary to the second part of the question, is the Minister aware that in the question of the take-over of the particular group of cinemas to which the Minister referred, the Independent Cinemas Association were in constant contact with the examiner but that he refused to meet them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the facts as quoted in the second half of the Deputy's question and I have expressed my concern to the examiner on that point.  The reference to the report is not quite accurate.  They said that although they recognised the difficulties the ICA should encourage ventures to promote experiments with concurrencies, particularly where there is a move-over and should also afford independent city centre cinemas second run status at least on a par with suburban cinemas if so requested by the exhibitor concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they to apply that on request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an encouragement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Encouragement from the <Col N="2045" /> examiner of the Restrictive Practices Commission usually indicates that he is requesting them to do so.  The Minister is aware that they are not complying with that and I should like him to take the matter up further with them.  Is the Minister aware that, since the question was put down, another independent cinema has closed, the basic reason being the lack of access to marketable products? Would the Minister consider applying regulations in so far as they apply in the United Kingdom where the situation in regard to monopoly control has been stated in law and where distribution has to take place to independent cinemas four weeks after exclusiveness has been removed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the commission recommended against making a mandatory order.  They suggested fair practice rules and had a number of meetings with persons involved in the trade with a view to drawing up such rules.  In the course of these meetings it became apparent to the commission that, as a result of their interventions and those of the examiner, arrangements had evolved which were working to the satisfaction of the greater part of those in the cinema trade.  The commission, accordingly, announced in May 1982 that they did not intend to make these fair practice rules which would not have been statutory but voluntary.  It might also be of interest to the Deputy and the House to know that an observer from the office of the examiner of restrictive practices now attends meetings of the product allocation committee of the Society of Film Distributors which is the body responsible for adjudicating on disputes in relation to film distribution outside Dublin.  As far as Dublin is concerned, there have been complaints but the relevant authorities, the examiner and the commissioner, have not recommended any action to be made in regard to these complaints and they are the people who investigate in the first place.  I am prepared, in the light of the concern expressed, to discuss the matter with the examiner and, if appropriate, with the commission to see if they have any advice to offer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism when he proposes to deal with the application of the Association of International Accountants for recognition as company auditors under section 162 (1) (a) of the Companies Act, 1963; if he is satisfied that the qualifying examinations are comparable in standard and scope with those of the established bodies of accountants in the Republic; if he will agree that in equity the members of the association should be allowed to practise the profession of accountancy throughout the Republic and also become eligible for appointment in the Government service as accountants and other executive appointments where a professional accountancy qualification is one of the conditions for appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Applications by the Association of International Accountants for recognition under section 162 (1) (a) of the Companies Act, 1963, as amended by section 6 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982 have been dealt with on a number of occasions over the years but, following careful consideration of the matter, successive Ministers did not see fit to grant the recognition sought because it could not be established that the membership had suitably high academic qualifications or experience.</P>
      <P>While I am aware that the qualifying standards of the association have recently been brought into line with those of other accountancy bodies which are recognised under the Companies Acts, I could not grant recognition unless I was satisfied that the great majority of their members had attained the necessary qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> I should point out that officials of my Department met with representatives of the association in December 1983 when they agreed to submit additional data in support of their application for recognition. When this information is received the matter will then be given further consideration.</P>
    <P>Failure to qualify for appointment as company or public auditor does not preclude the employment of persons with accountancy qualifications in other areas where such qualifications are required; it is a matter for prospective employers to decide the necessary qualifications.  My functions relate only to the question of qualification for appointment as company and public auditors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the international accountants are the only body who have their examinations moderated, is the Minister satisfied that their examinations, markings and standards are comparable to other examinations held by similar institutions for some years now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since about 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was around then that the British authorities decided to recognise their examination in the same way.  Is the reason for the Minister's refusal to recognise them prompted by the fact that the British have not yet given recognition?  I would be sad to think that this was the case but the Minister could act in a reforming way by giving the lead in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would be a sufficient reason to disqualify any association from recognition, just because the authorities of their country of origin did not allow them an equivalent recognition.  We have an obligation to look at this case on its merits.  However, the vast bulk of the membership of the association have not qualified under the improved examination requirements and to give a blanket recognition to the entire practice, including people who are a long time in the trade, might not necessarily be in the best interest of the consumer. <Col N="2048" /> I have looked at this matter since the Deputy's question was put down and I have not finally concluded my deliberations on this subject but I am advised that there would be considerable problems in granting recognition at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is entirely logical that certain persons should be allowed to practice accountancy and is there illogicality in maintaining that prohibition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that one might wish to change it.  On the other hand, the trend in company law is to place increased rather than reduced obligations on auditors to satisfy themselves that companies' accounts are in good order and that creditors and employees are protected.  To move on the one hand to increase the obligation which is what forthcoming legislation will be doing and at the same time to relax the statutory requirements as to qualifications would be illogical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the creditors and people dealing with business, even though they are unincorporated, are entitled to the same degree of protection from the auditors of those businesses as those in incorporated companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in the case of organisations that have limited liability.  Where there is unlimited liability clearly one can pursue the people involved as to their personal assets. Therefore there is a greater obligation to ensure that the latter are properly run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the International Association of Accountants are supported by the trade union movement and by business in their effort to have themselves recognised? Would he not agree that he is acting contrary to natural justice in that they have performed every task set to them?  Their examinations and their professional competency are accepted by all groups both here and abroad as being <Col N="2049" /> sufficient to warrant their acceptance. Would the Minister agree that all it requires to resolve the matter is an initiative on his part in consultation with his opposite number on the other side of the Irish Sea?  I think the Minister recognises that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not over emphasise the cross-Channel dimension.  It is not particularly important in my mind.  I said in my reply that the association were asked for further information in December 1983 and, to the best of my knowledge, that information has not yet been forthcoming. When it is forthcoming, I will be prepared to look at it, without necessarily being bound by anything colleagues in any other country might do.</P>

      <P>This information might make it possible for the question to be answered positively.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The following directives relating to company law have yet to be translated into national law by the Irish Government: Third Council Directive adopted on 9 October 1978; Fourth Council Directive adopted on 25 July 1978; Council Directive 79/279/EEC adopted on 5 March 1979; Council Directive 80/390/EEC adopted on 17 March 1980; Council Directive 82/121/EEC adopted on 15 February 1982; Sixth Council Directive adopted on 17 December 1982; Seventh Council Directive adopted on 13 June 1983; Eighth Council Directive adopted on 10 April 1984.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the implementation of the Fourth Directive on Company Law was set out in reply to a written question on 16 May 1984 in which I indicated that I have in preparation at present a comprehensive memorandum dealing with all the complex issues involved in this Directive which require detailed examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect to finalise in the very near future my proposals to Government in this matter.  In the meantime the basic work on preparing implementing legislation has been carried out in my Department so that once decisions are taken, the process of implementation will proceed without delay.  It is not possible at this stage to specify a precise date by which these measures will be implemented and while I would wish to have a Bill circulated before the summer <Col N="2051" /> recess, this may not be possible due to the complexities of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>The draft of the necessary legislation in relation to Directives 79/279/EEC, 80/390/EEC and 82/121/EEC is at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to bring them into effect in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated that various things are at an advanced stage, but some of these Directives date from 1978.  Does the company law reform which apparently was at an advanced stage under the previous Minister incorporate these Directives, or does it deal only with Irish company law and not take the European Directives into account?

The other concerns the Fourth Directive which is in regard to the publication of accounts of private companies.  Both of those have been submitted to me, one in the relatively recent past and the other some time ago.  The issues raised are extremely complex.  I am working very hard on them to try to come to conclusions about them.  In regard to the Fourth <Col N="2052" /> Directive I hope, if possible, to introduce it before the summer recess.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the comments referred to in the Deputy's question. The Deputy will be aware that the IDA published in January last a study entitled &ldquo;Consumer Foods: Ideas for Development&rdquo;, which identified a range of new consumer food products which have potential for production here.  The study also underlined the important role the wholesale and retail grocery trade could play in the further development of the Irish food industry.</P>
      <P>I have met recently with representatives of the supermarket groups and I will be having discussions shortly with the independent wholesale and retail grocery trade.  The purpose of these discussions is to explore what useful role the retail and wholesale trades might play in overall economic and industrial development. The IDA study is among the issues being raised in the discussions.</P>
      <P>I must stress, however, that it is a matter for private enterprise to exploit any opportunities that arise as a result of the IDA's study and the follow-up promotional work undertaken by the IDA.  If new proposals emerge as a result of the study, appropriate financial and other assistance will be provided for viable projects.</P>
      <P>Might I correct one point?  The meeting with the wholesale and retail grocery trade took place yesterday.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is a great opportunity there for development not alone in the food industry but in other areas of consumer goods? Will he agree with me that the supermarket chains should be more forthcoming in working with the IDA, especially the small industry section, and helping them identify market trends &mdash; something they do anyway?  Will the Minister agree that if there was closer co-operation a considerable number of jobs would be created and new projects got under way?  Will the Minister make his best efforts to bring those areas together and explore the opportunities that exist?  In my view they can be exploited because at the end of the day it is in the interests of the supermarkets that the economy is viable and that the money is kept for jobs here.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy asked that question.  I could not agree more with him.  There are tremendous opportunities and a lot of good things that supermarkets can do to help Irish manufacturers, particularly in the food area, to get going by giving them an opportunity to have a guarantee of displaying their products.  Own-brand products offer an opportunity for small manufacturers to get involved without having to undertake the development of their own independent brand image as an initial step.  I also think that the contractual arrangements made by the supermarkets with the companies in their infancy should be such as not to impose undue cash flow problems on the companies in the early stages until they get established.  I am proposing &mdash; I have already done so in one case &mdash; to meet all the major supermarkets to impress this point on them.  I have got a reasonably good response from a general meeting with them.  I intend to meet each one individually.  I welcome what the Deputy has said and I would welcome his support, and the support of his party, for what we are trying to achieve in this area. In the interim, any influence any member of the public can bring to bear on supermarkets <Col N="2055" /> in this direction would be most welcome.</P>

      <P>Marketing assistance is given to small industries by a number of State agencies notably CTT in relation to the export market, and the Irish Goods Council in relation to the home market.</P>
      <P>The Irish Goods Council are the body who are principally concerned with providing assistance in respect of local trade fairs.  I understand that their overall policy in this regard is to make organisational expertise available, together with modest funding, in certain cases, subject to there being a significant level of financial support and commitment at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that a fresh look should be taken at this area because quite a number of local communities have a lot of activity going on but do not get an opportunity of showing their wares with a view to encouraging the home or export markets?  I should like to refer to such an event last weekend in Ballyhaunis which was opened by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Kavanagh.  That was a marvellous success and if the Minister checks with his colleague he will learn that it was a great indication of what is possible in a small community if goods manufactured locally are put on display.  It encourages extra growth in national and international sales.  Will the Minister agree to have another look at this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Court of Justice, in a judgment made in November 1982, found that the organisation by the Government of promotional campaigns of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; kind on the home market was inconsistent with obligations under the Treaty of Rome.  I understand that the Treaty of Rome does not prevent such schemes being operated by private individuals or groups and that a number of private groups are in fact currently operating such schemes here.  I note, for <Col N="2057" /> example, that the Guaranteed Irish Scheme which formerly operated under the aegis of the Irish Goods Council, was recently relaunched by private interests.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the maintenance of international competitiveness under the headings of price, quality and delivery performance, together with the development and availability of new products, is essential if Irish firms are to compete successfully against imports on the domestic market.  The extensive services and expertise of the State agencies are available to assist Irish industry in this regard.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are no official statistics which would enable an accurate answer to be given to the second part of the Deputy's question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I do not have them with me.  The latest figure is that there are approximately £250 million of food imports altogether.  I believe that somewhere in the region of half of those would be substitutable.  I am speaking from memory.  I do not have the type of general statistical information the Deputy seeks.  However, the various agencies are working on the production of data banks in respect of individual sectors where imports, particularly by industry, could be produced by Irish industry for other Irish industries.  They are being identified on a data bank in the IIRS with the co-operation of the IDA. That type of practical information is available on a data bank.  I would refer people to the IIRS.  On global statistics, <Col N="2058" /> there seems to be a deficiency in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister obviously has taken some interest in this as far as food imports are concerned.  I agree with what he said particularly when one considers that fruit and vegetable imports between 1977 and 1982 rose from £52.7 million to £149 million while dairy imports in the same period rose from £10.7 million to £31.2 million.  Will the Minister agree that it is time the Government embarked on an import substitution programme, similar to one that was introduced by the last administration?  Will the Minister indicate his willingness to continue his efforts in the hope that he will be able to do something about the problem?</P>

      <P>In areas such as telecommunications and defence countries have exemption from the normal requirements in regard to the non-discriminatory purchase of goods.  It is contrary to EEC rules to enter into discriminatory practices in regard to public procurement. Industries located in Ireland have suffered considerably in their export efforts as a result of contravention of this requirement by certain member governments, and I have complained about this matter.  I went specially to Brussels to meet the Commissioners Narjes and Andriessan to complain about this question because of the damage it was doing to industrial development in this country. However, I do not think the best way to get rid of it is to start practising it ourselves.</P>

There is room for improvement in that area without infringing any regulations.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in reply to a previous question from him on this subject, I believe that import substitution can best be achieved through Irish firms being in a position to compete successfully with imports in such areas as price, quality, product development and delivery performance.  Irish firms can avail of the extensive services and expertise of the State agencies in assisting them in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland is generally <Col N="2061" /> precluded by its EEC obligations from restricting the import of materials produced in other member states.  However, I am anxious to encourage Irish firms generally to maximise business opportunities available to them.  Examples of recent initiatives by me in this area are the discussions with certain commercial State bodies, the Irish Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management and the retail and wholesale grocery trade, to identify a positive role for them in the development of small business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly 90 per cent of the Irish export trade is governed by the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</P>
      <P>The external trading environment is watched by my Department on a continuing basis and remedial action is taken as warranted.  Irish exports generally have not been seriously affected, in the EEC or elsewhere, by measures such as those mentioned by the Deputy.  Córas Tráchtála in their day-to-day contacts with exporters are constantly on the alert for any such barriers and in co-operation with my Department arrange for appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the Council of Europe document, Ireland has continued with the other member states of the EEC to avoid new restrictive measures and has pledged itself to roll back protectionism. <Col N="2062" /> The maintenance of the free international trading system continues to be our policy in discussions in the various international trading organisations.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred in reply to supplementaries to Question No. 12 that Irish exporters, particularly in some EEC countries, are hit by protective and local &ldquo;buy national&rdquo; promotion measures.  My question refers not only to protection but to harassments, delays and matters of that nature.  Having regard to the very serious degree of interference shown in the Council of Europe report, can the Minister say whether there has been any improvement since then?

It did not consist of a lot of analyses.  When one knows what has been done and what has not been done there is not a lot more to talk about.  The vast majority of the recommendations were accepted by the Government and implemented.</P>

      <P>I have indicated that I referred in Cork to those recommendations that were not accepted.  Broadly speaking, these fell into two categories. One was that rather than designate the entire greater Cork area for lower level of grant we decided to designate for a higher level of grant a number of specified industrial estates.  We thought that a better way of approaching the problem. There were recommendations in regard to tourism but it was the considered opinion of Bord Fáilte that these should not be accepted because they would involve breaking up Bord Fáilte and promoting individual parts of the country rather than promoting Ireland as a whole package. Therefore, on policy grounds, we decided not to accept those recommendations.</P>

      <P>I would not so agree.  I made it clear in Cork that the Government <Col N="2066" /> had created an environment there in which there can be a restoration of confidence in the city.  That is very important. We have also provided the people there with the tools necessary to enable them to provide jobs.  But much of the success of all this depends on the response of people in Cork to the small industries ideas and to other developments recommended in the report.  The problems of Cork or of anywhere else will not be solved by Government action alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned the debate I was dealing with Deputy Durkan's excuses for the number of unemployed teachers.  I pointed out that the Department of Education have a moral obligation to employ primary teachers because of the Department exercising very rigid control in regard to <Col N="2079" /> entry standards of students to the colleges of education.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister and Deputy Doyle said no one should suggest that more teachers and facilities should be made available in our schools without indicating where the additional money was to come from.  I assure both the Minister and the Deputy that the excuses offered by them and the Government for the cutbacks in education and for the failure to provide the necessary numbers of teachers and the necessary facilities in our schools will be a very poor consolation to those unfortunate young people whose education will be blighted because of the education policy of the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doyle made the extraordinary statement that Fianna Fáil were not interested in parental involvement in education but said that Fine Gael are interested in this aspect.  The Deputy is relatively new here and I suppose on that basis we must forgive her for her lack of knowledge on this matter.  When I was Minister for Education I appointed parents to the boards of community schools.  That was the first time parents had been appointed to the boards of any schools.  It was the first time they were given specific involvement in our educational system.  Indeed, the development since then in respect of parental involvement has followed on that original appointment of parents to the boards of community schools.</P>
      <P>I have a particular interest in parental involvement in education.  Some time ago I was especially pleased to learn that the INTO had agreed to resume parent-teacher meetings.  It is recognised generally that close co-operation between parents and teachers is vital for the development of the child.  I do not propose to give a definition of education other than to say it is concerned with the development of all the attributes of the individual to the end that he may achieve personal fulfilment and at the same time meet to the greatest extent possible his obligations to his Creator and to his fellow citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, education is not solely a matter for schools, lecture halls and programmes <Col N="2080" /> of study, though these are important elements in the whole process. The education process is a continuing one.  It begins before the age of formal schooling is attained and continues well beyond the time when the classroom and the lecture hall have been left behind. When we discuss curricula, school organisation and career opportunities we should recognise these other aspects of education.  One might regard them as elements devised to serve education. Even in dim and distant times it was accepted that the parent was the prime and natural educator of the child.  This principle has been embodied in the Christian philosophy of education which defines the function of the parent in this sense as being both a right and a duty.</P>
    <P>As civilisation advanced the concept of the school developed as an instrument to help the parent in the fulfilment of his role as an educator.  The school was not instituted either to relieve parents of their duties or to take from them the right to educate their children.  The school was devised to help parents in that role.  The closer the association between teachers and parents in matters concerned directly with the education of their children, the more valuable the help of the school is likely to be.  It has been said often that the school should be an extension of the home.  This is true in the sense that in the school there are people with special training and skills who undertake aspects of the child's development which for a variety of reasons parents cannot take on themselves.</P>
    <P>While on the concept of the school being an extension of the home I should mention something that has occurred to me often in relation to home life and social life in areas of concentrated housing in Dublin and in the larger cities and towns.  These areas have large primary schools and up to recently teachers were generally from rural backgrounds.  For the most part they had little understanding of the world from where their pupils were drawn.  For such children the school cannot be an extension of the home, unless the teacher familiarises himself with the social background of the pupils. I often thought that songs such as &ldquo;Beidh <Col N="2081" /> Aonach Amárach i gContae an Chláir&rdquo; mean little to pupils whose experience of commerce is limited to an occasional transaction at the chipper.</P>
    <P>One of my recollections of practice teaching in a Dublin school many years ago was when an inspector came into the classroom and the children were reading a story called the Crow and the Pitcher. He suggested that I explain the word &ldquo;pitcher&rdquo; because these children would go to the pictures.  Mathematical problems based on things outside the vision of a child or language lessons in Irish or English based on rural life will not appeal to those who have never been beyond the large housing estates in which they live, breathe and go to school.</P>
    <P>School education must be aimed towards a broadening of knowledge as well as developing a child's moral, intellectual and reasoning faculties.  One should not forget physical education.  The teaching skill called for is to lead a child from the experience he acquires in his home and local community to a knowledge of broader horizons without creating the impression that what he learns at school has no bearing on real life.</P>
    <P>There is vital need for close co-operation between parents and teachers so that the teacher can attain some knowledge of the family and their social background. It is understandable that I should be interested in the new curriculum because I took great interest in its development and introduced it into schools in July 1971 when I was Minister for Education.  It was the first major change in either the structure or the content of the school programme since 1926.  The old curriculum was rigidly subject centred.  The child was a passive recipient of information fed to him by the teacher.  School was another world divorced from the child's surroundings. Success or failure in life depended on the way a child mastered the basic skills of reading writing and arithmetic. This attitude was understandable when primary education was all that the majority could aspire to.  Change was taking place in that period, particularly in infant classes.  It was accepted that individual differences should be recognised and catered for and that every child should be <Col N="2082" /> encouraged to do his best but not forced beyond his capabilities.  These principles were applied in some schools to other classes.  Children played a more active role in their education with the consequent development of self-reliance, confidence and flexibility of mind.</P>
    <P>The object of the new curriculum was to create a learning environment rather than a teaching one.  The work in the school was child centred rather than subject centred.  It was to develop the child's faculties of reasoning and healthy curiosity so that he would reach out and discover knowledge for himself rather than receive it passively from the teacher. The new curriculum held out great promise for the better educational development of the child.  It did not make the task of education easier but the atmosphere was more pleasant.  Greater self-discipline was necessary.  A new orientation was required by the teacher.</P>
    <P>It was in the closer involvement of parents that the new curriculum had the greatest significance.  Pupils were encouraged to integrate their home and community experience with learning at school.  Through the child's questioning and observing in the home and elsewhere, parents are associated with their children's development.  This has helped teachers to become more what proper school educational philosophy demands, that is, that they be collaborators and partners with the parents in the preparation of young people for life.  In this way the curriculum is making a contribution towards the improvement of what is known as the quality of life.  As a result of the way the new curriculum was introduced, parents see they have a function in the educational process.  It encouraged them to consider how they could have a greater input into the process.</P>
    <P>There are no structures whereby parents and teachers can meet at present. No official time is made available for such meetings.  While efforts are made to overcome the obstacles in some schools, this is not widespread.  The Minister stated she proposes to assist the setting up of parent primary councils.  This is a step in the right direction but it is far from what is necessary.  The setting up of primary <Col N="2083" /> councils would help to give parents a greater involvement in the formulation of policy, but the reality is that what is needed is for parents to meet teachers. Teachers should have a clearer perception of the problems of parents and together they could considerably improve the education of children.  There is very little use in teachers meeting all the parents at the same time.  To be effective it must be on a person to person basis.  This may be time consuming but it is in the best interest of the child.  Official recognition should be given to this by allocating time and setting up special structures for this purpose.  As I have said, I am interested in the setting up of parent councils but that is not even half the battle.  We should not wait until parental councils are set up before we try to develop the structures which are necessary if we are to get full value from our educational system.</P>
    <P>There is one area of educational handicap to which I would like to refer, that is, the education of the travelling people. I believe education can make a worthwhile contribution to the solution of the problems.  In this area we should not confine ourselves to the education of the children alone, we should interest ourselves in providing more educational facilities for adults also.  If such facilities were availed of, newly settled travelling people would be helped to integrate with their neighbours.  Suitable courses in home management would benefit newly settled travelling people.  I am aware that such courses are available but I would be interested to know what efforts are being made by the Department and by the vocational education committees to encourage these people to attend these courses.</P>
    <P>The attitudes the settled community and the travelling people have had towards each other over many generations are not easily changed, but as a result of the efforts of many dedicated people these attitudes are gradually changing.  I think it is true to say that the majority of travelling people want to abandon their traditional wandering and to be accepted as ordinary members of <Col N="2084" /> the community.  The national aim is ultimately to absorb travelling families into the community and education is a basic need in helping them to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The educational problems of the children of travelling people are similar in many respects to those of other educationally retarded children but they are aggravated by social disabilities and other consequences of their unsettled way of life.  There are some special schools for children of travelling people where there are large concentrations of travelling people in highly populated areas, but if we are to achieve the ultimate aim of total integration, it is essential that the children attend ordinary schools.  It may be that all but the youngest children will need a period of preparation in a special class or school as a prelude to their integration in ordinary classes.  One of the lessons learned in some schools where special help has been provided for the children of travelling people has been that a high proportion of these children can take their place successfully in ordinary classes after a relatively short period of special preparation.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister would take a further look not only at the facilities provided for these children but also if she would ascertain the use being made of them and if anything further can be done to help.  Children of most, if not all, travelling people or recently settled families are likely to suffer social and cultural deprivation and perhaps the voluntary organisations would be of assistance in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the Programme for Action in Education.  When a person's actions are contrary to his expressed views and when he is not too happy about the acceptability of his actions, he tends to take refuge in the old cliché &mdash; do not do as I do but rather do as I say.  The Minister is obviously in that situation.  Since she became Minister for Education she has gone a considerable distance along the road to dismantling an education system which has been built up over the years with painstaking and loving care.  In the process she has set a pattern which will result in many young <Col N="2085" /> people being deprived of the opportunity of realising their educational potential. As a result of the Coalition Government's policy, the outlook for the educationally disadvantaged is bleak in spite of the views expressed in the Minister's document.  I have no doubt that she would be pleased if we did not concern ourselves with what she has done since assuming office, but rather that we should read her booklet and hopefully we would see that the real Minister for Education was different from what her actions would lead us to believe.  I am afraid actions speak louder than words.  As the Minister's actions are in direct contradiction to the stated objectives in that booklet, we have no alternative but to assess her period in office on her actions rather than the proposals adumbrated in that document, and more especially as the likelihood of these proposals coming to fruition are very poor.</P>
    <P>We cannot quarrel with the principles laid down in the document.  Nothing in the principles is new.  Many Ministers for Education laid down similar principles in the past, the difference being that Fianna Fáil Ministers acted positively while the same cannot be said about the present Government.  The principles as laid down in the preamble to the Programme for Action in Education are not new.  They are in the main principles on which Fianna Fáil Governments have built our educational system.  While recognising the need for further development, this is a system of which I feel we can be justifiably proud.  The objective of Fianna Fáil policy has been to provide equality of educational opportunities for all, to ensure that every person would have an opportunity to develop his or her God-given potential to the full.  Year after year, Fianna Fáil Ministers for Education continued to develop our educational system to achieve equality of educational opportunities for all.  While it was recognised that much more remained to be done, rapid progress was made under Fianna Fáil Governments in this area. We were clearly on the right road towards achieving our goal.</P>
    <P>It was a Fianna Fáil Government and Ministers for Education who decided that <Col N="2086" /> education should not be the prerogative of the few, and that it was no longer tolerable that the vast majority of our people should have to make do with a few years in a primary school and then move into the great big world to eke out an existence.  Under a Fianna Fáil Government in the late fifties and early sixties a deep study of the educational scene in Ireland was undertaken under the instruction of the then Minister for Education.  This study resulted in the publication of Investment in Education. Fianna Fáil Governments set about with a will implementing the recommendations in that publication, and the educational scene here has never been the same since.  The rapid implementation of the proposals in Investment in Education transformed the whole education scene. Free post-primary education was introduced, third level educational facilities developed and students assisted at that level.  A new primary school curriculum was introduced, programmes initiated to help the educationally disadvantaged, remedial teachers appointed, career guidance introduced and so on.</P>
    <P>The basic importance of the introduction of the free educational system was not simply that from then on post-primary education was available free of charge, because for those living near post-primary schools operated by brothers and nuns the cost of education, particularly in respect of school fees, was not high, and of course it was free in schools under the control of the VECs.  The real importance of the scheme was that for the first time the attention of all our people was directed to the fact that education was for everybody.  This resulted in a realisation among the great majority, most of whom had not themselves experienced third level education, that education was their right and that they had the same entitlement to it as those who because of their means had been in a position to avail of it in the past.  Once given the opportunity people quickly availed of the facility and the numbers attending post-primary schools increased rapidly.  School transport was provided free of charge for those living a distance <Col N="2087" /> from the post-primary school for the simple &mdash; and what should have been to everybody obvious &mdash; reason that the provision of free post-primary educational facilities was of little use to those who because of their distance from the post-primary school could not avail of them.</P>
    <P>More and more schools were built or extended and more and more teachers employed.  Children who were unable to cope were helped by remedial teachers especially qualified to deal with their problems.  Career guidance was introduced, third level education developed rapidly, regional colleges were set up. The NIHEs were established in Limerick and Dublin.  Scholarships were awarded at a whole variety of levels for young people and the basic principle involved was that every child was entitled to have his or her God-given potential developed to the degree possible in each individual case.</P>
    <P>Much was done by Fianna Fáil to develop our educational system and achieve our objective.  Much remained to be done in a world of rapid technological change.  The need for continuous development is always there.  The tragedy is, however, that with the advent of the present Coalition Government in 1982 the whole process of the development of our educational system not only stopped but went into reverse.  We are now well on our way to returning to the situation of many years ago when only those who can afford it can hope to participate in post-primary education.  This applies particularly to those living in rural areas.  Bit by bit, the whole fabric of our educational system which had been painstakingly built up over the years has been disbanded. There is scarcely a single facet of it which is not adversely affected by present Government policy.</P>
    <P>There is little point in producing a document such as the Programme for Action on Education, or in putting forward high sounding principles when at the same time every action of the Minister and the Government in respect of education is in direct contradiction to these very principles. One has only to note the many <Col N="2088" /> cutbacks made by the Government and the present Minister in money in real terms for education to appreciate that the fears which I express are well founded.</P>
    <P>Fares must now be paid on school buses, which of course is an extra taxation on parents.  Young people and their families are being penalised because of where they happen to live.  The Minister might say that those with medical cards have free passes on school buses.  We are all only too well aware that with any means test large numbers of people just above the means test limit are those most adversely affected.  The question arises as to how long such people will be able to continue to struggle to educate their children. The fact is that in many instances the children were already at post-primary schools before the introduction of these changes and efforts continued to be made by parents, but as time goes on it becomes more and more difficult.  I can see the point being reached when many families with incomes just above the medical card limit will not find it possible to continue their children's post-primary education.</P>
    <P>One of the principles enunciated in the preamble to the Minister's document is as follows:</P>
    <P>Educational provision should discriminate positively in favour of the educationally disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Minister has done exactly the opposite.  She has discriminated positively against the educationally disadvantaged.  What is the point of the Minister's enunciating high sounding principles when one primary school in my constituency, Saint Oliver's in Drogheda with over 1,300 pupils, has, as a result of the changes made in the pupil-teacher ratio by the present Minister, only one remedial teacher to cater for all its disadvantaged pupils?  Not only that, but this one teacher is not full-time on remedial work; he has other subjects to teach as well.  If this were not such a serious matter, one might regard that facet of the Minister's action plan as a joke.  I can assure the Minister that it is not a joke; it is an extremely serious matter.  It underlines the seriously damaging effect <Col N="2089" /> of the Minister's decision in respect of the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>What of the disadvantaged children in that school?  What price their future? What help will be the small amount of money which the Minister is now allocating for disadvantaged areas to them?  I have no doubt that they would be quite happy to trade that money for the appointment of more remedial teachers. One could not blame the teachers and parents in that school for a cynical reaction to the Minister's plan of action in respect of this matter.  I put down a question to the Minister explaining the situation in the school and asking that she give permission to appoint extra teachers. They needed at least nine extra teachers and were entitled to them under the normal provisions.  However, because they were a rapidly growing school they were particularly badly affected by this new pupil-teacher ratio.  The Minister gave one teacher extra last year but, as they had already one teacher over the quota, it means no increase and this year the Minister is offering them .2 of a teacher.</P>
    <P>The changes made by the Minister for Education in relation to the pupil-teacher ratio are having, and will continue to have at an accelerated rate as time passes, a most seriously detrimental effect on our whole educational system.  The really unfortunate aspect is that many parents do not yet appreciate the damage which this decision of the Minister could have on their children's education and because of the very nature of the matter they may never know what damage was caused. When a child reaches the end of his or her post-primary course it will be difficult for that child or for the child's parents to ascertain with any certainty the effect of fewer teachers, larger classes and fewer subject options on the child's educational development.  I am afraid that the present Government are taking refuge in that fact.</P>
    <P>When the Minister decided to compel parents to pay school bus fares the effect of that was easily understood by parents. They knew that this was simply a new form of taxation levied exclusively on parents of school-going children in rural areas.  Understandably, they protested <Col N="2090" /> vigorously.  But the changing of the pupil-teacher ratio in vocational and secondary schools appears to the layman to simply mean that a teacher would have one or two extra pupils to teach.  They could not see any great problem there. The reality, of course, is that there will be fewer teachers in schools because of the change and this will become a more acute problem as vacancies remain unfilled.  This change means, and will continue to mean, much larger classes in each school and the restricting of subject choices in both junior and senior cycles in post-primary schools.  It means, in many instances, that pupils taking honours courses in particular subjects will be placed in the same classes with pupils taking pass courses in the same subjects to the detriment of honours and pass students.  How can all this lead to equality of educational opportunities?  How can such a policy help each child to develop its God-given potential?  How can a child with a bent for practical or science subjects hope to reach its full potential when, as a result of the changes in the pupil-teacher ratio, these subjects are no longer available to him?  Is the Minister aware that post-primary school authorities in many instances have now informed parents who have applied to have their children taken into these schools that they will be taken but that there are conditions. The conditions are that they will not, for example in certain instances, be permitted to do science subjects or they will not be permitted in certain instances to do language subjects or some other subjects.  Parents are blaming the school authorities but the fact of the matter is that the parents should blame the Government and the Minister for Education who are responsible for the problem.</P>
    <P>In the chapter dealing with secondary education the following appears:</P>
    <P>A major need will be the development of more flexible organisations with particular regard to the needs of the lower achievers.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly what the Minister means here because, as I said earlier, while the Minister is suggesting what <Col N="2091" /> would be a good thing we find that the exact opposite is being done.  Classes, as a result of the Minister's decree will be larger.  The question I ask is will this allow for greater flexibility?  Honours and pass courses, as I said a moment ago, are now being lumped together in one class.  Will this allow for flexibility?  What about the disadvantaged child in these circumstances? In many schools there will not be a remedial teacher at all and in others, such as the one I mentioned in my constituency with over 1,300 pupils, there will be one remedial teacher devoting part of his teaching hours each week to remedial teaching.  The remedial teacher in such circumstances must feel totally helpless when faced with the enormous problem of trying to deal with the disadvantaged pupils in a school with over 1,300 pupils. I am afraid, having read the Minister's document, he will feel hopeless as well. In that particular school there is one guidance teacher for over 1,300 pupils.  Is the Minister serious?</P>
    <P>I have discussed this particular programme with many people involved in education since I got a copy of it and they have the same feeling I have about it, that it looks and reads very well but from a practical point of view and because, quite obviously, the Minister has no intention of developing it to any great extent, it will not achieve anything like what would appear on the surface it would be likely to achieve.  I do not know how anybody could accept the credibility of the Government when the Minister's actions, as I said a while ago, in relating to disadvantaged children are in direct contradiction to what she is, in effect, doing.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of schools now where there was a remedial teacher and where those teachers are no longer available.  What of the disadvantaged children in those schools?  What is the point in saying in the document that our whole purpose must be to direct our attention to the disadvantaged?  I fully agree with that aspect of it.  What is the purpose in saying it if in fact the remedial teachers have been removed from quite a considerable number of schools?  The <Col N="2092" /> only hope some children had in these schools has vanished.</P>
    <P>We must have smaller not larger classes if we are really concerned about overcoming educational disadvantages. We must have more remedial teachers not fewer and we must have more guidance teachers not fewer.  As I said earlier on, in reference to a remark made by Deputy Doyle when the Minister for Education says she is restricted by lack of finance this is very little consolation to those who lose out and will have no opportunity to retrieve their position.  It is very important that we should remember that if we have a generation of young people who, because of the cutbacks and restrictions in relation to educational policy at the present time, suffer, there is no way they can come back.  That is the major problem.  In future when money becomes available we will be dealing with a new generation of young people and, hopefully, if money becomes available we will be able to develop their talents but, in the meantime, those who are left at the moment suffering because of the Ministerial cutbacks will have missed their chance.</P>
    <P>The Minister's document refers to the recent report of the Educational Broadcasting Committee and to their recommendations regarding an investment programme for the development of educational broadcasting.  With regard to this vital element in our rapidly developing technological world we are told that this particular aspect is to be put on the long finger.  Funds will not be made available to implement what is a very necessary educational aid.  One does not have to dwell on the influence of radio and television on our young people to recognise the urgent need for development in this area.  It is an indictment of the plan of action for education covering the next few years if all it has to say on what is a vital element in our educational system or which is a vital element in the educational system in the whole developed world, is that the Minister and the Department will support the recommendation of the Broadcasting Development Committee that responsibility for educational broadcasting will be <Col N="2093" /> placed on any new agencies which may be granted a broadcasting licence in the forthcoming legislation.  This is hardly the dynamic approach expected from a programme of action in education designed to upgrade our educational system over the next four years.  In the thirties we had radio educational broadcasting for schools and in the sixties we had television school broadcasts.  In 1984 we have neither one nor the other.</P>
    <P>This is surely a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.  In a world in which there is such rapid technological change, primary teachers &mdash; indeed, all teachers &mdash; need support in subjects in which they have little experience.  Changes in curriculum present difficulties even for experienced teachers.  Radio and television programmes may be used with support material in such subjects as mathematics, Irish, nature study, environmental studies and so on.  Schools broadcasting can bring the outside world into the classroom.  It can illustrate working life and its problems and is eminently suited to deal with such matters as hygiene, dental care, sport and combating the drug problem.  We live in the space age and if the Minister's attitude is that we cannot afford to pay for educational broadcasting she can hardly hope to be taken seriously in saying that she intends to keep our curriculum up to date.</P>
    <P>In Denmark, a country which can be compared with Ireland, the average production of new programmes per year is as follows: primary schools, 25 radio hours and ten television hours; secondary schools, 25 radio hours and ten television hours; adult education, 50 radio hours and 20 television hours; a total of 100 radio hours and 40 television hours.  The Minister's plan of action informs us that nothing can be done here.</P>
    <P>It should be a matter of concern that because we have not television programmes for schools BBC programmes are being used in progressive schools in multi-channel areas.  These are excellent programmes in themselves but they portray a culture which is not ours and our way of life is endangered, particularly from programmes projected at our children <Col N="2094" /> in their most formative years.  The need for Irish-oriented programmes should be obvious.  It reminds me of the time, not too long ago, when the only qualifications we had for third level students in institutions other than universities were the London City and Guilds diplomas and degrees.  These were excellent qualifications in themselves but they were not suited to Irish conditions and needs.  The NCEA were established to cater for those needs.  Equally we need radio and television programmes to cater for our needs but we do not appear likely to get them.</P>
    <P>In the primary school sector it is proposed during the period of the plan to provide micro-computers and appropriate software in the principal teacher centres.  In Britain most primary schools have micro-computers and in Japan micro-computers have been introduced at pre-school level.  According to recent reports Ireland is one of Europe's leading manufacturers of data processing equipment, exporting over £900 million worth of equipment.  How can we hold this position if the best our educational system can do is supply only principal teacher centres with micro-computers within the next four years?  Our children must become familiar with new technology at an early age.  Money spent on such development would be an investment in the future.  I would urge the Minister to reverse her excessively timid approach to this matter and provide grants for the supply of computers to primary schools. In this age of rapid technological development and change, computers are a must if we are to keep up our educational development.  The Minister should immediately provide at least in-service courses to deal with this subject.  It is an ideal area in which to make full use of the curriculum development unit in the Department.</P>
    <P>If we ignore the need to supply our primary schools with computers the gap between children from educationally advantaged homes and those from educationally disadvantaged homes will become even greater.  Interested parents in a position to do so will buy a home computer and use the many educational <Col N="2095" /> programmes now coming on the market to educate their children, in some cases even before the children have reached school age.  This gap will cause major difficulties for teachers.  If the Minister does not at least provide grant assistance, only the primary schools with the necessary numbers and parental support will be able to afford computers.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is not disturbed by the general feeling in respect of this programme it is a poor lookout for education.  Schools in educationally disadvantaged areas, as well as small rural schools, will be unable to provide computers themselves and their pupils will be disadvantaged.  In the United States educators have found that children who have become used to home computers are turned off in the classroom when the teacher has only talk and chalk to offer and the question arises whether the teacher of the future will be able to teach at all without using new technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the pupil-teacher ratio, it is recognised in the Programme for Action <Col N="2097" /> that our position compares unfavourably with that in other developed countries, yet it is not intended to improve the position for financial reasons.</P>
    <P>I commend the exceptional work done by Deputy Wilson as Minister for Education in improving the pupil-teacher ratio.  Money was scarce then.  It was also scarce when every Fianna Fáil Minister for Education improved the pupil-teacher ratio and the facilities in the schools and were responsible for all the developments I have adumbrated.  As I have said, money was not easy to find but the Minister will not concern herself about that aspect.  Deputy Wilson as Minister was aware that children who were disadvantaged educationally could be helped only by better facilities and more teachers in the schools. I wish to repeat my appreciation of the work he did and I hope the present Minister will consider following his example.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she will provide a sum of £500,000, but that will be only £300,000 net when the school debts have been cleared.  I expect we will see highly publicised efforts in one or two areas in this city.  There are educationally deprived children in all areas throughout the country and the only way they can be helped is to reduce class sizes and to provide more teachers to look after them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Faulkner, in his hour-long contribution, said the Minister and the Government have been neglecting the educational system, that they were dismantling it, that it had been carefully built up by Fianna Fáil over the years.  He went so far as to say that the system has gone into reverse and that we would shortly be in the position in which we were years ago.  I assume that he was referring to Fianna Fáil Governments who were in office, with the sole exceptions of 1948 to 1951, 1954 to 1957 and 1973 to 1977.  Therefore, when he said the educational system has gone into reverse, that it is back to the situation in which it was years ago, he was referring <Col N="2098" /> to past Fianna Fáil Governments and their inability to deal with it.

She referred to jobs that were created and those that were lost.

We were let out of the training colleges as raw recruits and were sent down to the country to schools that had no facilities.

It has taken quite a long time to get some kind of structure and order into this matter.

Fianna Fáil speakers said that this was another opportunity for the Minister to stultify all growth in the provision of second level education.

    <P>First, I wish to deplore the extraordinary remark made by Deputy Wilson in <Col N="2101" /> his intervention regarding sectarian advice to me in my Department.  It was on a par with the anti-semitic remarks made earlier this year from that side of the House and I deplore it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with the matter of the allocation of post-primary teachers for 1984-85.  I do so because of the concern that has been expressed outside the House which I wish to allay. Concern has arisen inside and outside the House because of changes in the pupil-teacher ratio introduced last year.  They were first detailed by Fianna Fáil in their Estimates in November 1982 and they have not yet fully worked through the system.  I was surprised Deputy Faulkner spent so long on that topic because he was a member of the party that drew up the Estimates and made that decision.  I want to assure the House and the post-primary authorities, including the vocational education committees, that I will be as sympathetic as possible to their request for an improved allocation of teachers for 1984-85.  As I did last year, I will make provision to meet exceptional transitional difficulties that schools may encounter.  Again, as I did last year, I have set up appeals procedures in connection with the 1984-85 teacher allocation. A number of vocational education committees have successfully availed of the appeals procedure and have had additional teachers sanctioned.  Any school authority who thinks the teacher allocation has been insufficient should make use of the appeals procedure as established.  I wish to emphasise there has been no change in the allocation of remedial teachers in vocational schools which was made a year ago.  These posts will continue to be ex-quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that provision for pay and pensions has been increased by more than £62 million compared with 1983.  This represents an increase of 9.13 per cent.  The effect is that the percentage of the non-capital budget for education devoted to pay and pensions this year is <Col N="2102" /> 82.15 per cent compared with 81.78 per cent in 1983.  I remind Deputies that this increase is funded by the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>With regard to career guidance, let us look at the extent of the problem as it applies to secondary schools.  In the present school year there were 385 schools with career guidance teachers ex-quota. Of those, 144 with enrolments of 500 or more pupils were not affected by the changes.  Of the remaining 241 schools, 197 schools were not affected in the course of the year.  In only 44 schools were the career guidance teachers brought within the quota.  In those schools I hope that the overall policy of the school authorities will be such as to ensure that guidance to pupils will be continued.  I accepted eight hours per week as a minimum instead of the 12 hours per week which applied previously.</P>
    <P>Having drawn the attention of the House to these facts, as referred to in paragraph 5.8 of the Programme for Action, I intend to establish in consultation with interested agencies a formal mechanism to review current guidance provision and to allocate guidance posts on the basis of school needs, taking into account the range of programmes available in the schools.  It is my hope that under this mechanism it will be possible to meet the needs of schools for guidance facilities.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with two specific questions put by Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Lyons.  I can assure Deputy O'Rourke that the departmental circular relating to the terms of the higher education grants scheme will be issued to the local authorities within ten days.  With regard to notifying Deputy Lyons of payment of £500,000 in respect of disadvantaged pupils, I regret he thinks there was some delay in giving him the information. The Official Report for that day having been consulted, there is some doubt whether he said he would follow up his request.  However, I accept that he should have got the information and I assure him that he will have the full information conveyed to him next week. There has been, rightly, a lot of discussion about the role and function of parents in the educational system and I welcome <Col N="2103" /> the strong indications from the Opposition that they share our concern to maximise the role of parents.  I emphasise that the genuine recognition which parents have received from this Government in the consultation process is the first time this has ever happened.</P>

      <P>I was very interested to hear Deputy O'Rourke suggesting that the awareness of parents about the election to a board of management should be raised and I am glad to inform Deputy O'Rourke that that is what I propose to do as part of the involvement of parents. The occasion of the elections to those boards of management may also give an opportunity to select the people who could form the basis of the parents' council at primary level.  I was slightly confused by the contributions of Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Lyons.  Deputy Lyons said we had imbued everybody in education with a spirit of no hope while Deputy O'Rourke said that we had imbued everybody with a spirit of too much hope.  Perhaps they should check what the party line is on that aspect. Deputy Lyons rightly praised the technological sector of education and Deputy O'Rourke had slight apprehensions about the balance between the technological and the general or liberal arts sector.  That is a valid concern and it was good to hear both points of view expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke also mentioned that the National Planning Board recommended that there should be no cutbacks in real terms in the budget.  She went on <Col N="2104" /> to say that this year's provision was shabby and shortsighted.  It is necessary, therefore, to reiterate what I said when I introduced the Estimates this morning. The gross non-capital provision in votes for 1984 shows an increase of £78,251,286, or 9.75 per cent.  The rate of inflation is projected to be less than that, so obviously the National Planning Board and the Government are in agreement that there is no cutback in real terms in the non-capital provision.</P>
    <P>There has been mention on the other side of the House about cutbacks in the capital programme.  I am afraid to say anything to Deputy O'Rourke these days in case she accuses me of sermonising but I must point out that if Deputy O'Rourke looks into the history of capital provisions she will realise that the provision for capital must fluctuate.  The flow of capital expenditure is determined by a great number of variables, including the completion of major projects and the speed with which projects reach tender stage. There are a great many variables in governing the capital programme but it does not go up inexorably all the time.  When comparing one year with another it is, therefore, necessary to compare like with like.  In the 1984 Estimates we are providing £28.5 million for primary schools compared with a provision of £25.5 million in the 1983 Book of Estimates, an increase of £3 million.  During 1983 I made available an additional £3.1 million, so that the Book of Estimates for this year shows that the outturn for 1983 was £28.6 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner made some very interesting points, accompained by a number of assertions which he could not prove.  For the past number of years the Coalition Government have had a very positive policy in regard to education and this is identified strongly in the Programme for Action.  Deputy Faulkner said that the education system was being dismantled and that there was a lack of opportunity for our young people.  I would never deny the achievements in the sixties to which he referred but there has been a vacuum in education since 1977 as a result of the disastrous White Paper which his party introduced in 1980 <Col N="2105" /> which was full of woolly platitudes and generalities.</P>

      <P>I should also like to nail a lie which was promulgated by the Opposition.  There was no cutback in the quota of remedial teachers in post-primary schools and there has been no cutback in the total number employed in vocational or other post-primary schools. I should like to remind Deputy Faulkner although he is not here, that it was his Government which in 1980 discontinued the scheme of providing remedial teachers ex quota in post-primary schools.  His contribution had a very thoughtful sector dealing with matters in a very constructive way and I look forward to reading the record and availing of his wisdom in those matters.  I was surprised, however, at how inaccurate and wild he was in the second part of his speech.  Apart from his total rejection of Fianna Fáil's decisions in 1981-82 on the pupil-teacher issue he embarked on something which a great many Deputies avoided today, for which I was grateful.  He demanded many more millions on top of nearly £1 billion which the taxpayer already provides for education. I reject his gloomy predictions about what is happening with the new pupil-teacher ratio and I believe that the appeals system of this and last year effectively answers most of the criticisms he made.  I also think he should give teachers and school managers more credit for the advances and innovations which are being made daily in our schools.  He showed a total lack of concern for those who pay the bills for education and he should come clean and tell those people whose doors he will knock on in the coming weeks that in Dáil Éireann today he wished to extract much more money so that he could make a high-sounding speech on education.</P>
      <P>I make no secret of the extent of the challenge facing education.  We are coping with a unique situation compared to any of our European colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no great joy to be back here speaking about further redundancies in and around the New Ross area, especially the recent spate of redundancies at Albatros Fertilizers which everybody thought was the pivot of industry in that area.  Unfortunately, two years ago, when the workforce was reduced from 380 to 240, we thought that the figures would stabilise at that level. Unfortunately management see fit to reduce that still further and are bringing the workforce down to 170.  I am led to believe this is not the end of the story and that we will have more redundancies within the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Albatros Fertilizers Limited were the <Col N="2108" /> king-pin which we depended upon in New Ross as a strong base for industry. Unemployment levels in Wexford today are at an all-time high, in the region of 7,000 or 22 per cent.  This must rate us as the worst off county.  In the New Ross area the figures are in excess of 1,100 and this will bring the figure up to 1,200.  I want the Minister to ensure that everything possible will be done to guarantee that we will not have 70 redundancies in Albatros Fertilizers Limited.</P>
    <P>Being a farmer myself I am fairly well acquainted with the problem.  Because of the fallback in confidence in farming, fertiliser sales have dropped and Albatros Fertilizers Limited have suffered.  The management claim that they are not making money and therefore they have to reduce the staff.  They are operating a twin system in New Ross.  One is all blending, and the other is what is known as granulation or the CCF plant.  This plant, which produces a granulated fertiliser which makes it far more easy for farmers to spread it, is the last CCF plant in Ireland.  If it is closed, we will have no CCF plant.  This is of vital importance. There is still a demand for that type of fertiliser.  Is it the Minister's intention to see more imports coming in?  From what I hear the CCF fertiliser will come up the same river and be unloaded at the port on which the Albatros Fertilizer Limited factory is built.  I appeal to the Minister to retain the jobs in New Ross and not to create jobs for people outside this country.</P>
    <P>In 1982 a fairly substantial package was put to Albatros Fertilizer Limited which kept them going until this year.  I am asking for it to be continued until confidence comes back into the agricultural scene.  Then there will be far greater sales of fertiliser and the CCF plant will be able to continue as it has heretofore.  On many occasions in this House we have heard discussions about imports from other countries.  Now the problem is on my doorstep.  I want to ensure that everything will be done to protect the jobs of Irish people and that we will not be creating jobs for people in other countries.</P>
    <P>I believe Albatros Fertilizers Limited are anxious to keep the parent company <Col N="2109" /> going in Holland at the expense of the Irish company.  I am sure this is the case in many other instances as well.  I am particularly interested in New Ross at this stage.  I want to ensure that when any company is in trouble the difficulties are shared.  Over the years we have done nothing about the importation of fertilisers. This importation has been nothing short of dumping.  When manufacturers abroad had a surplus they dumped it here at the expense of our workforce.  Being a farmer I would not buy it.  I buy Irish. From what I hear the quality of the fertiliser which was dumped here is not nearly as good as the manure made here. I should like the Minister to give me an undertaking that he will have this matter investigated.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention NET who are State-supported.  I understand they are considering going into the manufacture of compound fertilisers, be it blending or otherwise.  I do not want to see a State-supported company taking jobs from people in New Ross.  I am most anxious that the Minister will insist that this does not happen.  We want to protect our own people and our own jobs.  New Ross port is a very active port.  It has done pretty well down through the years. One of the reasons for that is the importation of raw materials for fertilisers.  If we have a continuation of the present trend in Albatros Fertilizers Limited the workforce will be lessened again next year and, with less fertiliser being made within the confines of the factory, less imports will be necessary.  This will mean a downgrading of the port and probably create redundancies amongst dockers, and so on.  We cannot afford that.  It is another point I should like to make in favour of the continuation of Albatros Fertilizers Limited.</P>
    <P>New Ross station is one of the few stations on a branch line from the main Rosslare&mdash;Limerick line.  Three people are working there.  They depend totally on the delivery of fertilisers to keep the station in operation.  If there is a downgrading of Albatros Fertilizers Limited, or if less fertiliser is made which seems to be the trend, the station is in danger too. I understand that recently Albatros Fertilizers <Col N="2110" /> Limited have been bringing in contractors to do work which could have been done by the people who are now threatened with redundancy.  All these areas should be considered by the Minister to ensure that people who have employment in the area will keep their jobs.  I see no sense in bringing in contractors to do work which could easily be carried out by these people.</P>
    <P>I know negotiations are going on between management and workers.  I do not want to upset those negotiations.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that our unemployment levels in New Ross and the surrounding area will not be allowed to increase.  We have 1,200 people unemployed there which is in the region of 20 per cent.  Even though the figure is so high, no task force was set up in the area to deal with it.  The industry around which employment in New Ross is built is going downhill.  I am most anxious that this trend should be halted.  I appeal to the Minister to insist that Albatros Fertilizers Limited retain their present staff and to make the necessary finances available.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, my colleague Deputy Aylward has asked for some of my time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I agree completely with what has been said by Deputy Byrne.  He forgot to mention that the plant is actually situated in south Kilkenny in my constituency, and redundancies will have a very serious effect, not only on the economy and people of New Ross who are losing their jobs, but also on many families in south Kilkenny. Deputy Byrne has rightly pointed out that this is the last CCF production plant in Ireland.  It is my belief that if we permit this one to go we will be making a very serious mistake.  Up to 30 jobs will be lost in this plant and an additional 40 jobs will go because of the change in the bagging plant and the modernising of the rest of the operation.  I recall that in 1982 I approached the Minister concerned on behalf of Albatros and the Government, through Fóir Teoranta, made a £2 million interest free loan to the company.  At that time they were informed by a team of consultants from London that the plant <Col N="2111" /> was viable and would be viable for many years to come.  It was on the basis of that advice that the loan was made available as part of the package for the rescue of Albatros.  However, two short years later we are now informed that that is no longer the case, that the plant is no longer viable and 70 jobs have to go.  In fact, 33 per cent of the total workforce is being made redundant.  I do not think that is fair.  We are all aware of the hardship that is involved when people lose their jobs and that is why we are calling on the Government to make every effort to ensure that the jobs are maintained there.</P>
      <P>There is an interesting feature to this. At present the particular blends are imported and we are told that that is the reason why there is no need for this central compound fertilising plant.  In years to come when there may be an agricultural boom on the Continent those blends may no longer be available to Ireland we can all understand what the consequences will be for Irish farmers then. That valid point should be taken into consideration.  If those blends are not readily available Irish farmers, and ultimately the whole economy, would suffer. We should ensure that at least one plant of this type is kept in operation here.  The Minister should consider that point.</P>
      <P>When I hear of plants like Albatros, or other multinational companies, reducing their workforce I am suspicious of the decisions that are taken in board rooms in Holland and other places outside the country.  Suspicion can be cast on this operation.  It may be dangerous to make such a statement at this time, particularly when negotiations are taking place between management and unions but too often in the past we have all had experience of such an operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that whenever there is a closure or loss of jobs the State suffers a loss of revenue through PAYE and PRSI payments and the fact that the State has to pay social welfare benefits to the people involved.  That should be taken into consideration in all cases where there <Col N="2112" /> is a loss of jobs and one balanced against the other.</P>
    <P>We could ask what is the solution to the problem based on the facts put forward by the company.  The maintaining and the keeping of jobs is of vital importance. One suggestion is that the interest free loan facility should be extended for a few years, if that would mean that the jobs would be saved.  We have been told that if the plant is to continue it will cost so many pounds per tonne extra to the company and I should like to know if the Minister will consider subventing that premium.  We have spent money on many less deserving programmes down the years.  These redundancies will have a serious effect on the economy of New Ross.  The loss of so many jobs to such a town is a terrible blow.  South Kilkenny, parts of Waterford and other areas will also be affected.  Members from all sides of the House are genuinely interested in maintaining the 70 jobs at risk.  It is possible that this is the thin end of the wedge. Other companies may decide that they wish to modernise and if that occurs I have no doubt we will be discussing further job losses in Albatros and many other companies.  The Minister should take note of the points we have made and make every effort possible to have the jobs maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for giving me an opportunity to say a few words on this topic that has affected all of us who have an interest in New Ross and South Kilkenny.  The tragedy that is New Ross's over the years does not need any cataloging by me or any Member.  It has been done adequately on many occasions.  The increase in the unemployment figures in New Ross is on a par with the social consequences of what is happening in Cork, albeit on a smaller scale.  Anything mooted that will further exacerbate that problem is of major concern to us all.  I appeal to the Government, in particular to Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham, to investigate the situation in the Albatros factory in New Ross.  If anything can be done, I urge him to see to it that it is done.  I have <Col N="2113" /> full confidence that if the Government have a role to play they will do so.</P>
      <P>In summer 1982 the company had to implement a very comprehensive cost-reduction programme.  A drastic effort was made to arrest the inevitable total failure and rescue the company.  At that time they got help in terms of cash injections from Government agencies and their parent plant.  Without the 1982 rescue operation we would not be here today discussing the existence of the company in New Ross.  However, a couple of years further down the road we are discussing the appalling consequences that inevitably will result from 70 redundancies that are motted.  The company insist that this is essential if they are to safeguard the jobs of the majority, the other 140 who are to be retained.  We have to accept that from the company as being the position. If we are in a position to reduce the number of redundancies we will all have done a good day's work.</P>
      <P>The corrective measures taken in 1982 meant that the company have been reasonably viable up to now.  Unfortunately, the interest free period on the cash that was injected at the time is now over and I believe that is causing the immediate crisis.  Considerable repayments have to be met and interest will be gathering from now on.  The management of the company are doing everything possible to ensure a viable and sustainable future for the 140 employees who will be kept on. They have such a firm conviction that Albatros can and may become a viable company again that the shareholders have shown their faith by investing more than £700,000 in Albatros to improve efficiency and working conditions.  They insist that it can again fulfil its vital role in the Irish market in the fertiliser area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To survive, however, there will be a very difficult period with redundancies and operational trimming.  As a result, negotiations are under way between unions and management.  Politics are not involved in this issue because it affects us all across the board but if there is anything any of us can do as local representatives we are available to resolve any problems and, if possible, reduce the number of redundancies involved.  The <Col N="2114" /> company insist that this can be done only through the co-operation of all concerned. They are adhering to the principle of the CCF production and the maintenance of employment in this area is proved by the fact that they are the last CCF product company here.  The decision, as a result, has not been an easy one.  We talk long and hard at different stages about import substitution and looking after our own markets with our own produce but here is an area where we appear to be going in the opposite direction.  I know I can rely fully on the Government's interest in this and, I am sure, help if there is any role they can play in this tragic decision about to be taken in New Ross town.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to say that I share the concern expressed by the three Deputies, two from the constituency and one from a neighbouring constituency, for the people in New Ross who have been given notice that they will lose their jobs.  Even the cold print of the Official Report will indicate the shock this will cause in an area where we are all aware that already an unacceptably high level of unemployment still exists.  I suppose that it is not unexpected in some ways in that it is not the first occasion that the House has been called together in this fashion to discuss redundancies in this enterprise.  Deputies will recall that in March 1982 my colleague, Deputy Yates, sought an Adjournment debate on this issue when at that stage some 150 redundancies were proposed and some of the then Members contributed to that debate and expressed then their concern and anguish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me explain, so that there will be no dispute or uncertainty about this, that some of the issues that have been raised go beyond the remit of any one Department. Matters that have been raised would seem to be at times the concern of my Department in so far as we are concerned with ensuring that workers in such a situation receive their full statutory entitlement.  It is a concern, too, of the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, perhaps to a degree <Col N="2115" /> the concern of the Department of Agriculture and in some respects the concern of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Matters raised by Deputy Byrne in particular would seem to be properly the subject of discussion of various international bodies, including GATT.  My Department are involved to a limited extent only.</P>
    <P>I do not want to minimise my personal concern and distress at the issue.  Deputy Avril Doyle, Deputy Yates and my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, have spoken very frequently and with great passion about the situation at the moment in Wexford.  Our particular concern is with the situation that arises under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977.  That Act requires that the Minister for Labour be notified of redundancies of a certain scale, basically collective redundancies, and that, of course, includes redundancies on the scale now envisaged at New Ross.  The Minister for Labour has been informed of 69 redundancies, so to that extent and, indeed, in other respects, the Protection of Employment Act, 1977 has been complied with.  The Act envisaged, and it is the case, that the relevant trade unions would be consulted and the notice prescribed, 30 days, has been given.  I would like the House to know that on receipt of that notification my Department responded immediately.  Quite literally within 24 hours of receiving notice <Col N="2116" /> of redundancies on this scale, my Department contacted the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. That we have responsibility in the job creation area and responsibility in association with the IDA is material.  We have been in touch with the regional director of the National Manpower Service at national level and in particular their self-service section and also we have alerted those people in the Department whose function it is to administer and activate various intervention schemes that are the responsibility of my Department, particularly the employment incentive scheme.  Certainly there is no lack of will or interest on our part.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a preliminary advance warning notice so what I am about to refer to does not arise at this stage, but were there to be any suggestion that statutory entitlements were in question or in danger, then my Department would be there to assist.  At this stage, as Minister of State at the Department charged with manpower services, I can only echo and share the distress and anguish that have been expressed by Deputies on both sides of this House, and indicate that anything that can be done by my Department or any other Government agency will be done to help in this most unhappy situation.</P>

This post is one of a number of posts in respect of which Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, have sought my approval. Because of the financial cutbacks in the health services, I am not in a position to approve of all of these posts but my Department are endeavouring in conjunction with the hospital authorities to establish the hospital's most urgent staffing requirements and I am keeping the matter under review.</P>

She was also advised that as an alternative to her old age pension entitlement of £32.60 an adult dependant allowance of £33.65 could be paid on her husband's contributory old age pension.  No reply was received and a further request was issued to the pensioner on 5 April 1984.</P>
      <P>Representations were subsequently received from the Deputy indicating that the pensioner wished to retain her personal entitlement to old age pension and the appropriate pension book was issued on 17 May 1984.

This Bill provides for the payment of employees' entitlements subject to certain limits, in respect of wages, arrears of statutory minimum wages, holiday pay, sick pay, entitlements under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and outstanding contributions to company pension schemes which have not been paid because of their employers' insolvency.  It does not deal with the question of redundancy payments which are already provided for in existing legislation (the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1979) which allow for payment of statutory redundancy entitlements from the redundancy fund, administered by my Department, in cases which an employer is unable or unwilling to pay these entitlements.</P>
