      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he can quantify the damage caused, if any, to forests and fish life in Ireland by acid rain; and if he will outline the measures his Department intend to take to counteract this damage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy)</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that little if any such damage has taken place in this country to date.  However, the situation generally in regard to possible effects of acid rain on forests and fish life is being kept under review and in this context my Department are participating, at national and international level, in a number of measures concerned with the study of this subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he will, in view of the number of boats fishing from Kilmore Quay and the number employed which is in the region of 450, consider up-grading Kilmore Quay harbour to that <Col N="1182" /> of major harbour status; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy) Michael D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the possible designation of Kilmore Quay as a fishery harbour centre under the Fishery Harbour Centres Acts, 1968 and 1980.</P>
      <P>Having considered a report on fishery harbours in this country, including Kilmore Quay, by an internationally recognised harbour consultant, the Government decided in 1967 that five fishery harbour centres should be established to cover the north-west, west, south-west, south-east and east coastal regions.  Dunmore East was the location chosen to cover the south-east region.  The Government decision was given statutory effect by the Fishery Harbour Centres Acts, 1968 and 1980.  I have no proposals at present to increase the number of fishery harbour centres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy) Michael D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A major improvement scheme, including dredging of the harbour is proposed for Kilmore Quay and plans are being prepared by the Office of Public Works. Until these plans, together with an estimate of cost, are received in my Department and considered in the light of funds available for fishery harbour works generally, I cannot say when the scheme for Kilmore Quay is likely to be put in hands. The financing of maintenance dredging is, of course, a matter for the harbour authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ground preparation for tree planting varies with individual site characteristics. During the past decade, certain developments in mechanical cultivation methods have taken place.  These include (a) a ripping process for mineral soils aimed at eliminating the corrugation effects on the forest floor normally associated with ploughing and (b) the use of a tunnel plough on some peat soils with a view to more effective drainage in the interests of improved root penetration and crop stability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the exact amount but, subject to correction, my understanding is that it was 22,000 acres as at the middle of last year.  The intake of land has been much the same since, so I presume that the reserve is much the same.  I could be out a few acres, one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will recognise that the land reserve is at a critically low level.  Has he any plans to accelerate land acquisition for 1984 to enable land to be available for future plantation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the land reserve, at 22,000 acres, is at a very low stage.  Plans are being considered by the Department at the moment.  I am hopeful that these proposals will be accepted. They are specifically to improve the land pool situation for planting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave some indication here recently that he had set up a special review team within his Department to examine this whole question. Is the Minister of State now saying that that review group team does not exist?  Will any further action be taken in this special area, which has been the subject of much criticism from the industry and those people involved in it, of the whole question of the methods by which forestry will be developed in the future to enable us reap the maximum potential by way of jobs, opportunities and indeed revenue for the State through the full exploitation of our timber resources?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand the Minister said at the time that there is at present an inter-departmental committee <Col N="1186" /> sitting, I should say that we are awaiting that report.  I understand that their report will be available in the very near future. However, I cannot give the exact date. That is my understanding of any undertaking given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that the present position in relation to the structures whereby our timber resources are being exploited are adequate to deal with the current situation? If he is so satisfied has he taken into account the dissatisfaction there is generally within the industry and throughout the country about the methods by which forestry is being exploited and the feeling that we are not getting the maximum return or that our potential is not being fully exploited in the present situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the inter-departmental committee set up was to examine the specific points the Deputy has mentioned.  Until I receive their report on those points I would not care to comment.  I am not pleased, and any Minister working in my Department would endeavour to improve the situation, particularly where there is a natural resource involved.  My first priority must be the acquisition of land, which is the basis of all afforestation, and then we can move into other areas.  But I cannot move until this report is made available to me.</P>

      <P>The letter in question, which also received some press publicity, consists mainly of unsubstantiated assertions about damage to trees by acid rain. These assertions are not borne out by my Department's recent and on-going investigations. Indeed, all the indications are that the damage complained of arises from sources other than acid rain.  The writer is being so informed and is also <Col N="1187" /> being advised that the general situation in regard to potential damage to Irish forests by acid rain is being kept under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the harbours in County Donegal which will obtain grant aid from his Department during 1984.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration is at present being given to the provision of grant aid for the improvement of the following harbours in County Donegal: Killybegs, Greencastle, Burtonport, Portevlin, Portmore, Cladnageeragh, Port Inver, Portnablagh and Trá na mBad.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible, having regard to the limited total funds available for harbour development, to commence improvements at all of the above-mentioned harbours in 1984.</P>
      <P>My Department, in consultation with the Office of Public Works, are at present examining what new fishery harbour improvement works can be undertaken this year having regard to the estimated amount required to meet expenditure on contract works in hands and estimated expenditure on urgently needed new works in particular.  Until this review is completed I cannot say which harbours in County Donegal will be grant aided in 1984.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are on-going works for 1983 which will not be completed until sometime around the end of April next. Until such time as these works are finished and we know the amount of money required, it is impossible to estimate accurately how much is needed for these harbours.  Later on in the year we will be able to give the Deputy details of the harbours we propose doing in 1984, but <Col N="1188" /> until that work is completed we cannot specify the exact harbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is mention in the capital works programme for 1984 that Killybegs will definitely be done, is the Minister of State now telling the House that the capital works programme suggests Killybegs and he is saying that Killybegs is only being considered at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not say that. The Deputy asked a specific question about the harbours that were receiving specific consideration for grant aid for 1984.  I have given the Deputy the names of the harbours that are receiving consideration.  The specific ones will be mentioned afterwards.  It is my understanding that Killybegs will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Minister of State is very well aware of the need to have the one at Burtonport done. Can he give a commitment to the House today that the dredging of Burtonport will take place because it is of absolute importance that it be done?  Does he realise its importance, that large boats at present cannot use Burtonport Harbour on a 24-hour basis?  They can use it only in favourable tidal conditions and Burtonport will become an obsolete pier if moneys are not spent there this year.  Will the Minister confirm to the House that moneys were provided in the Fianna Fáil Book of Estimates for early November 1982 for Burtonport?</P>

Until the review I mentioned is completed and I know exactly where we stand in relation to the 1983 works I cannot give any guarantee.</P>

It is all right to list the number of harbours under consideration&mdash;one could list every harbour in Ireland&mdash;but, unless financial allocations are provided to ensure that at least some of them will be done, many of them will never be done.  The Minister of State must realise that he knocked £1 million off the capital allocations for this type of work last year.  Would the Minister of State make representations to ensure that the Government would restore those £1 million as a matter of urgency, thereby ensuring that at least <Col N="1190" /> some of the very dangerous harbours are rendered safe.</P>

      <P>I am flabbergasted that we are given in tabular form the reply to a question as important as this one with regard to a reduction in quotas, quotas which the Minister was discussing in Europe yesterday, a reduction to 70,000 tonnes of mackerel.  I cannot accept an answer like this.  An answer such as that is indicative of the interest which the present Government have in fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to mackerel, the quota for 1983 was 80,000 tonnes.  At present a figure of 70,400 tonnes is proposed. With regard to herring, in the area VIaN, north west of Ireland, last year the quota was 9,250 tonnes, this year the proposals are for 8,460 tonnes.  With regard to herring in the Celtic Sea, last year's quota was 7,000 tonnes, the proposed quota for this year is 5,180 tonnes. These proposals are being discussed at present.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Department of Forestry and Fisheries, in conjunction with BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta, placed an advertisement in the national newspapers and the fishing publication inviting people to apply for grants for boats which measured 133 feet?  Can they be serious in offering money and incentives to fishermen when they know that they cannot take advantage of them in view of the proposed reduced quotas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>A reduction of 7,000 to 5,000 tonnes in the quota for the Celtic Sea is virtually a closure of that sea.  I do not think that the amount of stocks justifies <Col N="1193" /> a reduction of that nature.  Can the Minister of State give an assurance that every effort will be made by him to ensure that this quota is substantially increased, bearing in mind that stocks in the Celtic Sea can yield a substantially increased quota over the 5,000 tonnes to which he referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>These are only proposals and I assure the Deputy that the Minister and I will be endeavouring to get at least the 7,000 tonnes quota we got last year in the Celtic Sea, exclusively for Irish boats.  However, the Deputy must remember that the total allowable catch has been reduced by the EEC in all cases. These negotiations are ongoing and it will take some time before any conclusions are reached.  Everything will be done to ensure that we get the maximum quota, especially in the Celtic Sea, in view of the scientific reports which are now available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister trying to have the 80,000 tonne quota of last year increased rather than trying to negotiate a figure between 70,000 and 80,000 tonnes, in view of the landing capacity of <Col N="1194" /> the boats and the freezing capacity on shore?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Minister and I had a meeting on this issue and we are looking for substantial increases in quotas in all species, including mackerel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any figures available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I should disclose figures at this stage but the Deputy should remember that last year when we were offered 60,000 tonnes we managed to increase it to 80,000 tonnes. This year we are asking for a further increase on that figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Coughlan also I am asking the Minister for the Environment if he will make a statement regarding the water pollution problem affecting 7,000 people, hospitals, schools and bakeries in the Ballyshannon-Rossnowlagh areas in County Donegal; if he will provide finance for an improved water scheme in this area and if he will outline the steps being taken to prevent a recurrence of any further such incident in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the problem which caused pollution of the Ballyshannon water supply, requiring it to be turned off and leaving the town dependent on an emergency supply.  I have asked the local authority for a full report on this matter.  In the meantime my officials have been in touch with the local authority and I understand it is estimated that water supplies will be restored by tomorrow and following some tests should be cleared for consumption by Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the county council that when the problem was discovered local authority workers, including the fire brigade, took action to remedy the situation. When it became clear that the immediate measures taken were not <Col N="1211" /> effective in restoring a pure water supply it was decided to shut off the system and to notify the public of the situation.  I understand this was done by public address system and through RTE radio and television.  In seeking a report from the county council I have asked particularly for a report on the timelag between the discovery of the pollution and the giving of a warning to the public.</P>
    <P>A preliminary report for a water augmentation scheme for Ballyshannon was approved by my Department in 1980 and Donegal County Council were asked to prepare contract documents for this scheme.  The question of financing the scheme must await submission of these documents by the county council.</P>
    <P>While the Deputies will appreciate that I cannot give any guarantee regarding a recurrence of such an incident, my concern is that Donegal County Council and indeed all local authorities will take the necessary steps to guard against such incidents.  As far as reasonably possible and if incidents did occur in future, procedures to minimise the ill effects and warn the people affected would be put into effect promptly.  While I cannot prejudge this case, the Deputy will realise that local authorities have adequate powers under the Local Government (Water Pollution Act), 1977, to take action against persons causing pollution of water supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The caretaker of the water scheme discovered the pollution at 10 a.m.  He alerted his supervisor and some remedial work was attempted immediately but that did not resolve the problem.  It was decided by the local engineer that the pumps be switched off at 2 p.m.  Efforts were made by the fire brigade, by way of high pressure hosing, to clear the slurry.  After consultation between the council's engineers and the county medical officer it was agreed that <Col N="1212" /> the pollution was such that a public announcement should be made in regard to it.  A broadcast system was ordered from Bundoran and a public announcement of the problem was made at 5.30 p.m.  There was release on the matter also on RTE radio and television.  Water tankers were used to bring water supplies to Ballyshannon, the first tanker having been in use at 6.30 p.m. on Sunday.  From 9 a.m. on Monday six tankers were in operation.  Army and civil defence personnel assisted in that operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">

      <P>So that we may be certain that water will not be consumed by anyone before an analysis has been carried out, is the Minister prepared to guarantee that a sample will be taken from every house in the Ballyshannon-Rossnowlagh area?  Such testing is necessary since, I understand, the polluted water found its way into the pipes in every home.</P>

It is a much easier matter to ascertain that the water leaving the reservoir is fit for human consumption but that is not the case in respect of individual houses because the tanks and pipes contain polluted water.  That is why I am asking for an assurance that an analysis will be taken in the case of every home in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I completed my contribution on the budget last week I made two main points and I wish to repeat them very briefly.  First, I considered the strategy adopted in the budget as an incorrect one for this time in our economy.  I regarded it as a missed opportunity. I had taken the view that progress to restore our national finances is a necessary and legitimate objective of budgetary policy and I said that a reduction in public spending must be a priority because it is, and it has been for some time, at an unsustainable figure.  However, policies to promote growth and to reverse the unemployment situation can and must be pursued concurrently if public finances are not to deteriorate further. A balanced budget may be achieved but at such a high level of unemployment and low level of domestic economic activity as to preclude any hope for the future.</P>
      <P>It is my view that both objectives can and must be pursued concurrently.  If they are implemented in this way they can be mutually reinforcing, thereby establishing a virtual circle of growth and recovery in place of the vicious circle in which the economy is trapped.  This is my core objection to the financial strategy adopted in the budget.  It fails to adopt the twin approach of encouraging industry and employment while seeking to reduce the budgetary deficit.  It sees a balanced budget as a precondition of and as a prerequisite to a revival of economic growth and employment rather than as a parallel approach.  The approach in the budget will so reduce the numbers at work as to destroy the already dangerously narrow tax base and it will necessitate a greater tax burden on this dwindling base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had made employment the thrust of the budgetary strategy he could get people back to work, broaden the tax base, save social welfare and unemployment funds and lessen the enormous appetite of the State for more and more tax receipts.  Last week I concluded <Col N="1288" /> that the Minister missed the opportunity to take the twin approach. The Government have correctly identified the restoration of competitiveness in our economy as the central policy requirement but, amazingly, they proceeded to ignore that central requirement by announcing a 1 per cent increase in inflation.  Incidentally, that will give us a rate of 9 or 10 per cent next year compared with a figure of 4 or 5 per cent for America and the industrialised countries of Europe.  The increases in regard to petrol and clothing, the tax base lendings and the ACT are a direct attack on competitiveness which the Government had identified correctly as the central policy requirement.  It is a pity the Government missed the opportunity in this regard. The increased costs in the budget will be felt by industries who will become less competitive and it must lead to more unemployment.  Last week I said a concurrent policy is needed, that it is not a matter of one being a precondition of the other.  It is a pity the opportunity was missed then.</P>
    <P>Taxation should be used as an instrument for promoting equity and for increasing incentive.  I will contrast the excellent treatise given by the Minister in his preamble on taxation last week with the situation that exists today.  Taxation imbalance has not been redressed, especially the burden on the PAYE sector. The fact is that the tax paid will increase by some £300 million: £1,664 million as the 1983 outcome and £1,952 million as the post budget 1984 figure, giving almost £300 million of additional tax taken from the PAYE sector.  That is done with 30,000 fewer people at work, so clearly the burden of taxation has increased substantially. The widening of the tax band, I calculate, will give the average family between 70p and 90p per week in the context of the additional levy, the PRSI burden and the 1 per cent inflation which this budget will impose.</P>
    <P>In the Budget Statement at column 826, Vol. 347 of the Official Report, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It would be desirable in the coming years to set ourselves the objective of <Col N="1289" /> restoring the tax base by progressively reducing or abolishing allowances, reliefs, and deductions . . .</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to restore the tax base.  The way to restore the tax base is by getting the country back to work.  The loss in revenue which stems from unemployment as a cost of servicing the dole queue will be £650 million next year.  That is £500 a year for every working person, or £10 per week.  That makes it impossible in the short-term to restore the taxation base.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally the Minister's view in respect of the scope for tax reform runs contrary to many experts in this area. The Minister said: &ldquo;Fundamental reform must await a better budgeting situation&rdquo;. That is disagreed with by Mr. Donal De Burca, the secretary of the taxation committee, who said in a recent article that it is impossible to implement many reforms, indeed fundamental reforms; and their implementation, far from not being possible, would actually help to lighten the load and give greater tax equity.  The budget in the United States of America this year concluded that taxation reform can be and is often a prerequisite to lightening the tax load and not a consequence of it.</P>
    <P>I am saddened to find that the Minister takes the view that tax reform must await a better budgetary situation.  I put it to him that if he makes some progress in the area of tax reform he would make it easier to tackle the whole question of lightening the tax load.  I am sorry that he sees it the wrong way around and I think that is the reason he has got so much of his budget strategy wrong.  At another time when unemployment may not be so high this might be the correct strategy in ruthlessly tackling the budget deficit; but at this time, with enormous unemployment, the correct strategy has to be increasing competitiveness, adopting a twin-pronged attack on national finances and getting the country back to work.</P>
    <P>That has got to be the basis of any economic strategy and I am dismayed that the Minister has missed his opportunity in that regard.  There are just one million people today at work.  There are <Col N="1290" /> only 760,000 taxpayers.  There are another one million people dependent one way or another on social welfare. That is in a population of just over three million people.  There are 760,000 taxpayers in a population of just over three million.  Clearly, on any analysis and with any Government we are bound to have heavy taxation on the few.  That is all the more reason for adopting the correct budgetary strategy which should not be one of reducing further the one million people at work but rather a policy of putting people back to work and, in parallel, a fundamental &mdash; not just a tinkering with &mdash; reform of the taxation system designed to bring greater equity and restore investment and incentive.  It is sad that that opportunity was missed last week.</P>
    <P>The higher rates are still very much with us.  A great deal has been said about the difficulties facing the ordinary worker.  The ordinary worker now includes a huge mass of people who in other times might have been inclined to regard themselves as middle class.  Suburban poverty, hidden poverty, white collar poverty is now a serious feature of the Ireland of 1984.  Bus fares, VHI contributions, university fees, mortgage repayments, petrol bills, shrinking take home pay and increasing inflation all add up to one sad fact which the banks know all about and that is that most ordinary &ldquo;three and four bedroom semi-detached land&rdquo; people are living today on overdrafts and the goodwill of their bank managers.  The net effect of the budget therefore will be to increase the percentage of income presently being taken away by the State.  That fact must be driven home.  That clearly means a drop in living standards.  That will inevitably start a demand for additional pay increases because the average family last week was given less than one pound by the Minister and they will spend that pound on petrol, PRSI, the extra VAT and the 1 per cent inflation.  It is a disgraceful situation.</P>
    <P>However, I am not so concerned about that as I am about the missed opportunity to inject economic philosophy into the bones of this nation and try to put our people back to work.  The President of <Col N="1291" /> the Institute of Chartered Accountants made a statement last week and I can do no better than quote what she said about taxation:</P>
    <P>Taxation must be the single most detrimental ingredient in endeavouring to reward enterprise and work in Ireland today.  When one includes PRSI a taxation rate of 72 per cent is reached by a single person when they earn £12,000 to £13,000 a year.  The taxation level of 45 per cent is reached by a single person at £6,300.  Let there be no doubt that these rates of taxation contribute to the development of the black economy, abuses of the social welfare system, dissatisfaction by those involved in the PAYE system and the self-employed, employers' discouragement because they are unable to award the take home pay to workers who have made an above average contribution to the business.</P>
    <P>One could not put it better.  That is the view of a professional source.  An employer now has to give a person £4 if he wants that person to take home an extra pound.  What kind of crazy taxation structure have we built for ourselves?  We are killing whatever golden goose is still left to us.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is not just an urban problem.  It is also a rural problem and the <i>Farmers Journal</i> recently pointed out there is a certain lack of commitment by the Government to the development of Irish agriculture.  They also said there was a failure to acknowledge the problems in agriculture today.  I am an urban Deputy but I regard agriculture as an area in which there are tremendous possibilities to provide employment and create new jobs.  We must give up the idea that agriculture is an area of job loss and assume that jobs in agriculture will continue to dwindle.  It is the foundation of our economy and if we look at it in an industrial way and give it the same incentives comparable to manufacturing industry I believe it can in a professional way increase employment considerably. <Col N="1292" /> Recently a number of suggestions were put forward particularly the suggestion seeking an agricultural enterprise zone of a Shannon Airport type.  Suffice it to say that a number of schemes are operating in other countries which, if applied to our agriculture in a professional and industrious way, could place agriculture as part of the solution to unemployment, not as part of the problem.  That is the way in which we should view our agriculture.</P>
    <P>Our problems are far greater than would be tackled or solved by one year's budget.  We might consider a three year budget period in place of the annual one, which is too restrictive, too inflexible and too short a planning period.  I welcome the additional funds for Córas Tráchtála to aid our exporting, but propose that we do more in this area.  The Americans have a saying &ldquo;All sale is profit and everything else is expense&rdquo;.  That is a healthy attitude for an open economy such as ours.  We would be foolish not to put our resources and our young people into exporting and marketing.</P>
    <P>We have a young, educated mass of people out there.  On the other hand, we have less than 1 per cent of total world trade.  A small percentage increase in that world trade would change the face of Ireland and wipe out unemployment.  Is there not a case for trying, in an imaginative scheme, to match up our young, educated, determined population with these markets in trying to penetrate them and so contribute to the solution of unemployment? This is a positive suggestion which I have seen operate in other countries and which I would like the Government to consider.</P>
    <P>The reduction of unemployment is the central policy facing us today; but, unfortunately, this budget will increase unemployment. Indeed, it seems that the Government are planning for this, if one looks at the additional social welfare payments. We should be using this budget as an instrument of economic policy and a vehicle for reducing unemployment in the immediate term.  I am not asking for an overnight reduction, but the start of a medium-term plan.  All the Members are acquainted with the magnitude of the <Col N="1293" /> problem confronting us.  There will be at the end of 1984 some 50,000 extra on to the figure which the present Government declared, in their Programme for Government on coming into office, was &ldquo;a disaster&rdquo;.  They went on to say that short-term emergency measures would be taken to deal with the problem.  Unfortunately, the figure will be 50,000 higher, despite any measures taken.  It will be a disaster if this Dáil acquiesces in the perpetuation of unemployment on that scale.  If we in this Dáil, as the Government are doing, plan our industrial strategy around a figure of 225,000 unemployed, we cannot claim, by any stretch of the imagination, to be a Christian society, let alone a just society.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, an economic cost in the waste of our most precious resources.  There are serious economic consequences from a policy point of view which I have attempted to point out.  We are locked in a vicious circle of high unemployment, high social welfare payments and high transfer payments.  Worst of all are the social consequences and recent research has linked high unemployment with child battering, marital strain and indeed, in many countries, suicide.  I know from my constituency work, as do most Deputies, that unemployment is being reflected in the high admission rate into our psychiatric hospitals. As political leaders, entrusted by the people with responsibility for their future and welfare, we cannot wash our hands, saying that unemployment will come right when the sums add up.  That philosophy is not acceptable to our rising generation.  There is a better way.  I have tried here and in other recent contributions to suggest real alternatives which promote fiscal balance within a framework which promotes employment and raises living standards.  I believe that that is the better way.</P>
    <P>The kind of policies we need are those which do not tax jobs or employment. Our taxation structure simply says that the more you employ, the more tax you pay.  Should it not be at this stage in our development, with enormous unemployment, that the more you employ, the less tax you pay?  That is an incentive to <Col N="1294" /> employ people rather than a taxation on employing people.  A child in the street could grasp that philosophy.  Unfortunately, we have adopted policies which have as their core a taxation system which does not assist employment at this critical time. At another time that policy might be all right, but not today with the present unemployment situation.  It is unfortunate that the budget increased PRSI even further.  That has to be a tax on employment.</P>
    <P>The Government have pointed to a percentage reduction in the budget deficit as a percentage of gross national product.  I applaud any reduction in the budget deficit, but we must put clearly before the House that the budget target in 1983 was £897 million.  Six months later it was adjusted to £960 million and the proposal in the budget now is £1,088 million. Whatever about percentages and their validity &mdash; and one could argue on that for a long day &mdash; the realities are that the budget deficit is almost £150 million higher than was originally targeted at the start of the year.  We would not as a nation want to get it that wrong every year or we would be in some difficulty.</P>
    <P>I am not clear if this is the appropriate debate in which to do so although this matter hinges on our economic wellbeing, but I want to refer to the recent newspaper reports about the visit of President Reagan to this country and the suggestion by some Members of this House that perhaps that visit would not be welcome. I, for one, would welcome it.  I do not dispute the right of any Member of the House or of any citizen to have strong views on the political policies of the United States and on their military policies abroad.  However, I remind those who might disrupt a possible presidential visit of a few facts about our economy. Firstly, American companies in this country provide 36,000 jobs, which is twice as many as are provided by United Kingdom companies and four times as many as are provided by German companies. These figures were taken from the IDA report of 1982 and 1983.  Also, according to that report &mdash; and this must be borne in mind by those contemplating giving a message to the American people <Col N="1295" /> that their President would not be welcome in Ireland &mdash; United States planned investment here at the latest available date was £165 million.  That is four-fifths, 80 per cent, of total planned investment by all countries in Ireland.  If one is still not convinced I might add that the Telesis Report says that the relative importance of United States companies as a source of new employment is growing rapidly.</P>
    <P>I give those figures in this House today, lest we get ourselves into a national frenzy about the visit of the United States President to this country, to remind people that this country can ill afford to bite any hand that seeks to help us feed ourselves today.  Certainly I take the opposite view, that the visit is to be welcomed. We endorse, support and encourage further investment by the United States in this country.  I would stress that all of that is aside from whatever views one may hold about the political or military situation.</P>
    <P>I might conclude by making one other point: that this country in 1983 had exchange rate losses of £810 million.  That does not constitute a deficit in the ordinary sense of the word; it is a deficit of £810 million of a once-off loss attributable purely to the change in the value of currencies.  It is as it were, a capital loss. In fact it is close to the size of what should have been our total budget deficit.  I wonder whether there is not a better way of making our people cough up on an annual basis to pay off an exchange rate loss of £810 million than by charging it to current expenditure on a regular basis.  From such investigation I have carried out I am aware that a number of other countries have found a better way of doing that. They have found a way of recycling such exchange rate losses in the capital budget and not making them a charge on the current budget, thus spreading them out. If I might put it this way, if one lost money on selling one's house one would not dream of endeavouring to pay it off out of one's wages in one year; one would have to endeavour to reschedule it.  That is what should be done with that £810 million, which constitutes a once-off exchange rate loss mainly because of the <Col N="1296" /> strengthening of the dollar and the Deutschemark.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of this budget should have been employment.  The major policy error made in this budget was to miss the opportunity to tackle that central area.  Perhaps it would have been worth it not to get any progress on the unemployment situation if we had a large reduction in the budget deficit.  But from the figures I have given the House it is quite clear that there has been no reduction in the budget deficit.  Therefore, we have fallen between two stools in this budget.  At this time in Irish history, with this new modern, young generation, it is a sad, missed opportunity.  It is wrong strategy at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>A major achievement of the past year has been the substantial reduction made in the rate of inflation.  As pointed out by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement the average rate of inflation dropped by over six percentage points in 1983; this budget will ensure a continuation in the current year of this trend and this is recognised by most informed commentators.  This will significantly improve our competitive position and enable us to benefit from the expected upturn in the world economy. It also creates the necessary prerequisite climate for job maintenance and the creation of new job opportunities.  Reduction in inflation rates will contribute in a meaningful way to the protection of the living standards of the less well off in our society, including in particular pensioners, unemployed and those in receipt of other social welfare benefits. The improvements, as indicated in the broader social welfare field as outlined in the budget, will be of far more real benefit to these recipients than apparent more substantial increases in a situation of rampant inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us briefly look at the other positive favourable indicators now emerging due in no small measure to the responsible statesmanlike policies pursued by the Government.  To quote from the recently published quarterly economic commentary <Col N="1297" /> of the Economic and Social Research Institute, 1983 has witnessed:</P>
    <P>a massive improvement in the balance of payments, a significant increase in industrial output, a marked reduction in the rate of inflation, some slowing down in the growth of unemployment and a small reduction in the budget deficit as a proportion of Gross National Product.</P>
    <P>These indicators give no grounds for complacency &mdash; but they are not bad for our first full year in Government.</P>
    <P>We could easily at this stage have switched to more popular budgetary policies by increasing expenditure at the expense of increasing the current budget deficit.  However, to do so would seriously impair the prospects for a continuation in 1984 of the emerging favourable trends to which I have already referred. And in my view what is important is that we continue with the policies which are already showing notable results and gradually again recreate the confidence and conditions in which development will more freely take place &mdash; not, of course, as an objective in itself but rather as the essential road to the creation of critically needed new jobs and an improvement in the standard of living for all our people. In my view the budget guarantees a continuation in the current year of the favourable trends now emerging.</P>
    <P>What of the budget itself?  It delivers on what I see as a priority and an absolute necessity, namely, to look after persons dependent on social welfare allowances. Short term rates were increased by 10 per cent, and other weekly benefits by 12 per cent as from 1 June last.  In addition the long-term unemployed had a further special increase of 5 per cent as from October last.  I was particularly pleased that we were able to give pensioners a double week's payment at Christmas.  The budget provides for a 7 per cent increase in both short and long-term benefits and allowances as from July.  Again special concern is shown for the long-term unemployed who will be given an 8 per cent rather than 7 per cent increase.  Provision is also made for a 7 per cent increase in <Col N="1298" /> children's allowances.  We would, of course, have liked to have given more but this could only be done at the cost of higher taxation rates or by cutbacks in existing programmes.</P>
    <P>Areas suggested as likely for cutbacks in recent weeks in the media and elsewhere included the food subsidies, termination of the mortgage subsidy scheme for first time house purchasers operated by my Department and indeed the payment of children's allowances.  Of course all of this speculation was again misplaced. The Government have and will continue to deliver on the commitment to keep short term social welfare benefits in line with increases in the take-home pay of workers and to maintain the living standards of other weekly welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>On the income taxation front there is only limited scope in the present state of the economy for concessions. At the same time provision is made for increases in personal allowances and in the general exemption limits for persons on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The role which key services administered by my Department, such as housing, roads and sanitary services, must play in facilitating future development is an important one.  The budget provides an extra £8 million for roads and £6 million for housing.</P>
    <P>I will now speak in more detail on the building industry and these key services of my Department.</P>
    <P>The building industry is one of my primary concerns as Minister for the Environment. It is an industry which is of vital importance because of its size and output, because of the employment it generates and because of its role in providing the basic infrastructure for future development.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years the general trend of the industry has been downward with falling output and reduced employment. It is my aim as Minister to seek to halt &mdash; and reverse as early as practicable &mdash; this downward trend and to establish solid foundations for sustained future growth.  The industry's problems can be attributed mainly to two interdependent factors.  Firstly, effective demand has <Col N="1299" /> been depressed by the persistent world and national recession and secondly, private investment in the industry has fallen dramatically in recent years.</P>
    <P>On the international front, there are signs that the worst of the recession may be over.  This is good news for the construction industry since, more than anything else, a resumption of growth in the industry is inextricably tied up with what happens in our economy as a whole.  It is encouraging that some hopeful signs have already appeared.  Cement sales, which are a reasonable indicator of activity in the industry, began to recover quite sharply from about the middle of 1983 and fell by only 7 per cent in the year. This fall compares with a 15 per cent drop which was being forecast by many commentators at the beginning of the year. In comparison with 1982 home sales of cement increased by 12 per cent in the last quarter of 1983.  Housing activity, which accounts for over 40 per cent of construction output, was quite strong during 1983 and I am hopeful that it will improve in 1984 given the particularly favourable indicators now emerging in the housing area to which I will again refer.</P>
    <P>As regards private investment in the building industry, which has fallen so badly in recent years, our aim must be to create the conditions within which it can begin to grow again.  That is precisely what this Government are attempting to do.  It is vital to get the country's finances in order &mdash; otherwise we can never hope to have stability or soundly-based growth in the building industry or indeed in any other industry.</P>
    <P>One of the disturbing results of over-investment in the building industry in the late seventies was the growth of imports. Notwithstanding the fall in output since then, the level of import penetration has remained high.  We are now importing some £300 million worth of building materials annually and it has been estimated that half of these at least could be produced at home.  These statistics illustrate the vast potential there is for expansion in the building materials sector &mdash; expansion in both the quantity and range <Col N="1300" /> of products and of course also in employment.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the indicators are there that the economy is now being handled in such a way as to create a climate of confidence for investors generally including those in the building industry.  The Government for their part will continue to maintain a high level of commitment to the industry by providing a substantial part of the total investment in building output and by creating a climate of confidence within which private sector investment may grow.</P>
    <P>Of major significance for firms in the building industry are the changes introduced by the Minister for Finance relating to the stock relief concession.  It was generally recognised that in the last year or so the clawback arrangements in force had been operating to the disadvantage of many firms.  Indeed, the industry itself had claimed that what had been introduced as a benefit had, because of the recession and the need to rationalise on the part of many firms, turned out to be a millstone threatening to drag firms into liquidation.  The changes will mean that there will in general be no clawback of relief once granted and, as regards relief already given, the clawback deferred last year will be waived.  This concession, therefore, will confer a major benefit on those firms and on the industry in general.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer in more detail to the housing area both in the context of its critical economic role in relation to the building industry and also to the broader social role of providing a decent standard of housing for every person in this country, particularly for those whose resources are not sufficient to enable them to house themselves.  In 1983 the decline in housing output tapered off and total new house completions were down only slightly on the previous year with 26,121 new houses built compared to 26,798 in 1982.  In addition, the signs are promising for a return to growth particularly in the private housing sector in 1984.  For example, new house grant allocations in 1983 were 12.8 per cent higher than in 1982 and new house loan grant approvals by the building societies <Col N="1301" /> increased from 6,163 in 1982 to an estimated 6,800 in 1983, an increase of 10 per cent.  With regard to loan approvals for existing houses, a remarkable increase from 9,092 in 1982 to 12,700 in 1983 or 40 per cent was recorded.  This shows, I think, that people are again finding the confidence in their future which enables them to undertake the greatly increased financial commitments involved in moving house.</P>
    <P>Regarding the social aspects of housing policy, I have already indicated in this House that I see the need for a fundamental review of some of the existing statutory provisions governing the local authority housing programme.  I intend to push ahead quickly with this review and I hope to have new legislative proposals formulated by about mid-year.  A central aim of these proposals will be to provide a better legislative framework within which the problem of housing the homeless and other deprived sections of the community can be effectively tackled.</P>
    <P>While the scale of the voluntary housing movement in this country has been small in the overall housing context, it nonetheless continues to play an important role by providing housing for the elderly and certain other special categories of housing need.  A special scheme to assist the provision of housing for the elderly by voluntary bodies was introduced in 1979.  In 1981 the terms of the scheme were revised and extended to the provision of housing for other categories including the handicapped, deserted wives, battered wives and families on local authority waiting lists.  I am satisfied that voluntary bodies can play an increasingly significant role in the provision of social housing and especially in circumstances where support and back-up services are required.  The existing scheme of assistance for this type of housing has not, I regret, been as successful as originally hoped and the terms are being reviewed in my Department following consultations with representatives of the voluntary housing movement.  I hope to be in a position to announce the outcome of this review in the near future.</P>
    <P>The ready availability of adequate mortgage finance is crucial to the private <Col N="1302" /> housing programme.  I am glad to say that a record total of about £560 million was advanced in 1983 for house purchase by lending agencies, both public and private. The SDA and the Housing Finance Agency schemes continue to play vital roles in encouraging home ownership by those on lower incomes who would not normally be catered for by the commercial lending agencies.  In the light of the importance of these schemes and in order to generate increased activity and employment in private housing construction, I am pleased that the Government have been able in the budget to increase by £6 million the provision of £134.5 million in the 1984 Public Capital Programme for these schemes.</P>
    <P>An increase of £3 million in the allocation for the SDA scheme brings to £77.5 million the total capital provision for house purchase loans under the scheme for this year.  I am now particularly glad to be able to announce increases in the SDA loan and income limits.  The maximum ordinary loan which may be advanced is being increased from £14,000 to £16,000 and, in addition, the maximum special category loan is being increased from £18,000 to £20,000.  The income limit is being increased from £7,000 to £8,000 which will also apply to improvement loans, the maximum of which is being increased from £4,000 to £6,500.  The new loan and income limits will apply to houses, the contracts for the purchase of which are entered into on or after 3 February 1984 or, where an applicant is building his own house, the foundations were completed on or after that date.  The increased limits in the case of home improvement loans apply where improvement work commenced on or after 3 February 1984.  I am sure that these increases will be welcome news to aspiring home owners and to persons carrying out much needed improvements to their houses.</P>
    <P>The increase of £3 million in the PCP allocation for the Housing Finance Agency means that a total capital provision of £63 million is available to the agency for the payment of home loans this year.  I expect that this will fund a total of about 3,150 loans.  The Housing <Col N="1303" /> Finance Agency are successfully raising extra funds for house purchase through the issue of index-linked bonds to certain financial institutions such as pension funds, insurance companies, unit trusts, and so on.  There is no doubt that the agency's loan scheme has contributed significantly to the housing programme and the building industry.  The agency's scheme by its lower initial deposits and repayments has brought home ownership within the reach of persons who might not otherwise be able to provide their own homes.  Since the first loans were advanced by the agency in September 1982 until 31 December 1983 about 3,650 loans valued about £71 million have been paid out and there is a continuing strong demand for the agency's loans.</P>
    <P>Building societies are continuing to contribute enormously to the provision of mortgage finance.  In 1983, the societies paid out a record amount in excess of £400 million &mdash; an increase of almost 40 per cent compared with 1982 &mdash; for about 17,500 houses.  With loan approvals by the societies running at high levels and the inflow of funds holding up very well, the outlook for 1984 is very encouraging. A further feature giving much satisfaction is the present mortgage rate of 11¾ per cent which is the lowest it has been for six years.</P>
    <P>To conclude on mortgage finance, I believe that the prospects for this year are good and that a sufficient supply of mortgage finance will be available from both public and private sources throughout the year to meet any demand that arises.  This is particularly satisfying because the experience over the years has shown that the availability of mortgage finance is a critical factor in sustaining the level of private housing output.</P>
    <P>A total of £211 million is being provided for the local authority housing programme in 1984.  This allocation represents an increase of £3 million over last year's provision and will ensure the maintenance of the programme at the relatively high level achieved in 1983. About 6,100 houses were completed in 1983 &mdash; the highest figure achieved since 1979 and about 400 more than in 1982. <Col N="1304" /> The expansion has not been confined to completions since over 8,000 houses were in progress at the end of 1983 compared with 7,460 at the end of the previous year and the average monthly employment on the programme increased by some 500 to around 6,400 compared with the 1982 average of 5,900.  In short, the local authority housing programme is currently in its healthiest state for years.</P>
    <P>My confidence that the programme can be maintained at the present high level throughout 1984 is an indication of the good value being obtained in tenders over the past year or so.  In addition, we have begun to benefit from new cost control procedures introduced by my Department during 1982 and 1983.  These procedures were introduced in order to ensure that we achieve the desirable objective of getting the best possible return on the capital provided for local authority housing but without reducing standards below an acceptable level or going back to the concept of low-cost housing that caused so many difficulties in the past.  In addition to the capital provided for the construction of local authority houses a sum of nearly £155 million has been provided in 1984 to subsidise in full the loan charges on moneys borrowed by local authorities to build houses.  This subsidy and its size is a further clear indication of the Government's continuing commitment to provide housing for those members of our society whose resources do not enable them to house themselves.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the high level of new house grant approvals in 1983. For 1984 the Government are providing £11 million for new house grant payments. In 1983 approximately £14.3 million was paid under the special mortgage subsidy scheme.  This scheme gives valuable assistance to first-time purchasers of new houses to meet the heavy mortgage repayments over the first five years of a loan.  In 1983, approximately 25,000 claims for payments under this scheme were met.  In addition, over 11,700 new applications were approved.  To allow for payment of these and the cumulative effect of instalments due in respect of applications received in past years, the <Col N="1305" /> Government are providing £20 million for this scheme in 1984.  This represents an increase of nearly 40 per cent on the 1983 budget provision.</P>
    <P>The Government's continued commitment to the conservation and improvement of the country's existing housing stock is shown by the provision for this year of £6.25 million for grants under the house improvement grant scheme, disabled persons and essential repairs grants.  The house improvement grant scheme is aimed specifically at the provision of basic amenities in houses, the relief of overcrowding and the carrying out of necessary works to the fabric of a house.  For the third year in succession, £1 million is being provided for the task force on housing aid for the elderly.  It will allow for the continuation during 1984 of this important programme to improve the living conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit and insanitary accommodation.</P>
    <P>Despite the present difficult economic situation, the State provision for road improvement works this year is £98 million. This includes an additional sum of £8 million which I am pleased to have been able to provide in the budget.  The provision of just under £100 million will be used to continue the significant programme of road works now in progress around the country, with priority being given to improving the national routes and selected major works on other important routes.</P>
    <P>State expenditure on road improvements in the five year period from 1980 will come to £366 million, representing a four fold nominal increase over the previous five year period 1975-1979.  This accelerated rate of investment has allowed substantial progress to be made in implementing the road development plan for the eighties.  A major review of the plan is now almost completed in my Department and will be considered by the Government over the next few months in the context of the preparation of the medium-term plan for the economy.  It is my aim to ensure that improved major roads will continue to bring easier access to our principal ports and harbours, shorter travelling times on <Col N="1306" /> the major inter-urban routes and reduce traffic congestion in our larger cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Major projects which will continue into 1984 include further work on the Cork/Mallow road; Redmond Bridge in Waterford; the ring road in Kilkenny; the Bandon Line road and bridges in Cork; the new Corrib Bridge and approaches in Galway; by-passes of Leighlinbridge, Middleton, Navan and Athlone; and, in the Dublin area, by-passes of Swords, Palmerstown/Ballydowd and Cabinteely. Schemes due to commence in 1984 include Stage 2 of the Santry by-pass, the Wexford by-pass, works from Dunkettle towards Carrigtwohill in County Cork and at Slievrue in County Kilkenny. These major works will be supplemented by a programme of improvements on other roads in the national road network. Provision will also be made for essential works on a number of important urban and regional roads.</P>
    <P>The extensive capital asset represented by the existing road network must be preserved by an adequate programme of road maintenance.  This year grants totalling £25.5 million are being made available to road authorities for maintenance works on national and other routes.</P>
    <P>Road works have the capacity to generate direct and indirect employment. They give a wide distribution of direct employment both on-site and off-site throughout the country as well as considerable indirect employment in quarrying, plant and other related industries. I am satisfied that the additional capital provision of £8 million made in the budget will maintain employment in road works at a satisfactory level.</P>
    <P>The investment of considerable additional funds on the roads area could of course be economically justified.  With this in view, I am examining the scope for involving the private sector more in the financing of road improvements to supplement the amount available under the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer here to the fire services.  The effects of fire, both in terms of lives lost, human misery and also destruction of property, are very serious.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> The Government are fully aware of the need for adequate levels of capital investment to provide for the development of the fire services and are increasing their funding accordingly.  Despite the difficult economic situation, I am happy to state that this year's capital allocation of £7.5 million for the fire services represents an increase of 25 per cent over the £6 million provided in 1983 and is three and a half times greater than the 1980 figure.</P>
    <P>This is concrete proof of the Government's real commitment to the development of the fire service.  It will enable good progress to be made with the on-going programme for the provision of new fire stations and training facilities and the upgrading of old and unsuitable stations.  At present, work is in progress on stations at Phibsboro, Rathfarnham, Blanchardstown and the O'Brien Institute in Dublin and at Bray, Tinahely, Clonmel, Athlone, Limerick, Killeshandra and Dundalk.  Work is to commence shortly at Galway, Cavan, Ennistymon, Foynes, Cappoquin, Leixlip, Bantry, Cashel and Abbeyfeale.</P>
    <P>The substantially increased level of allocation which I have provided for the service enables planning to proceed for the provision of additional stations throughout the country.  The £7.5 million allocation will also be used to assist local authorities to purchase fire appliances, rescue tenders, communication and ancillary equipment.  These developments will improve the protection for life and property and reduce the economic waste from fire.</P>
    <P>The increased level of borrowing for capital investment in the fire service would normally result in fire authorities having to meet heavy loan repayments when there are many other demands on their resources.  To ease this burden my Department recoup 50 per cent of the loan charges incurred by fire authorities on such borrowing.  This is a substantial encouragement to them to provide and maintain the facilities that are needed. Subsidy amounting to £1.46 million is being provided for in 1984.</P>
    <P>The Government are conscious of the vital importance that the provision of <Col N="1308" /> infrastructure has in the promotion of economic development and the sanitary services programme has a key role in this regard.  With this in mind this Government made substantial capital available in 1983 for the programme and I am glad to say that a similar high level of investment is being made this year.  The amount provided in 1984 for the programme is £98.6 million, the bulk of which is provided for the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that the sanitary services programme in 1983 provided employment to almost 1,900 persons during the year and this level of employment is expected to be maintained in the current year.  The high level of investment in the programme will again allow some £7 million to be provided for the small scheme programme for schemes that cost £50,000 or less.  These small schemes are carried out by the local authorities on a direct labour basis and, apart from the benefit derived from their construction, these schemes are of assistance to the local authorities in maintaining employment in the labour units involved.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the subsidy on the sanitary services programme will amount to £36 million as against £27 million in 1983. This subsidy consists of contributions to local authorities towards loan charges incurred on the works financed under this programme.  The high level of subsidy required is a reflection of the higher activity generated in this area in recent years and the corresponding increased capital provision made for it.</P>
    <P>In my short time as Minister for the Environment I have become increasingly aware of the severity of the financial problems which beset our local government system.  The importance of the role of local authorities both as elective local representative bodies and in providing and maintaining essential local services to the community requires that every effort be made to ensure that they are both structurally and financially viable for the future.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to proceed with local government reorganisation but improvements in the forms of local government cannot be of benefit <Col N="1309" /> unless adequate financial provision is made for the maintenance of new structures. Since the abolition of domestic rates and, more recently, the High Court judgement &mdash; now confirmed by the Supreme Court &mdash; on rating in accordance with the land valuation system, local authorities have been experiencing significant financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>Various factors have combined to produce a situation in which local authorities are dependent on the Exchequer for the major part of their revenue.  This is neither appropriate nor desirable for the effective functioning of local government. The extension by the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, of local authorities' powers to charge for services and the decision in 1983, and again in 1984, not to limit the amount by which commercial-industrial rates could be increased have gone some way towards recognising the need for local financial discretion.</P>
    <P>As mentioned on previous occasions in this House and elsewhere, an examination of local finances has been underway in my Department in recent months.  The purpose has been to identify areas of concern, such as the growth in the share of Exchequer financing of local government and to seek to redress the balance by finding some means of restoring local financial independence.</P>
    <P>Finding a solution to local authorities' financial problems will not be easy.  The task is to devise a system which will satisfy the basic needs for the medium and longer term.  These include, firstly, the need for a firm basis to be provided for adequate funding of the various local services and programmes; secondly, the need for a fair degree of local financial independence and discretion; and, thirdly, the need to keep within reasonable and manageable limits the evergrowing demands on the Exchequer in line with the requirements of national economic policy.  A sum of just under £280 million has been provided by way of rate relief grants for local authorities for 1984 as against £277 million for 1983.  It must be remembered for comparison purposes that the 1983 provision included a special extra provision of over £31 million provided <Col N="1310" /> by this Government in last year's budget.</P>
    <P>One of my objectives in the area of policy is to bring to fruition the review of local government structures which is at present proceeding.  I do not think that anyone who has any knowledge of the system would at this stage query the need to modernise and adapt local government to the requirements of the current age.  It is essential that local authorities should be able to respond quickly and effectively to the challenges presented by social and economic change and that the system should be efficient in delivering services to the public.</P>
    <P>I am also very concerned to strengthen the democratic operation of local government. This applies particularly to adapting the system to the major changes which have taken place in town populations. In many cases now a major proportion of townspeople are living outside their own town boundaries &mdash; in some cases indeed there are more living outside than inside: Ennis and Navan are examples. These people have no say in the election of the town councils on which they depend for major services and this is an obvious anomaly &mdash; and a serious one &mdash; in the practical operation of local democracy.  In Dublin, of course, special problems of area definition and representation have also arisen in consequence of the massive increase in population there.</P>
    <P>We also have to see how reform in local government systems might reflect the growth in community organisations and their willingness and capacity to contribute to local well-being.  Before concluding this review I will be having discussions with the County Councils' General Council and the Association of Municipal Authorities and it will be my intention to bring forward comprehensive proposals for reform as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A major criticism made of this budget by the Opposition is that &ldquo;it does nothing&rdquo;. What it does, of course, is that it provides for a continuation of the conditions in which the substantial gains emerging at the end of 1983 and to which I have referred can be further built on <Col N="1311" />&mdash; these include a substantial reduction in inflation, improvement in balance of payments, increased industrial output and exports, reduced interest rates, etc. In particular it will further help to create the essential pre-conditions to enable us to benefit from the expected gradual upturn in the world economy.  The measures being pursued by the Government are boosting business confidence which is necessary if we are to reverse the decline in private sector investment and in the process facilitate development and create jobs.  All in all this budget is a further step on the road back from the brink of economic disaster as reached by the Opposition prior to their U-turn on the irresponsible economic policies pursued by them over the period 1977 to 1981.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Labour I became acutely aware of the very real talents and commitment among our younger people. What is essential is that we provide the necessary confidence and create the climate to utilize and build on this unique asset.  I am convinced that the responsible lead being given by this Government, together with the benefits accruing from the expected upturn in the world economy and the substantially reduced inflation rates, with related improved competitiveness, will create the conditions in which new development will again freely take place.  It is in this way that we will provide the required new jobs and improved living conditions for all our people.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister for the Environment, one could be excused for saying that this budget is an extraordinary exercise in political cynicism typified in the abandonment of everything on which the so-called Coalition were elected.  They have reneged on their employment strategy, on the questions of the budget deficit, on social welfare allowances and health charges, on their treatment of the taxpayer and the lack of attention to tax reform, as well as their shameful disregard for the agricultural sector.  This budget cannot achieve what the economy requires.  There is a refusal to accept responsibility for the <Col N="1312" /> depression that prevades the lifestyle of every section of the community.  It fails to recognise the potential for reform and for a return to growth in the economy.</P>
      <P>This budget condemns those at work to new levels of frustration and insecurity; it condemns those without work to the prospect of never having employment; it condemns those unable or too old to work to the poverty line.  It is a total negation of the joint agreement published in December 1982.  It is an abandonment of that agreement which was sold to the electorate as the means whereby this Government would deal with our social and economic ills.  It is an abandonment of the Fine Gael sacred cow of so-called financial rectitude.  This is not a neutral budget.  It is just a hotchpotch of compromises more concerned with elections and staying in power than practising what the Coalition parties have been preaching for a number of years.</P>
      <P>The greatest single disappointment is the acceptance by the Government of the inevitability of unemployment at an unacceptable level and their obvious incompetence or impotence in dealing with the job crisis.  Our unemployment situation is the greatest social and economic problem we have.  That has been said by every speaker in this House during the past 12 months but it must be borne in mind that the Government are charged with the responsibility for doing something about it.  They have reneged on it and have so frustrated the population that people are left with no option but to believe that their children will never obtain gainful employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in youth unemployment is double the EEC average and what should be our greatest strength is turning out to be our national nightmare &mdash; youth unemployment.  That very statistic should have been the only figure which really mattered in the budget strategy but it received only one mention when the Minister said that the labour force was increasing.  That was the only recognition given by this Government who stated in their joint programme that unemployment would be their primary concern. What was the expectation of youth just a week ago?  It was that the Minister <Col N="1313" /> would find it possible to announce some new initiatives, some new incentives to business, some new planning structure in relation to our resources which would give hope to the throng of unemployed. Their hopes were dashed.  Some 70,000 young people under the age of 25 have lost faith in our democracy and in this institution.  The requirement is 20,000 new jobs per annum to deal with the job demands of our young unemployed.  One would have thought that the Minister for Finance would have recognised that fact and put us in the picture.</P>
    <P>Between 1982 and 1983 there were 55,000 redundancies and the Government have not attempted to find replacement jobs.  There are 30,000 fewer people in manufacturing industry than there were in 1980.  The industrial base has been stripped naked.  This was made patently clear to the Government in recent submissions from interested parties who were seeking a change of heart by the Government in regard to opportunities for business to regenerate itself.  They were disappointed and our young people are totally frustrated.  The Government have neither the will, the capacity nor the competence to deal with that one issue which they promoted as the primary objective in their agreement for coalition. The cost to the economy in 1984 is estimated at approximately £900 million to meet the payments and to cater for the lost tax revenue of the unemployed.  The number unemployed is not 208,000; it is much closer to 250,000, because there are many people, particularly young people, who do not sign on.  The Department have made the conditions for qualifying so restrictive that many people have ceased to sign on.  However there is no recognition in the budget that the position is so bad except for one miserable line which gave the total number of people coming on stream.</P>
    <P>Ministers and Government spokesmen always ask what alternative the Opposition would provide.  I will give a brief outline of some measures which could be taken.  There is need for a short-term emergency strategy to deal with unemployment. It could be catered for under <Col N="1314" /> the following headings.  There must be a greater emphasis on the construction industry and not in accordance with some of the figures the Minister gave just now which I will blow a hole in later on.  There is need for greater investment in infrastructural developments.  There is need for the development of our natural resources.  No cognisance has been taken of the potential that exists there to deal with unemployment.  If necessary there should be a transfer of financial aid to cater for renewed activity in fishing, forestry, agriculture, tourism and everything that we have or can grow or export.</P>
    <P>No great notice was ever taken of the potential of the services sector.  There should be a plan to cater for that.  There was a complete negation of our plan to deal with import substitution.  If the Government were serious about this there are a minimum of 50,000 jobs which could be created in this area.  We are told that we import £800 million worth of products for the building industry which we could make here.  Even if one job could be created for every £10,000 worth we import, we could create 80,000 jobs in this area.</P>
    <P>There is great need to develop small industries.  We have heard a lot of lip service paid to this area but nothing concrete has been done.  I am talking about the development of enterprise centres and so on.  There is one area which the Minister might consider getting money from to cater for the programmes I am suggesting.  I am sure this will please the Labour Minister opposite.  The time has come when our financial institutions, if properly approached, could make a considerable contribution to these programmes. They have vast funds available. They should be approached in the national interest.  They should make their resources available with perhaps a moratorium on the interest.  The banks and financial institutions will not be able to survive if we continue on the path we are now on.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment referred to the construction industry.  I found it difficult to know what Budget Statement he was referring to.  On page 66 of the published Public Capital Programme <Col N="1315" /> for 1984 there is reference to the productive infrastructure capital money made available over the years.  In the last two Fianna Fáil administrations there was an increase of 51 per cent and 25 per cent respectively in what was made available to the building industry under that heading.  Last year the out-turn represented a reduction of 17 per cent on the total moneys available for the building industry.  This year it is suggested there will be a 1 per cent increase which, with inflation at 10 per cent, means a 9 per cent decrease.  The Minister for the Environment had the audacity to say he was proud of these figures.  Does he realise that the figure for the unemployed is totally inadequate and is an inadequate response to the crisis which exists in the construction industry?  The indicators, as far as the industry are concerned, are dismal.  The amount of work they have for the future is declining.  The professionals one would expect to remain in the business are seeking the quickest way out to other jurisdictions and walks of life.  If they are staying they are on the dole hoping for the return of a good Fianna Fáil Government who always understood the need to protect the construction industry.  We always believed it was one of the fundamentals for job creation on and off site.</P>
    <P>The volume of investment fell in 1982 by 12 per cent and by 15 per cent in 1983 in this industry.  Total unemployment is now at 50,000 people.  Is the Minister seriously telling the House that he has a solution to that from the figures outlined in the capital expenditure programme?  It does not make sense and the people in the construction industry are on record as telling the Minister and the Government that that is their view as well.  The 50,000 people unemployed in the construction industry are costing the Government and the taxpayers about £70 million in unemployment and pay-related benefits.  It is accepted that about £30 million is lost in revenue to the State. That adds up to £100 million approximately, which has to be catered for in the current budget deficit.  If there was a reduction of £124 million last year in the <Col N="1316" /> capital programme for the building industry it seems very poor economics to lose £124 million of construction and infrastructural development and at the same time include £100 million on the current deficit to cater for those unemployed in the industry.</P>
    <P>To put the Minister in the picture, I would remind him that a substantial proportion of the total number of companies which closed last year were construction companies.  An unfortunate consequence of any such closure is that trainee, apprenticeship and recruitment schemes are discontinued also.  That area of activity almost ceased in 1983.  We experienced also the virtual destruction of the construction industry materials industry and of the services backup. Therefore, it is not a matter only of the number of people working for a construction company at the time of closure who become unemployed.  There are many other people involved also.</P>
    <P>Despite the seriousness of this matter, there is no effort being made to deal with it.  We have a situation in which not even lip service is being paid to the problem. In the public capital expenditure in so far as it affected the building industry there was an increase of 31 per cent in 1981 and an increase of 14 per cent in 1982 &mdash; on both occasions Fianna Fáil were in Government &mdash; while the outturn for last year represented a reduction of 10 per cent in a grand total of £1.154 billion. This year we are told there will be a further reduction of 2 per cent on the already reduced figure.  We may take it, then, that in effect there is a reduction of about 12 per cent in real terms in the public capital expenditure programme in terms of the building industry.  That situation can only spell disaster for another 10,000 people who otherwise might continue to be employed in that industry.</P>
    <P>The disintegration of the capital expenditure programme in terms of the building industry is the fundamental reason for the high level of unemployment in the industry.  The budget deficit is being increased by leaps and bounds in order to cater for both the lost revenue and the benefits that must be paid to those people who lose their jobs, whether <Col N="1317" /> they have been employed directly in the industry or in ancillary industries.</P>
    <P>There is a great need to increase capital expenditure to allow the construction industry, not just to revive itself, but to survive.  The time has come when the Government must stop starving existing contracts of necessary funds to complete the work involved.  This is another strategy that has been developed by the Department of the Environment in the past year or so.  The idea is to ensure that once a job starts the certificates are not sent in for some time and that when they are received, the whole situation is stalled long enough to render it impossible to finish the job.  The only result of this is an increase in the completion cost, a factor that is to the detriment of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced recently that he intends to make further capital moneys available for the road network.  What are being made available in this respect are the most paltry and insignificant sums imaginable.  If the Minister thinks that these amounts will result in relieving the situation in so far as the transportation needs of the country are concerned he should take a few Ministerial trips so as to see for himself the extent to which the road network has disintegrated in the past 12 months.  Obviously, the Minister does not travel far from the Pale in his journeys.  He has not succeeded in persuading his colleagues in Government to make available the capital moneys the local authorities need to deal with what is an essential part of our infrastructural needs.</P>
    <P>As I have said, for a long time there has been only scant attention given to the need to develop small industries.  We can all recall with some joy the big movement that took place in the past 15 years in attracting major foreign multi-national concerns, particularly in the technological field, to this country.  It was not popular in those earlier years to advance the need to cater for our small industries. However, there was a change of heart, with all the verbosity that accompanies such changes from time to time, but that is no substitute for doing something positive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> The Opposition must again put forward the alternatives that will regenerate growth in our economy.  I say this because of the lack of any fresh thinking from the Government.  The time has come for us to have a national plan that will incorporate innovation and small enterprise centres.  To undertake such work effectively it would be necessary to transfer some of the resources that are available and to move away from the red tape that is preventing some of the Government agencies from dealing properly with this area.  I suggest that some of the existing floorspace under the control of the IDA should be made available to organisations and groups who are interested in utilising it for small enterprise-centre type operations.  It is time also that the existing floorspace owned by local authorities is made available for such purposes. One can hardly credit how slow local authorities are in making floorspace available to interested parties.  There seems to be much reluctance on the part of State agencies, both nationally and locally, to provide, to lease or to give accommodation to people interested in helping themselves from the resources that are available.  We should utilise more capital to build, to purchase, and to lease workspace, not to cater for the big multi-nationals who are in a position to cater for themselves from their own resources but for the small operator who requires 300 or perhaps 500 square feet of workspace and who has not the expertise that the bigger operator has.  It is not enough that the small operator be told by politicians that he will be given all the assistance that can be given to a new entrepreneur.  He should be actively supported and promoted.  There are one or two incentive centres that have been very successful but they should be repeated in the context of a national plan throughout the country.  We should start by choosing a few towns and making available to those who are willing and interested some of the floorspace that is available to national and local agencies.</P>

      <P>The Minister has transferred from the Department of the Environment where obviously he was responsible in some part for the disaster as outlined on page 66 of this book.  But if he is to repeat that sort of performance in his new Department he would be well to keep quiet at this time.</P>
      <P>There is a need also to mobilise the regional offices of the IDA in conjunction with county development teams.  There seems to be somewhat of a strain in that connection all the time.  Perhaps the Minister would apply his good offices to that area to help those young people coming from the programme set up under another agency under the control of the Minister and who are now frustrated because at the conclusion of the programme they have no place to go.  I have met several of them in recent weeks. Their one cry is what will they do now. The Government have the power to deal with the matter and I suggest that they apply themselves to it.  I would support the setting up of trade fairs for small industries in each county to show what is available and what can be sold on the home and the foreign markets.  We are trying to encourage young people to learn new skills but at the end of the day we are sending them out on the streets without any hope of work.</P>
      <P>It all comes back to the joint programme entered into by the Coalition parties.  They should be honest and say they have failed and are not accepting that document as the standard to be applied to the economy.  The budget deficit is a typical example.  At one stage last year the figure was £897 million, as a result of a trick in summer it grew to £950 million and the outturn was £1,085 million. I do not know if that is in accordance with the language in the joint programme but I could not find it stated there that it was the intention of the Government to allow the budget deficit to increase. Obviously they have abandoned the joint programme, as they have abandoned the task of reducing the budget deficit during the next four years.  I wish they would state that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> This budget is just one of three this year and everyone knows that.  The man in the street knows that if there is no allowance for public service pay in the budget it is obvious that a supplementary budget will be needed later.  In addition, it will be a case of diminishing returns in respect of the hardy annuals and there will be no buoyancy in the economy. These items will have to be dealt with by means of further budgets.  I presume the first one will be after the European elections and the second budget sometime after the summer recess.  The general public are well prepared for that.  Let us not forget one point, namely, that removing the budget deficit in five years won the Coalition Government the last general election.  They have abandoned that now and they should do the decent thing and say so.</P>
    <P>They hope the deficit will go away by allowing it to reduce as a percentage of GNP and they are depending on international economic growth to provide them with the necessary excuse.  I should like to put them on warning with regard to this matter.  Last year in the United States the deficit was $64 billion and the outturn this year is expected to be $100 billion.  I hope the Government get the message.  What is happening in the United States is election politics also. While the American people can tolerate a deficit of $100 billion this year to elect the incumbent in office, there is nothing surer but that as soon as the election is over there will be a battening down in America again and we will be back in another recessionary period.  That will not give us the growth of 2 per cent or 2.75 per cent about which we have heard so much recently.</P>
    <P>The man in the street does not want to know about gross national product.  He wants to know about the Government's actions with regard to their Programme for Government.  If that programme stated the budget deficit would be reduced, how did it happen that last year the outturn was £1,085 million and that for this year it is estimated at this point, without taking into account what will happen later in the year, at £1,088 million? <Col N="1321" /> The simple truth is that the budget deficit is not being reduced, rather is it increasing.</P>
    <P>It can be further substantiated that the Government have reneged on their written stated commitment to the people. Last year the national debt was £15.7 billion, an increase over the previous year when it was £12.8 billion.  In simple arithmetic it means that in one year the national debt increased by £2.9 billion, an increase of 22 per cent.  That was borrowed money and I want to know what is all this talk about the Government reducing international foreign borrowing. The truth is that £15.7 billion means a sum of £4,485 per person of the population and last year the Government increased the national debt for every individual by £800.</P>
    <P>What did we get for that increased borrowing by the Coalition Government, despite the fact that they were adopting a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude, that they would reduce borrowing and the budget deficit?  What return did we get for that extra borrowing?  The Irish people know what they got so far as hardship is concerned. Last year's budget was referred to by all commentators as the toughest since the foundation of the State.  If that was the case, then the budget this year must have been even tougher because it simply added to the 1983 budget.</P>
    <P>What about the &ldquo;funny money&rdquo; in the budget?  I will give the House a few examples where the Government found it useful to cook the books in the bookkeeping exercise last Wednesday.  There was a sum of £50 million pre-payment of interest from An Bord Telecom.  A sum of £20 million was brought forward from the building societies and £7 million extra tax revenue from the self-employed.  All of those moneys will have to be catered for next year.  The Government are borrowing this year in advance of the outturn for next year.  That money will have to be found and it will be done in budget No. 2 or budget No. 3 this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the income tax provisions, it is unfair and misleading to the ordinary taxpayers to suggest they will be better off.  Whatever about the civil servants <Col N="1322" /> who framed the figures for the budget, I am quite sure the poor innocents who typed the reports knew well they were being codded and every PAYE worker knows this also.  If there had been no change in the tax bands, allowances would have had to increase by about £650 for married people to enable the taxpayers just to stand still.  The increase granted by the Minister is £700 and the bands adjustments and the tax allowance increases mean, according to the Minister, that 15,000 people will leave the tax net temporarily.  He forgot to use that word but he brought into the Budget Statement a new sentence that will reflect on him for the rest of his life.  He said the tax would move progressively.  I say to him that the 15,000 people who might, he says, temporarily find themselves out of the tax bracket will only result in 56,000 persons going from the 25 per cent to the 35 per cent bracket.  How else could the Minister not suck in from the taxpayers the extra £90 million in his revenue figures? He had to get it from someone in the PAYE sector and he is simply trying to create an illusion when he says people will be better off.</P>
    <P>Many of the 15,000 he says will temporarily find themselves out of the tax bracket will before the end of the year find themselves back in again.  But they will be back in when they get a small increase in their wages.  If that increase is in accord with the inflation rate it should be somewhere around 10 per cent and so these people will not find themselves back in at 25 per cent but at 35 per cent. The PAYE sector will therefore be worse off.  There is no concession to them despite the fact this is our second effort at a concession.  Each budget has sucked in more money from the PAYE sector despite the fact that it was stated here unequivocally in their joint programme for action that they would relieve the burden of tax and reform the tax structure. If that is not cynicism I do not know what it is.  It is an abandonment of a promise given.  It is a reneging on something duly agreed, on something expected by the general public, but we still do not have it.</P>
    <P>A great many people were taken aback <Col N="1323" /> last week.  Mark you, the Government have done a fairly good job at selling the next item with which I shall deal but it will dawn before too long on the ordinary person that the bond washing operation is not all it is alleged to be.  The Minister has cleverly suggested to the general public that he has got hold of some tax evaders and, because of that, he is a great fellow.  Let me put the matter in perspective. If I am wrong the Minister can put me right.  The Minister and the GIM and the agencies attached to the Government are seeking to create an image of some investors and some institutions being involved in some kind of large tax fiddle. That is the perception they would like to generate in the public mind.  The short-term advantage they are getting as a result of that provision in the budget will have very long-term consequences and it is not true to say the Government were not aware of that.  They were fully aware of the practice.  The Department of Finance were fully aware of the practice. Why would they not be?  Government securities were involved and successive Governments have always maintained that these securities should be exempt from capital gains tax.  That was a Government ploy down through the years.</P>
    <P>This Government are not coming down on some tax avoiders.  They dream up the figure of £30 million.  I would like to know where they got that £30 million which will come into the coffers because of the bond washing operation.  The budget could not suggest a figure.  If the Minister had a figure, if he could have dreamed up a figure as he dreamed up so many other figures to make his balancing act a little more credible, he would have shoved in the £30 million.  He could not give us the figure in his Budget Statement but suddenly now the Department of Finance can serve up a figure of around £30 million. Had they had that figure last week the Minister would have used it.  This £30 million figure is a fiction.  The figure will be nothing like that.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin we have to deal with the disadvantages of what the Minister is doing.  The Stock <Col N="1324" /> Exchange is our financial market and even the ordinary man-in-the-street knows that when that goes into spasm there is something seriously wrong and no amount of shoring-up publicity that tax avoiders are being caught will disabuse the mind of Seán Citizen, not to talk about the loss of credibility and creditability as a result of this provision.  But it will not be just a lack of confidence &mdash; something that has been well articulated by people &mdash; but what about the non-availability of borrowing from the domestic financial market, borrowing which will be sorely needed by this bankrupt Government?  It will not be there if it is all washed out and so the Government will have to borrow somewhere else and that somewhere else will be the foreign international money market.  We are being put in pawn.  There is no better way I can say it except to say it is surely in accordance with what I viewed in the past two weeks coming into the House &mdash; the pawnbrokers parade.  Take a look at it outside between here and Kildare Street. Beautiful rows of three balls running round both sides of the enclosure.  We have turned the precincts of the House into a pawnbrokers' parade and this provision more than any other condemns us to that.  There will be need for security.</P>
    <P>Where will all these new funds that have been dispossessed of their true and natural home find a new home?  What new paradise is available to them?  Someone suggested the building societies would mop up the thousand millions.  I do not think it would be in the best interests of the building societies to take on more short-term money.  It would certainly give a jerk to building societies' balance of payments and their prospect for loans if they have the money for a fortnight and suddenly found that it was gone at the end of the week.  The money will not find a home with the building societies.  It will find its way out of the jurisdiction.  It has been suggested it might find its way into other institutions but what has happened in the last week where bond washing is concerned is that £1,000 million of Irish taxpayers' money is now being made available to restructure <Col N="1325" /> the British economy at the expense of our own.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that it is only financial institutions which will suffer. Financial institutions get their money from small investors.  In turn that money is invested and subsequently comes back by way of interest and an increase in capital.  But investors are being forced now to invest outside the country and they will have no control.  The market has been taken away from them and bond washing is simply an exercise in whitewashing the budget hardship we have endured for the past week.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions not quite as serious but yet provisions which will have a very big impact on Seán Citizen.  I refer to the VAT.  The introduction of VAT on clothes has been a pre-occupation of Fine Gael for the last couple of years. They were thwarted on one previous occasion but, with political vindictiveness, it was going to be rammed down the throats of the general public whether they liked it nor not.  The tax was brought in at 8 per cent, but the aim is progressively to apply it up to the level of other goods taxes of 18, 23 or 35 per cent.  That is the reason for the new term mentioned in the Minister's speech of progressive activity in so far as economic matters are concerned.</P>
    <P>This provision takes no notice of the number of clothing companies which have been forced to close in the past couple of years.  For this industry to survive there must be a stable trading climate. One must generate consumer spending, but the position of the industry has been weakened in the past week.  This is going to lead to increased imports, which means increased closures.  It is typical of the attitude permeating the whole Budget Statement which is: get the figures right irrespective of the job losses. Fourteen thousand jobs are at risk in our clothing industry, in which 8,000 jobs have been lost since 1979. There has been an erosion of competitiveness in that industry in those few years.  Importation of low class merchandise is flooding the market but, nevertheless, although this could be the straw that would break the back of that industry, <Col N="1326" /> the Government got back at the general public.  Because they were defeated on this once, they would not continue to be defeated on it.</P>

      <P>Cross-Border traffic was going to be reduced.  We are all the time talking about traffic going up in the opposite direction.  There had been a fair traffic down here for the purchase of our merchandise in the clothing industry, but the Government are just cutting that out as not being worth while.  This is an insensitive measure imposed on the most sensitive employment industry.  It spells the end of another indigenous industry in the short-term.</P>
      <P>In the midst of a whole range of bad deeds, the social welfare provisions of this budget take their place in the order of merit.  The unsocial, insensitive face of the Labour Party is shown.  It was understood that if any provision of the budget was under the direct control of the Labour Party, it surely must have been the social welfare provision.  What a disappointment to everybody who has to be a beneficiary under our social welfare system.  There will be no largesse in that respect, so far as the Labour Party are concerned.  That party have learned very little.  One would have thought that the defection of one of their better Members on one previous occasion, would have shown them the light but that lesson has not yet been learned by Deputy Bell.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that some of the pseudo-socialists who jabber away beside that Deputy had not a little more courage when the opportunity was given to them. They are more concerned with protecting their own rotten seats in here than in providing, even in the harshest of harsh times, the limited amount necessary to keep body and soul together in the thousands depending on our social welfare system.  The provision is 7 per cent from next July, but I presume that it is for the whole year, that that 7 per cent will last to the end of December.  A simple bit of <Col N="1327" /> arithmetic will show that that is 3½ per cent in the whole year, if starting from 1 January.  These people have to live other weeks as well, not just from July.  The actual increase would amount to one-third of the inflation rate to which the Government are admitting.  If that is not telling the old age pensioner, the retired or sick person, the deserted wife and any other beneficiary that there will be a positive decrease &mdash; excuse the paradox &mdash; in their living standards, I do not know what is.  If anyone can suggest, and particularly the Labour Minister present, that reducing the standard of living of the old age pensioners and the sick is in accordance with the so-called document on joint agreement on Coalition strategy and in accordance with socialist thinking, it is time all the Labour Members did what their former Leader, Deputy O'Leary, did and joined up with the ultra right-wing conservatives to whom they are latched anyway.</P>

      <P>Thousands of medical cards are being withdrawn every day.  Whether the Minister knows it or not, the limit now is £85 per week for a married couple to qualify for a medical card.  In this Budget Statement two old age contributary pensioners would have £96.50p between them for the week, which would mean that they would not be entitled to a medical card, even if the £5 extra is given to them from next June.  If that provision of £5 extra eligibility limit for certain old people had to be made, it means that nobody else will be entitled to that before the end of the year.  That is the realism of it.  It will be trotted out that all this shows the need for reform of the health services.  Children's allowances are increased by 7.1 per cent &mdash; from August next, of course.  That is the princely sum of 20p per week per child. In effect, it is 8p a week per child from today on.  What a magnanimous gesture to the campaign against poverty of the so-called Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unemployment assistance for <Col N="1328" /> smallholders has already been dealt with by many speakers.  This is a matter of concern right now to the 16,500 small holders on our west coast from Donegal to Kerry who have had their benefits slashed and their living standards cut in half by the imposition of something which does not stand up to scrutiny, because the High Court decision need not apply in this case, if the Government so wished. You cannot use the Griffiths valuation system to gain tax revenue, but there is nothing in the court judgement which says that it cannot be used as the yardstick to give out benefits.  The living standards of all smallholders from Donegal to Kerry are being decimated in support of some new policy which nobody can yet quite understand except the political reason that there is no Labour participation, front or backbench, in the Government of this House and that there will be none. That is why we must suffer the brunt of their ire at this time.</P>
    <P>We also have to suffer in other ways as well so far as health is concerned.  We have the new health system under which one can get sick on a five day week &mdash; the new sickness syndrome of &ldquo;get sick from Monday to Friday, but do not dare to attempt to do so on Saturday or Sunday&rdquo;. That is what, in effect, the health cuts mean to the health boards, as they have been directed by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  To give the Minister one simple example to bring it home to him, it involves a reduction of £4.5 million, or a cut-back to the Western Health Board.  Whether the Minister knows it &mdash; and the proposals are not now a matter for negotiation &mdash; it is being directed at that £4.5 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no choice but to accept it, but it is not the first time I have had this.  There is a cut-back on essential emergency services directed now by several health boards because of the direction of the Minister.  I understand the response to be: who will take responsibility if somebody should be unfortunate enough to get caught up in some tragedy? The answer is that the health boards will pass on that responsibility to the Minister. Therefore in effect what we are being told is that this country will no longer be able to provide the minimum emergency services necessary to keep the health boards going.  To save that £4.5 million in the Western Health Board means that Castlebar General Hospital would have to be closed for 15 months.  Today we are told that the emergency ambulance services in the Western Health Board area have to be curtailed, that there are new rostering systems, which means there will not be an ambulance to bring the unfortunate ill to hospitals.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude by saying that the unemployment will remain unemployed and will be joined by thousands of others this year.  The employed will have their frustration turned into despair.  Whatever about the pawnbrokers' parade that goes on out in the Kildare Street forecourt, I contend that this Government are selling out our greatest national asset, our people, and they are doing it for short-term monetarist advantage.  I put it to them now, that the IMS poll said there was 68 per cent of our people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I listened, as I normally do, to Deputy Flynn with a degree of interest, concern and attention.  Certainly I was gratified that we had seen fit in this budget to reduce VAT on theatre tickets from 35 per cent to 5 per cent because Deputy Flynn's performance certainly justified the belief that there is within the Irish people a theatrical tradition, which if properly harnessed, could earn great revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Deputy's hour long flight of fantasy he was driven at one point to exclaim, in relation to his critical analysis of our policies, that there was not even lip service paid in the budget to some of the problems he went on to identify. I heard Deputy Flynn speak from these benches in 1977 and describe the Fianna Fáil manifesto published at that time &mdash; during that enormous epochmaking year &mdash; as the most important book to have been published in Ireland since the Bible.  I heard him say that with my own ears sitting over there.  I say to Deputy Flynn, and to Deputy Ormonde who was not in the House at that time, that the last time we had a budget with which people thought they could be happy or cheer about was in 1977.  Yet they are still paying for it and their children and their grandchildren will be paying for it because of the kind of extraordinarily confused mixture of liberal popularism and contradictory arithmetic, logic and semantics we have just heard from Deputy Flynn.</P>

If manifestos could create jobs we would not have any unemployment and if resolutions could build hospitals we would not have anybody awaiting hospitalisation.  Finally if election promises, such as Fianna Fáil election promises, could drain this land, then the Shannon would have been drained years ago.</P>
      <P>The Deputy advanced one good idea in the course of his contribution, one which I give him an undertaking to pursue, that is the question of investigating the available floor space in IDA advance factories and other such institutions.  but, for all of that, it seems to me that the Deputy was incapable &mdash; and it is a tragedy for this democratic process hopefully soon to be broadcast &mdash; that, for example, in relation to the question of VAT on clothes, he obviously did not hear Mr. Jodi Carr on the radio last Saturday say that the rate was reasonably acceptable, that by and large the industry was not surprised.  Finally in relation to the so-called telling point of the Deputy's argument &mdash; that it would contribute to job losses as a result of extra imports &mdash; Mr. Carr's considered view, and he is one of the major manufacturers in this area, is that because for the first time the importers of foreign made clothes will have to pay VAT at point of entry, domestic manufacturers of such clothing items, now subjected to VAT at 8 per cent, will for the first time have a differential advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore some of his <Col N="1332" /> arguments advanced in that area, his journey down the woes of the building industry were like a broken record.  He refused, as do Fianna Fáil's speakers frequently, to put the other side of the argument.  At present the ordinary taxpayer pays over 70 pence in every pound that goes on to every building site in this industry.  And if there has been a withdrawal of capital from the construction industry it has not been by the public sector, rather it has been by the private sector, the same private sector that did very well in boom years in the building industry.  In particular the Deputy bemoaned &mdash; and I had to give some information in this regard to the Deputy's colleague, Deputy S. Brennan &mdash; the importation of building materials, the importation of materials generally.  He should realise that that was as a direct consequence of the Fianna Fáil overheating of the building industry in 1978-1979.  Many of the importers are prominent Fianna Fáil supporters.  The Deputy well knows to whom I am referring when I say that.</P>

      <P>For all of that, in so far as the Deputy came forward with the idea of stopping the building industry getting any more advance factories &mdash; which no doubt did not form part of his criticism but that of the CIF &mdash; I will accept that there is need for no more advance factories, despite the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That point certainly has merit and we should look at it.  I might turn now to points I want to make in my capacity as Minister for Labour and to confine the remainder of my remarks to <Col N="1333" /> the priorities I want to set for myself in the Department of Labour.  Nineteen eighty three, as even the most biased commentator will admit, was a year of significant economic achievements for this Government.  Difficult economic decisions were forced upon us, not least due to the pied piper policies which had brought this country to the brink of ruin. These decisions enabled major improvements in several aspects of our nation's finances.  The balance of payments and industrial production significantly improved, the downward trend in the rate of inflation was continued, there was a significant reduction in the current budget deficit as a proportion of our gross national product.  Most importantly, the rate of increase in unemployment has slowed down and in recent months has been halved.  It is still far too much but, if we can take any comfort from trends &mdash; and we cannot take an awful lot &mdash; there is comfort to be taken from those I have just mentioned.</P>
      <P>Unemployment remains the greatest single manifestation of our economic difficulties. The human dimensions of unemployment &mdash; the social and economic deprivation to individuals and families, the loss of opportunity to develop skills and talents, the crisis of confidence which it engenders &mdash; are not really registered in these statistics.  In the final analysis the total waste of the resources of our educational system are not reflected in the impact that unemployment has on the individuals who suffer from it.  It does not give me much comfort to say that our unemployment problem is not unique.  It derives in part from the world economic crisis which, with its combination of structural and contingent features, is sparing neither the industrialised nor the developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although certain economic indicators are improving a little, we can scarcely expect that, at the present time, growth rates will be sufficient in the near future to bring down or even hold in check the level of unemployment in Europe, given the demographic features in play and the probability of increased productivity <Col N="1334" /> through the introduction of new technologies.</P>
    <P>As a small open trading economy, Ireland has not been in a position to remain isolated from the effects of the international downturn in aggregate economic activity and we have witnessed a depressing succession of major industrial closures.  Regrettably and painfully this House has had to debate some of them. The level of unemployment now stands at over twice that which obtained in Janaury 1980 when the recession first began to show up in the unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>At least Deputy Flynn and I are sensible and wise enough to know that we cannot play party politics in that regard because there has been a succession of administrations presiding over those figures since 1980.  The widening gap between the demand for and the supply of labour has been particularly evident in the area of youth unemployment, where unemployment has been rising at over twice the adult rate.</P>
    <P>The Government are acutely aware of the urgency of coming to grips with our unemployment problem.  We have made exceptional efforts to implement policies targeted at youth in the areas of education, training, work experience and employment through the commitment of substantial Exchequer resources.  On a wider level, the commitment of this Government to proper economic planning through the establishment of structures such as the Task Force on Employment and the National Planning Board and the development of strategies to maximise industrial development will ultimately bear fruit in the creation of self-sustaining employment.</P>
    <P>In addition, a Government Task Force on Employment has been established in order to identify measures which can be taken immediately to relieve unemployment.</P>
    <P>The planning board report to the Government through the Task Force. Their main functions are to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the productive sectors and to recommend policy measures which would maximise their contributions to output and employment. I am now going to propose that, in addition <Col N="1335" /> to the work which they are already doing, they will try to explore how public works could be undertaken and financed at minimum Exchequer cost as an alternative to expenditure on unemployment benefits.  This will be done in consultation with the social partners but as part of an overall policy of considering measures whereby the imperatives of social equity can be reconciled with the need to secure an efficient use of public resources.</P>
    <P>In that context, the board will also be submitting to the Government a draft medium-term plan for the economy as a whole.  The Government have decided that a medium-term public capital programme will also be prepared this year. In addition, arrangements are being made to streamline the Government accounting system to indicate the level of expenditure on major areas of policy.  All these measures are designed to bring more order and clarity into the business of Government.</P>
    <P>Arising from these initiatives at national level, it follows that corresponding improvements in the planning, implementation and review of action at Departmental level are also required.  As Minister for Labour, I am currently in the process of drawing up a two-year work programme for my Department, in the light of the budget provisions showing what measures are to receive priority treatment in the allocation of resources and staff and what results are expected. I intend to keep developments under review so that such modifications as may appear necessary in the light of experience will be quickly made.</P>
    <P>I am also examining what type of institutional arrangements are needed to improve the overall management of my Department by the clearer identification and definition of the Department's aims, policies and strategies and how policies can best be translated into detailed programmes and activities incorporating time scales, targets and quantified outputs, where feasible.  Obviously, action in these areas will have to accord with priorities and targets as determined by the Government.  The major consideration in all these exercises is to ensure <Col N="1336" /> the best value for money through the most efficient and effective use of available resources.</P>
    <P>The development of manpower policy which will complement strategies of employment creation falls within my brief.  I am determined during my period of office, that manpower policy will achieve a priority status within the work of my Department, that occupational guidance, training and placement services to job seekers will be improved and that every initiative which can contribute to the alleviation of our present unemployment crisis, will be taken.</P>
    <P>In this connection I wish to refer to the work of AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency.  I am aware that there has been some criticism of the lack of co-ordination of the activities of the various manpower agencies, including the Youth Employment Agency, and in particular &mdash; I want to stress this point &mdash; a perceived lack of co-ordination between certain bodies in the education field.  That there are serious problems both in regard to the definition of a coherent policy for manpower development, youth employment and training, as well as in bringing about a co-ordinated approach by the various state agencies involved must be broadly acknowledged.  I am not afraid to do so.  Since taking office I have been able to help the agency come to grips with some of the teething problems which have constrained them from achieving their objectives.  I propose to pursue these as vigorously as I possibly can.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Departments of Labour and Education, Deputy George Birmingham, has been given special responsibility to produce an early and complete report on the co-ordination of the activities of the manpower agencies associated with the Department of Labour and the educational agencies associated with the Department of Education in so far as these impinge on labour market developments.</P>
    <P>Within the policy framework recently published by the Youth Employment Agency, there is a consideration which I would like to highlight.  This is the need to develop the enterprise and commitment to self-help among young people. <Col N="1337" /> That there is considerable potential for a positive response from Irish workers, of every age, to initiatives of this kind is well illustrated by the enterprise allowance scheme launched last month.</P>
    <P>This imaginative innovation, which recognises the initiative and self-enterprise of so many among the unemployed, has proven remarkably successful and generated a significant response in its very short period of operation.  Prior to the introduction of this scheme, many unemployed people found themselves in a Catch 22 situation.  While drawing social welfare benefits, they could not engage in work or business; if they set about establishing their own business they could not guarantee themselves or their dependants an income, no matter how basic.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Labour, I have responsibility for administering the enterprise allowance scheme which is designed to encourage people drawing unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit for at least 13 weeks to set up their own enterprise.  Instead of the social welfare benefits, they are paid a weekly allowance of £50 or £30, depending on marital status, for up to a period of one year.  With its introduction on a pilot basis in December 1983, 500 places were made available, 300 for persons over 25 and 200 for younger applicants.  The demand, even already, has more than matched the targets, particularly for those over 25.  In one small provincial town, the allocation was less than ten and there were over 300 applications.</P>
    <P>In the light of this experience I have directed my Department to review the scheme immediately with the object of its expansion and development upwards to a level of between 2,000 and 5,000 places depending on demand to ensure that its continued operation will make the maximum possible contribution to the job creation process.</P>
    <P>In regard to developments at EEC level, I have identified four main lines of approach which I will be pursuing in my capacity as Ireland's Social Affairs representative within the European Community both in the period leading up to and during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> The first concerns implementation of the social guarantee of vocational preparation and training for young people which the European Community adopted last June.  This guarantee is a political commitment aimed at all young people, but in particular at young people leaving at the end of compulsory education without vocational or educational qualifications. If there is a category of young persons with least potential to get jobs on the labour market, then it is that group. The Community have given this commitment but what precisely does it entail?  It is similar to the original Youth Employment Agency policy on which we went before the people in 1981.  In short, this is a commitment to ensure that over the next five years all young persons entering the labour market for the first time will receive vocational training or initial work experience of at least six months' duration and, if possible, one year to break out of the catch 22 situation &mdash; not being able to get a job until they have had experience to qualify for a job.  The implementation of this commitment is one of the Government's main policies for the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>My second priority will be to take account of the recent review of, and to maintain the impetus of successful participation in, the European Social Fund.  It is not recognised by many people just how critical that fund is to the finances and welfare of so many young people. The important features of that review, which was conducted in 1983, are that 75 per cent of the fund will in future be allocated to operations for young persons and, perhaps of more importance to this country, that 40 per cent of the budget will be allocated to the six regions of absolute priority, of which Ireland is one. This allocation should ensure that Ireland will obtain at least the same level of assistance from the social fund as heretofore, which, in the present climate of the EEC finances, is a considerable achievement.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, it is important that the budget of the Social Fund should continue to grow.  While the EEC Commission has indicated that it wishes to see the ESF budget double in size over the next five years, this will hardly be possible <Col N="1339" /> unless the Council of Ministers manage to resolve the question of the United Kingdom budgetary refund and the more difficult one of reform of the CAP.  If the financial resources of the Social Fund should become tighter, competition for the available funds would become more intense and Ireland's share, which now stands at £124 million for operations in 1983, or 9.6 per cent of the total budget, which, having regard to our population represents just under 1 per cent, could be endangered.  During Ireland's Presidency of the Council it will be my intention to ensure that Ireland's position as a region of absolute priority will be safeguarded and that no measure which might undermine that position will be adopted.</P>
    <P>My third area of emphasis is to ensure that during our Presidency the Community will move towards a clearer definition of social policy in the medium term, particularly in regard to unemployment. In this respect I am in total accord with my French colleague, Mr. Beregovoy, currently President of the Council (Labour and Social Affairs) who has referred to the phenomenon of Commission projects remaining for years on the table of either the Council or the Working Party on Social Questions and of the uncertain fate awaiting them in the absence of a consensus of our Governments on the actual nature of such topics or the form of the legal instrument.  I will be having early discussions with the French Minister to ensure that our thinking should lead us to clarify the role and specific nature of Community social policy in relation to the competence of the member states and the two sides of industry.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would mention one proposal which has surfaced in the discussions and which has caused some considerable disagreement and, probably, unease.  This is the so-called Vredeling Directive &mdash; named after the commissioner who formulated it &mdash; on procedures for informing and consulting employees.  I believe that there is need &mdash; particularly during a recession when the need for social cohesion is more and not less important &mdash; for a positive response to a Community <Col N="1340" /> instrument which contains the basic principle for improved procedures for informing and consulting employees.</P>
    <P>The most significant aspect of the debate at present taking place in Ireland concerning the proposal is the negative repercussions which the adoption of a Directive may have on decisions by foreign companies to invest here.  This, I have no doubt, is a consideration which is of importance for other member states, also.  Some member states which already have legislation on information disclosure may be able to maintain foreign investment because of their central location and ready access to large home markets. But with the ever increasing competition between countries for new industry, both within and outside the Community, it is clear that even a small reduction in the available pool of internationally mobile projects would have a disastrous effect on Ireland's ability not only to increase but to maintain the existing level of investment.  This is particularly the case as regards technologically-advanced companies which are knowledge-intensive and whose success depends on knowing more than their competitors.</P>
    <P>For these reasons it is necessary during the further consideration of the Vredeling Directive to distinguish between real opposition, that which has been termed &ldquo;the element of demagogy in the opposition campaign&rdquo; and the residual opposition which, I believe, is considerably more valid opposition, and which was based on the original text whose modification is not yet fully known or fully understood.  There have been intimations &mdash; and perhaps a more forthright assessment is called for &mdash; that the strong and hostile initial reaction of Japanese and American industrialists has been abated somewhat where detailed explanations of the thrust and contents of the revised proposal have been provided.</P>
    <P>The point must be made that this proposal is the result of extensive debate over a number of years.  There is nothing very dramatic or revolutionary about it. The original proposal has been significantly altered, and some would say excessively watered down, and it is clear that <Col N="1341" /> the Commission have given effect to the more far-reaching changes proposed by the European Parliament.  It is also the case that the text, even as it stands, provides a good deal of flexibility and leaves member states considerable latitude in the form, content and timing of implementation. I say to industrialists and promoters that the fears expressed in financial and commercial journals are exaggerated and not properly based in relation to the provision of a constructive system of information between employer and employee.</P>
    <P>It is my firm view that the sharing of information between management and workers and the development of participative structures within the workplace can only have a positive impact especially in regard to the development of a healthy industrial relations environment.  I believe that the communication of all relevant information which does not directly threaten the commercial security or confidentiality of the enterprise is a prerequisite for the development of trust between workers and their employers. There is nothing to fear from such developments. The positive effects in terms of increased industrial peace, as international experience illustrates, far outweigh any misconceptions which may exist regarding the desirability of such measures.</P>
    <P>The question of improved information-sharing and consultative machinery was raised in the Discussion Document on Industrial Relations Reform which was published by my predecessor and colleague, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, in November last year.  I want to repeat and underline the commitment he gave during his term of office as Minister for Labour, that is, that I intend to examine during the course of discussions on reform with both sides of industry, what measures are necessary to stimulate the proper development of such structures at local and national level.</P>
    <P>In regard to the strike statistics for 1983, a number of significant trends are obvious.  Firstly, my Department estimate that the number of days lost due to industrial disputes in 1983 &mdash; standing at 311,000 &mdash; was the lowest number since <Col N="1342" /> 1975.  This would appear to be part of a longer term trend.  The average number of days lost in the four years 1980 to 1983 are about half of the days lost in 1983 according to my Department's estimate. This fits in with previous trends that a small number of strikes account for a large proportion of the days lost.  The proportion of strikes which were unofficial has continued its decline since 1976 when records began, but at 38 per cent these strikes still represent a major cause for concern.</P>
    <P>Any temptation to exploit the genuine fears of workers about their jobs to make short term bargaining gains should be resisted by management.  Managements who handle industrial relations in a restrained and professional way during a recession will be best placed to maintain good relationships and improve productivity further during any upturn.</P>
    <P>In so far as the actual functioning of industrial relations is concerned, the Minister for Labour's role is, of necessity, a limited one.  Above all else, he must avoid becoming involved in individual disputes.  Any such involvement on his part can serve only to devalue the efforts of official agencies such as the Labour Court or the Rights Commissioner service and to absolve the parties directly concerned of the responsibility to settle their own differences.</P>
    <P>Rather than supplanting the responsibilities of either union or management personnel, I see my role as that of helping to create and sustain the conditions conducive to good industrial relations at the level of the individual plant or industry. This is a matter primarily of ensuring that our general structures and practices are adequate for the purposes for which they are intended and are capable of meeting the demands which are placed on them.</P>
    <P>I am pleased, as a consequence, that it will fall to me to advance the process of industrial relations reform initiated by the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh.  Following publication of the discussion document on industrial relations reform in November 1983 meetings were held with ICTU and FUE on the procedural aspects of the proposal discussions.  Progress was made at these meetings and, <Col N="1343" /> while one or two matters remain to be clarified, I am confident that we will get the discussions proper under way in the near future.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to advert to my commitment to full equality between men and women in employment.  I have directed that the review of equality legislation which was begun in 1981 should be completed within a specified time period during this year.  I expect then to be in a position to introduce worthwhile and meaningful amendments to the legislation which will eliminate many of the anomalies which have arisen in the operation of these Acts and which will be in accord with developments in relation to the elimination of discrimination on the basis of sex which are taking place within the European Community.</P>
    <P>I have taken this opportunity to highlight the priorities I see within the Department of Labour and to respond to some of the general points raised by Deputy Flynn.  This budget was carefully balanced between conflicting demands from different sources outside this House, between the need to get our finances right and to stimulate the economy to protect existing jobs, to protect the weak and the needy and create a positive climate for job creation. Nowhere was that conflict so evident as it was in the contradictory speech made by Deputy Flynn.  On the one hand, he called for massive public expenditure and, on the other hand, he berated us for not getting the budget deficit down to the level he thought necessary, and which was indicated as being necessary in the Fianna Fáil document <i>The Way Forward.</i></P>
    <P>If we have achieved the target of £750 million set out in <i>The Way Forward,</i> there would hardly be a construction worker on a building site today, instead of the reduced numbers about whom he appeared to have so much concern.  We have not been given an easy job, and the public at large recognise that.  Within difficult constraints we are attempting to balance the two forces, both of which must be recognised and handled with care and delicacy.  We want to steer a course which will bring us all through our present <Col N="1344" /> difficulties, and not just the strong or those who have been able to survive in different capitalist societies by virtue of their own strength and their own social position.  There is room on our ship for everyone in our society.  The Labour Party in particular will make sure that the most vulnerable passengers will get special treatment in the kind of economy we know we can achieve given time, patience and, above all, courage and endurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the Minister's opening remarks about Deputy Flynn and myself.  Deficit budgeting was begun by Richie Ryan in 1973, not in 1977.  The Coalition aimed at a budget deficit of £850 million in 1983 and we saw what happened to that.  The figure for 1984 is in excess of £1,089 million and they talk about deficit budgeting.  I am glad to have this opportunity to contribute to the budget debate.  The Minister referred to a finely balanced budget, but we all know how finely balanced it was &mdash; what was required to keep Labour in control and how far Fine Gael could go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>You could have fooled me.  It seems there are signs that the long awaited recovery is under way.  A sustained economic recovery is vital to the solving of the problem of unemployment. At present the recovery is extremely fragile. We must not continue to hurl political insults at each other and criticise for the sake of criticising.  When we feel the Government are doing a good job we must commend them, admittedly rarely. We must point out to them where we think they are going wrong in the hope that in the Finance Bill, they will make any changes we feel they should make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have to ensure that the recovery does not mean that those who have will have more in wages, overtime, and so on, while those who have not remain stationary.  The recovery must be translated into more output and more jobs, rather than higher wages and prices which could lead to restrictive monetary <Col N="1345" /> policies and choke off the apparent recovery.</P>
    <P>How does this budget help the recovery? The report of the National Planning Board under Professor Louden Ryan asked for no deflationary package.  The Minister delivered on that.  The report also emphasised the importance of domestic demand to the recovery.  The Minister reneged on that.  The introduction of budgets which fuelled inflation has been halted finally and this should lead to decreased pay demands.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the famous bond washing operation we all read about in the past few days.  The NESC report prepared by a group of UCD academics, which was not published, condemned the fact that investing in gilts leads to high post tax risk free returns while investment in inherently risky manufacturing industry is discriminated against positively relative to Government and property investment.  Money which finds its way into gilts is not available for industry.</P>
    <P>I do not fault the Minister for closing this tax loophole.  I do fault him on the way he set about it.  His vague references led to confusion.  We all know the stock market can stand everything except confusion and uncertainty.  Money estimated at between £250 million and £300 million may be driven out of the system altogether. This seems a bit like cutting off your nose to spite your face.  Is the divisiveness in our community now extending to the bond washers?  Are they to join the self-employed and the farmers as the new villians of the piece?  We must remember they were engaged in tax avoidance, not tax evasion.  The Minister is to be congratulated on finally getting something moving, even if it was only a rush on the stock market.</P>
    <P>I will move on now to the 8 per cent VAT on clothes We all accept that a broader VAT base could lead to a lowering of the rate.  Again I cannot really fault the Minister for putting a low VAT rate on clothes.  But is this the time to do it?  Ten years ago we had 25,000 people employed in the clothing industry.  Today we have 14,000 employed in that industry. Last year alone, 17 clothing firms closed down with a loss of 2,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> However, 80 per cent of our clothes are imports, and I can see no disadvantage in putting 8 per cent VAT on them.  I wonder whether VAT on clothing material at the point of entry could be reconsidered because this leads to a reduced cash flow in an industry already very much troubled.  I would also quibble with the Minister on his arbitrary assignment of ten years as the age at which VAT on clothing applies.  Nobody can consider an 11-year-old to be an adult capable of earning money for his own clothes.  If the Taoiseach is worried about the small woman, I would reassure him that no woman, no matter how small, wishes to wear clothes appropriate for an 11 or 12-year-old.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism's leaked White Paper confirms that he expects the present rate of unemployment to continue until at least 1993.  This means that many well-educated young people will be spending the best years of their lives on the dole.  Will they be doing so on £28 per week?  Middle-aged workers with heavy family responsibilities are now among the long-term unemployed.  They need to be able to live with dignity and with the respect of the community.  How can they do so when they are thrown on the bread-line as at present?</P>
    <P>Civil servants work on the assumption that the average man is trying to milk the system.  Of course, they have to work this way because their primary aim is to save tax pounds.  We are not civil servants; we represent the people.  We know that most of those 208,000 people would give anything for a job.  They want to work and they have a right to work.  Where is the mention of them in this bloodless budget? There is not one word about the unemployed.</P>
    <P>General demand stimulation in priming the pump to stimulate additional employment may have to be ruled out because it would worsen our budget deficit and lead to increased Government borrowing, as well as a possible increase in inflation which is already double that of our competitors.  However, selective stimulation as advocated by the OECD would be less likely to generate additional demand for imports.  They suggest <Col N="1347" /> energy conservation and, more important, renovation and improvement of existing housing blocks.  To this end the Minister has reduced VAT on concrete to 5 per cent but this reduction does not apply to concrete products or cement.  It appears that only ready-mix concrete is reduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given an extra £6 million to housing, £2 million to primary schools, £2 million to Ringaskiddy and £8 million for roads, a total of £18 million to an industry where one in every two is unemployed.  It would be laughable if it were not so tragic.  It should be remembered that money put into job creation leads to a net budgetary cost which is substantially below the gross cost because of reductions in unemployment benefits and increased taxes and PRSI, not to mention the increased spending power of the people now unemployed.</P>
    <P>Tax concessions for venture capital are most welcome.  I hope this will cover services as well as manufacturing industry. In the US services account for 50 per cent of consumer spending and service industries have added an enormous amount to the quite unexpected strength of the US recovery and are expected to do so for the second year in succession. The IDA now cover industry-related services which, although not capital-intensive, are employment-intensive. Government grants and subsidies should be directly tied to the number of jobs created instead of being linked to capital expenditure.  If only new industry is included in the tax concessions for venture capital, existing industry may suffer from the capital outflow.  There is no doubt that the increase of 0.5 per cent in employers' PRSI is adding to an already crippling burden.  There is definitely a case for a decrease.  I know that other EEC countries have a higher PRSI rate but they do not have our inflation rate.</P>
    <P>The deserted wife is to receive an increase of £2.85 and a person on disability benefit is to get an increase of £2.45. That works out at 7 per cent.  With inflation running at 8 per cent as well as VAT on clothing, they really are doing well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> We must not forget that we got 19 per cent ourselves.</P>
    <P>At the end of last year £13 million of unspent money was returned by the Department of Health to the Exchequer. How many more sums of this magnitude are lying around?</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the new Ardkeen Hospital is included in the capital allocation for health.  It is one of nine such projects, six of them being in Dublin.  I wonder if the Minister and the Government realise that there is an area outside the Pale called the rest of Ireland.  It galls me that we in Waterford have to stand in line for capital funds with hospitals such as St. Vincent's in Dublin.  I worked in that hospital in 1971 when we moved from the old premises on St. Stephen's Green to Elm Park.  We in Waterford must now stand in line with this hospital for capital funds.  Waterford, like neighbouring Cork, has suffered more than most during this recession.  The building of the hospital at Ardkeen would give a vital boost to the building industry in that area and I plead with the Government to ensure that this project goes ahead.</P>
    <P>The abolition of student medical cards seems an incredible decision.  The Minister's projected saving of £2.5 million is fantasy.  Our student population are without doubt the healthiest sector and students will only rarely go to see a doctor. They have now been deprived of a medical card so they will go to the casualty department of a hospital where much more money will be spent on investigating them.  I assure the Minister that there will not be any saving through the removal of the medical card from students.</P>
    <P>There was a reduction this year of £3.5 million in the allocation for the South Eastern Health Board.  We have been asked to carry out various cuts to try to live within our budget.  Indications are that there will have to be a minimum of 150 job losses to achieve this, not to mention various other types of cuts.  All this is from a Labour Minister for Health while the Labour Party are reputed to be the conscience of the Coalition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn spoke about the five-day syndrome.  This may be a possibility in <Col N="1349" /> the west and it is also a possibility in the south east.  Among the measures being considered is the operation of certain hospital wards on a five-day basis. Patients will have to be told that they can only get sick between Monday and Friday.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we are extremely weak in marketing and research and development.  The Irish Export Board are to receive only £17 million, a grossly inadequate sum.  I presented this very forcibly to John Delaney, an Irish American whom I persuaded to come to Waterford some time ago.  Mr. Delaney and a group of Irish American business colleagues are venture capitalists who would finance marketing and research scholarships for young people. On-the-job training and vocational education raises the productivity of the worker and increases his earning potential. It helps him to adjust to the rapid structural changes now occurring.  The Government should provide better information on occupational requirements so that the skills essential to future growth can be nurtured.  This will lead to a better matching of supply and demand in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's proud boast is that the food subsidies were retained.  Food subsidies are for everyone, rich and poor. The bread, butter and milk for the Mirabeau Restaurant are subsidised to the same extent as those for the deserted wife and the widow.  There must be some other way of ensuring that the lower paid can get the benefits they deserve rather than the country as a whole.  I would be interested in getting views on that.</P>
    <P>This year is our last chance for a little pump priming and therefore some growth, because if the forecasters are correct 1985 is the year in which the US budget deficit will drive American interest rates even higher.  The total borrowing requirements for 1985 for the US are estimated to be nearly 600 billion dollars. The Federal reserve will also have to deal with the inflation which is due to rise about then and will have to become tight-fisted, leading to a reduction in growth.  They will have to tackle their deficit by rising taxes and reducing spending. <Col N="1350" /> The big danger is that they may lead us into another recession.  The rising tide raises all boats but the ebbing tide lowers them.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the economic comment made by Reynolds, Cooper, McCarron, Chartered Accountants. They say:</P>
    <P>The 1984 Budget was perhaps the least significant, in terms of changes actually made, for many years.  There have been no cuts in expenditure of any consequence, and the burden of taxation is set to rise once again . . . a tax allowance has been introduced for lower income payers of the income levy, a further complication to the system of direct taxation of incomes.  This now has five components &mdash;income tax ... PRSI ... health and related charges . . . youth employment levy . . . and the income levy ...  It would be difficult to devise a more complicated system, and it would appear that the Commission on Taxation has, despite the quality of its work, had no impact.</P>
    <P>When will we do something for the PAYE sector?  We paid lip service to them in the budget and told them that something would be done in the future. I plead that we do something for them now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Quinn, on his appointment as Minister for Labour.  I am satisfied from my knowledge of his ability that no better man could have taken the job.  I should like to go on record as wishing him well.  I was particularly impressed by his address which reflected many of the problems that are facing the trade union movement and workers generally.  He spoke about giving workers more information and having better consultation.  We know from experience that workers are not given full information and the latest example of this was with Fords of Cork where there was a clear case for the legislation the Minister spoke about.  I look forward to seeing that policy put into <Col N="1351" /> operation.  I am sure the trade union movement will welcome that.</P>
      <P>I was also impressed by his reference to the enterprise allowance scheme.  We have reached the age of the nixer.  This had developed as a result of unemployment and the level of social welfare payment which workers find it difficult to survive on.  It has forced many people who sign on for the dole to do nixers to supplement their benefit.  The enterprise allowance scheme is a very positive approach to combat that.  Workers do not like to spend their time signing on the dole and playing hide and seek with social welfare investigating officers.</P>
      <P>From my experience in my area I know the interest shown in this new scheme.  It may be the answer to the trade union call over many years to assist people, particularly those made redundant, to get back into productive employment.  What better way to do that than to be able to start up their own business and be financially assisted in an honest way by the State? As the nixer age has developed so also has the level of investigation.  I congratulate the Minister on this scheme.  I hope he can get the finance to develop this and assist young people who have ideas.  As a trade unionist with experience in this field I hope to be able to give him some ideas we have encountered in this area.</P>
      <P>I was also pleased that he referred to the equality legislation.  There is no doubt that while definite progress is being made in this field there is still substantial discrimination against female workers in the work place.  Many trade unionists pay lip, service to this aspect of female workers' working life.  The existing legislation has never been employed with the energy which should have been used by trade unionists.  In many cases discrimination exists with the support of male trade unionists across the industrial field.  I am glad the Minister has clearly indicated he will pursue this and will strengthen the legislation in relation to equality of opportunity and equality in the work place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference made by the Minister to disputes that occurred during the year gives a clear indication that the level of <Col N="1352" /> disputes has been the lowest for many years.  I am happy that this has happened. I have been involved in national negotiations since 1969 and I said last year that I was satisfied that, at least for a period of time, the national wage negotiation had outlived its usefulness.  Although I advocated that policy in the early years of the national wage agreements, as time went on I realised that it was not in the best interest of the trade union movement, of industry or of the services.  That thinking has proved to be correct because last year there was an agreement in the public service which to a large degree was based on the settlements that had been secured in the private industrial sector.  If that policy had continued for a few years it would have been to the benefit of industry, of the services and of the public service.  I say that in the belief that there should be an inter-relationship between the level of wage settlements in the public service and those in the private sector. One is interdependent on the other.  In their final form national agreements discriminated against both the productive and the non-productive sectors.  Therefore, I regard the present formula as being in the best interest of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I am happy to have the opportunity of following my colleague, the Minister for Labour, in this debate and I look forward to the contribution he will make during this time in the Department.  At this time last year I found myself in a position of total and utter disagreement with a number of aspects of, first, the budget, and secondly, the Social Welfare Act that was proposed subsequently.  I do not wish to rehash all that now.  We are a year further on and many things have happened in the meantime.  On this occasion I am satisfied that the Labour Ministers in Government have made a more positive contribution in the direction that you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and myself would consider to be Labour Party policy.  I appreciate fully that two parties in Government, each having a different philosophy, cannot travel the same road and that therefore there must be some compromise along the way.  I hope that the sort of progress we are witnessing in this year's budget will continue and that by the end of the <Col N="1353" /> term of office of this Government we will have secured at least those major policies the Labour Party stand for.  I trust that that achievement will come about while working in harmoney with our colleagues in Government.  In these circumstances I was in a position to vote for the budget thought it did contain quite a number of items which I disapproved of strongly. However, that is probably the position so far as the Ministers and backbenchers alike in Government are concerned.  It would be dishonest for any one of us to say that we agreed with everything contained in the budget but there has to be some kind of balance.  The budget must be considered by any Member in, first, the national context and then in the context of its effect on the people in one's own constituency and in one's own party.</P>
    <P>Since the footwear industry is one of the largest and most important industries in my constituency, I am glad that for the second year in succession there is no VAT being imposed on footwear. Regarding the imposition of a low level of VAT on clothing, with the exception of childrens clothes, I do not believe that the application of VAT in this way will succeed.  This was demonstrated on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; on Saturday last, though anyone who knows the industry would have known that anyway.  It is difficult to understand how the Minister could have put forward a proposal of this nature.  I cannot see working a system whereby certain aspects of clothing are VAT-rated while others are exempt from VAT.  Surely it would have been better if, as the lesser of two evils, there had been an application of VAT on an equal basis right across the entire industry.  The Minister's proposal will create major problems for manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers.  I appeal to him to consider amending the proposal at the appropriate time.  If it goes through in its present form it will cause major problems not only for the people I have mentioned but also for the Department and for the Revenue Commissioners.  But if the Minister decides not to amend the measure, I forecast that by this time next year it will have proved so unworkable as to have to be either withdrawn or altered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> Those of us who have had responsibility for workers in the clothing and textile industry in the past 20 years have been proven correct in the forecasts we have been making down through the years. The footwear industry, which was healthy and thriving and in which 7,000 people were employed, now employs fewer than 3,000 people.  Despite the fact of there not being VAT on footwear at any stage, 85 per cent of the total home market consist of imports.  The corresponding figure in respect of clothing is in excess of 50 per cent.  As a trade unionist I must ask myself what will be the advantage or otherwise that will accrue from the imposition of VAT on clothing.  The imposition of VAT on clothing at the point of entry, provided the rate is not increased substantially in future budgets, might result in a slight advantage to the home industry.  In saying that I am not extending an invitation to the Minister for Finance to increase this VAT, but the point has been made to me by a number of clothing manufacturers.  I should welcome the opinions of the clothing section of the CII on my suggestion.</P>
    <P>Whether we belong to a party who are in opposition or to the parties in Government, the biggest issue concerning each of us is the unemployment problem, a problem about which there is much talk though in respect of which I do not consider this budget to be making any major contribution.  There are some areas in which the budgetary measures will be of help in dealing with this problem.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to provide General Medical Services to those between the ages of 16 and 25 years who are dependants of persons who do not have full eligibility for these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am calling on the Government to <Col N="1355" /> restore medical services to those between the ages of 16 and 25 years from whom they have removed eligibility for such services.  I see the Minister for Health has tabled the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;endorses the Government decision to withdraw certain health services from persons aged between 16 and 25 years who are dependants of persons who do not have full eligibility for the services under Part IV of the Health Act, 1970.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Members should be clear when they come to vote that by voting for the Government's amendment they will be voting in favour of withdrawing health services from persons between the ages of 16 and 25.</P>
    <P>On 16 December the Minister published the Health Services Regulation No. 3, 1983.  Section 2 states:</P>
    <P>The services provides under Sections 58 (1), 59 (1), and 67 (1) of the Health Act, 1970, shall not extend to persons between the ages of 16 and 25 who are dependants of persons who do not have full eligibility for the services under part IV of the Health Act, 1970,. . .</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>These Regulations shall not apply to persons in receipt of an allowance under section 69 (1) of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>This means persons who are in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance. The regulations published by the Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>These regulations shall come into operation on the first day of January, 1984.</P>
    <P>Even when the regulations were published it should have been obvious they could not come into operation on 1 January 1984 because between 16 December and 1 January there were 15 days including the Christmas period and it would have been impossible for the <Col N="1356" /> health boards to notify the persons concerned and the family doctors that they were no longer eligible for services. While students are receiving these notices at the moment, a number of them have not yet had the services removed from them.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question in the Dáil on 18 January the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 January 1984 this situation was changed by Regulations to provide that students and other persons between the ages of 16 and 25 who are dependants of their parents and whose parents are not eligible for medical cards will not retain automatic entitlement to medical cards.  These persons will retain their eligibility for free hospital services. . .</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that the regulations do not apply to persons who are in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance or to persons who are entitled to services under EEC regulations.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we are concerned because we believe this decision will cause undue hardship for a large section of the population whose disposable income is already reduced, and much of it reduced as a result of the policies pursued by this Government in the past 14 months.  It is the duty of any Minister of Health and any Government to prevent stress in the community.  On this occasion the action of the Minister will create stress not alone for the students who find themselves without the right to free medical services but also for their parents, many of whom are struggling to maintain their children in second and third level education.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned because of the serious problems it will create for people between the ages of 16 and 25 years, particularly for students living away from home in flats in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Coleraine, Belfast and in other towns where regional colleges are situated. Thirdly, we are concerned because we believe this will put an extra charge on the health services to look after the needs of these people in hospital.  Many of them will end up in hospital when they become <Col N="1357" /> ill, whereas when they had the right to general medical services they would have been treated by their family doctor, thus avoiding very expensive treatment in hospital.</P>
    <P>In my constituency and elsewhere I see families who are maintaining children in third level education but none of them is in a position to pay out money at random. The vast majority are struggling to keep their children in second and third level education.  There may be a few millionaires who have no difficulty in paying but they are not the people to whom I am referring.  In respect of children in receipt of local authority grants, their parents have to subsidise the grants to maintain their children in &ldquo;digs&rdquo; or flats.  They will find it very difficult to meet the cost of health care.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that those students whose parents have medical cards will retain their right to general medical services but account must be taken of the guidelines with regard to the issue of medical cards.  I will give the House a few examples.  A man, with a wife and with two children under 16 years with a third child aged 21 years who is at university or a technical college, having a gross income of £126 per week will not get a medical card; but if the guidelines allowed the net income to be considered that man would have a medical card.  In the above case, a son or daughter who is a student will not have the benefit of a medical card.</P>
    <P>The most serious aspect is the effect it will have on students, particularly those living in flats away from home and this was recognised by Dr. O'Grady, the students' doctor at UCD.  He is quoted in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 3 December 1983.  Dr. Alan O'Grady, a student doctor in UCD, said he felt a dangerous situation could arise.  A youthful student up from the country living on his own in a flat gets ill and has little money.  He may not call a doctor and very serious problems could arise.  He also said that casualty departments in hospitals could be inundated by students with health problems if the free medical service was withdrawn.  He said: &ldquo;I don't personally think the Minister will be saving much money in any case.  It is <Col N="1358" /> our experience that only about 10 per cent of students use the service, but it is a crucial 10 per cent.&rdquo;  Those are not the words of a politician on this side of the House trying to score political points. Those are the words of the doctor with a great deal of experience looking after students in the largest centre of third level education.  He says very serious problems could arise.  We recognise those problems could arise.  For example, a student living in a flat who gets pneumonia and has not the money readily available for a doctor will suffer hardship.  A student who complains of headaches but has not got the money available to go to a doctor may develop meningitis and find himself with a very serious health problem.  This could be the direct result of a decision by this Government to withdraw a basic service from those between the ages of 16 and 25.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health lives in Dún Laoghaire, and the vast majority of students in that area probably live in family homes and so the Minister may not be aware of the problem of the very serious situation facing students from the country who are living in flats in this city or in any other large centre of third level education. There will be problems for those who may find themselves acutely ill. There are 120,000 students from whom the right to general medical services will be withdrawn.  It is estimated that in the case of one-third of these the parents are entitled to full eligibility, and that means that approximately 80,000 students will have that right, a right they enjoyed for over 10 years, but a right which will now be withdrawn from them.  We are very concerned about the serious consequences that will have not alone on the parents but also on those people of 16 to 25 years of age, and particularly those living in flats.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about saving money.  He believes he will save £2.5 million.  Basically those in that age group, 16 to 25 years, are the healthiest section of the community.  While the national average of visits to the doctor in the health service generally is six per annum the student rate is only two and, as Dr. O'Grady pointed out, only 10 per cent of <Col N="1359" /> students avail of the service.  It is important to recognise that not alone are these students losing their entitlement to the general medical services and the facility in regard to their family doctor but they are losing their entitlement to the medicines and drugs they may need.  They are also losing their entitlement to dental and ophthalmic services.  This could have very important consequences for students and for the parents who find themselves confronted with the cost of dental and ophthalmic services as well as of general medical services.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated on a number of occasions &mdash; indeed he stated it here again last week when speaking on the budget on 26 January &mdash; that, and I quote, &ldquo;The special position of students was an anomaly.&rdquo;  Perhaps that is his view.  One would not deny that there are anomalies in most of the services administered by the State.  What did he do?  He removed what he saw as one anomaly and put numerous anomalies back in its place.  The first one one would question is, at what age are you no longer a dependant of your parents?  Would it be realistic for the Minister to say that if someone of 50 years of age was at home on a farm with his parents he would be a dependant?  That would be realistic if he had no income of his own.  I believe the constitutionality of declaring someone over 21 years of age a dependant on his parents is something that might be worth looking at.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly would be a man with a wife and two children, one 16 years of age and one a student, a student who is married with a wife and a child.  He is soley dependent on his father and mother who have no medical card.  Is he entitled to a medical card?  Will he get a card if he applies for one?  Are his parents, who may be on a very low income &mdash; perhaps the man we referred to earlier with £126 &mdash; obliged to look after the medical needs of not alone their son but his wife and child as well, because he is a dependant of theirs and the regulation refers to a dependent?  Also in the regulation, persons on disabled maintenance allowance are excluded but <Col N="1360" /> other categories are not excluded, such as the person I mentioned who may be married but is still a dependant on his parents.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly, two children of 18 and 19 years of age, one at home in receipt of unemployment assistance and the other a student.  One will be eligible even though she will have a small income and she will have a right to the general medical services, but the student away from home will have no such rights even though she has no income whatsoever. Yet another anomaly created by the Government in removing this one anomaly, as they saw it.</P>
    <P>Take persons living in a flat.  Students from other EEC countries are automatically entitled to general medical services but the students from our own State have no such right.  What is the position of students in receipt of unemployment assistance in the summer or at Christmas, when they are not at university?  Will these be entitled to medical cards or not? Again, another anomaly created by the Minister because of this decision.</P>
    <P>Last week I asked the Minister if a person in receipt of a part-time income while being a student would be entitled to a medical card.  The answer I got was:</P>
    <P>Students who are dependants of persons who do not have full eligibility for health services no longer have automatic entitlement to medical cards. This obtains whether the students are in part-time employment or not.  In any individual case on eligibility for a medical card, due regard will be taken of all the relevant circumstances of that case.</P>
    <P>The regulations refer only to dependants. If people are in part-time employment and financing their own way through third level education, I cannot see how they can be considered dependants. When the regulation dealt with one specific exclusion, why did it not deal with that?</P>
    <P>In his statement of 16 December and in this House on 26 January when speaking on the budget, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It has also been provided that students <Col N="1361" /> will retain their eligibility for free hospital services, both in-patient and out-patient, including the services of hospital consultants.</P>
    <P>In other words, all students, irrespective of their parents' incomes' will have limited eligibility entitling them to free hospitalisation, free maintenance, free medical care, both as in-patients and as out-patients in hospital.  This creates a further anomaly.  A student whose parent might be a millionaire will have full comprehensive medical care in hospital or as an out-patient, while a student of a family with, say, two other children, even though that family's income might be only £125 per week, will have to pay the family doctor and also for the medicines.</P>
    <P>To provide full comprehensive hospital services while removing the right to general medical services is contrary to the present day philosophy on health care throughout the world and to the Minister's own commitment to strengthening community care services and transferring resources from hospital to community care.  I quote the Minister talking about an examination of the services in this House on last Wednesday.</P>
    <P>We will, in the current year, clearly have to give a great deal more thought to the appropriate mix of services between community and the hospital services.  Of their nature, the hospital services tend to be very expensive, and while it would be a mistake to consider that in all cases, an appropriate level of community care will necessarily be cheaper to provide.  It is obviously desirable that we try to ensure that only those who require the high level of expertise and the technological facilities available in our general hospitals are admitted to them for care.  This imposes on us the need critically to examine all the services we are providing within the community, in order to establish how effective these are, how they might be improved and how they can be altered to provide a more effective and efficient health service in general.</P>
    <P>He spoke about limiting admissions to <Col N="1362" /> hospital, operating day hospitals and providing five-day-week hospital care, all because he recognises the expense of keeping persons in hospital and having persons attend hospitals at present.  What does he then do?  He withdraws the medical card from students, people living alone in flats in Dublin who if they get ill, as everybody in this House knows, will not have money readily available to attend the family doctor and pay for medicines in the chemist shop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that the student will not have the money readily available in his pocket at the present time.  The Minister is encouraging those students who need medical care and attention to get up from their sick beds and go to the casualty department of a hospital &mdash; as he says himself, the most expensive location for the delivery of health care.  The Minister is encouraging those 80,000 students to do this, and a number of them will be admitted, possibly for social reasons because of living alone in a flat with nobody to look after them whereas, if their family doctor was calling to them in their flat on a daily basis they would be able to be maintained outside hospital.  The Minister, recognising that problem and the need to transfer resources from hospital care to community care, makes a decision which is the exact reverse of what one would expect any Government to make at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to Deputy Fitzgerald's interruption, but I would say that any Government, sensible or not, would know the basic fact that it is much more expensive to have people treated in hospital than to have them treated outside.  I am surprised that the Minister made that decision and that the Government were a party to that decision. If they felt it necessary to make any change, it should have been in hospital care and certainly not in the general medical services care.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that in the event of hardship arising the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board will be empowered to make available the required services without charge.  In theory that sounds well, and I have no doubt that there will be cases of students whose parents do not have medical cards and who are suffering from some chronic illness which would create hardship who will be able to apply to the chief executive officer who will allocate a medical card. However, what about the students who become suddenly ill in their flats in the city of Dublin, or Galway, or Cork, or Athlone?  How long will it take them to get the chief executive officer of the health board to provide a medical card? It is unreasonable to fool ourselves into thinking that somebody who has become acutely ill and is without the money will merely have to lift the telephone and call the chief executive officer and will have eligibility of services right away.  It does not happen like that.  We are all aware, from our own experience, that it takes a minimum of three weeks to get a general medical services card and in many cases a lot longer.  To suggest that there will be no hardship is absolute nonsense.</P>
      <P>In the joint Fine Gael/Labour Programme for Government under the section of health it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking ahead beyond the immediate situation a comprehensive review of all aspects of Health Services will be carried out as a matter of urgency with the <Col N="1364" /> objective of ensuring that everyone within the community has adequate medical protection and access to services.  A guiding principle of this review will be the extension and development, on a phased basis, of Community Based services to encourage a real switch from institutional to Community Care.</P>
    <P>That is exactly the reverse of what the Government have done in this case, because certainly they are not ensuring that everyone in the community will have adequate medical protection and access to service.  In fact it is directly the opposite to their commitment.  Listen to it again:</P>
    <P>. . . community-based services to encourage a real switch from institutional to Community Care.</P>
    <P>Here they are encouraging people to institutional care away from community services.</P>
    <P>I have received a number of letters on this subject, including one from somebody in University College Cork in which it is stated:</P>
    <P>This further cheeseparing exercise of the Coalition has already cost one of our members over £300.  It is causing particular hardship for those students living away from home.</P>
    <P>I have another letter which questions the administration of assessing students during the Christmas and summer recesses, students who will be applying for medical cards, who will then have them withdrawn, and all of the administration involved.  I might quote the last paragraph, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Everyone is entitled to free hospital care.  With the eradication of the student health card scheme, it is obvious that more and more hospital beds will be taken up by students with ailments which could otherwise have been forestalled by early medical treatment.  In the long run this could cost the Government far more than £2 million a year.</P>
    <P>That is a letter from a students' body in this country.  They recognise what the Government fail to recognise but what <Col N="1365" /> Dr. O'Grady &mdash; and he could be considered to be very independent in all of this &mdash; recognises; indeed what we on this side of the House recognise.  I do not accept the statement of the Minister that he will save £2.5 million.  I say that because students and those in the age group 16 to 25 are very low users of a health service, they are the healthiest section of the population and it is only when they are forced to do so that they will use the service.  It is inevitable that parents and students will suffer.  Even if there is hardship it is just not possible to provide an immediate medical service under the existing health boards arrangement. It is not possible to provide that sort of service sufficiently rapidly for those students who find themselves acutely ill when they are away from home attending third level establishments.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reverse his decision.  Indeed I am glad to say that as recently as 29 November 1983, when I asked a supplementary question of the Minister as follows, at column 407 of the Official Report of that date:</P>
    <P>Would the Minister accept that those over 75 years of age are high risk patients, irrespective of income, and should be subject to the same guidelines as apply for those in the younger age groups?  Would he not consider that a case could be made at least for raising those guidelines to include the over 75s?</P>
    <P>The Minister replied as follows:</P>
    <P>I would not accept that on the grounds of utilisation of scarce health resources ...</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that some time between then and Wednesday last wisdom descended on the Minister and the Government, because it was announced in the budget that they were changing those guidelines.  The Minister himself said in the House that he had arranged accordingly with the health boards that a special age allowance be built into the medical card guidelines.  I compliment the Minister, when he saw that he was not right &mdash; and it is important to remember that he did withdraw medical cards <Col N="1366" /> from the aged this time last year when he first came into office &mdash; on having the courage to reverse a decision he recognised as being wrong.  I would ask him now to do the same on the question of medical cards for those between the ages of 16 and 25.</P>
    <P>In this evening's <i>Evening Herald</i> I see that the Taoiseach was in Trinity College today to address a breakfast meeting of final year business students on the Irish economy.  The Students' Union vice-president, Karen O'Connor and Entertainments Officer, Paddy Goodwin &mdash; from our constituency, a Ceann Comhairle &mdash; met the Taoiseach.  It is reported in that paper and I am quoting:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach today promised student representatives at Trinity College that he would consider their reservations about the plan to withdraw medical cards.</P>
    <P>It is said, later on in the same article:</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald had promised he would pursue their claims and invited them to make a written submission to the Cabinet. . . .</P>
    <P>I welcome that decision of the Taoiseach. I believe the Government will recognise that they made a mistake on this occasion and that they will reverse that decision.</P>
    <P>I am not going to talk about the Government's social policy and the serious problems it is creating for the whole of our community, not alone with regard to health but with regard to social welfare. For instance, there is the 7 per cent increase in social welfare benefits for six months of the year which represents 3½ per cent for a whole year.  That is an indication of their social policy.  Then there is the cutback of 4 per cent to the health boards, which will probably cost up to 1,500 jobs.  Those are just examples of the Government's commitment to the poorer sections of our community.  Then there was the family income supplement, promised in the budget this time last year, repromised at the famous Barretstown Castle meeting of July, that it would be here in December of last year, while we were told on Wednesday last, that it will not now be here in February, March or <Col N="1367" /> April but rather we were promised it for November next.  They are indications of the social policy of this Government. Therefore it is not surprising they made the decision they did.  I would ask them to do what they did when they recognised that they were wrong on the question of the aged in our community, and reverse this decision.</P>
    <P>I want to read out again the Government's amendment:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann endorses the Government decision to withdraw certain health services from persons aged between 16 and 25 years who are dependants of persons who do not have full eligibility for the services under Part IV of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>That calls on every Member of Dáil Éireann, Fine Gael and Labour, and on us &mdash; but we will not accept it &mdash; to proceed into the lobbies tomorrow evening to vote to withdraw these medical cards from students.  That is what that amendment is seeking.  We on this side of the House will be voting against that amendment.  Rather we will be voting for our own motion to restore medical cards to those between the ages of 16 and 25 years.  We would ask the people on the Government side of the House &mdash; those in the Fine Gael and Labour Party who believe this was a wrong decision &mdash; on this occasion to come into the lobby along with us.  It will not pull down the Government, if they are defeated on it, but it will bring home to the Government that this was a wrong decision and that the majority of Members of Dáil Éireann expect and want the Government to reverse that decision in the interests of those between the ages of 16 and 25 and of their parents who are hard pressed throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might assist the House in considering the motion before it if I begin by outlining the general principles governing entitlement to general medical services in this country and put them into their historical context.  Very broadly, a person who is eligible for these services without charge is required to show that his financial circumstances are such that if he were to provide these services from his own resources, this could cause hardship.</P>
      <P>Since about 1850 the State has accepted a responsibility for ensuring that no one is denied access to medical care because of inability to pay for it.  The establishment of the dispensary service, which was an enlightened move in its time, ensured that the poor would receive the medical care they needed without payment.  On the other hand, it was designed in such a way that persons who could afford to pay the doctor were excluded from its scope.</P>
      <P>Just how suited this approach to medical relief was to Irish circumstances is confirmed by the tenacity with which it survived to modern times.  When the legal code of the poor law and the medical relief system was replaced by the Public Assistance Act of 1939, the criteria for deciding eligibility for medical services remained unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the forties there were demands for a health service free of direct charge to the whole population, including a general practitioner service.  In the 1947 and 1953 Health Acts, the Governments of the day responded by providing free hospital <Col N="1369" /> care for persons suffering from infectious diseases and by extending general hospital services to the middle income group.</P>
    <P>But the 1953 Act made no change in eligibility for dispensary medical services, because the Government accepted that paying for general practitioner care would cause no hardship for the middle and upper income groups. The Act provided a safety net for persons whose doctor or drugs bill was beyond their capacity to pay by permitting health authorities to assist them with the costs.</P>
    <P>In 1972 the dispensary system was replaced by the present choice-of-doctor scheme.  The new scheme differs from the dispensary system in that it provides a general practitioner service without charge for the poorer sections of the population on the same basis as persons who can afford to engage their doctor privately and pay their private fees.  This was a radical change from the system which it replaced.  Nevertheless, it retained the two principles which had been part of the system since its beginning:</P>
    <P>&mdash;that nobody should be denied the general practitioner service because of financial problems, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;that public funds should not be spent in providing the service without charge for persons who could afford to pay for it from their own resources.</P>
    <P>The second of these two principles has attracted considerable attention and comment in recent years.  People are beginning to realise that, in some circumstances, money which is spent on the provision of a State service, even though that service is good and useful in itself, may result in resources, to which the poorer sections of society contribute their due share, being used largely for the benefit of their better off countrymen.</P>
    <P>In the last few years it became evident that access to the free general practitioner service was being given to persons for whom there would be no hardship in meeting the cost of the service from the resources which were available to them.  Many students, particularly those attending third level colleges, <Col N="1370" /> belong to families to whom the cost of paying the family doctor is of little consequence. Yet, these students were being given automatic entitlement to medical cards and to a free family doctor service. The criteria of hardship and need were not being applied to this group in the way that they were applied to the rest of the population.</P>

      <P>Scarce State resources, on which there were increasing demands, were being used to satisfy needs which applicants were quite capable of meeting themselves.</P>
      <P>It became clear to many that the automatic granting of medical cards to students was unfair because students were not being judged by the same standards as other persons applying for medical cards and because many students came from privileged homes where meeting the cost of general practitioner charges imposed no strain on family finances.  In addition many third level colleges provide medical advice for students without charge, largely at the taxpayer's expense.</P>
      <P>On assuming office at the end of 1982, the Minister inherited a position in which the anomalous treatment of the student population in regard to their entitlement to medical cards was already being questioned. A considerable volume of representations were being made pointing to the inequity involved in providing free services for persons, some of whom could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as being at risk of hardship if the service were not available without charge.  Some of these representations came from persons whose own children held medical cards and who could not understand why public money should be spent on doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of reasons, including the limited resources available for health services and the consequent need for a more critical approach to all items of expenditure, the Minister felt that this anomaly justified further investigation. However, in order to allow time to have the implications of any policy change to <Col N="1371" /> be fully considered, it was decided to defer action, pending a thorough analysis of all the factors involved.  This analysis was undertaken, and it was only when its results became known that the Government decided on their present policy in the matter.  Some of the facts which came to light in the course of this analysis, and which influenced the decision taken by the Government, are of interest.  The first point is that of the 120,000 students holding medical cards in 1983, it is estimated that less than 30 per cent belonged to families in the lower income group.  The majority of students who held medical cards belonged to families in the middle and upper income groups.  With public policy coming under increasing criticism for failing to take sufficient account of the distributional effects of social services, it was clear that some action had to be taken to remedy this situation.  As a society, it must be one of our primary concerns to distribute resources in favour of the less well off sections of the community. Any movement in the opposite direction must be carefully examined to see whether it is justified on humanitarian grounds.  Having identified the anomalous position of students, the Government would have been guilty of seriously neglecting their responsibilities had they not acted to remedy this situation.</P>
    <P>The second fact which emerged from the analysis is that the student population, as a group, represents a young and predominantly healthy section of the population.  This assertion is borne out by the patterns of usage of the general medical services by different age groups in the population.  It has been established that the average usage by young persons over 16 years of age of these services is significantly lower than that of the medical card population as a whole.  As an illustration, the number of visits per person to a doctor by persons in the age group to which most of these students belong is less than 2.5 per year.  On the other hand the average number of visits per person for the entire medical card population is more than six per year.  This demonstrates the relatively low demand from the student population for general <Col N="1372" /> medical services and must lead to the conclusion that opposition to the changes introduced is based on an exaggeration of any possible hardship involved.</P>
    <P>If we were in a situation in which money was freely available to meet the many stated needs of our people, there would be no problem.  Even in the relatively more affluent times which we passed through during the seventies the students' automatic access to the general medical service might have been accepted.</P>
    <P>I do not need to remind the House, however, of the tight budgetary situation within which the Government must currently frame their policies.  The resources available for public spending are strictly limited.  We must face up to this and realise that all demands for public services cannot possibly be met.  We must therefore establish priorities and resign ourselves to meeting those needs which are regarded as most urgent, leaving lower priority needs to be fulfilled at some later stage.  In this context it is essential that we are clear about the objectives of public spending on social services.  We must, at all costs, try to protect the level of services afforded to those sections of the community which are materially least advantaged and we must realise that, in so doing, it will not always be possible to preserve the <i>status quo</i> in relation to the more advantaged sections of the community.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the budget for 1984 the Government had considerably less money available to them than was required to meet the legitimate demands on their resources from all areas.  When in addition, account was taken of the likely impact of inflation during 1984, it became obvious that, in order to keep expenditure within the general Estimate provision, some economies would have to be made.  The health services, as well as other areas of public expenditure, would have to make their contribution to these economies.  The Minister was therefore faced with the difficult problem of identifying the potential for savings throughout the health services and deciding on the areas in which cutbacks could be made without imposing undue hardship <Col N="1373" /> on any section of the community or without damaging any of the essential services.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the imposition of cutbacks on health spending did not begin in 1984.  Of necessity, the search for economies in this sector has been an on-going process over recent years, and a number of initiatives aimed at cost containment have been, or are being, implemented. Naturally, the initial thrust of these efforts has concentrated on the elimination of any inefficiencies in the system, and worthwhile savings can be achieved in this manner, up to a point. However, it is also necessary to examine the effectiveness of public spending on health services, and this implies a review of the quantity and quality of services provided, as well as the extent to which services are provided free of charge.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the withdrawal of these services from some 85,000 students will save in the region of £2½ million in a full year at 1984 costs.  While this sum might appear small in contrast to the overall health budget, nevertheless this and other savings are necessary to ensure that other and more essential health services are not reduced or withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Other options to achieve savings were, of course, open to the Government.  For example, the adjustments to the medical card guidelines might have been less generous. This would, however, have involved a risk of depriving some people of their free access to the general medical service, people who could ill afford to lose their entitlement.</P>
    <P>There were other possibilities for savings, but the implications of these were much more serious.  Charges might have been introduced for visits to general practitioners in the general medical service, or charges could have been placed on prescribed drugs.  A move in this direction would have both produced income and made savings by discouraging the use of the service.  Consideration might have been given to the possibility of making cuts in payments to doctors and chemists taking part in the general medical service. The list of items which are excluded from reimbursement under the scheme might have been extended.  Moves such as these <Col N="1374" /> would have had a major impact on the nature and quality of the service.  They would have posed major administrative problems and would have seriously affected the services available to persons least able to afford them.</P>
    <P>The implication of the motion now before the House is that the savings which will be yielded by the Government's decision to withdraw eligibility for certain services from students could be compensated for by cut-backs in some other areas.  Having examined the options, the Government are satisfied that their decision is the right one, on the grounds of equity and commonsense.  The policy for the future will be that, in assessing the eligibility for a medical card of any student who is a dependant of his parents, account will be taken of the financial circumstances of the family.  Eligibility will no longer be regarded as automatic. Students will get medical cards if financial circumstances and inability to pay for general practitioner services justify this. This does not single out students for harsh or unfair treatment.  Rather it puts them on the same footing as all other members of our society for whom financial circumstances and inability to pay for the service without hardship are the criteria which determine eligibility.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to remove the anomaly of a group of persons having automatic entitlement to free general practitioner services without reference to financial circumstances was implemented by regulations made by the Minister for Health.  The general effect of these regulations was that students and other persons aged between 16 and 25 years who are dependent on their parents will retain their medical cards only if their parents have medical card eligibility.</P>
    <P>Many of the students in this age group are dependent on parents who are covered by medical cards.  There may be 30,000 to 35,000 such students.  These students are not affected by the regulations. They do not lose any of their entitlement to health services.  They remain eligible for medical cards while their present circumstances continue.</P>
    <P>I should stress that, as well as applying to only some of the students in this age <Col N="1375" /> group, the regulations apply to only some of the health services for which these students have been eligible.  The services which have been withdrawn are the free general practitioner service and free drugs, together with the ophthalmic and aural services.  No other services are affected by the provisions of the regulations. This is an aspect of the matter which may be lost to sight, and I would like it to be borne in mind in any objective assessment of what is now being done.</P>
    <P>One major service which is not involved in the new arrangements is the hospital service.  Students will retain their entitlement to free hospital services.  This includes hospital in-patient services and hospital out-patient services without charge.  It also includes entitlement to free hospital consultant services.  This is a special concession for students.  They are entitled to free hospital consultant services without reference to their parents' income.  Persons with incomes in excess of £11,000 a year, together with their dependants, are normally not eligible for free hospital consultant services. However, students from these upper income group families, whose medical cards are cancelled under the new arrangements, will retain their entitlement to free hospital consultant services. In terms of expenditure on health services, the hospital service is the area where most of the large bills for health care can arise.  Students are fully protected against the risk of such bills.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that some students, in order to avoid paying a fee to their family doctor, would choose instead to go to hospital, thereby placing an extra burden on the hospital service.  I doubt if this will happen, because there would be no great advantage in it for the students and this will be apparent to them.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed that the withdrawal of students' medical cards might give rise to hardship.  This concern was appreciated and the matter was very carefully considered before any action was taken.  In framing the regulations, the Minister set out to ensure, beyond all doubt, that no hardship could arise in any case.  In order to achieve this, the regulations <Col N="1376" /> contain special provision to guard against the danger of hardship.  If in the case of any student whose medical card is withdrawn it is clear that the provision of a required service would cause hardship, the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board is empowered to make that service available without charge.  Persons who are in receipt of disabled persons' maintenance allowance are also specifically excluded from the terms of the regulations.</P>
    <P>These provisions are supported by a number of other factors which I have already mentioned and which also have a bearing on the issue of hardship. The first of these is that students who are at the greatest risk of having financial problems in meeting the cost of general practitioner services are not affected by the arrangements now being made. These are students from the lower income group whose parents are eligible for medical cards.  Their medical cards are not being withdrawn and they retain full eligibility for all health services.  They form a sizeable part of the total population of these students.  Their number is probably in the region of 30,000 to 35,000.</P>
    <P>A second factor is that students whose medical cards are being withdrawn lose only some of the services to which they have been entitled.  In particular, they do not lose any part of their eligibility for hospital services.  This is potentially the most costly part of health care and the one in which serious financial problems can arise.  By comparison, general practitioner fees are not of major consequence and students, as well as the rest of the population, are protected against excessive drug cost by the long-term illness scheme and the refund of drugs scheme.</P>
    <P>These various safeguards provide a comprehensive insurance that no serious hardship will arise as a result of the adjustment to eligibility which is now being made.  If any individual case of hardship does arise the chief executive officer of the relevant health board will deal with the matter as soon as it is brought to his notice.  If, despite the safeguards <Col N="1377" /> which have been built into the system, the problem of hardship presents itself in a more general way, the Minister will be prepared to take whatever action is necessary to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>There is one other category of persons to whom I would like to refer, that is, students from other countries who are pursuing courses in Irish colleges.  Some doubt has been expressed as to whether these students get, or are entitled to get, services on more favourable terms than their Irish colleagues.  The position is that students from non-EEC countries do not have automatic entitlement to medical cards and would not normally be eligible for them.  However, the hardship provisions would apply and any such student who was unable to provide a service which he required without genuine hardship could have that service made available to him without charge.</P>
    <P>Students from other EEC countries, including the United Kingdom, on the other hand, receive their entitlement to health services from EEC legislation. The provision of health services for these students remains the responsibility of their home country.  The Irish health authorities act as agents for these countries in providing health services for the students while they are resident in Ireland.  They receive the full range of Irish health services but at the expense of their home country.  There are no Irish public funds involved.  Costs are reimbursed by way of special reciprocal agreements between the countries of the Community.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are now being made to put the new provisions into effect in a uniform way throughout the country. Accordingly, meetings have been held between officials of the Department of Health and representatives of the health boards in order to draw up standard procedures to implement the new arrangements. Steps are now being taken by the health boards to write to all students informing them of these arrangements. There will be a form enclosed with every letter that is issued.  This is a standard form of application to retain the medical card.  The purpose of the form is to enable students to whom the regulations do not <Col N="1378" /> apply to retain their medical cards.  If any student wishes to retain a medical card on valid grounds, then that student should complete the application form and sent it back to the health board.</P>
    <P>Of necessity, these arrangements will take some time to complete.  Students will be given time in which to re-apply for medical cards.  Decisions will have to be made on these applications.  Doctors will have to be informed of any changes being made.  As of now, no student has yet had his medical card withdrawn because of these new arrangements.</P>
    <P>If I may summarise, the most important point is that the principle on which the general medical services is based, that nobody should be denied access to the general practitioner service because of inability to pay for that service, is being preserved.  Every person in the State has access to the family doctor service when it is needed.  Any person who is unable to pay for this service for himself and his dependants, without incurring hardship, is entitled to avail of the service as made available by the State.  There can be no argument about upholding this principle. It is not in question now and any changes which are now being made have built-in safeguards to ensure that it is preserved.</P>

      <P>Where disagreement can arise, and has arisen, is on the question of equity in the State's financing of public services.

If we accept this principle, then we could not argue against the changes now being made under which the financial circumstances of their parents will be taken into account in assessing the eligibility of students for medical cards.</P>

      <P>If we accept, as we must, that there is a strict limit to the amount of money that can be made available for public services, then it follows that priorities must be established between programmes and services and choices made which favour those with relatively higher priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it is easier to designate, and act on, priorities when a choice has to be made between proposed new services.  It <Col N="1380" /> is much more difficult to curtail or discontinue an existing service, one to which the recipients have become accustomed and have accepted as their right.  This has happened in the case of the students.  If we were now starting from the position that students did not have automatic entitlement to medical cards, and if we were dealing with a proposal that this should be given to them, the arguments against doing this would be more acceptable. Such a proposal would attract very little support and the chances of its being successful would be very slim.  We are, however, starting from the position that students have enjoyed this concession for some time and its automatic nature is now being discontinued.  It is natural that there should be some sympathy for the students who are losing something which they had come to accept without question.</P>
    <P>This, however is an emotional response and does not have any regard to the merits and demerits of the position as it obtains and of the reasons why changes are now considered necessary.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with this in the context of the various cut-backs which have been imposed on young people since this Government came into power.

This country is anti-youth and anti-anything which will help the progress of young people.

      <P>The Minister of State told us how infrequently young people use the medical card and that argument proves our case.  The precise statistic is 1.1 for the number of times a student would visit a doctor in a year, while 6.4 visits is the average for an adult holder of a medical card.  The very argument which the Minister used is the one we would use in support of our case for the retention of medical cards for young people.  If they will not be used very often, why take them away?  The doctor in charge of medical services at UCD has said that the 10 per cent of students who use medical cards are those who will experience hardship. In Dublin the only student who will be refused a medical card is the Irish student from the 26 Counties.  Is there not something ridiculous about a situation wherein a boy or girl from Germany, Northern Ireland or any EEC country can come here and avail of full medical facilities while the Irish girl or boy is not allowed the use of a medical card?</P>

      <P>I will now deal with some of the social repercussions.  We all know that there has been a massive assault on the problem of drug taking and I applaud the Government on their initiative on setting up a sub-committee of Ministers and experts to consider this problem.  I read recently of the importance <Col N="1384" /> of young people developing a rapport with a medical practitioner in whom they can confide any worries or leanings towards a dependency on drugs or alcohol. That facility whereby young persons can visit a doctor of their choice will now be taken from them.  I do not know the ages of the Minister's children.  For a parent living down the country whose son or daughter is a student in Dublin, Galway, Athlone, or wherever, there is a feeling of security when they know their child can visit a doctor if he or she feels ill.  Very often these young people are living in digs or flats without any parental guidance.  When the Minister spoke about parents to whom the calling of a doctor was of no consequence he showed he had no conception of what it means to send a boy or girl to third level education. I cannot understand how the Minister could accept the pap he was fed in his speech or that he could deliver it without it sticking in his gullet.  Any parent who has children going to third level education knows that it is a struggle all the way. It is a struggle to get points, to gain entry and pay fees which are rising dramatically every month.  They must be kept and must have pocket money.</P>

      <P>I never heckled the Minister while I listened to his boring speech and the least he might do is give me an opportunity to have my speech heard.  The Minister showed that he was out of touch with young people when he said that to send young people to college was a matter of no consequence.  There are commitments all the way.  Whether a student has a county council scholarship, which has not been increased for some years, or a VEC scholarship at a maximum of £1,000 plus fees, it goes nowhere near their upkeep in a third level institution. Add to that the other charges which parents have to bear and we see that their disposable income is really reduced.  We have increased ESB charges, local authority charges and higher rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an attempt by the Government to put something over on what they think <Col N="1385" /> will be a docile audience because many of them do not have votes or are registered in a constituency outside of the one in which their college is located.  Leaving aside the question of votes how can the Minister say this will not impose any hardship?</P>

It was a Labour Party motion which brought down the Government in November 1982.  It was a motion condemning the health cuts imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I went to the Library today and took out the Dáil reports for those two days.  They make such interesting reading.  The serried ranks of Fine Gael and Labour amid several interruptions &mdash; far more than the gentle little nice help-ons I got here &mdash; screamed and roared at the Government that they could not allow the country to be dragged down the path of these dreadful health cuts imposed by the dreadful Minister, Deputy Woods.</P>

      <P>While he was there he met the students' group.  In a very correct fashion they told him that the withdrawal of the medical card would affect them as young people.  The Taoiseach promised them that he would go back to the Government and ask them to look again at the issue.  If the students would deliver a written brief to him he would bring it to the Cabinet table.  I hope the student representative group will do so immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government, who desperately wish to have the ear of the young people, have certainly got their ear right now. The voice of the young people is saying: leave the medical card with young people.  They do not use them unnecessarily. No young person runs to a doctor at the drop of a hat.  They are more interested in going to their lectures, attending games and so on.  When they need to use it they need it badly and it should be left to them.  The Minister said that many third level colleges had resident doctors or medical aid which students could have recourse to and that this was supplied at the taxpayers' expense. I come from a town where there is a regional technical college catering for 1,000 students.  They have no medical aid of any kind.  I have been assured by the student bodies in various schools of technology in Dublin that they do not have a medical representative in their colleges. What they depend on is the help and <Col N="1387" /> goodwill of some member of a faculty and a good first aid box.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister with responsibility for Women's Affairs has come into the House because the worry of this is borne by the mothers of rural students. Every possible support should be given to students but the Government, who in recent days have shown their strong anti-youth bias, will withdraw medical cards from young people aged between 16 and 24 years.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for granting me permission to raise on the Adjournment this very important matter.  I wish also to record my gratitude to the Minister for Justice for the sympathetic ear he extended to me this afternoon when I discussed with him details of this travesty of justice.</P>
      <P>In its wisdom the House has arranged that in matters connected with the law and justice there is a final court of appeal &mdash; the Minister for Justice.  From my knowledge of the administration of laws in the courts, I would have greater confidence in the reasonableness and in the sense of justice of any politician or of any Minister than I would have in some of those ladies and gentlemen with whom rests the responsibility of pronouncing sentences.</P>
      <P>Before revealing the details of the case in question I would express the hope that in trying to get through to the heart of the Minister, I would not do anything that might prejudice my case, though on my own account, I could not care less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> In a court case in 1980 a citizen of this country was found guilty of the charge of which he was accused and in the opinion of the learned District Court judge the penalty considered appropriate was a £10 fine.  There were two people involved in the offence and the co-accused was given the benefit of the Probation Act.  On the advice of his legal representatives, the gentleman on whose behalf I speak decided to take his case to the Circuit Court with a view to having the penalty of £10 removed and thereby be enabled to return to his place of employment. Naturally, my friend who had never been before the court up to the time of this case and who like many of our people live in awe and misunderstanding of our courts and of what are known as law and justice took the advice given to him.  Subsequently, he found himself before another court.  Unfortunately in the Circuit Court in the matter of appeals that one ear of sanity and reasonableness, a jury, is not allowed.  Therefore, my friend found himself before one learned Circuit Court judge.  I do not understand why I should be precluded from attacking that gentleman, but in deference to the permission granted me in the matter of raising this question, I will abide by the conditions laid down.  However, there will be other opportunities.  Indeed, during the Second Reading of the Criminal Justice Bill I referred to this case but without identifying it.</P>
    <P>The situation is that my friend who was never before in any kind of trouble and who would admit that he was guilty of the misdemeanour which led him to court in the first place found himself before one who is presumed to be a more sympathetic and more learned judge.  In respect of a charge of having co-operated in the stealing of eight pounds of butter valued at £6, this learned judge, on his interpretation of the law and indeed the wishes of legislators, decided that the man was guilty of an offence which warranted his being confined in Mountjoy Prison for 12 months.  That must be the greatest contribution that can be made towards the subversion of law and justice.  It is much greater than are other examples which are often put before us.  How can we <Col N="1389" /> expect the man in question, his family, his neighbours or anyone who is familiar with the case to have the confidence and respect that we would all like them to have in our law-and-order process? Despite all the expertise, the sensitivity, the knowledge, the psychology and so on with which the judge is supposed to be endowed, he considered a sentence of this magnitude to be warranted.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to bring other matters into the debate, but all of us here know that there are walking the streets of Dublin and of every town in the country people who are guilty of the most serious offences but who for one reason or another are not in prison.  Sometimes we are told that there is no room for them in the prisons.  Apart from other considerations the Circuit Court judge in the case in question ordered that the man be taken immediately to Mountjoy.  That order was complied with and my friend served three weeks in prison.  His legal advisers told him then that there was another case due to be heard before the High Court, the case which involved two unfortunate members of the Garda who were said to have suffered at the hands of a judge &mdash; I do not know if it was the same judge &mdash; and that he, too, should appeal.  Pending the appeal my friend was released from custody.  Since the appeal was heard in early 1981 that man has had reminders from the Garda about the warrant that was issued for his arrest.  He has had visits from the Garda to his house, with the result that he had become almost a nervous wreck, as had his wife also.  Their children were mindful of the unease in the house though the parents tried to keep the details from them.  This man was so distraught that he came to me before Christmas last and asked that I make representations to have him taken to Mountjoy if that was necessary to have removed from him the sentence that was hanging over him, which prevented him going about his normal daily work and from carrying out his duties as a husband and father.  It was his extraordinary request that prompted me to raise the matter on the Second Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill.  If that man were a hardened criminal he would not have been so <Col N="1390" /> sensitive to any of these considerations, but this was the first occasion on which he had found himself at the mercy of our legal system and of those who are charged with dispensing justice in a way that would appeal to a normal individual.</P>
    <P>On Friday morning last while helping to prepare his children for school, the man was visited by five members of the Garda.  They surrounded his house.  This number of gardaí was as many as had tried to locate three men in another part of the country who were believed to have committed murder.  The same number surrounded this man's house even though he had already intimated to me, and I had conveyed his wishes to the Garda, that he was anxious to get this matter off his mind and out of the way.  Notwithstanding understandable appeals from his wife that he should not be removed from the house in front of his family, the gardaí, in deference to the duties imposed on them, snatched that man from his wife and children and he is now in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>In all my time I have never come across such a miscarriage of justice and I appeal to the Minister, through his Minister of State, to release the man in question forthwith.  This man has already served three weeks and, as far as I am concerned, that is more than adequate for someone who has been a partner to the stealing of £6 worth of goods.  His contribution was £3 and he has served a week for every £1.  To my mind that is more than adequate.  If someone is advised by his or her legal adviser to take a case to the Circuit Court that must not be interpreted as putting that person in danger. From inquiries I have made I understand it is well known that if a case is brought to the Circuit Court instead of those learned ladies or gentlemen being happy to be in a position to adjudicate on such cases there is a resentment about it.  They are endeavouring to establish the situation where it will become known that a person who comes before them does so under the peril of having his sentence increased.  That happened in this case from a fine of £10 to 12 months in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution talks about respect <Col N="1391" /> for family life.  Where is it in the mind or heart of that Circuit Court judge?  A colleague of that gentleman recently released a foreigner who was carrying with him heroin to the value of £74,000. In the opinion of the judge that man was released because he had a wife and children to whom he could go, even though they were in another country.  Here an Irishman who was charged with stealing goods to the value of £3, who has a wife and three children, gets no consideration whatever.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prejudice my case here.  My sole reason for raising the matter on the Adjournment was to address myself as convincingly as possible to the Minister so that he would exercise his right, and indeed his obligation, to have justice done in circumstances where it is obvious there has been an interpretation of law and justice that appears alien and unacceptable to any normal man.  I ask the Minister to do that for the sake of the man, his wife and family.  Secondly, I ask him to do it to ensure that this House and the great houses that accommodate the gowned men and the men with the wigs do not make a laughing stock of the law. In my opinion the gentleman who gave that sentence is not fit to adjudicate on the troubles of people and is not fit to interpret what goes through our House. I see from the Leas Cheann-Comhairle a sign that I might be accused of making an attack on the man in question, but we cannot ignore what has happened.</P>
    <P>Apart from the man and family who have suffered, we must realise we have reached a stage where we will have to apply ourselves to eradicating from that rotten system the opportunity it gives to people to misinterpret their responsibilities and duties to the point where an innocent person has been incarcerated in Mountjoy.  We have in Ireland &mdash; and I am a party to them &mdash; various organisations and groups who concern themselves with human rights, human rights that affect people in South Africa, Ecuador, in Russia, people from whom freedom has been taken.  I make no apologies for being rather parochial in my approach. My first concern is for my immediate <Col N="1392" /> neighbour and for Irish people.  If this happened in another country we would have people in Ireland lobbying about it, who would be concerned that such an injustice had been inflicted on any human being.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State is replying I hope she will not reply from an institutional brief that will attempt to protect what in the past was deserving of protection. I hope she will not speak from a brief that will require of her to defend the indefensible.  In my conversation with her Minister today I thought I detected some sympathy.  I knew he could not pronounce judgement immediately on the facts as given to me but I assure the House that all the facts I have given are in perfect accord with the details of this case.</P>
    <P>In brief, a man was charged and brought before the courts in 1980.  He was fined £10, was encouraged to appeal and he did so.  He appeared before the Circuit Court and was sentenced to 12 months.  He served three weeks, was released to go on appeal to the higher court and that appeal was lost.  Since 1982 this sentence has been hanging over him. In my opinion any Minister for Justice not prepared to exercise the duty and responsibility he has in a matter like this will not be acting in accordance with the wishes of this House.  I hope he will not feel it incumbent on him to defend what is obnoxious, unacceptable and unwelcome and which has already brought to a family such trauma and unease with regard to what I would regard as justice. Instead of considering releasing this man, we should more appropriately be concerned with extending to him our sympathy, sorrow and disappointment that he has been the victim of such a foul decision.</P>

      <P>It falls on me to respond to Deputy Tunney's contribution. I understand him to be motivated by concern with and interest in fairness.  I should like to assure him that there is certainly <Col N="1393" /> sympathy and consideration on the part of the Minister and myself.</P>
      <P>The man in question, however, has been arrested and lodged in prison on foot of a court order.  The Deputy is free to consider that the verdict of the Circuit Court in the case was inappropriate, but it is for the courts to determine the severity of sentences in accordance with law.</P>
      <P>The Deputy appears to consider that there is an obligation on the Minister, in relation to the case to defend his not using the powers conferred on him by law in order to release prisoners before the duration date of sentences passed on them by the courts.  I do not accept that there is any such obligation, and think that previous Ministers for Justice would agree.  The power is a discretionary one, and I do not think that it would be in anyone's interest if the Minister for Justice had to argue the toss about the length of time each and every prisoner should actually spend in prison.  The Deputy can be assured, however, that power of release is exercised responsibly and as fairly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, owing to pressure on prison accommodation, many low-risk prisoners are benefiting from early release nowadays, and I think it may be assumed that the prisoner referred to by the Deputy may have his case considered fairly soon.</P>

      <P>My Department's Vote provides for the funding of three capital projects from which County Galway is likely to benefit in 1984.  They are:</P>
      <P>1.  Western Aid Electrification (FEOGA)</P>
      <P>The provision in this year's Vote is £1.87 million.  The amount to be expended from the Vote will represent 80% of the total cost of the work done and half of this amount will be recouped from the EEC.  The scheme is designed to stimulate the development of agriculture in the west of Ireland through the connection of farms to the electricity supply.</P>
      <P>2.  Grants for Private Bog Development</P>
      <P>The provision in this year's Vote is £1 million.  The scheme is administered by Bord na Mona and provides for payment of grants to individuals, qualified groups or societies towards the cost of private bog development for the production of turf for fuel.</P>
      <P>3.  New and Renewable Sources of Energy</P>
      <P>The provision in this year's Vote is £97,000.  The bulk of this year's expenditure will be on maintaining and monitoring the windpower programme and on monitoring the small hydro generators.</P>
      <P>4.  Expenditure in Co. Galway</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be impossible to state what <Col N="1217" /> the expenditure in County Galway will amount to in 1984 in respect of 1 and 2 above.  Specific allocations are not made in respect of individual counties and the amount spent in County Galway will depend on the incidence of applications received and processed during the year.  In 1983 expenditure in County Galway amounted to £400,000 approx. on the FEOGA scheme and £55,383 on the private bog development scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards 3 above, my Department expects to spend approx. £20,000 on the wind turbine on Inis Oirr in 1984.  This money will be spent on repairs, modification and general upkeep of the machine which was erected in 1982 as part of the national windpower demonstration programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the changes that will take place on 1 January 1985 in relation to the importation of motor cars by private individuals, illustrating any changes in money terms between the present circumstances and the circumstances that will obtain then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present under the special arrangements for the motor vehicle assembly industry the commercial importation of fully built up motor vehicles is confined to persons registered as importers under the Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) Act, 1968.  In accordance with the provisions of Protocol No. 7 annexed to Ireland's Treaty of Accession to the European Economic Communities, these special arrangements will be terminated on 1 January 1985.</P>
      <P>From that date, therefore, private individuals may import fully built up motor vehicles without restriction.  Vehicles of non-EEC origin, which are not in free circulation in the Community, will continue to be liable for the Common Customs Tarriff at the appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>As to the possibility of any changes in money terms, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by the Minister for Finance to Dáil Question No. 309 on 24 November 1983 in regard to the possible effects the removal of restrictions would have on the level of taxation on cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would further refer the Deputy to the announcement by the Minister for <Col N="1220" /> Finance during the course of his Budget Statement to the House on 25 January 1984:</P>
    <P>From 1 January, 1985 the restrictions which we have been allowed to maintain on importations of motor vehicles since our entry into the EEC will not longer apply.  This does not mean that there will be any reduction in the level of excise duty on motor vehicles.  While I am having the taxation regime for motor vehicles examined at present to see whether any changes would be desirable to meet the new circumstances, the intention will be to maintain the existing overall level of taxation in this area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if the plan for the provision of a toxic dump at Baldonnel, County Dublin, will now be discontinued, having regard to the widespread opposition in the area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>There is no proposal to provide <Col N="1224" /> a toxic dump at Baldonnel.  However, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 342 to 346 of 14 December last in which I dealt with aspects of the proposal to locate a central waste facility at Baldonnel, including the reasons for the selection of the Baldonnel site and the fact that any development would be subject to planning permission. I also indicated that the arrangements generally, including the possible cost, were under review and that I was not in a position to say when detailed proposals for the development and operation of the facility would be available.  There is no change in that position.</P>
      <P>The development envisaged is a depot at which limited quantities of waste would be bulked up and stored under stringent conditions, pending export to approved disposal facilities abroad.  It is possible that some treatment of waste may be undertaken at the centre in the future if the quantities of waste being received and economic considerations justify such a course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of financing the cost of snow clearance by a local authority is primarily a matter for the local authority concerned.  In the case of roads, the cost is generally met from the local authority's own resources, supplemented by the block grant or by my Department's grants for maintenance.  In 1983 the Department provided additional grants totalling £253,000 to meet the cost of specialist snow-clearing equipment in certain key areas.  In 1984 I propose to make a provision of the same order for this purpose.</P>

The board must, however, comply with Government policy on the filling of posts in the public sector which allows only one out of every three vacancies which have arisen since 23 December 1981 to be filled.  The only exception to this arrangement arises where the number of vacancies in a particular grade is greater than one third of the number of posts in that grade.  As the vacancy for inspector in the western area of the Southern Fsiheries Region does not meet these requirements the post is not fillable.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 243 and 244 together.  I have not asked the Hospitals Joint Services Board, Rathfarnham, to implement any redundancies among its staff.  The board itself, having made a detailed study of the likely demand for its laundry service in the coming years, concluded that manning levels are higher than would be necessary to meet this demand.  In the circumstances the board has decided that it has no option but to lay off a certain number of staff.  Since the matter is at present the subject of negotiation between the board and the trade unions concerned I do not think it appropriate that I should make any further comment at this stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question, the Hospitals Joint Services Board has not a monopoly of the hospital laundry services in the Dublin area.  It has always been the case that part of the Dublin laundry hospital requirement was met from other services including private laundries.  The extent to which this happens varies and it is not possible to give precise figures on the matter.</P>

      <P>The deployment of health board staff within any particular health board area is a matter for the chief executive officer of the health board concerned.</P>
      <P>The current embargo on the recruitment of additional staff in the public service has given rise to a shortage of dentists in the Eastern Health Board.  It is necessary, therefore, for the board to redeploy dental staff from time to time to ensure, in so far as possible, that an equitable level of service for eligible persons operates throughout the health board area.  In accordance with this policy a dentist who worked at the Ballymun clinic for four days per week was transferred to Blanchardstown to help to cope with the waiting list that has developed in this rapidly growing area.  The health board is keeping the situation under constant review to ensure that no undue hardship is caused to eligible persons in any particular area.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking all employees over the age of 16 years whose earnings from employment are assessable to PAYE income tax must pay a contribution under the PRSI system.  A private contractor therefore, like all employees, irrespective of whether he is performing a service for the public or private sector must remit PRSI contributions (inclusive of health contributions) to the Collector-General in respect of each payment of reckonable earnings made to an employee.  In order to discharge this liability there is a legal obligation on each employer to register with the Revenue Commissioners.  Likewise an employee must also register with his local tax office and obtain a PRSI number from them.</P>
      <P>The statutory obligations of employers in relation to the payment of PRSI contributions are provided for in the Social Welfare Acts.  These obligations are well known to employers and employees and it is not clear what further advantage there would be in having the matter referred to in a contract.

      <P>The person concerned, who is a postal applicant, does not satisfy the contribution conditions for unemployment benefit.  He claimed unemployment assistance and his case was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of his means.  Following the completion of inquiries he was assessed with means at £4.25 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging in his parent's home. He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at £23.75 weekly being the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable to him £28.00 less £4.25.</P>

      <P>The rate of unemployment benefit payable to the person concerned was reduced from £33.55 weekly to £28.90 weekly on the grounds that he did not fulfil the contribution condition of having at least 280 paid contributions in a seven year period.  Following a review of his contribution record it was established that he fulfilled the condition and payment of unemployment benefit at the full rate of £33.55 has been restored. Arrangements have been made to pay <Col N="1262" /> arrears amounting to £56.58 to him this week and further weekly payments at £33.55 will follow.  His entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat-rate unemployment benefit cannot be determined until he furnishes evidence of his earnings from 6 April 1982 to the commencement of his unemployment benefit claim on 28 April 1983 to enable the 85 per cent limit to be calculated.

His case was referred to a social welfare officer for reinvestigation and following the completion of inquiries, he was assessed with means in excess of the statutory limit applicable to him £4,225.00 per annum.</P>
      <P>The assessment of his means took into account the income received by him from the sale of milk and the profits from the sale of cattle and sheep and the value of capital.  Allowance was made for expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income and included in such expenses were the costs of feeding stuff, fertilisers, milking costs. His profit from his holding and from capital was estimated at £9,000.00 per annum.  He has not signed as unemployed since 28 June 1983.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for the receipt of widow's non-contributory pension is that the widow's means must not exceed the statutory limit applicable in her case.  In the case of a widow under 66 years of age with no qualified children the statutory limit is £40.00 per week. This is increased to £50.00 per week if she has one qualified child.</P>
      <P>The means of the person concerned were originally assessed at £51.69 per week derived from a farm and allowing a deduction of £6.00 per week in respect of a qualified child.  They were increased to £57.69 per week from 1 September 1983 when the child ceased to be qualified on reaching 18 years of age.  Because her means at all times exceeded the statutory limits applicable, her claim to widow's non-contributory pension was refused. She appealed against this decision and her case has been referred to an appeals officer for determination.  She will be notifed as soon as he gives his decision in the matter.</P>

    <P>The rates for first year off the job apprentices are subject to income tax and PRSI. The rates for redundant apprentices are based on wages rates within the industry and are computed so that they are equivalent to the take home pay of an apprentice in industry after deduction of income tax and PRSI.  Apprenticeship rates of pay for the different categories of apprentices are negotiated between employers and trade unions.  Apprentices are normally paid a percentage of the skilled craftsman's rate.  These percentage rates range from 30 per cent in the first year to 80 per cent in the fourth year of apprenticeship depending on the trade category.</P>
