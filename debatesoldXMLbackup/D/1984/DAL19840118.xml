      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I beg leave to announce, for the information of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>(1)  that, on 2 January 1984, I assigned the Department of Communications to Deputy Jim Mitchell; and</P>
      <P>(2)  that, on the same date, the Government appointed Deputy Ted Nealon, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility for Arts and Culture, to be Minister of State at the Department of Communications also with special responsibility for radio and television.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the reason he consented to a meeting between the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Minister for Justice; and if he will agree that this is a major departure from the practice which has hitherto been followed in Anglo-Irish relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to answer Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I did not meet the Secretary of State who was in Dublin for discussions with the Minister for Justice.  Bilateral meetings at ministerial level are now a well-established feature of Anglo-Irish relations &mdash; and within the European Community &mdash; and do not require specific justification, as the Deputy seems to imply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is a departure for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to meet with the Minister for Justice only and that this has implications, first of all from the point of view of our independence and sovereignty?  The traditional practice is that Anglo-Irish relations in so far as Northern Ireland is concerned, have been conducted either on Taoiseach level or Foreign Minister level.  Perhaps he would care to comment on that aspect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in no way a precedent. Many meetings have taken place between the Ministers of the two Governments over the whole period of the history of this State.  There was no question of meetings between Ministers being channelled through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, even prior to the establishment of the Anglo-Irish Council.  Within the council it is, of course, envisaged that Ministers will meet with their opposite numbers.  There have, in fact, been precedents for such meetings, including a precedent for such a meeting with the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that the fact that the Minister for Justice alone would meet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would give some credence, to put it at its mildest, to a belief in certain British circles that Northern Ireland is entirely a security problem?  I know that the Taoiseach would agree with me that that is not our position and that we see peace and reconciliation only coming to Northern <Col N="4" /> Ireland through the development of new political structures.  The belief that Northern Ireland is nothing more than a security problem is a dangerous belief. Would the Taoiseach not accept that there is a possibility that the fact that the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, responsible for Security in Northern Ireland, could meet our Minister for Justice, who is, of course, responsible for security in this State, would tend to support that erroneous view that the problem of Northern Ireland can be solved entirely by security measures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's analysis of the problem, but I do not agree that such a meeting lends credence to that view.  The Government have made very clear and have, I think, succeeded in conveying to a substantial segment of British public and political opinion in some measure, for the first time, that the view that it is a security problem only is completely erroneous.  I do not believe that this meeting in any way detracts from the successful efforts which we are making in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>I ask the Taoiseach if he will keep in mind for the future &mdash; this meeting has happened so there is nothing that we can do about it &mdash; the very real danger which exists that if this sort of security meeting only is to take place, it would have inherent in it the policy dangers which I see?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept what the Deputy says, so I shall not keep it in mind.  I did not understand the <Col N="5" /> Deputy's earlier remark about an irritable little reference and therefore, cannot reply to that adequately.  What I said was that this was not the first such meeting. I cannot see what is irritable or little about that.  It is simply a statement of fact.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he still believes the official forecasts of unemployment are too pessimistic in the light of the December unemployment figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; radio programme on Sunday, 8 January, I suggested that a figure of about 225,000 for average unemployment in 1984 was, in my view, a bit pessimistic.  I believe it to be possible that the average monthly increase in the seasonally adjusted live register figures for 1984 will be closer to the average increase of just over 1,900 a month for the final nine months of 1983, recognising, of course, that the change fluctuates from month to month, as was the case in December last.  This would yield an unemployment figure for 1984 which could be about 10,000 lower than the official estimate.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress, however, as I said in the interview in question, that the Government very properly went on the official advice given to them and made financial provision in the Estimates for the official forecast of unemployment in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, no doubt, will be fully aware when he made this statement that the figures for the unemployment increase of 28,000 and the figures reaching 208,000 already, were not known.  In view of the fact that this very alarming increase in unemployment took place would he not think that this certainly should cast doubt on his, in my view, very mistaken optimism about unemployment?  Would he not also <Col N="6" /> advert to the fact that already, in the month of January, we have had an appalling and regrettable list of closures &mdash; and later on I know he will be making a statement about the loss and prospective loss of jobs in Cork, with 100 jobs lost in Burlington in Tullamore, 250 redundancies in Irish Biscuits, 91 jobs lost in Youghal?  Would the fact that these factory closures, redundancies and job losses have emerged already at the very beginning of 1984 not cast very serious doubt on this false optimism he purported to convey in that interview?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point that the Deputy raised, the great bulk of the increase in December over November was a seasonal increase &mdash; the seasonally adjusted increase was 3,200 &mdash; which is above the average of earlier months but fluctuations of that kind occur from time to time.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, in their November 1983 bulletin, forecast, I think, an average of 210,000, very much lower even than the figure that I have indicated would be possible if the present trend or trend of the last nine months continued. Therefore, by the standards of the ESRI, my own personal assessment is pessimistic, not optimistic.  It may very well be that, in individual months, there will be adverse fluctuations and in other months favourable fluctuations.  I do not want to press the point but the fact is that we have made financial provision for the increase in unemployment, as officially advised to us in accordance with our practice of producing estimates solidly based on offical advice rather than the individual views of Ministers.  I think I am entitled to my own personal opinion as to what may happen as long as I do not seek to impose these opinions in any way on the Estimates or budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think that he can continue to speak with two voices, in that, on the one hand in so far as the Estimates over which he presides are concerned, he comes to the conclusion that the unemployment figure will be 225,000 and on the other hand he gives some sort of personal or divinely <Col N="7" /> inspired estimate of a lesser figure? Would he accept that one of the principal planks of the Programme for Government which brought this motley Government together &mdash; and the figure was 170,000 at that time &mdash; was firm and decisive action to reduce the figure of 170,000 unemployed?  In view of the fact that there are now 38,000 more persons unemployed than there were when that firm undertaking was given, would he agree that this Government have reneged totally on the whole question of employment and unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the rate of increase in unemployment that prevailed in the closing period of the Government over which the Deputy presided has been halved in the last nine months is evidence, as far as evidence can be given statistically, of the effects of the policy this Government have been pursuing as well, of course, as of external events and other factors that may operate favourably.  I cannot therefore agree with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A last question to the Taoiseach.  May I also remind the Taoiseach that, in that same, perhaps best forgotten document, there was a statement that the expansion of employment required a continuing high level of investment. The Taoiseach will recall that that was specifically indicated in the Programme for Government &mdash; a continuing high level of investment.  In view of the fact that unemployment is still rising inexorably, can he now give us an assurance that, in their forthcoming budget, that undertaking at least will be honoured?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see the Central Bank Winter, 1983 Quarterly Bulletin projects an increase in investment in machinery and equipment arising from the recovery in the economy which they see taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will note also that, in that same Central Bank Bulletin the following statement was <Col N="8" /> made in regard to his term of office in 1983:</P>
      <P>However, the absolute level of the Exchequer borrowing requirement remained high by both historical and international standards, again requiring large scale foreign borrowing.  As a result national debt, both domestic and foreign, continued to increase at a rate far faster than the growth in national resources, ....</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That level of borrowing, as referred to by the Central Bank Bulletin, is a 3 per cent lower share of GNP than was left by my predecessor.  I would like to hear what the Deputy might have to say about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not genuinely underestimating the size of the problem considering that the unemployment rate now throughout all of Europe is approximately 10 per cent &mdash; in the United States it is approximately 8 per cent, that is an average figure for all of Europe and the United States &mdash; and that in this country it is now nearly 16 per cent?  Does the Taoiseach not think that he is underestimating the size of the problem, considering that this country is out of line with virtually all other democratic states in the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by contending I am underestimating the size of the problem.  None of us is in doubt about the size of the problem as it is.  The question relates to the likely trend of unemployment in the period ahead.  We have made provision <Col N="9" /> for the increase in unemployment which official advice suggests might occur.  In pursuing that policy we have adhered rigidly and strictly to the principles that inform the operations of this Government, that at no stage will we alter or modify estimates of expenditure, or estimates of revenue as submitted to us on the best advice given to us, in order to produce a more favourable financial picture than would otherwise be there.  That having been done, and having adhered to those principles, or should I say restored those principles, underlying the presentation of our finances, I am entitled to my own personal opinion, which may, of course, be proved wrong.</P>

      <P>The Government in their statement issued on 12 January on NESC Report No. 75 welcomed the report as a valuable and timely contribution to their consideration of policy options in the run-up to the 1984 budget. The Government will, as indicated in that statement, consider the many specific recommendations made in the report in framing the forthcoming budget and in deciding the shape and thrust of the economic and social strategy, which will be contained in the Government's medium-term plan now in preparation.</P>

Does the Taoiseach accept that and will that be the policy in the forthcoming budget?

Such action as has been taken in the financial sphere, restrictive in character, forced on us by the profligacy of the previous Government, and having adverse effects, is something which was necessary in order to safeguard the finances of the State, to ensure its solvency and to ensure our capacity to continue to borrow the large sums which are necessary in order to finance investment in this country.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to the Taoiseach that the only time I had any direct responsibility for the finances of this country was in December 1979.  The Central Bank nails the lie and points directly to the Coalition Government of the 1970s as being responsible for everything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe everybody accepts that there are grave difficulties for the theatre as far as attendances and employment in the theatre are concerned. However, as the Deputy is aware, the Arts Council decided to withdraw funding from the Irish Theatre Company and to fund touring theatre on the basis of grants to individual companies. An Irish touring agency company was set up, funded by the Arts Council, to co-ordinate those activities.  The Leader of the Opposition mentioned the employment element and I should like to <Col N="13" /> tell him that the new regulation for touring produced more actor-weeks than the Irish Theatre Company.  In 1981 under the Irish Theatre Company there were 405 actor-weeks while in 1982, under the Arts Council's touring system, there were 633.  In 1983 the figure was 530 actor-weeks. As far as employment is concerned there has been a substantial improvement and there has also been an improvement as regards bringing professional theatre to the provinces.  In 1981, the last full year for the ITC, there were 35 actor-weeks involved and this rose to 51 weeks in 1982 and 48 weeks in 1983. There has been improvement on both counts.  I should like to tell the Deputy that it would be inappropriate for the Department of the Taoiseach to become directly involved in funding the arts which is the statutory function of the Arts Council.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State accept the general view of all connected with the theatre, despite the collective statistics he has given, that the Irish theatre is in a parlous state at the moment?  In view of the great publicity and propaganda made of the Minister's appointment as having responsibility for the arts and culture, there is an obligation on him to do something about this matter. Will the Minister accept that his appointment, and the title he has been given, is regarded in artistic and theatrical circles as a joke in very bad taste?</P>

      <P>The responsibility for ensuring that gas mains in Dublin are in a safe condition lies with the Dublin Gas Company itself.</P>
      <P>I am assured by Dublin Gas Company that the company's mains have been independently assessed and found to be up to international standards.  My Department keep in close contact with Dublin Gas on the safety aspects of its operations.  A number of measures have been taken by the company to ensure the safety of the public.  These include increased leak surveying, improved leak control and maintenance procedures and a large reduction in the toxic carbon monoxide content of the gas.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above it is proposed to phase out the production of town gas over the next four years or so and to replace it with natural gas which is not toxic.</P>
      <P>The Gas Technical Standards Committee was set up at the request of my Department in 1982 under the aegis of the IIRS.  It includes representatives of the gas companies, Bord Gáis Éireann and the Department.  Its purpose is to draw up safety standards for the gas industry, including gas installations and domestic appliances.  To date a number of standards have been formulated in relation to various domestic gas appliances and standards are in course of preparation in regard to service pipes, mains and fittings.  In addition codes of practice are being drawn up concerning domestic and non-domestic installations, and gas fires.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the last four years in the Dublin centre city area at least eight people have died because of gas leaks in the mains outside their homes, not inside?  In many of those cases there was not a gas supply in the homes involved. At least 12 others barely escaped death. In view of that, is the Minister not concerned <Col N="19" /> about the consistency of the fatalities? There were further fatalities this winter, apparently because of corroding mains in public footpaths.  If that is the case, would the Minister not accept some responsibility, such as impressing on the Gas Company the urgency of renewing the mains, many of which, I understand, have not been renewed since the last century?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the number of fatalities in the last number of years, but I believe the new procedures being taken by the company will eliminate the fears expressed by the Deputy.  Increased leak surveying will improve leak control and maintenance, and this will be beneficial to the company and in the interest of public safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures which the company have adopted are based on consultants' recommendations.  The measures are: a systematic survey of mains and services on a continuing basis, a 24-hour emergency service for a fast response to any reported escape, planned mains and service renewal programmes in accordance with internationally adopted criteria, and during the period of reforming natural gas, a reduction in the carbon monoxide content of the gas. There will be continued use of odorants in the gas supply to maximise public awareness in the event of leaks.</P>

      <P>I am continuously concerned because what the Minister has just said in his reply is the same as has been said each year when there have been fatalities from gas leaks. The Gas Company have made the same statement as we have just heard from the Minister.  Would the Minister impress on the Gas Company, at least, the urgency of circularising householders who are in close proximity to gas mains so that they will be aware of the high risk involved in sleeping in downstairs front rooms?  In all cases of fatalities the people had not got gas in their homes and were therefore unaware of the risk close to their homes. People were sleeping in groundfloor front rooms in close proximity to gas mains without any knowledge of their existance. Consequently, would the Minister impress on the Gas Company the need to make this information available to such householders?</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The original proposals for a briquette factory of 260,000 tonnes at Ballyforan were reviewed in 1982 when the board decided that the project should proceed as two separate developments of 150,000 tonnes each, approval of the second unit to be decided when the success and viability of the first unit had been established.</P>
      <P>As part of an overall review of all major capital projects under the aegis of my Department, initiated when the Government took office more than a year ago, a further detailed review of the project was undertaken.</P>
      <P>A report on the review of the project was submitted to me after I assumed responsibility for energy matters.  I am considering the matter at present and will be submitting my recommendations to the Government as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year £15.4 million has been allocated in the Public Capital Programme <Col N="22" /> for the Ballyforan project.  It is estimated that the number of jobs at an initial stage of construction would be 75.  This number could be expected to increase to 180 before the factory has been completed.</P>

I understand that the Minister for the Environment will shortly present a motion to the Dáil seeking approval to the terms of the Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land Based Sources and that the process of ratification will then be concluded as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our concern about the discharge of radioactive effluent and the dumping of radioactive waste at sea has been made known to Britain on several occasions in recent months as well as to other participating countries to the Paris Convention and the London Convention on the Prevention <Col N="25" /> of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and other Matter.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the Anglo-Irish Summit in London, last year, the Tánaiste raised the matter of the discharges of radioactive effluent into the Irish Sea from the Windscale Plant at Sellafield with the Prime Minister and in December of last year the Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, while he was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, had bilateral discussions on the matter in Brussels with his then opposite number in the UK, Mr. William Waldergrave, MP.  The Deputy can be assured that Ireland's concerns on this issue are being pursued at the highest level.</P>
    <P>On the question of dumping of radioactive waste at sea, as distinct from waste discharge to the sea, Ireland will be represented at the next meeting of the London Dumping Convention in February of this year and it is my intention to take this opportunity to make our continuing concern about the effects of dumping known.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have assured me that there is no evidence to date that the dumping of low level radioactive waste into the north-east Atlantic in accordance with the Multilateral Consultation and Surveillance Mechanism operated by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development presents a hazard in any way to our population or environment.  Our concerns about this dumping are to ensure that no avoidable risk is taken that might cause a health or environmental hazard in the future.  The Deputy will be aware that no dumping was carried out in 1983.</P>
    <P>There are no discharges of nuclear wastes from land based sources directly into the Atlantic that I am aware of although discharges are taking place into the Irish Sea and the English Channel from two nuclear plants in the UK and France.</P>

I should point out that on two occasions, on 22 November 1983 and 23 December 1983, the Nuclear Energy Board carried out radiological surveys of east coast beaches to allay public concern about the reported incidents at Windscale.  These surveys showed no evidence of contamination and this has been confirmed by laboratory analyses of the samples.</P>

      <P>The need for the USA and the Soviet Union to pursue with determination the negotiations on intermediate range and strategic nuclear forces was a main theme of the address by my colleague Deputy Barry to the thirty eighth session of the UN General Assembly.</P>

      <P>Consequently, in the address of my colleague to the Conference on Disarmament in Europe, in Stockholm today he expressed the Government's concern that these negotiations should resume and should do so with a genuine and manifest aim of succeeding and thereby bringing about substantial reductions of nuclear weapons and conventional forces to the lowest possible level.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware that most insurance companies operating in the motor insurance field will not accept any proposals from persons under the age of 25 years; if he is aware of the very heavy loading of premium prices in such cases in the limited number of cases where such proposals are accepted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed recently over the availability of motor <Col N="30" /> insurance cover for young drivers.  While I cannot compel an insurer to take on particular risks, all motor insurers in the State undertook in 1981, in the context of the Decline Cases Agreement, not to decline a risk on grounds of age of driver alone.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has particular details of individual cases of cover being declined on grounds of age alone he should forward these to the Department for investigation.</P>
      <P>It is common practice, and has been for many years, to place heavy loadings on the premiums charged to younger drivers.  This reflects the increased risk of accidents and claims involving such policy holders.  The higher risk involved is indicated by the road accident statistics published by An Foras Forbartha and by the examination of premium loadings and claims experience carried out by the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee. If any young driver feels he is being excessively laded he can refer his case to the Department for examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Take General Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corporation Limited. They have 150 per cent loading from 17 years of age to 20 years of age.  It falls to 100 per cent from age 21 to 24 and between the age of 25 and 29 they have a 25 per cent loading with no loading over the age of 29.  Hibernian Insurance Company Limited have a 125 per cent loading from ages 17 to 20 years.  From age 21 to 24 they have a 75 per cent loading and from age 25 to 29, a 20 per cent loading. In the case of the PMPA, 100 per cent for age 21 and under and from age 22 to 24 a 50 per cent loading.  I have given the Deputy an indication of what the loadings are but rather than continue to pick out some which might be invidious as regards comparisons it would be better to give him the entire list and he could look at them himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the licensing authority for people writing motor insurance.  He has the power to decide that insurance companies will not act in a discriminatory way against young people.  It is obvious from the few samples he has given that there is a wide disparity in the way insurance companies deal with different categories.  The Minister has a duty to see that fair play is done by the companies.  In granting the annual licence he should see to it that certain categories are not discriminated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the licensing arrangements would provide an appropriate opportunity for what the Deputy has in mind.  Applications for increases in premiums, which must be approved by me, would probably be the most appropriate method of achieving what the Deputy has in mind.  Investigations in this area by the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee indicate &mdash; this was stated by my predecessor on 24 November &mdash; that the loadings applied to young drivers broadly reflect the risk involved. <Col N="32" /> This risk is borne out in the higher road accident statistics affecting young people published by An Foras Forbartha.  This expert body indicates &mdash; this may not apply to individual companies &mdash; that broadly speaking the practice is in line with the actual risk involved as reflected in the statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the major contributory factors for the collapse of a major motor insurer last year, the subject of legislation in this House, was that the company was the only major motor insurer interested or willing to take on this category of person and that there was considerable resistance by all other insurers to have anything to do with the young motorist under 25 years of age?  This led to a very serious situation last year.  Does the Minister not agree that that loading should be spread evenly among all motor insurers writing insurance here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for each company to decide in the first instance what loading it wants to apply.  No company is forced to apply a loading.  That is as far as I can go in replying to the Deputy's question.  It would not be appropriate for me to engage in discussions in regard to the instance the Deputy has in mind.  If the Deputy wants to put down a question about that he is free to do so but I would not wish to become involved in it at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the matter up with the Minister.  It must be clearly stated that the PMPA as a major insurer was the only Irish insurer willing to take on this category of person.

Those who are not willing to undertake this course should have their licences looked at.</P>

      <P>The House will, I know, want to pay tribute to the late Seán MacEntee who was a Member of Dáil Éireann for half a century and whose record of service to his country was unsurpassed.  That service was at all times motivated by a burning patriotism, a flame which remained alight until the last moment of his life.</P>
      <P>As I have said elsewhere, he brought to the proceedings of this House the eye of a poet, the vision of a patriot and a tongue whose acerbity belied the softness and warmth of his heart.  In Government he served in many roles, including a long number of years in the key position of Minister for Finance, helping to steer the State through a difficult and turbulent period.</P>
      <P>Coming into office in 1932 he was concerned, while pursuing with the other members of his party, its policies, to maintain the continuity of the State, thereby helping to secure the establishment of our democracy on the firmest of foundations.  His concern for democracy remained the basis of all his political ideals and actions.  His absolute rejection of violence as a means of securing the objective that was dearest to him above all others, the unity of the Irish people, was informed by his devotion to the democratic process.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The death of Sean MacEntee marks the ending of one of the last remaining links with the generation of public men who helped to build this State.  For over 40 years, he participated in most of the major debates here in Dáil Éireann.  It was always a great experience to see him exercise his unique debating skill, demonstrate <Col N="216" /> his complete mastery of language and use his devastating wit and knowledge of parliamentary procedure to brilliant effect.  He had, too, a wide knowledge of the administrative process, an intimate knowledge of all the major Departments of State and he made a great contribution to building up our economic structures and our welfare services.</P>
    <P>Ever proud of his Ulster origins, Seán MacEntee sought and worked for the reunification of his country and for the coming together of the people, North and South in harmony and in peace.  Seán MacEntee had a great love of country which motivated all his endeavours.  He played a significant part in Ireland's struggle for independence, in the evolution of modern Ireland and in the development of her democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>The legacy of Seán MacEntee to future generations of Irish men and women is that of an Ulster man who, during a long and eventful life, selflessly and unsparingly devoted himself to the advancement of his country and to the welfare of her people.</P>

      <P>In the light of the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle I considered it proper to make a statement to the House.</P>
      <P>I wish to inform this House and the people of Cork of the Government's reaction to yesterday's announcement that the Ford Motor Company will later this year close their plant in Cork.</P>
      <P>I must first express my profound regret and surprise at the closure announcement because of the hardship this decision will create for so many families in Cork and of the damage which the loss of so much employment will cause to the economy of Cork and the nation.</P>
      <P>I wish to say that the Ministers for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and for Foreign Affairs sought, on 29 December last, a meeting with the top management of the Ford Company.</P>
      <P>The Government are prepared, as we have always been, to sit down with Ford management, either local or international, to see what options are open by way of State action to enable the assembly of cars to continue in Cork.  My understanding is that the unions involved are similarly disposed to see what they could do to achieve this objective.  If, as a result of a full examination of all feasible options, vehicle assembly is adjudged no longer to be viable in Cork, we are equally committed to sitting down with Ford management to examine all possible options for State action to assist Ford replace the vehicle assembly operation with another manufacturing facility.</P>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that the Industrial Development Authority have established two task forces at senior management level, the first to prepare urgently a detailed presentation for and to undertake negotiations with the Ford Motor Company on how it can manufacture automotive products in Cork on a profitable basis as many other companies already do in this country, and the second to co-ordinate the entire industrial promotion campaign around the Cork area with particular attention to initiatives that can produce results in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to announce that I am establishing a small, high level expert working group &mdash; I will bring this before the <Col N="219" /> Government later today &mdash; to advise the Government urgently on the impact of the measures already being taken to provide jobs in the Cork area, on the action necessary to provide additional new jobs and on all action possible to safeguard existing viable jobs in Cork.  This group will, of course, liaise closely with both IDA task forces.</P>

      <P>I regret that this sad and sorry occasion has arisen in this House.  It is perhaps the most poignant occasion on which I have ever had to speak in very briefly discussing the announcement yesterday evening of the closure of the Ford car assembly plant in Cork.  While I accept the explanation you, Sir, have offered I am at a loss to understand how any experts advising you in a democracy, such as we have, could advise you that an elected public representative could not on an occasion like this be enabled to ask two very relevant Private Notice Questions following immediately on the announcement of the closure of this car assembly plant.  I am, I think, entitled to say what the content of those questions is.  First, I asked if the Taoiseach would be prepared to head a delegation to meet the Ford management in the United States in an effort to have this decision reversed.  The second question I asked was if the Taoiseach would immediately establish an emergency job creation task force for Cork headed by a Government Minister and representative of all interests in an effort to counter the huge job losses in the area.  Obviously that second question has got some limited response in the statement the Taoiseach has just read out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going further I think I should draw the attention of the Taoiseach to the fact that his statement disappoints me intensely.  It does not seem to be in line with the utterances of the Minister for <Col N="220" /> Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism yesterday afternoon and again last night when he stated that Fords would not be allowed to walk away from Cork.  I welcomed that statement and promised the support of myself and my party.</P>
    <P>The statement just made by the Taoiseach appears to be much milder in tone and weaker than I would have expected. In fact it can be described as somewhat condescending.  I fail to understand such expression as: &ldquo;The Government are prepared, as we have always been, to sit down with Ford management, either local or international, to see what options are open, by way of State action to enable the assembly of cars to continue in Cork&rdquo;.  Big deal!Surely that is the least that could be expected of a Government. What leadership will they give?  What initiatives are they prepared to take?</P>
    <P>In the preceding paragraph the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;I wish to say that the Ministers for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and for Foreign Affairs sought, on 29 December last, a meeting with the top management of the Ford Company.&rdquo;  Let us go into that now.  This being a very limited debate, the demands of this party cannot be adequately met. We have a statement but it is a statement which does not allow my Cork colleagues and others on this side an opportunity of speaking and I suggest nothing less than a full debate in Government time is called for.  When I submitted my questions, my party colleagues, Deputy Pearse Wyse, Deputy Wallace and Deputy Denis Lyons appended their names.  On our arrival here four other Deputies from Cork constituencies, Joe Walsh, Daniel Moynihan, Ned O'Keeffe and Michael Ahern suggested their names should also be added.</P>
    <P>Fords touches every home and every person in Cork because everybody had either a friend or a relative in Fords and the difference between this and the announcement of the Dunlop closure is that that announcement was made during the Dáil recess and unfortunately before the Dáil resumed it had become a reality. But the Dáil is now in session and the Taoiseach has an obligation to ensure <Col N="221" /> that every step is taken to prevent this becoming a reality.  I deliberately avoided and I will continue to avoid making this a political issue.  We will support the Government.  We will support them in every way possible in the interests of saving that plant in Cork.</P>
    <P>A few points have to be brought to notice here.  We are told 800 jobs will be lost.  How many more will be affected by the loss of that 800 jobs?  To their credit Fords were a good company by Irish standards.  I say this in a complimentary way to them even though I do not agree with the way in which they have made this announcement or the shortness of the notice given.  They purchased most of their components in the Cork area and certainly in the Republic generally.  I refer to such components as paint, glass, springs and so on.  The gate of Fords was a traditional stage for the sale of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and the <i>Evening Echo</i>.  The Marina, once the industrial hub of Cork business life, because of the closure of Dunlops and now the imminent closure of Fords, will be no more.</P>
    <P>I steered away from the statement about the Ministers for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and for Foreign Affairs on 29 December, seeking, a little less than three weeks ago, a meeting with the top management of the Ford company. I am not sure whether that means Irish, European or United States management. But, whatever it means, I wonder why it took so long to seek that meeting because in April of last year the trade union movement in Cork requested a meeting between the Government, the trade unions and the management of the company.  All Cork public representatives on both sides of this House pressed for that meeting.  I understood the meeting had been fixed for 14 December.  It did not take place.  For what reason I do not know, but I assumed that that meeting would have been rearranged, not for December but certainly for a date early in the New Year.  I now understand from the Taoiseach's statement that no effort was made to fix that meeting until 29 December.  If that is the case someone has been remiss.  All I am saying is that when you present a statement to the <Col N="222" /> House it should be clear and detailed on an occasion like this and should not be one that cannot be understood.  I do not know whether it refers to the meeting originally requested or to a new meeting. One could take either interpretation.</P>
    <P>I welcome any move to help the Cork unemployment situation which now, if we take the city alone, stands at 12,600 unemployed or an increase of 25 per cent on this time last year.  If we combine city and county we talk of a total unemployment figure of 23,000.  That does not include the Tungsram announcement last week or Blackwater Cottons announcement last week or the Ford announcement. I do not know what the Taoiseach expects from the high level expert working group which he now proposes to appoint to advise the Government.  I expect they will be appointed today and asked to meet tomorrow and I suggest to them that before the Minister for Finance announces his budget proposals next Wednesday some proposals for Cork must be brought to his notice.  Never let me have to stress again the urgency of the deepwater berth project.  I heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs 11 months ago saying he hoped that the next time he referred to the deepwater berth it would be in a positive way, providing funds.  It has been referred to many times since without any money yet being provided.</P>
    <P>I believe there must be a lower river crossing; the ferry must be restored, and I do not mind who runs it.  Either of the State companies are welcome to it and if there are squabbles I am not interested. I also want to see an improvement of the entrance routes to Cork.  The section from Watergrasshill to Cork city has been long in need of improvement.  That is urgent but above all I want a better and more flexible approach by the IDA. When Ferenka fell the people opposite made a lot of noises.  At that time Deputy O'Malley as Minister for Industry and Commerce increased the possible grant ceiling to industry from the IDA from 45 per cent to 60 per cent.  The same thing should be done now in the case of Cork as a matter of extreme urgency.  The IDA must be encouraged perhaps to take <Col N="223" /> greater risks at times.  I believe that ICC and Fóir Teoranta should also be involved in the working group in order to cope with the situation which is becoming alarming at this stage.  Cork needs a restoration of confidence, a sort of impetus and morale boosting because it has been dealt blow upon blow upon blow and this now the most serious of them all.</P>
    <P>Dunlops and Fords were regarded in Cork as solid bastions of employment where when once employed you could be sure of life-time work.  That era has now ended and I believe the Government have an obligation &mdash; so do we all and we will all share it with them and support them &mdash; to endeavour to establish what options are left.  They must exhaust every possibility of car assembly continuing.  If that cannot be done what alternatives are open?  How many if not all of the workforce can be retained?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach informed the House that the IDA had established two task forces at senior management level for different purposes.  When were they appointed?  Why did we not hear of this long ago particularly when last April the trade union movement asked the Minister for Industry and Energy for meetings to discuss the situation on a tripartite basis?  The efforts being made now should have been made sooner.  The Taoiseach explains what each task force is assigned to do but it is surprising, in view of the knowledge that is available to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism &mdash; I accept entirely that he did not know of yesterday's announcement &mdash; that nothing was done before now.  It is unfortunate that we see here the cold face of a multinational taking a decision affecting the lives and livelihoods of so many people, affecting the very fabric of Cork society and undermining its structure.</P>
    <P>We hear experts talk of the efficiency of some of the &ldquo;ginks&rdquo;.  You cannot compare a 1,300 per day plant with a 90 or 100 car a day plant.  The recession worldwide is hitting the car industry but this is a major blow to an area already stricken. The Ford company owe something to Cork and Cork owes something to the <Col N="224" /> Ford company also.  The ethnic connection is there.  I believe this is the only Ford company in the world carrying the name &ldquo;Henry Ford and Son&rdquo;.  The name goes back to an old Cork family.  The original Henry Ford was a Corkman.  Does his memory cut no ice now, the man that was responsible surely for the huge empire that has been built?</P>
    <P>I understood and expected the Taoiseach to state that his Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism had already arranged a visit to Detroit which he said yesterday he was endeavouring to arrange.  I thought it would have been arranged by now.  If it is not, I suggest that it be arranged immediately and that the delegation be headed by the Taoiseach if possible.  It should be small but yet representative of all the interests involved.  Surely the interest most involved is that of the workers who have been loyal to that plant.  I think we can all agree that this was an excellent work force.  There may have been difficulties from time to time but overall this was a well managed and well organised plant but not big enough to be comparable with the giants of today's world.</P>
    <P>I believe the old connection must be used on this occasion.  To his credit Deputy Coveney last night suggested a political initiative. We on this side of the House would be prepared to support any such initiative.  I am disappointed that the Taoiseach in his statement has not indicated what initiatives may be taken by the Government.  It is not enough to say that they are prepared to sit down and discuss with Ford's management what might be done.  They must ask Ford management to meet them at all levels.  There are three &mdash; local level, European level and, above all, Detroit level.  This has been a traumatic experience for so many people.  I know that discussions are still taking place and believe that the approach of all concerned has been extremely responsive.  I am not aware of the content of those discussions.  They are being held behind closed doors, in confidence.  We all await their outcome and the subsequent announcement.  This Government have an obligation, on <Col N="225" /> which they will have our support, to exhaust every possibility as to whether car assembly can continue in Cork and, if not, what worthwhile alternative options can be provided there.</P>
    <P>I know that every one of my Cork colleagues, as well as others on this side of the House, would wish to contribute and cannot because this is but a statement, and I accept that entirely.  Nothing less than a full scale debate on this issue will satisfy us as a party.  That must take place if not today, tomorrow, and the sooner the better.  It is a problem for all of us.  I believe that all Deputies of all parties have taken pride over the years in driving Ford cars.  This was due to a sense of commitment to the car assembly plant. Perhaps Cork owes something to Ford's, but Ford's also owe something to Cork. I earnestly urge the Taoiseach to be a bit more aggressive in his approach than the statement he has read to the House today.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach has said that there will be a debate on this matter.  This miserable hiccup of a statement, or yawn, or whatever it is says absolutely nothing.  All it says is that he regrets that there is nothing he can do about it.  The shock and horror that we have been listening to from Government and Opposition all morning is unbelievable when they all know ever since Jack Lynch signed the Treaty of Accession in 1972 that Protocol 7 said that car assembly would end in the end of 1984.  They have all known that since 1972.  They have had equal terms in Government &mdash; the Coalition from 1973 to 1977, Fianna Fáil from 1977 to 1981 and then every second year after that. They have had equal time in Government and neither of them did anything for 12 years about the car assembly industry. All the rest have closed down, with a loss of 5,000 jobs already and Cork is now closing down.  Presumably they thought that Ford's would stay on.  Men are sitting in the Datsun factory on the Naas Road for the last six weeks fighting the same battle.  They fought against this clause in the Accession Treaty in 1972 and marched in the streets of Dublin.  They knew that their jobs would be lost in 1984 so why all the shock and horror from the Taoiseach or from Deputy Gene Fitzgerald that they are amazed at this closure? They knew for 12 years that our car assembly industry was doomed in any case.  During that 12 years neither of them did the slightest thing about it.</P>

They did nothing about it.  During those 12 years we had a lead and zinc mine which was exporting all its raw material, when we could have established a smelter and had an industry which could have provided the components for cars, 15 per cent of which are lead or zinc.  The zinc mines were exporting 360,000 tonnes of raw ore every year.  There is a whole string of things which could have been done.  They certainly could have done in 12 years what the Taoiseach is now talking of doing, sitting down with management to see what options are open by way of State action to enable the assembly of cars to continue in Cork.</P>

      <P>If the Deputies want to have a debate on the closure of Ford's Cork assembly plant without mentioning Protocol 7 of the Treaty of Accession to Rome, then they are wasting their bloody time, because that is why it is closing down.  The only thing about Ford's is that <Col N="230" /> they stayed in business a bit longer than the others.  They are staying in until the autumn of 1984, whereas the others were closing down in 1982 and 1983, shutting up shop, importing their cars.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Energy on 5 July last what consultations had been held with the EEC, or if any were planned, regarding the possibility of extending the period under Protocol 7 of the Treaty of Accession to the EEC during which car assembly could be continued. In answer the Minister said this in reply to Question No. 384 of that day:</P>
      <P>There has not been any consultation with the EEC Commission regarding the possibility of extending the special arrangements for the motor assembly scheme beyond the date provided for in Protocol 7 viz., 1 January 1985, and it is not intended to seek such an extension.</P>
      <P>Nor, he said, was it intended to have any consultation with them in regard to extending the period for assembly. Therefore, it was shot down at that time. There was no question of car assembly remaining after 31 December 1984 because that decision was made, and no alternative industries were supplied.</P>
      <P>I put down another question to the same Minister on 7 July last, No. 338, in regard to the motor assembly industry and in his answer the Minister did give a commitment but that commitment is not now contained in the Taoiseach's statement. In the course of the Minister's reply on that date he said:</P>
      <P>Firms currently assembling and who cease operations before the end of 1984 will be required to provide alternatives to assembly in order to continue to qualify for facilities to import fully built-up vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I take it that means is that the Minister is prepared to say to Fords, if they close down assembly here: &ldquo;Right, we will allow no fully assembled cars in until you provide an alternative industry to give 800 jobs there&rdquo;.  That is what I take that commitment to mean.  But there is no mention of that in the Taoiseach's statement, nothing whatever about it.  He <Col N="231" /> merely talks about options by way of State action to enable assembly of cars in Cork.  I took it that was a commitment from the Minister for Industry and Energy at that time.  Such commitment is at least necessary, taking a hard line with all the assemblers.  They talked about that with the other assemblers who closed down before, that they were to provide alternative industries.  British Leyland, when they closed down assembly, promised to set up an industry to manufacture frames for car seats, which they started up but then shut down.  That has gone as well.  The same type of thing might be done in other cases.</P>
    <P>We want something definite and firm so that if they do not provide the jobs they will not be allowed to bring in the cars.  Other EEC countries are taking their own decisions, are backing their citizens when they fight against imports which are affecting their jobs, whether it be farmers in France or wherever.  The citizens and workers of this country would be prepared to do the same thing if the Government would give them the same backing as other EEC Governments give their workers when they fight against things which deprive them of their jobs and their right to work.  This import of fully assembled cars here is doing 5,000 workers out of a job.  With regard to the 800 workers going out of work in Cork, according to Mr. Pádraig White of the IDA last evening, every industrial job set up now gives five spin-off jobs.  If Mr. White's figures are correct &mdash; and he maintained last night that they were &mdash; that must mean that every industrial job lost also loses five spin-off jobs.  Then the loss of the 800 industrial jobs in Cork will mean the loss of another 2,000 spin-off jobs there.  When one talks about 800 jobs lost in Cork, anybody in Dublin should be thinking in terms of something like 6,000 or 7,000 jobs lost here in proportion to the population.</P>
    <P>If there is a debate I hope we will get from the Taoiseach some more definite commitment, harder, firmer, none of this wishy-washy stuff contained in this statement but hard, firm decisions that speak harshly to the people who have made <Col N="232" /> their profits out of this country for 60 years and ask why they are going to abandon us now.  We should say: &ldquo;Right, no more Ford cars come into this country until you set up alternative jobs for those 800 workers&rdquo;.</P>

Perhaps the Taoiseach could indicate, first of all, that this procedure is acceptable to him and the Government <Col N="233" /> and indicate when this might happen.  I notice that we are interrupting at 7 p.m. today because, understandably, there is no room for Private Members' Time.

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has been before the House for a number of months and there has not been any attempt so far to rush the discussion or limit the number of speakers.  It is clear that the Minister has listened attentively to the great divergence <Col N="239" /> of views expressed on the Bill.  I am certain that he is open-minded about many of the suggestions for change that were made.  I believe the Minister has taken into account the many points made by other speakers as the debate progressed. Given that there has been such a full discussion I do not intend to go over the points made so well by the previous speakers and it is my intention to discuss two general areas.  Firstly, I want to deal with the general jurisprudence of the Bill and the areas with which I find myself in some measure of disagreement.  Secondly, I want to deal with the general context in which the legislation is going through the Oireachtas and the context in which it will when passed be put into operation.</P>
      <P>On the question of the jurisprudence of the Bill most of the major points have been made by my colleagues.  There is general agreement that the thrust and direction of the Bill is correct for the most part and that the Minister has, with few exceptions, succeeded in getting the right balance between the need for effectiveness and the need to ensure that the rights of the individual are maintained.  I do not intend to go through the Bill in detail indicating the sections I support because that would be superfluous.  Instead, I want to point out to the Minister the areas about which I have reservations.  I am sure the Minister will in his usual open-minded way have another look at some sections.</P>
      <P>The wording of section 4 is a cause for concern.  The intentions of the section are right and there cannot be any disagreement about that, but the wording is open to a certain amount of dangerous interpretation. Under that section the Garda shall on request cause the solicitor of the detained person to be notified as soon as practicable.  That may seem a small quibble about these words, but I believe they are open to various interpretations and, as far as is practicable, I should like to see this wording tightened up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, many people detained may not have a solicitor and therefore it is imperative that the Bill, in one way or another, should provide for a panel of <Col N="240" /> solicitors who would be available to people in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister should have any worries about sections 9, 10 and 11 which would get rid of the absurd situation at present when people on bail can commit crimes in respect of which the sentences would be concurrent.  There have been far too many dreadful examples of this.  Deputy Woods will know of cases in our constituency in which appalling things were done by people while out on bail.  These provisions will make it possible to impose consecutive sentences and this will be warmly welcomed.  The absence of this up to now has been a source of irritation and a scandal and the sooner this is put into effect the better.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 to 18 contain the main thrust of the Bill.  These provisions have been seen by many lawyers and others who have examined the Bill as introducing a fundamental change in our system of criminal law, the system which had held always that a person is innocent until he is proved guilty.  Not as a lawyer, I will ask a number of questions.  For example, is it possible, as has been suggested by a number of people, including the Chairman of the Irish Association for Civil Liberties, Mr. John Gore-Grimes, that this part of the Bill as introduced will establish without doubt the concept of investigative detention?  I should like the Minister to answer me in regard to that worry.</P>
    <P>Section 14 does not cause me any particular problems because I believe it is right that any person found by the Garda to be in possession of firearms or ammunition without a reasonable excuse must give an explanation as to how she or he came to have them.  If an explanation is not forthcoming or if a misleading one is given, penalties are provided for.  No one here today should pause very long about whether this constitutes a threat to any established rights.  Our society has the right to ask without apology for explanations from those found to be in unlawful possession of firearms or ammunition. It is clear to all of us that unless positive steps are taken to outlaw the rule of the gun, the pattern which we have seen becoming increasingly prominent, particularly <Col N="241" /> in the last 12 months, will continue without check.  Therefore, section 14 is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Section 15 causes a great deal of difficulty to a number of people.  All of us will have sympathy with the objective behind the section.  However, I hope the Minister will be able to put to rest the fears expressed by many people in the course of this debate in regard to the change in our system from an accusatorial system to an inquisitorial one, which this provision seems to imply.  The central point in the section is in regard to safeguards. Would it be possible to build into the section further safeguards?  The Minister seems to think it would be, but I should like him to be more explicit and to tell us in greater detail what he has in mind.</P>
    <P>For instance, are there some parameters of the range or type of questions a garda could put to a detained person? Under the section, is it necessary that a detained person must be questioned even if he has not a legal representative or a member of his family present?  There is not much point in hiding the worry about safeguards.  It is regrettable that the safeguards recommended by the Ó Briain Report for persons in Garda custody were not made operational because we all know about recent accusations about persons being ill-treated while in Garda custody.  I do not think there is a public representative in the country who at some stage or other has not had representations made to her or him on this matter.</P>
    <P>From our examination of such charges we all know that in many cases the charges have been unsubstantiated, that they were part of a vicious propaganda campaign aimed at undermining the Garda and at destroying their credibility with the general public.  However, it is important that we face up to the position that there have been abuses.  Abuses can never be justified and in some circumstances there have been abuses, there have been harrowing abuses which in certain localities damaged the credibility of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Abuses of that sort are likely to happen at any time in any police force.  They may happen because the police officers in <Col N="242" /> question believed that a person was guilty and they wanted to take shortcuts, believing that the ends justify the means.  It may happen because every police force will have among its numbers people psychologically unsuited to be policemen, people who should never have been entrusted with the sort of power which is normal for a policeman to have.  Such officers are in a small minority but such people will be found in police forces.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there must be built-in guarantees to ensure that small groups will never be in a position to abuse their powers. I appreciate that the Minister has thought very deeply about this and, without going into all the arguments in detail, I am outlining to him my worries on the matter of safeguards against ill-treatment or abuse.  Nothing more quickly undermines the standing of a police force or its general acceptance in a community than the belief that people in custody do not have adequate safeguards.  Some people would condone this, people who will say that the only way to get results is to allow the Garda to have a heavy hand, to allow the Garda to do the softening up that will produce results.  Nothing could be futher from the truth because any police force that gets results in this way very quickly will lose authority and acceptance within the general community.  It is in the interests of the force that the safeguards be there, be seen to operate, be clear and explicit, and that the right of citizens to have a full investigation of possible abuses be there.  Indeed it is more in the interests of the police than of the general public that these safeguards be there.</P>
    <P>All of us are aware of the campaign to undermine the Garda, a campaign carried out in an insidious way aimed at painting the police force in a way which would make them unacceptable and cost them the moral authority which is the basis of policing a free community.  For that reason I urge the Minister to consider my misgivings about the strength of the safeguards being provided.  I hope he will be more explicit on this subject.</P>
    <P>Other provisions in the Bill cause some worry.  The main cause of worry is sections 16 to 18.  The matter of inference is at the centre of these worries, the inference <Col N="243" /> which a court may draw from silence or otherwise of an accused person, the danger that this may very well erode the presumption of innocence.  I do not think the Bill would be weakened one whit if this matter of inference were omitted altogether.  Without it the Bill would be clearer and stronger.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, the Bill is positive.  It will stand up to serious criticism.  It provides the sort of balance I referred to earlier. The provisions in section 19 have been long overdue.  We are all aware of cases in which alibis have been concocted in the most blatant way, in open defiance of the police, almost laughing at the police, when people guilty of enormous crimes can walk out of court, laughing, they and the police knowing that the alibi is a totally false one.  Section 19 largely removes the possibilities which criminals have in this way and is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21, which provide that written statements will be admissible as evidence in the same way as oral evidence is satisfactory but I am a little worried about the way in which the tape recording of interrogation will be supervised and regulated.  I am not worried about the principle, as the provision of tape recording will be helpful.  I hope the level of technical competence of those who operate this equipment and the type of equipment used will not allow for erasures to that, unlike in the case of President Nixon, there will not be an 18½ minute gap at some crucial stage or that there will not be any need to have expletives deleted at certain stages in the tape recording.  On that question I am simply anxious that the Minister will give us greater elaboration on the way in which this will be done.  As far as the content of the Bill is concerned these are the only matters which worry me.  I can substantially agree with the general drift of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The second point of concern, which in some ways is more important, is the general context in which the Bill is being introduced.  I believe the Minister will probably agree with me that the climate in which a Bill is introduced and the general perception of the Bill is in many <Col N="244" /> ways almost as important for its effectiveness as the content of the Bill.  The Bill itself is useful and is overdue.  However, I do not believe that anybody would suggest that it comes near to solving the problems which concern us.</P>
    <P>The context of the Bill has been highlighted very tragically and vividly by the events in Ballinamore and in County Mayo last month.  I have no intention of joining with those who call for the resignation of the Minister or who seek some easy way, one single stroke which would put the entire situation to right.  I have no intention whatsoever of joining with that group.  However, the fact remains that those two operations showed up very serious and frightening problems of organisation and management within the Garda Síochána.  The operations highlight reforms and changes which are long overdue and they highlight the absence of political will up to now to face up to these changes.  They bring into very sharp relief that tangled and very often obscure area, the relationship between the Department of Justice and the Garda. The very dramatic events of 1982, in which the Department of Justice were often a central actor, have to a large extent distracted attention from the real problems which we now face.  The scale of the problem is so great and the time available to the Minister is so short that unless he can get stuck into those changes in a fundamental way all the powers which this Criminal Justice Bill will confer on the Garda and the courts will not be of any avail.</P>
    <P>Even in the past year we have seen the inexorable slide into greater and greater trouble and violence.  The Garda, who are closest to the problem, confess to a sense of frustration at the present time, a sense of despair in face of the growing and inexorable drift into anarchy and violence.  They see themselves frustrated and powerless unless the falling morale of the force can be lifted and undesirable practices within the force can be eliminated, unless there is an infusion of new managerial talent, unless the position of the Garda <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Department of Justice and day to day operations is clarified and unless a far greater role is given <Col N="245" /> to the Garda over their own affairs.  Most of all, they see this drift and hopelessness continuing unless the gardaí are given new organisational and managerial procedures and unless those are introduced as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In many ways we can be rather academic in talking about a Criminal Justice Bill.  We represent our constituents and we deal on a daily and weekly basis with the problems of crime and the breakdown of law and order in our society.  We all have certain views about how this should be done.  I believe there is a security crisis at the moment.  In that crisis I believe that the groups closest to the ground are those who in some way are best placed to know what is wrong and how it can be put right.  I am talking specifically about the two major Garda organisations.  They are the people who represent those on the ground.  I feel, after studying what they have been saying and talking to many of their members over the last month, that they are the people who are best placed to know what the real problems are and what is feasible.</P>
    <P>I accept as a starting point here that any professional organisation is largely concerned with the advancement and the welfare of its members.  I accept that there will be areas of self-interest in the guarding of one's own position, there will be internal politics and that the public interest may not always prevail.  After making those reservations, which are as true of the Garda organisations as they are of any other professional group, I ask the Minister to listen very carefully to what is being said in the present situation by the more thoughtful members of these organisations.  I believe there is a genuine and public spirited desire on the part of those two major organisations, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda representative Association, to have our police force organised as professionally, productively and effectively as possible, to see high standards in the police force and to see them maintained.</P>
    <P>This desire is not just one of aspiration and pious platitudes.  Each of those groups have made very specific, detailed, <Col N="246" /> constructive and radical proposals, and in each case, I regret to say, there has been little or no official response to what has been said.  Let me be specific on this. The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have produced plans for community policing.  These plans are radical but I believe they have been very carefully thought out and they attempt to get at the central problem of policing and security, that is, the relationship between the police and the community, something which is in very serious jeopardy in many of the urban areas where very often there is no real relationship of trust and support between the police and the community.</P>
    <P>I believe the community policing proposals attempt to involve the community with the Garda within the legal framework in the protection of the community. These proposals are imaginative but they come from a hard-headed, informed professional organisation who know what the problems are at first hand and who know what they are talking about.  I have heard those proposals discussed at meetings in my constituency.  There have been quite a number of meetings held on the question of law and order where the community proposals have been explained by senior members of the Garda and as they have been explained they have caught the imagination of many of the people who have heard them.</P>
    <P>I believe they would invoke a very strong and positive response if they were to be seriously discussed and put into effect.  I hope the Minister can assure me that I am wrong but I have not seen any strong official response to the community policing idea.  As far as I can see the response has not been enthusiastic.  It seems to me that it has been lukewarm, that the snags are more important than the virtues of the idea and there is little evidence of commitment.  I hope I am wrong but I have yet to see evidence that I am.</P>
    <P>The Garda Representative Body commissioned their own study some time ago at their own expense.  It was carried out by Howard Greer of the Irish Management Institute and contains 25 specific areas in which reforms can be made. Many of the reforms or the restructurings <Col N="247" /> are of major significance.  In the view of those who subscribed to the report they are changes which can help productivity in a significant way.  The Minister's Department have that report.  It is an excellent, thoughtful and tough report by a first-rate independent management consultant.  I ask the Garda Representative Association to make that report available to the public but most of all I should like to see from the Department of Justice a detailed and specific response to the proposals so that we would know if they were worthwhile in the view of the Department and what part of them could and should be implemented.  It would be unfortunate if there was no official response to what was a public spirited report.  There is no reason why we should agree with all or part of the report but it contains many useful ideas.  The worst that could happen is that there would be no response to the report or that it would not be discussed as a serious part of an ongoing discussion on the problem of policing here.</P>
    <P>The most relevant of all is the study commissioned by the Department and produced in 1976 by Stokes Kennedy Crowley.  I do not know what is in that report nor do many other people because successive Minister for Justice simply did not publish it.  This was an expensive report paid for out public money.  I suspect it was a good report and examined ways in which the Garda could be restructured and made more efficient. Yet it has been gathering dust for the past eight years.  Why has this been so? Were the recommendations in the report uncomfortable to the Department?  Was there an absence of political will to face up to the restructuring involved?  Is there an unwillingness on the part of the Department to face up to major reforms which might result in a lessening of the Department's control over the Garda?  Is there an unwillingness on the part of the Department to indulge in a full and open debate on these matters based on the view that the Department with their experience, expertise and undoubted record know best and that they have information which cannot easily be made <Col N="248" /> available to the general public?  That is a legitimate point of view and may well be at the back of the reluctance of the Department to go public on many issues. However, it is a mistaken view especially at a time when we are trying to move towards a more open system of running the country.</P>
    <P>Why is the Oireachtas not trusted in a matter of this kind?  Why is such a report not made available to the Oireachtas even in part so that its Members could be better informed when they launch into debate on matters of this kind and those which the Bill is trying to face up to?</P>
    <P>I am not hostile to the Department of Justice.  I am not indulging in a spate of Department bashing.  The Department of Justice has shown over a number of years that it has people at the top who are conscious of the highest standards and who have tried their best even in difficult times to see that the highest standards of integrity were maintained.  It is a very public spirited Department.  However, it has been too introspective and afraid to open up to full and open discussion.  Very often the point of view of the Department is correct and would benefit from being publicly aired and accepted.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to approach his Department as Pope John XXIII approached the Vatican Council &mdash; to open the windows in the Department, blow away some of the dust and allow the clear thinking fresh air to blow its way through the Department.  Certain rooms will have to be kept closed and that is understandable.  We should try to open up the Department and trust the public and the politicans a little more.  They are with him in trying to grapple with these problems.  I would ask if it is possible that the Stokes Kennedy Crowley report of 1976 be published in full or in part so that we might have some idea of the way in which the restructuring of the Garda will be brought about.</P>
    <P>I am making these points in a serious way because what I see happening to the police force worries me profoundly.  All the Criminal Justice Bills in the world will be irrelevant unless the Minister can resolve the central problems within the Garda Síochána which I have outlined.  It <Col N="249" /> is for this reason that I urge him to publish the report perhaps not as a prelude to action but as a basis for a full public debate which recent events have made so necessary.  It would also provide a context within which the Bill and its objectives may be discussed.</P>
    <P>The climate surrounding the police force and the Minister's Department are as important as the Bill.  Public confidence in the Garda must be restored and the gardaí must begin to believe in themselves and in their ability to do their work properly.  Major reforms in the Garda system which are so patiently necessary, which the Garda see as necessary and are prepared to support in full must be carried out quickly and with full public support. Unless this can be done and a new climate created the hopes of the Bill achieving its objectives are very much less than good.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  He is a good Minister for Justice who has won the support and confidence of all fair-minded people in a very short space of time.  In his year as Minister he has shown good judgment, toughness, character and commonsense. I am very pleased that he is the Minister handling this Bill because he has shown an openness to discuss the matter in a mature and fair-minded way. I know he will accept the strong worries I have expressed about what is happening in the police force in the spirit in which they are meant and that he is keen to initiate a debate which will achieve as quickly as possible the objectives of bringing our police force back to what it should always aspire to be and to the degree of organisation and efficiency which is desirable.  With the reservations I mentioned earlier I support the Bill and look forward to contributing on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important when discussing a measure such as this that we keep things in perspective.  Violent and criminal acts are nothing new.  They have been with us since time began.  That is not to make light of the present level of violent crime.  It is a very serious problem which we must solve if civilised society is to survive.  We have been given figures <Col N="250" /> recently which indicate that indictable offences increased from 38,000 in 1973 to 97,000 in 1982.  On average there has been an increase of 6,500 crimes per year. We must ask if that is that the full story. For many years crime was associated with cities and large built up areas but it has now spread to even the most far flung isolated areas.  There are cases of householders being kept occupied by travelling salesmen while some of their buddies are robbing from them.  When I hear of people coming to clinics and complaining about the closure of a Garda station, I wonder how many of them do not report minor crimes?  I am sure if those crimes were taken into account the statistics would be quite different.  The question might be asked if there has been a corresponding improvement in the control of violent crime when one considers the number of people in the Garda Síochána now and in the mid-1960s.  We cannot deny that there has been a change in society and we do not seem to have adjusted to that change.  When talking about young people who are engaged in crime we tend to think in a simplistic way about the matter: we say that teachers will deal with the educational aspect, the clergy with the religious aspect and the Garda Síochána will deal with law and order.  However, society is more complex and there is not a simple solution.  In the case of many young people who are engaged in crime there is a sad lack in parental control.  Many people like to have a second job to provide additional income but it is most important that the future of the children should not be jeopardised in any way because the parents are unable to give their children the necessary attention in their formative years.</P>
      <P>In view of faster means of communication and transport it is no longer reasonable to expect that the Garda Síochána on their own should be able to deal with crime.  Our way of living, how we handle our affairs and secure our property must be adjusted to meet the new situation.  I will put forward a few points under various headings for the consideration of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána must have available <Col N="251" /> modern equipment and technology in line with that available to police forces on the Continent.  It is the old story, namely, if you want men to do the job properly they must have the necessary tools.  A developed probation service for young offenders would ensure that our prisons do not become training schools for hardened criminals.  Liaison between the Garda Síochána and local organisations is necessary, particularly those organisations dealing with young people. Here I should like to compliment many young gardaí who came to my area on Border duty.  Many of them were very interested in and were associated with sport and the work they did in the various clubs was most valuable.  It was a great way to get in touch with young people.</P>
    <P>Property owners and house owners must make a greater effort to secure their property.  In addition, adequate security measures by banks, post offices and other financial institutions is necessary.  They have a responsibility in this matter.  There will have to be a restriction in the amount of cash payments by the wider use of cheques for wages and social welfare benefits. We have many banks and post offices, we have in operation the giro system, we have credit cards, bankers' cards and Diners' Club cards and it is sheer nonsense to have large sums of money in circulation.  If greater use were made of cheques we would reduce the number of robberies.</P>
    <P>We must accept that handling large amounts of cash is a risky business and we will have to adjust our approach accordingly.  The banks, insurance companies and the State by way of the post offices take less than an active interest in making provision against robberies.  It is only in the past few years that they have had anything other than an open counter system.  The measures they have taken are far from adequate, but I admit they have been an improvement.  Many people receive payments in cash although this is a hazardous business at the moment.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the opening hours of banks do not make them very satisfactory for many workers.  I think the banking hours should be changed in any <Col N="252" /> event to keep in line with the practice in Europe.  The annual returns of the banks show that they have substantial profits and they could spend some of this on providing more satisfactory opening hours for people, perhaps opening on Saturdays or having late openings on other days.  Banking hours were designed for conditions existing 20 or 30 years ago, but in view of the competition in the financial sector in all probability they will be forced into providing additional opening hours for the public.  I am not satisfied that the post office is fulfilling its role to the full but probably under the new system some changes will be made.  In Belgium the post office operates a giro system. Most people have an account with them and much cash handling is avoided. Many payments can be made without cash changing hands.  In Europe practically every farmer carries out his business by way of bank transfers.</P>
    <P>Car thefts are the cause of much concern. This is a further example of a lack of real effort by manufacturers and suppliers to provide vehicles that are reasonably safe from entry and theft.  Door locks even on very costly models are quite often a joke.  Very often they are useless. I am not sure which election it was because we have had so many of them over the last few years but there was an occasion when I was in a hotel in Castle-blayney and I gave a chap election literature and he went out and put it into the boot of a car.  Half an hour later when I went out he said the boot was empty.  I had given him the keys of my car and I began to wonder was it one of those occasions during elections when one sees literature disappear.  It turned out there were two cars parked together and he opened the other car with the keys of mine and put the literature into it.  Luckily enough the owner of the other car was a supporter.  That is just an illustration of what can happen.  I refuse to believe that it is not possible to make secure a car costing anything from £6,000 to £14,000. I think insurance companies should be required to give a worth-while reduction in premiums where a worth-while protective system is installed.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion <Col N="253" /> on the arming of the Garda.  For 60 years we have had an un-armed police force and I would be loath to see any full-scale arming of the garda.  One of the most disturbing features when one visits Northern Ireland is seeing the armed police there.  Possibly men for selected duties might require to be armed when dealing with certain problems but I would prefer to see the force in general continue the established tradition of enforcing the law without the necessity of carrying arms.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of talk about giving more powers to the Garda.  Some of it has been sensational.  Some of it has certainly not been helpful.  The Garda are human beings like ourselves.  They have the same failings or virtues of every other human being.  The Garda can only be fully effective if they have the goodwill of the people behind them.  Young and inexperienced gardaí are often relegated to Border duty.  The facilities provided in many of the stations are not what they should be.  I spoke about this matter as long back as ten years ago.  In Monaghan you have a station which was built at the beginning of the century and was designed to accommodate 14 personnel. Over the past few years there have been no fewer than approximately 100 serving gardaí in that headquarters.  The men should not have been sent to this area until such time as proper facilities had been provided for them.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years the pattern has been the closing down of many small stations throughout the country. They were replaced by the patrol car which was presumed to take the place of the uniformed man on the beat.  Nothing can replace the man on the beat.  The men serving in these local communities were highly dedicated.  They formed part of the community.  They had a role to play and they played it to the full. Actually they prevented crime.  We now have a situation where crime is increasing and so is drug abuse.  We should return to the successful pattern of the past and put the man back on the beat.</P>
    <P>The task force was reduced substantially in numbers, or so we are told.  I see <Col N="254" /> the Minister shaking his head.  I sincerely hope the task force will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything from the Rose of Tralee to stolen bicycles has been referred to in this debate.  The problem of law and order at the moment has heightened debate intensively about this Bill, about the general conduct of the Garda, their effectiveness, their detection level and the results generally achieved.  The general opinion is that the force has done an exceptionally good job down through the years.  In recent years unfortunately there have been ominous signs within certain sections of the public that all is not as well as it should be within the force.  There have been allegations of beatings by gardaí, of their over-use of force, of their over-stepping their authority, over-stepping the regulations under which they operate and, in some cases, bad publicity resulting from the actions of what must be a very small minority in the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis laid by different commissioners down though the years has been responsible in some degree for public opinion of the effectiveness of the force.  Some commissioners may feel the drug problem is a major priority to be tackled.  Others may feel that a drink-driving problem is a major priority to be tackled.  Others may feel that public relations, law and order, petty crimes should get priority.  Various commissioners have laid different degrees of emphasis on all these things.  It takes four years to qualify as a hairdresser, a plumber or a carpenter. It takes seven years to qualify as a doctor or an engineer.  Considering the very short time allotted for the training of a Garda and the enormous responsibility he is given, the question arises whether the training period is sufficiently long to equip him for the responsibility he may undertake when he leaves the training centre.  It is unfair to ask a young recruit, either man or woman, to go into a sometimes hostile environment or a very different environment and be expected to cope effectively with the kind of problems that arise in that environment, problems in many cases totally alien to the background, character and <Col N="255" /> upbringing of the particular Garda recruit.  The Minister must look at this.  I am sure in the recent discussions and in discussions before this with various representative Garda bodies, this matter has received appropriate consideration.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the Garda has been called in question recently.  It can be asked, I suppose, why the heroin problem has not been beaten in Dublin.  The gardaí concerned in this detection know who is involved in the racket and they have had opportunities to put away some of these people and they have done so effectively.  The problem, however, has not been licked and some may ask why greater resources cannot be used to do this type of work more successfully.  This is a growing city but a reasonably small one in world terms and while the drug problem is endemic in western Europe we should not be recognised as one of the fastest-growing heroin centres in the world.  This problem must be tackled once and for all.  Great strides have been made recently and I hope this will continue.</P>
    <P>This is a very complicated piece of legislation which has demanded from the Minister a sort of political tightrope-walking act in order to put before the people the fact that the rights and liberties of ordinary people can be safeguarded while at the same time giving the Garda the necessary facilities and legislation to combat serious crime effectively. I am not competent to deal in a legal sense with some of the details of the Bill but I want to make a few references to certain sections of the Bill.  The Minister has made it clear that it will be a superintendent or an officer above that rank who will assess the grounds proper for detention and that is as it should be. Regarding consecutive periods of detention, the Minister's commitment in his speech that if the Bill needed amendment he would amend it on Committee Stage, is watertight but I do not think the wording of the Bill is very clear in this regard. Does the single detention period relate to all offences, whether a person is charged or not, or does it relate to offences committed in a single incident? <Col N="256" /> Does it relate only to offences being concurrently investigated?  Under subsection 5 of the section dealing with consecutive detention, what is &ldquo;another such offence&rdquo;? Is it the same offence committed in another incident or another separate indictable offence carrying five years imprisonment?  We need clarification of this.</P>
    <P>The suspension of the detention period between midnight and 8 a.m. is also in the Bill.  The member-in-charge is not required to form an opinion as to the detained person's need for a rest nor need he or she take into account the physical or mental condition of the detained person. The words in the Bill, &ldquo;so as to afford the detained person a reasonable time to rest&rdquo; do not seem to confer any rights on the detained person and might as well be omitted if that is so.</P>
    <P>Regarding access to legal advice, is it in order for a detained person under a superintendent's investigation to ask for a solicitor to attend during the period of detention even for a short time?  Such a period could, in consultation with the solicitor or legal adviser, be taken out of the overall detention period.  Consultations if allowed would have to be of short duration.  In some cases they might be very necessary as, for instance, if the person detained and liable to be charged suffered from mental stress.</P>
    <P>Strip searches have been mentioned and this calls in question the rights of people and of the Garda to find evidence which might carry with it liability to being charged with an indictable offence. Under the Bill, at present the Garda can only carry out a search if they believe the person is carrying drugs or explosives. Does this mean that if a person is carrying a potential murder weapon, a murder weapon or sums of cash, that searches cannot be carried out?  The Bill does not appear to distinguish between strip searches and body searches.  Any form of intimate search should only be carried out in the presence of persons of the same sex as the detained person.  Body searches should be carried out by medically qualified people of the same sex as the detained person.  I am sure the Minister will spell that out in replying.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> Section 16 of the Bill regarding drawing of inferences from comments or statements made by a detained person should be withdrawn altogether.  It is possible for anybody of normal mental capacity, if there is such a thing, to forget to comment on something that might be important or is deemed to be important in the case.  Inferences drawn that might not be true or would be open to doubt should not be allowed as this might lead to public outcry or denigration of the Garda force. The section should be withdrawn.  The matter of ordinary language mentioned in the section also needs to be clarified. Does it take account of dialects and colloquialisms which some people use and their choice of adjectives in describing certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manning referred to the Watergate case in the context of tape recording and recalled the gaps in the transcript of the Nixon case.  Under the tape recording section in the Bill the person likely to be charged can be given a copy of the tape; one can be kept and sealed and one given to the legal adviser or some such person.  Does this mean the use of triple deck tape recorders recording three tapes simultaneously?  It is possible with electronics to insert matter in tapes or delete it without the sounds becoming apparent on the new tape. Electronics have reached a very sophisticated level.  If a tape recording is to be made, will it be done on a triple deck machine or on a single deck being subsequently re-recorded when sections might be erased or added?  Triple deck tape recorders should be used and if that is so does it mean these will be available in every Garda barracks or only where a chief superintendent has an office?  In that case, does it mean that a suspect would have to be carried quite a considerable distance to a centre of interrogation or investigation?  We do not want to set up a police state where we have a miniature Lubyanka in every superintendent's area.</P>
    <P>The practicality of tape recording of interviews with suspects and detainees must be clarified.  For example, in County Galway are there to be tape recording facilities with appropriate people to ask <Col N="258" /> questions in each Garda station, or each superintendent's station, or inspector's station?  If these people could be dangerous in one sense or another, what is the position about escorts for bringing them from the furthermost ends of the county and having trained personnel to deal with them?  It is fair to say that over the last six weeks there have been numerous power failures right across the western seaboard area, due to storms and so forth.  What is the position if the mechanics of the tape recording facilities break down, if the quality is not true, or the facilities are not sophisticated enough for audibility or emphasis?  If tape recording equipment is to be used, it must be the best and most sophisticated, so that there will be no doubt as to the quality and genuineness of the recording.</P>
    <P>The right to silence is a very serious matter which will be discussed in more depth on Committee Stage.  In the case of anybody brought to a Garda station and detained on the express advice of a superintendent, the superintendent must have reasonable knowledge that the person might have committed an indictable crime.  The detainees in many instances would probably have been trained to evade replying to questions.  There are innumerable cases of detained persons picking a spot on the ceiling at which they have looked for five or six hours and said nothing.  In many cases they have been highly trained to do just this.  Those of them who have been through the legal system know much more intimately than many lawyers how to use the law which has been to their advantage over the years.  What happens when a person just sits still and says nothing?</P>
    <P>The question of community policing has been raised on this Bill and references made to New York and the implementation of their community policing methods in a city like Dublin, Cork, Limerick or in major urban areas where crime is on the increase.  The experiments in this respect carried out by the Garda in the two areas of Thomastown in County Kilkenny and Claremorris in County Mayo have not been successful.  There is a basic flaw and a fundamental fault in implementing the policy in those two <Col N="259" /> areas.  The idea of community policing is to build up a relationship between the Garda force and the people whom they serve.  We must remember that gardaí are under pressure as people as well as guardians of the peace.  For instance, they cannot drink in a public house as any other citizen can, cannot walk down the street while on duty if not properly attired in uniform, cannot conduct themselves in many ways as the ordinary citizen does within the general lifestyle of the people of the district.  The fostering of good relations between the Garda and the local people is of vital importance.  If gardaí have not that full relationship and knowledge, they may fail to detect crime in many cases, or to know what is going wrong in the area, or to understand why people might take certain courses of action.</P>
    <P>When things were a lot quieter here and we did not have the present rampant crime, the presence of the Garda uniform was a deterrent to younger people who were not then exposed to the rubbish of the television programmes from other countries which might have led them on to be adventurous and re-enact television crime scenes.  One had then the physical and psychological deterrent of the presence of the Garda uniform to stop many young people from wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>The policing of the two areas mentioned is done by patrol car.  It is thus impossible to build up a genuine, enduring relationship with the people of the area.  A garda is responsible for the area which he serves, to his sergeant, his superintendent and so on up the line.  He is also responsible to the people of this district.  It is his duty to ensure, in so far as he can, that the law is observed within that area.  If he is brought out of that area into another district in a patrol car or van, as the case may be, he does not know the by-roads, the people or their background.  He does not know who has gone away, or has come to live in that area.  He loses interest and things can happen of which he is not aware.  A serious crime could go undetected for a considerable time because of this lack of knowledge and information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> Small villages and towns in Britain generally have an office manned by a clerical person or an assistant, which office is used for the taking of messages.  If there is an accident or a crime to be reported, it is communicated by radio to headquarters. As well as there being an open office for the public, there is one constable whose job it is to foster public relations with the people of that district, to know what is happening, who is living there, who has moved, who has gone away and come back.  That information is available through that police officer and with a small involvement of rota systems it is possible to have that information at hand all the year round.  Information about petty crimes and other matters generally transmitted to gardaí could be given to a clerical person who can be trained to be quite competent in passing on that information to the appropriate authority.</P>
    <P>With regard to community policing in Claremorris in particular, the radio system for contacting the Garda station has never worked, for instance in Shrule.  The second system in the small village of Kilmaine has worked only intermittently. What are the people to do who want to convey information, if the radio equipment never works?  There might not be a telephone kiosk near at hand and this creates difficulties.  If this project is to continue, the first thing that must be done is to ensure that communications between people and Garda barracks are sufficiently sophisticated to operate when needed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>One of the finer aspects is the increased mobility given to the Garda force.  Much better communications should be possible by the provision of reliable radio systems. However, increased mobility without the essential local information means a failure of the project.  Last year and the year before, a series of very serious crimes, court cases about which are still going on, took place in the Claremorris area.  Very many letters were sent to public representatives by people who were fearful as a result of murders and other serious crimes.  These people had not the physical presence of the Garda to reassure them, as had formerly been the case. In terms of the building up of community <Col N="261" /> relations, of fostering good relationships or understanding between the public and the Garda, something has to be done to revert to the presence on the ground, with the added facility of increased mobility and better communications.</P>
    <P>Car thefts have been mentioned.  These have increased on an enormous scale. Surely it is technically possible to devise a car, bearing in mind all the micro-computers, whizz kids and brains all around the world, that one cannot start or drive away without first undoing a combination lock-starter.  One can take out the plugs or points but people cannot go to that bother if they are dressed up for an occasion. But conventional locks can and will always be broken.  There is always somebody who can devise a system to beat that lock or perhaps physically smash the windows if needs be.  But the mechanism of starting engines and so on can be controlled in a most sophisticated manner.  I am sure such matters are being worked on.  Certainly, in view of the number of people around the country who have been killed by joy riders in the past decade, something needs to be done, if there is no way they can drive a car away in the first place, then there will be no way open to them to perpetrate such havoc and destruction.</P>
    <P>The general provisions of the Bill have been referred to.  The sad, tragic and unfortunate events which took place prior to Christmas have tended to highlight the implementation of its provisions and increase public awareness of what the Minister for Justice has on hands and also the kinds of powers and increased facilities the Garda are seeking.</P>
    <P>The Garda are not a perfect body. There has been a small minority over the years who have given them in general a bad name, something that disappoints me enormously.  The recruitment system to the Garda force is very sophisticated; but always there will be black sheep in every family, with a very small minority giving the Garda generally a bad name.</P>
    <P>I read an interview with the Commissioner of the Garda in a recent newspaper. It is my opinion that such interview should not have taken place until all of the evidence from the people concerned <Col N="262" /> in the Claremorris incident was in his hands.  If disciplinary measures must be taken, then they should be taken only after receiving all such evidence.  I do not know whether the Garda Representative Body have furnished a detailed report or whether the Commissioner is in possession of all the facts involved.  When the Minister gave his usual, highly competent performance in answering questions and giving the public clarification of these matters in a recent television interview, he referred to the 11 or 12 people of the task force who had been involved in that operation.  While such happenings are inexcusable and indefensible &mdash; and should never be allowed happen again &mdash; often people on the ground take a different interpretation.</P>
    <P>While I am not suggesting that the Minister is wrong, there were three cars involved in that incident.  Two of those had arrived at the scene or premises before the third.  I understand the force was comprised of two members of the present task force, three members of the old Special Branch as it used to be called, and one uniformed man who was then in plain clothes.  When the other car arrived on the scene the escapees had already got away.</P>
    <P>There appears to be confusion about this and I should like the Minister to clarify it when replying: would he state clearly whether the present Commissioner of the Garda has disbanded the task force?  If the task force is still in existence then some of its members do not appear to be aware of that fact.  If they are not in existence, are they supposed to be out after people who might steal, say, bags of turf, bicycles and so on?  It must be remembered that these people have been furnished with highly effective weapons and have undergone very intensive courses to do a specific job.  I want to know are they in existence or are they not, what exactly is their role and what facilities are available to them. If the Commissioner has disbanded the task force we, and the people in that task force, should be aware of that fact.  It should be remembered also that the kind of people with whom they have been dealing, who have brought such shame <Col N="263" /> on our country, are themselves very highly trained terrorists, in many cases people who have been dealing with the British armed forces in the North over the last decade.  Many of them have been abroad.  They are a highly disciplined military organisation who have shown themselves not afraid to shoot, kill and murder people in this country.  That kind of operation cannot be dealt with by people who are not equally highly trained or effective.  That is why a continuance of this task force, bringing them even more up-to-date with further refresher courses on the ground, as it were, is something that is most desirable.</P>
    <P>The Claremorris incident is one only of a series of such incidents which have come to light in recent times.  Action, in the sense of discipline, does not appear to have been taken in the Donegal, the Carrigtwohill or Enniscorthy incidents, but apparently is pending with regard to the Claremorris incident.  If all of the facts in relation to this matter are not in the hands of the Garda Commissioner then there is pressure placed on the members of the task force involved in that operation to submit a report, a report on which they feel they will be disciplined, whether that be right or wrong.  The Commissioner should have asked for every detail in relation to that incident from all of the people involved, interviewing them personally if necessary, and then decided what course of action should be taken. But merely to inform them that disciplinary measures are or may be pending places them under a certain amount of pressure.</P>
    <P>The general involvement of the task force, as I understand it, along with unarmed gardaí in relation to road blocks and other activities, is certainly up to standard.  This is exemplified by a recent happening on the main Dublin road on an evening after the Claremorris incident, when there was a road block set up of unarmed gardaí and task force personnel who stopped a car very late at night. That car, without actually stopping, sped off into the night.  It was subsequently flagged down and contained, not armed people, but people returning from a <Col N="264" /> dance, disco or party.  If the task force were to open fire on such a car, causing a death or deaths, without adhering to their regulations, certainly their action would be exposed by the media for lack of clarity in implementing the regulations and doing an extremely bad job.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the organisation of the Garda as a unit, and that of the Army as a military unit.  Certainly, when the Army were called into the woods of Ballinamore, they were able to move in and remaín there.  They are trained and equipped and have the facilities to ensure that they can remain for a month, six or eight weeks, if necessary.  That is their job and they understand it.  On the other hand, the Garda seem to have fallen down in some areas of organisation in relation to this incident.  I have spoken to Gardaí involved in that incident who spent anything from 17 to 20 hours on duty without receiving any proper sustenance or being changed on their roster. The Army organisation is different.  They can change and have their own rota system. They can have their own self-contained units within the area of each commandant. This calls into question the involvement of the Garda and Army in operations such as were carried out before Christmas.  There has been a lot of media coverage about those operations. The Ministers for Justice and Defence, and the appropriate organisations, should look seriously at the question of combining the use of the Army and the Garda in such operations with a view to greater effectiveness.  As the Minister pointed out, the man kidnapped was released without a ransom being paid and they were two of the main objectives of the operation.</P>
    <P>The involvment of the RUC and the British Army in the North in the last decade has not proved to be a successful operation.  We must take cognisance of that and of the relations that exist between those two forces.  I am sure the Minister will consider those matters in the coming months.  I would not like recent incidents to be forgotten without proposals emerging for better detection and greater effectiveness by the people on the ground.  One aspect of the television <Col N="265" /> programme that struck me was the &ldquo;no comment&rdquo; response given by many people when asked if they would give assistance or advice to the Garda if they were aware of any happenings in their area.  That is indicative of the politics of fear inherent in many sections of society as a result of recent happenings.  I am aware that some years ago a young man who had a verbal exchange with a seller of <i>An Phoblacht</i> was dragged from his bed at 3 o'clock in the morning and left in the local graveyard.  He was told he might be left there for eternity if he did not keep his thoughts to himself.  Until the Garda get the full co-operation of all citizens against such activities they will not be able to do their duty.  If there is a fear of reprisal against individuals or their families it is obvious that there is a need to do something.</P>
    <P>We have learned from recent incidents that there has been too much tacit acceptance of this type of carry on.  We have all learned that support in a romantic or fearful sense for such activities is at a higher level than was believed originally.  We must deplore that.  That matter was dealt with to some extent at sessions of the Forum for a New Ireland of which I am a member.  Indeed, the comments made by the Cardinal Primate last weekend in regard to the Forum are acceptable in so far as they indicated that confusion existed about the Catholic Hierarchy giving evidence in regard to security and the general relations between people from the North and the South.  He was ambivalent in his comments in regard to support for Sinn Féin and the policies they pursue.  One should understand that this is not a religious war.  These matters should be above ambiguity and it behoves everybody to be clear on where they stand in regard to these matters.</P>
    <P>In his first year in office the Minister dealt competently with a series of delicate and, in some cases, politically sensitive issues.  The Bill before us is a major piece of legislation that demands flexibility, courage, intelligence and an understanding of its consequences before its implementation. I have no doubt that the Minister will set up a Garda complaints tribunal in due course.  Many gardaí <Col N="266" /> would welcome the establishment of that tribunal because the public, in general, believe that gardaí can do things above the law without being subject to it.  The Garda would welcome this tribunal in order to clear their good name.</P>
    <P>We face in 1984 in terms of law and order and security many delicate issues. On Committee Stage we must deal competently with the provisions of the Bill. Our people must understand that the Garda, the Department of Justice, and the Government are willing to provide the necessary facilities in the interests of maintaining law and order.  Our people must help the Garda and deliver information in confidence that can be acted upon.  We have to get rid of the view that the Garda should be treated in the same way as the RIC were treated.  People did not give information to that force.  The Garda have a lot to do in terms of good public relations and establishing a good relationship with the people they serve. If that is done in conjunction with having legal provisions for the detection of crime we will be able to tackle the crime problem in a serious way.  If the people see criminals apprehended and put away that will do a lot to restore confidence in the Garda and the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>Some may hold the view that the Second Stage debate has gone on too long but we are discussing an important piece of legislation.  I should like to compliment the Minister who has remained in the House throughout the debate unlike some Ministers who do not stay here when the House is processing a major piece of legislation.  The important elements of the Bill have been highlighted and on Committee Stage we will deal with them.  Hopefully, some provisions will be amended at this stage.  We want to ensure that the provisions that are causing concern are either explained fully or altered.</P>
      <P>I support the principle of the Bill.  It has taken a long time to get this far but any Member who has read the contents of it will understand the reason for the delay.  It is a highly technical legislation with references and cross-references to other laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> I agree with the sections dealing with majority verdicts, the need to inform the prosecution in advance of an alibi, the failure to appear in court being made a new offence, the increase in penalties for firearms offences and the abolition of unsworn statements.  Such provisions are long overdue and are necessary in the fight against crime and vandalism here. I support the sections that deal with offences committed while on bail.  I agree with the view that sentences imposed for such offences should be consecutive to any sentences passed for a previous offence. The limit of 12 months on the aggregate term of imprisonment for consecutive sentences imposed by the District Court is to be increased to two years. Failure to surrender bail would be made an offence for which a consecutive sentence can be imposed <i>vis-à-vis</i> sentences for previous offences.  I strongly support the provision, which particularly affects the centre city area, which will increase penalties for thefts of motor cars.  The sentence now will be a fine of £2,000 or five years in prison.  The provision in relation to the receiving of stolen property is also to be welcomed.  Anybody who knows anything about crime, vandalism and lawlessness in this city will know that a few cute solicitors and a few smart thugs and vandals can manage totally to manipulate the existing law and abuse the system successfully.</P>

      <P>As I way saying, it is obvious that anyone closely associated with life in this city, as well as those acquainted with life in rural areas, will be aware of the way the present law is being totally manipulated by a few smart solicitors to get people off serious offences. People have been able to get away with the unauthorised taking of cars continually over the last five years in this city. It reached very high proportions and several thousands of cars were stolen.  It has reached a ridiculous stage.  The criminal now even helps the people whom he stole the cars from.  He burns out the cars in my area so that the owners can get the insurance, thereby putting up general insurance premiums.  The car parts are sold to back street garages, people who participate in the black economy.  This Bill will at least give the Garda an opportunity to tackle offences of that kind.  Up to the present the Garda have been made idiots of and anybody who tries to justify this does not understand the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say that when this Bill reaches its Fifth Stage &mdash; I cannot speak for the Fianna Fáil Party on this but I assume that when we discuss it at a party meeting this will be agreed &mdash; coincidental with it we will be discussing the Fifth Stage of legislation dealing with complaints procedure.  It would be wrong to <Col N="269" /> proceed otherwise.  In the original document issued with the Bill it was implied that there might not be legislation in regard to complaints procedure.  If so, I should be glad to hear from the Minister tomorrow, when he concludes this debate, what he proposes in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that we were told it had not been decided whether legislation would be necessary to establish complaints procedure or whether it would be introduced in the first instance as an administrative matter.  However, we were promised that both Houses would be given an opportunity to discuss complaints procedure before it was brought into effect.  I suggest that there must be legislation and that both Bills be decided together.  We could not expect the House to agree to pass a Bill to amend the criminal law while the Minister could by regulation or by administrative act introduce complaints procedure. That would be impossible and I have been told so by solicitors I have spoken to.</P>
    <P>I will put forward a few viewpoints on sections I regard as extremely dangerous. During an Adjournment Debate I gave statistics in regard to crime, vandalism and lawlessness in this city.  On a number of occasions I have highlighted that.  The Bill will help to solve many problems, but we must ensure that we will get a right balance so that we will not antagonise the community against the Garda by giving the latter tough powers.  The Garda do an extremely good job in so far as they can.  For years they have been crying out for legislation such as this.  This Bill gives them almost all the powers they require but they should implement the Bill without using unnecessary force, when force is necessary.  I disagree with some Deputies who think that the Garda can solve all problems without the use of force. That seems funny to me.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Deputies have spoken about the effects of section 3.  I share the concern of the Garda and the framers of the Bill in regard to the questioning of those who commit serious crimes.  The Garda have been complaining that their investigations are being hampered in some way. <Col N="270" /> In many city centre areas there is extra pressure by the Garda and this alienates communities in those areas.  The level of trust in the Garda is correspondingly low &mdash; it is just a &ldquo;we and they&rdquo; situation. Section 3 covers petty crime.  Some people may think there is no such thing as petty crime.  In deprived city centre areas it often becomes necessary for children to steal from shops.  I do not consider that as a very serious crime, though I accept it is crime.  They often do it for survival, through hunger or because they do not have money or because their parents do not look after them properly.</P>
    <P>Section 3 covers a vast array of offences, including misdemeanours, shoplifting, petty larceny.  If the Garda use heavy arm tactics against that kind of crime they will find it very difficult to get public support when they are dealing with more serious crimes.  That has been proved in relation to the Offences Against The State Act because only one out of every ten people detained has been convicted afterwards.  In those cases people were arrested on suspicion but in 90 per cent of the cases the authorities were wrong.  Powers of detention in these circumstances were only given previously in the Offences Against The State Act and they should not be given for inner city type minor thefts.  That is going a bit too far and the balance will have to be looked at.  If that is not done, though the Garda try hard, there will be further alienation.  They try hard to do their job but they do not have the support of the people.  I am speaking with wide experience of those areas and with the support of the clergy, social workers and community people who work in those areas.  I know the Minister has submissions on that.  It would be unfortunate if the House ignored the expertise of the people who know those areas.</P>
    <P>You cannot generalise on a Bill such as this.  Protection has to be built into Bills. Many people do not realise how much suppressed anger and resentment exist in some of those deprived areas.  It is another question whether it is justified.</P>
    <P>A section like section 3 could possibly break the camel's back, and this section has to be looked at very carefully.  At a <Col N="271" /> time when resentment and frustration are increased by a massive increase in unemployment this type of position can lead to an explosion.  There were a number of independent assessments following the Brixton and Toxteth riots in 1981.  The major reason for those riots was the alienation of the young people in those areas from the police force.  This can happen again without the police positively trying to aggravate the matter.</P>
    <P>The Garda have so many problems in those areas and they are called out so frequently that there is a tendency to beat it out of them rather than bring them in and question them like they do in an upper class area.  I suppose if I was a garda in some of those areas I would be inclined to do the same.  A garda in those areas can hit a fellow a few wallops for a minor crime and it is taken far better by young people than being brought in and interrogated as can be done under section 3 for the same offence.  Having spoken to many of those young people and their parents, I know they would accept a wallop far easier than they would accept being dragged down to Fitzgibbon Street, Mountjoy, Pearse Street or Store Street stations and interrogated.</P>
    <P>I believe the section should be amended.  One amendment which could be looked at is that the detaining garda should at least have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person detained has committed the offence.  The reasonable grounds and the crime suspected must be stated to the person being detained as well as to the station sergeant and not just to the gardaí.  The suspect must have the right to appeal this to an independent tribunal, which I am sure would be allowed under separate legislation but is not under this Bill.  The station sergeant would be held responsible in court for ensuring that the suspicions of the detaining garda are reasonably grounded and not just that he so thinks. He must explain himself.  I support also the tape recording of interviews.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 to 18 are the other sections there has been a lot of discussion about. I understand the position of the gardaí and the position of the drug squad who <Col N="272" /> pick somebody up, find a substantial sum of money on that person and cannot force that person to reveal where that money was obtained.  Legal experts have pointed out that the sections are extremely vague and undefined.  I am not a legal expert, but if they are vague and undefined they have to be very well teased out.  This party have at present under examination the type of amendments we will put forward to sections 15 to 18, which are basically about the right to silence.  Any person can be stopped, searched and required to account for anything in his possession.  The Garda in some areas have a hunch that a certain person may be involved in crime or helping to organise crime, but they may be wrong, so we have to be very careful on harassment. I believe the Garda have sufficient powers to do most of the other things they want without harassment.</P>
    <P>I am concerned mostly with my constituency where a lot of the people have not reached a sufficient level of education, tend to be backward and are ignorant of rights and wrongs.  At the same time there are others who are very well briefed.  A frightened, confused person who may have some psychological problems could be convicted on very weak circumstantial evidence because his confusion or disorientation may result in making statements or failure to make statements which are construed as corroborating some kind of evidence.  That is easy to understand in an area like Sherriff Street where there is a high level of crime.  If young people from that area are dragged in and questioned some of them would almost agree with anything. Others would not agree even if they were in the High Court.  People have a right to be protected.  I am afraid sections 15 to 18 will be taking away a lot of rights which I believe people are entitled to have.</P>
    <P>I believe that weak, vulnerable people could easily be dealt with unjustly by the law.  When you go into court and you have sharp solicitors and station sergeants there it is very difficult if a person is not properly defended.  Such a person can easily be convicted of crime while others can get off because they have a <Col N="273" /> good solicitor.  It is the job of the legal system to prove people guilty, given reasonable legislation to do that.  I believe if sections 15 to 18 are very severely amended they will not take anything away from the Bill.  Perhaps it might be important to leave the sections in for more serious crime because we are then up against the people who are very well briefed.  We are up against the criminal element who have legal advice before they go into crime.  We are talking about the major gangs and the major criminal activity in this city.  It would be terrible, having waited so long for a Criminal Justice Bill, if we ruined it by not creating the distinction between petty crime and minor larcenies and serious crimes like drug trafficking and major criminal gangs.  I believe a few amendments could clearly show the distinctions here.  I do not believe it would be very hard for any efficient draftsman with a good legal mind to come up with good amendments to sections 15 to 18 in order to do that.</P>
    <P>It has been said by some people who defend sections 15 to 18 that all it means is that in court the judge and jury are notified that a certain person left out something important in the initial stages of making a statement.  However, if it is a person's first time in a Garda station or if a person did nothing and was just hauled down to a station and faced with a few bulky looking customers asking him to make a statement, it can be very intimidating. They do not give tea in Garda stations, as anyone who ever tried to bail somebody out or help somebody knows well.  If one is used to being in a Garda station one can handle the situation. There have been some cases &mdash; I will not name them as they will be known to the Minister and his Department &mdash; where it has been alleged that prewritten confessions were found in Garda stations. Whether that can be substantiated or not is another matter, but even the thought that that could happen is enough to make people concerned.  If a person is nervous he may leave something out or he may accept something if he thinks it will make it easier for him.  That may be used against him afterwards.  Some people say it will not be used against him, but perhaps <Col N="274" /> it would.  If I was walking down the street, bundled into a black maria and ten minutes later was answering to a burly sergeant I would forget a lot of things.  I would even forget I was here today.  I do not go along with the fact that that can be used in court against a person.  I realise that this has to be thrashed out further. The criminal will still have his alibi because he will have thought out what he will say before he is brought in.</P>
    <P>I have said time and again that we must give a fairly tough Bill to the Garda to enable them to deal with the problem of law and order.  They must be allowed to use a certain amount of force and flexibility. At the same time we must protect the rights of the individual.  They are fundamental and human rights which could be taken away if this Bill went through unamended.  This party supports the Second Stage but the Minister can rest assured that it will be an active and lively Committee Stage.  What eventually goes through the House is extremely important.  I congratulate the Minister for eventually bringing the Bill into the House.  I plead with him to think of all sections of the community before it is passed.</P>
    <P>In spite of what was said by the last speaker community policing will be a major step forward in solving the problems in deprived areas where crime and vandalism are rampant.  The Garda are not popular in many areas.  Perhaps it is not their fault but it is in many areas where they were highly respected in times gone by.  If there is blame on one side there is also blame on the other.  There are many people willing to co-operate with the Garda and to build up the kind of relationship that once existed.  The Garda would know what was happening and get a better feedback, particularly in city areas.  The Garda have said that it may be easy enough in rural or suburban areas to have community policing but it would not be so in city areas.  If the Garda co-operate with community policing they will stop many of the tactics going on at present.  I will not refer to them but in my area and in others it is well known that the drug problem and drug pushers are on the decline not through any actions of <Col N="275" /> the Garda.  That is regrettable.  I predicted that a long time ago and was scourged for it, but if we do not have community policing and co-operation with the Garda they can be given ten Criminal Justice Bills and things will deteriorate.  If the Minister or the Commissioner think otherwise, they should think again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In evaluating any legislation such as this Bill, which is designed to alter the rules and regulations of our criminal law, there are three important concepts which have to be considered. The first and perhaps most fundamental and important of these is that society must be protected.  Any society that feels threatened by an element of lawlessness must and will react to ensure that law abiding citizens can go about their business and pleasure without fear.  When society feels that there is a threat to the safety of the individual or to property society will demand that steps be taken to curb the criminal activity of those who would endanger law abiding citizens or property.</P>
      <P>We heard the Minister when opening the debate outline the general background which led to the introduction of the provisions now before the House.  We heard of the rising incidence of crime, the amount of unsolved crime, the intolerable financial cost to the State as a result of crime and the cost to the Department of Defence in the provision of security and help to the Garda authorities, the loss of revenue from tourism and the increased need for concentration on deterrents and detection of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is abundantly clear to any right-minded citizen that the harsh reality in modern Ireland is that our laws are inadequate and further measures such as those contained in this Bill are urgently required to provide our citizens with the kind of protection they are entitled to and demand.  It is for us, the legislators, not just to react to the demands of society but to anticipate them and provide the laws necessary.  We must allay the fears of citizens and demonstrate to those of criminal intent that their activities will <Col N="276" /> not be tolerated by society.  If we are to fail in these basic functions as legislators it would be true to say we would have failed the society that elected us to perform this role.</P>
    <P>The second concept I would refer to is to ensure that our laws result in the apprehension and conviction of criminals. We all know that in many cases the Garda might be well aware of the perpetrators of a given crime.  However this knowledge does not satisfy the general principle I have mentioned.  What is required is a code of law which will ensure that the criminal is apprehended, brought to trial and in due course convicted.  I am mindful of the fact that in achieving this we cannot jeopardise the rights of the innocent.  Whatever the detractors of this Bill will say, one thing remains abundantly clear: in the ultimate analysis all those brought before our courts will be tried in accordance with the rules of law and evidence.  The judges are there to ensure that these rules are applied and to make sure those before the courts secure a fair trial.  To those detractors of this Bill I say that the fundamental precept of our criminal law remains unchanged, that is, a man is innocent until such time as he is proven guilty.  What we have in the Bill are provisions designed to ensure that the detection of crime is facilitated.</P>
    <P>The third concept is that those to whom the enforcement of law is entrusted, namely, the Garda Síochána, must have the necessary powers to assist them in their task.  Only by giving them such powers can the first two concepts be implemented. It is totally insufficient for people to say that society must be protected and that criminals must be apprehended. It is essential that powers be given to those people to whom the enforcement of our laws is entrusted. Sections 3 to 8 do not undermine the fundamental concept that a person is presumed innocent until he is proved guilty. Section 3 deals with the detention of an arrested person and it applies only to offences where the term of imprisonment and conviction is five years.  I suggest that the Bill should be amended to add the words &ldquo;or more&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;five years&rdquo; in subsection (1).  The powers of <Col N="277" /> detention contained in the Bill can apply only where the person has been arrested with reasonable cause.  The section then deals with details of the powers of detention. All of these matters will be viewed subsequently at the trial by the presiding judge.  These provisions do not give the Garda unlimited powers of detention and in addition, in the Bill there are sufficient clauses to ensure that the chances of the powers being abused are totally minimised.</P>
    <P>There are further safeguards in section 4 which outlines the rights of an arrested person to consult with a solicitor.  It is the duty of the member in charge of the Garda station to notify a named person of the place of detention of the accused and in the case of somebody under 17 years it is the duty of the Garda Síochána to notify the parent or guardian of the arrested person.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that sections 5 and 6 are necessary to aid the Garda Síochána in carrying out their functions.  Further, I am satisfied that safeguards contained in section 6 are adequate to protect the interests of law-abiding citizens.  Where a prosecution is not brought or where the accused person is acquitted, any of the records referred to in section 5 are to be destroyed and this can be witnessed by the person concerned or his solicitor.</P>
    <P>In section 8 there is adequate provision against an <i>ad hoc</i> re-arresting of an accused person.  Section 9 deals with a matter which has been the subject of comment on many occasions by the Judiciary. It is a matter that causes very much concern, namely, the high incidence of offences committed by people while out on bail on other offences.  It is a pointless exercise and an abuse of the indulgence of society if people who are out on bail use that time to commit crimes with impunity knowing that their sentence will be taken into account.  I welcome the provisions that have been made with regard to this matter.  What has been happening here is an intolerable abuse that must be eliminated.  The provisions in sections 9 to 15 are desirable and overdue. The legislators must take steps to ensure that people do not take advantage of technical matters to commit crimes or <Col N="278" /> withhold information from the proper authorities in connection with crimes.</P>
    <P>There are two other provisions which I welcome.  The first is contained in section 19.  This section provides that in the case of indictable offences the accused must produce notice giving particulars of an alibi which he wishes to adduce.  This is a fair and reasonable provision.  To date the accused in a criminal trial is forearmed with a book of evidence containing statements of witnesses to be brought against him.  I am glad this will not be interfered with as I think it is in accordance with fairness and justice. However, the situation prevailing to date in relation to alibis is patently unfair. There can be a situation where at the close of the State's case the accused can suddenly and without prior notice produce an alibi.  Why should the State not have the right in advance to investigate the alibi?  This would be a fair and natural development.</P>
    <P>There should be a radical overhaul of the licensing and registration of vehicles. Every serious crime involves transport. If we had a proper system of identifying the owners of vehicles the use of such vehicles in crime would lead quickly to finding the culprits.  Such a system was put forward in the 1982 <i>Garda Review</i> by Inspector Ryan of Cork and the Minister should pursue this point.</P>
    <P>There are also many vagrant itinerants and persons from across the Border driving uninsured cars here and nothing can be done about them.  If a garda stops one of the cars the person concerned has ten days in which to produce his licence and insurance but the vagrant has disappeared long before then.  Some changes are needed here.  I welcome the provisions in section 24 which provides for majority verdicts in certains cases and under certain conditions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am satisfied that there are inherent safeguards in it.  Given the basic precepts of criminal law and having regard to the provisions in our Constitution, this Bill will provide a reasonable hope of a safer existence for law-abiding citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss. M. Barry Miss. M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss. M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome <Col N="279" /> the provisions in the Bill.  We are all very concerned at the high level of crime and this is a step forward in dealing with the matter.  The number of Deputies who have spoken on the Bill is an indication of the level of interest and the concern that exists with regard to the high level of crime.  In my view it has been one of the most-talked about Bills since I became a Member of this House.</P>
      <P>As we introduce various measures to deal with crime I have often asked myself if we are only scratching the surface.  I wonder if we are prepared to look at the root problem.  Until we do this we will only find patchwork solutions to the problem of crime in our society.  There is need for research into the cause of crime and, unless there is such research, any solution designed to combat crime will be a half-baked solution.  Money spent on research would be money well spent to discover the root cause of crime.  Properly carried out surveys would give us clear indications of the causes of crime and, having carried out adequate research and properly designed surveys, we would be properly equipped to deal with crime.</P>
      <P>Many speakers have dealt with the contents of the Bill.  Before I do so I should like to go into the reasons which are the causation of crime.  I believe bad law causes crime.  There are many laws which in effect lead both young and old into criminal situations.  There are many laws which could be introduced that would prevent or prohibit crime.  That is our responsibility and we should repeal much of our existing legislation and introduce legislation to suit our particular social structure.  We have a habit of copying British law.  I think that is deplorable.  An example of that is the Unfair Dismissals Act.  There is a great deal to be learned from other countries and from Britain. We could well garner ideas and opinions from these.  Unfortunately we do not look at British law to see how it was enacted and learn from their experience.  Up-to-date research would improve our laws and would save amending our laws at later stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Law should be adapted to the Irish situation.  There are loopholes in the law <Col N="280" /> which seem to favour the rich.  This is very demoralising, particularly for our young people.  An example of such loop holes is the case of Pat O'Connor in the February election of 1982.  Many young people around the country were summoned for double voting and they were convicted.  Pat O'Connor had the financial resources to take a case to the High Court and, while he was summoned for double voting and it was acknowledged he had two ballot papers, there was no evidence to bear that out.  If young people see this kind of inconsistency one cannot blame them for growing cynical and bitter. The lack of consistency in our courts has been very disheartening and saddening. I can see no consistency at all in reported cases.  It is of vital importance that we have a system of law and order which is just, and when I say &ldquo;just&rdquo; I mean laws designed for the greatest good of the greatest number.  It must be consistent because if the punishment does not fit the crime one cannot expect consistency and good standards in society generally.  It is imperative that penalties should reflect the seriousness of the crime.  That is not the case at the moment. We all know of instances where a relatively minor crime met with a huge penalty while what we would regard as a major crime met with a minor penalty. We all have knowledge of these incidents.</P>
    <P>One British law which would be useful is the law relating to the rehabilitation of offenders which was passed in 1974.  If one commits a crime one is given a rehabilitation period and once that period is successfully negotiated one gets a clean sheet.  If one is sentenced to six months or more imprisonment one is given a rehabilitation period of ten years.  If one does not commit an offence during that period one is no longer labelled with the original offence.  Now I know of a case in the Ceann Comhairle's part of the country where 20 years ago a young lad was accused of stealing a chicken.  He was summoned to court but was found not guilty.  A few months ago he went about setting up an auctioneering business but the superintendent had to give his court record.  The result may be a delay in the <Col N="281" /> whole process.  It is wrong that people should carry with them a minor offence committed 20 or 30 years previously.  The worst aspect in this case is the fact that the young man did not commit the crime. If the rehabilitation to which I referred were introduced here that would give hope to young people.  That would be a welcome introduction into our laws.  It is a good concept and it should help in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>The law also needs to be updated where car theft is concerned.  An ever-increasing number of cars are being stolen, particularly in the Dublin area. There were only 40 people accused of theft last year for actually stealing cars. I understand that when one steals a car one has to change the number plate before one can be convicted of stealing. Under some other measure you can be taken to court but the penalties are very small and very varied.  I come back to the point that the penalty should match the crime.  If the present situation continues people will begin to lack confidence in the system and we shall find ourselves in very dire straits indeed.</P>
    <P>The legal profession should come together and put their own house in order.  Surely it should be possible for them to come to agreement in the application of similar sentences for similar crimes.  In all other professions there is consistency in decision.  Doctors, nurses, politicians, auctioneers and so on can meet together and adopt a consistent policy. If sentencing in our courts appears inconsistent, as it often is, then we are fighting a losing battle.  It is the last straw in a democratic State.</P>
    <P>I believe the general lowering of standards in society is another cause contributing to increased crime.  Formerly, when a crime was committed people co-operated with the Garda in their detection efforts.  Now life has become so materialistic, selfish and personal that each one merely looks after himself.  The community has become less homogeneous and standards generally are declining.  In the fight against crime I am certain we need general improvement in standards in society.  Once I asked a detective involved in the Cork drug squad to <Col N="282" /> account for the increase in crime.  He said that one of the most obvious reasons to him was the lowering of standards in high places.  When young people see people in high places carrying on in such a way they say: &ldquo;Why not I?&rdquo; That situation must be changed if we are to cope with rising crime.  The community spirit which was a great protection against crime has disintegrated because we have moved to a much more urban society.  Dublin has expanded rapidly and many country people coming to live in Dublin do not know their next-door neighbours or anybody near them and this seems to lead to indifference and an increase in the crime rate.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has grave consequences for society and it is time to tackle the problem head on.  It will not go away. It is useless for politicians to declare that their aim is full employment in the future. It is unrealistic.  Because of world trends less and less work will become available. Due to new technology and mechanisation, computers, micro chips and so on, fewer jobs will be available.  We shall have to share the work of the nation among the people of the nation.  We have been accustomed to the work ethic and regard it as part of our tradition and our life.  Our self-esteem is closely linked with our jobs.  People lose their self-esteem if they lose their jobs.  In despair, they look for some sort of kick out of life and that often involves some form of crime.  The devil finds work for idle hands.  If we fail to deal with unemployment we can only expect an increase in crime.  Many people feel bitter and think the State owes then a job.  To work is a basic human right and naturally people without work become resentful of those with property and big cars and so on, things which are unattainable to themselves.  Much crime in poorer areas is against property, not people, according to research information &mdash; people taking out their frustration and aggression on property which they know they can never own themselves.  They regard people with property rather as an enemy.</P>
    <P>The challenge of poverty is always there, in recession or out of it, and we should always endeavour to come to grips <Col N="283" /> with unequal distribution of wealth in our society.  That inequality produces problems on other levels.  Another reason adduced for the increased crime rate, and one to which we pay little attention in Ireland is the portrayal of violence in the media particularly on television and videos.  In many cases, even in this country, children witnessing violence on television attempt to emulate it.  I have known instances of it myself.  A recent case occurred on the day of the Hanging Bill in the British House of Commons. There was also a programme on television and a young lad of nine or ten, having heard in detail a programme on television that morning dealing with the proper way to hang and having seen a film of it, later did away with himself really in a sense of play.</P>
    <P>Many programmes here do not do justice to the Garda Síochána.  They often present the criminal as the hero.  We cannot be ambiguous about our attitude to crime; one cannot be a hero and a criminal at the same time.  Such double standards cause a general lowering of standards. We should present a more positive theme in a positive light such as the good work being done by the Garda.  A weekly programme listing a lot of information is not sufficient.  Young people particularly get a kick out of seeing something done that they have not seen done before.  In 1978 when there was a television strike in Britain, one day at the height of the campaign one of the trade union members was flashed on television for a couple of seconds and this strike gathered momentum and great public support as a result. Our underlying attitude as presented in the media is very important and we should monitor and guard it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am availing of this, my first opportunity of expressing the grave concern and disappointment which the Government feel at the development in Cork yesterday. We have all recognised that there are special problems in the assembly industry here as a result of the protective regime which existed in regard to motor assembly, as agreed at the time when we entered the European Community, being due to terminate at the end of this year. Regrettably, this is accompanied by the fact that, as a result of the very long recession &mdash; the longest that we have experienced in Europe since the last war &mdash; the demand for the motor industry products has declined rather dramatically in Europe and, in particular, European based manufacturers have lost a share of a diminished market to imports from new sources of motor cars manufacture which were almost unheard of in the European market 15 years ago.  We have, indeed, a combination of three factors causing problems in the motor industry in Cork. The first is the end of the special regime in regard to assembly; second, the general decline in the motor industry market in Europe as a result of the general recession; and, third, the increased share of that market being won by imports from outside the Community.  This has resulted throughout Europe in numbers of redundancies.  Indeed, I should mention a fourth factor which is increased automation and robotisation of the motor manufacturing industry.  It is one industry that, because of its assembly line, standard and uniform nature, has been particularly prone to the adoption of cost reducing and employment reducing robotic methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, the scale of production in Cork &mdash; about 15,000 units per annum &mdash; is very small by comparison with that of more modern plants in the Ford network where 40 million units per annum is the production level.  This smallness adds to the cost factors and puts the Cork plant at a disadvantage. Further, while it is important that these overall factors affecting the motor industry <Col N="285" /> should be fully understood by everyone involved in this debate, there is no point in starting from a standpoint which ignores the fundamental realities of the market place, which is where all industrial decisions ultimately are made.</P>
    <P>We must also realise that there is a real possibility that we can adapt to face the situation.  This has been the intention of all recent Governments in their dealings with the motor industry here and, in particular, with the motor assembly industry. In return for concessions with regard to the importation of fully built-up vehicles negotiations were entered into with various motor importers and manufacturers whereby they shifted their manufacturing from motor vehicle assembly, which had apparently a limited life, into component manufacture.  One particularly good example of this is that of General Motors who have established a very successful enterprise employing in Tallaght as many, 800, as have been told that they will lose their jobs in Fords. That is an example of what we would be hoping would be possible for Fords to do. Indeed, there are few firms of whom we would have in the normal course of events as high hopes as we would of Fords, because of their very long association with this country and, in particular, with the city of Cork.</P>
    <P>It is with a view to persuading Fords to make such a long-term, viable and &mdash; for them &mdash; profitable commitment to an alternative manufacturing facility in Cork that we have been bending all our efforts in recent times.  There have been two meetings between my Minister of State, Deputy Collins, and the Ford Company in recent months.  There have been numerous contacts between the IDA and Fords, including approaches to Fords even since Christmas by the IDA, with a view to getting them to bring forward proposals.  Ultimately, we must recognise that a proposal for an alternative industry is best devised by Fords themselves, because they are the people who have the necessary expertise in the market place. They know what components are saleable and it is with a view to getting them to bring forward such a proposal that all these meetings and discussions have <Col N="286" /> taken place.  Indeed, the negotiations which took place with Fords with regard to the importation of the Telstar motor vehicle were specifically guided by the Government's anxiety to get the company to make a commitment to an alternative manufacturing facility in Cork which, regrettably, they have not yet been in a position to make.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the Government and I have been seeking since last month discussions with Fords at the highest level with a view to promoting this case.  I am very hopeful that this debate, which is very timely and has been arranged quickly, will afford an opportunity to demonstrate the extent of the commitment of all sides of this House and to convey the message to the Ford Motor Company that we believe that we can provide them with a profitable opportunity in Ireland.  Clearly, we must also convey to them the grave social concern which is felt as a result of the consequence of the decision.  However, that in itself is clearly not enough.  We must also be able to convey to them the view that, if they make the necessary commitment to Cork, they will be able to do so in such a way as will be profitable for them.  We can convey to them the fact that we offer in this country unrivalled facilities for foreign investment.</P>
    <P>This has been recognised by the fact that more US investment in Europe comes to Ireland than to any other location on the Continent of Europe.  All of those American firms that have invested in Ireland, giving very large numbers of jobs, cannot be wrong.  It is clear that the company which was almost the first American one to lead the way, in 1917, in United States investment in Ireland should continue to do, as so many other American companies are doing to their profit and should invest in a suitable modern, profitable project in Cork.  I should add also that the Industrial Development Authority, who have had contacts with Ford at European management level as well as here in Ireland, have done a considerable amount of work in recent months in identifying precisely the type of project in which Ford can profitably engage in Ireland.  I believe that the <Col N="287" /> information and facts that have been put before Ford, and can be put before them in even greater detail by the IDA, will represent a profitable opportunity for Ford and a prospect for the people of Cork, so that this important firm can continue to be active in that part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I recognise, as has been pointed out by a number of Deputies in private discussions I have had with them, that this closure has implications for many other firms as well who supply components of one sort or another to Ford.  At the suggestion of some of the people with whom I have had discussions, I am asking the IDA to undertake an immediate study, not just of the Ford situation, but also of the position of all of those companies, some of them not even in Cork, who will be very directly affected as to their viability by the decision of the Ford company. Probably this is something that has to be done anyway.  Even if Ford succeed in identifying another project, it may not be one that would require exactly the same mix of Irish components as is at present used by that company.</P>
    <P>I have indicated also, and Members will have heard the Taoiseach describe, the emergency action that the Government have taken in regard to the overall employment situation in Cork.  I do not propose to dwell on that at this time.  But we do recognise that the two blows that Cork have suffered, in the form of this announcement and the closure of Dunlops, present a very serious employment situation in that city and one which we must do all in our power to recognise. However, I say that the message we must give the people of Cork must be one of confidence, that they must have confidence in themselves, in their ability to overcome their problems.  There is a clear realisation that in the final analysis the industrial success of this country depends on the enterprise, risk-taking and initiative of Irish people rather than on anyone else in any other part of the world.  If there is anything needed in this country it is to continually build people's confidence in their ability to overcome their problems.  That is the reason so much <Col N="288" /> emphasis is being placed on industrial development programmes by the IDA on enterprise development, on enterprise centres, on programmes to encourage people to set up new Irish industry on their own initiative, using their skills in a risk-taking entrepreneurial way rather than in seeking safe and not necessarily quite so creative employment.</P>
    <P>While I hope we shall continue to seek solutions for our problem and continue to seek industry from abroad, we shall not neglect the great possibilities existing in our people, in particular in the city of Cork, for the solution of our own employment problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>We may all have different approaches to the problems now obtaining in Cork.  I shall not use this sad event as a political occasion.  The people of Cork and the country generally, I have no doubt, were saddened by the announcement of the closure of the Ford factory in Cork.  Cork has already suffered many disappointments in the closure of many of its traditional industries. A package in terms of attractive redundancy payments to the workers involved is of little consolation to them.  I would ask: what about the future of their families and that of the many thousands of young people seeking employment? Each industry that closes lessens the opportunity of employment for the thousands of young people in both the city and county of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us of a number of options open to him, that efforts have been made to try to save this plant.  The Minister knows as well as anybody else in this House that the trouble in Fords had been there for quite some time.  We were all aware of the problems confronting that great, viable industry of ours. But because of this recession they find themselves in trouble.  It is only natural for any Government, knowing of this, to move in at the very early stages of the problem.  The Minister mentioned the Ford company a number of times this evening.  In this respect we must seek clarification.  Cork has maintained the only name associated with the company known throughout the world &mdash; Fords <Col N="289" /> and Son of Cork; every other Ford plant throughout Europe bears the country name after the name of the company, such as Ford (Belgium) and so on.  The company here was founded in memory of a Cork man.  Surely we are entitled to make our plea not just to the Ford company. Here I must assume the Minister is talking about the Ford management in Cork.  The Ford management in Cork represents working management dictated to from America.  Let us get this very straight &mdash; and the Minister of State now present knows this also &mdash; there is no point in the Cork management appealing to America that we go into mass production of another component without the support and backing of both the Government and the IDA.  We should be honest about this.  When the warning bells were sounded the Taoiseach, and the Minister responsible, should have gone to the United States where policy in regard to Ford plants is dictated.  I would have gone to the United States to meet influential people like the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill, Senator Edward Kennedy and others and urged them to use their influence to save Cork's great industry.</P>
    <P>The fight is on to save Fords of Cork. I understand that the trade unions decided today against a closure.  We have heard too much talk about attractive redundancy payments.  We must keep in mind the future of the people of that city and the prospects for the many young people.  Many of the workers have families and they are concerned about their prospects of getting alternative employment. Corkmen can be forgiven if they become emotional about this issue.  I was disappointed to hear the Taoiseach say today in the course of his statement that he was establishing a small high level expert working group to advise the Government urgently on the impact of the measures already taken to provide jobs in the Cork area.  Unfortunately, I did not get an opportunity to question the Taoiseach on that statement.  The only experts needed are sitting in this House, the Members who represent Cork.  We could with 30 minutes' notice inform the Government, and the House, <Col N="290" /> of the needs of Cork and where employment can be got.  We heard a similar statement when the Dunlop factory folded up.  What has happened since?  We have lost other traditional industries.  In Fords, and throughout the county, people are wondering what industry will suffer next.  Surely there is an early warning system?  When the warning bells are sounded the Government should step in to help an industry over a lean period. The Government should help industries that over the years have proved viable and given good employment.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that while the experts sent by the Government are running around the city and county investigating the employment position other traditional industries will be folding up.  The public representatives are the experts, irrespective of the party they represent. They know what is happening because they have to deal with problems in that area on a daily basis.  The Government should not confine their thoughts to Fords of Cork because, as they are aware, all decisions in regard to that factory are made in America.  There is little point in saying that we should try to find a way to produce components.  The Minister, and the Minister of State, must be aware that any decision to mass produce a component at a plant in Europe is taken in America.  I appeal to the Government to direct all their efforts at the United States parent company.  The Cork factory was founded by Henry Ford, a Corkman, and it has well established links with the United States.  Any reference to Ford meant the Ford factory in Cork.  We will not lose this industry without a fight.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the other Cork public representatives that we consider going to the United States to meet the influential people there in an effort to have this decision changed.  We must face up to our responsibilities and highlight the fact that the decision to close the Cork factory was taken in America.  All Ford plants throughout Europe are subject to directives from America.  The Minister should have elaborated on his suggestion about production.  There is no doubt that the work force in Cork is excellent.  They are dedicated, like all Cork people, and have <Col N="291" /> supported Ford products down the years. We are not talking about the loss of 800 jobs only.  We must bear in mind that the industries manufacturing the car components will suffer also and the ESB will lose a tremendous amount of revenue if the factory is closed.  There is no question of the workers being satisfied with redundancy payments.  We will not wait for the final curtain to fall on Cork.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what efforts are being made to reopen the tyre making industry in Cork.  What efforts are being made to utilise the machinery that is rotting in Dunlops?  I am sure the Minister is aware that many of the Dunlop workers are prepared to establish small industries if they are given the machinery in the Dunlop factory.  I asked the Minister for Labour to investigate this.  I am aware that one group in Cork city approached the IDA, after carrying out extensive research, with a view to setting up an industry.  That group have made an appeal for the release of some of the machinery in the Dunlop factory.  If I was a member of the Government I would purchase that machinery and hand it over to those people who have the incentive and ambition to establish a small industry.</P>
    <P>Deputies Coveney, Allen, Desmond, O'Sullivan, and the other Cork representatives are the experts as far as Cork is concerned.  If we were given 30 minutes we could outline the problems of Cork and save the Government a lot of money. There is little point in sending outsiders to the city to carry out a survey while industries are closing down rapidly.  I should like to sound a warning that we will not allow the Ford factory to close without a fight.  That fight must be centred in the United States.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision taken to cease production at Fords of Cork was one of the saddest and most devastating ever announced.  The Ford motor company for 70 years was the flagship of Cork industry and the principal private sector employer for longer than most of us can remember.  It has an exceptional place in the industrial life of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> On behalf of the people who are looking desperately to this House this evening I ask for an all-party approach, that we will not indulge in recrimination about what one Government or another might or might not have done in the past.  We are all very wise in hindsight.  One could argue forever that one Government or another throughout the years might have done this or that.  That will not do anything for Fords or for Cork, particularly for the workers who depend on Fords. Therefore, I hope we will address ourselves this evening to the kind of proposals we can initiate.  In this debate there is no use holding out the prospect that we will automatically turn this thing around. We are up against it.  Fords would not have made such a devastating decisive statement if they had not made up their minds, and we now have the job of trying to change the minds of people who do not lightly take decisions and then reverse them.</P>
    <P>Though I accept what Deputy Wyse said, that we must fight, and we will, it will be a tough fight and we should not tonight raise expectations that it will be a matter of the Government twisting the arm of Fords.  If that has to be done this Government will do it, but the outcome cannot be guaranteed and we should not pretend that it can be.</P>
    <P>First of all, I take issue with Opposition Deputies who spoke about the statement of the Taoiseach.  Bearing in mind that that statement was issued less than 24 hours after the announcement, it contains a number of positive suggestions, the first being that the Ministers for Industry and Foreign Affairs are seeking a meeting with Fords in Detroit and are prepared to travel out there as soon as possible to meet the company at the highest level.  That is where the ultimate decision lies.  I hope they will be on their way in the next few days and that they will bring back the bacon.  In the Taoiseach's statement there is a clear invitation to Fords to sit down to discuss the options open to try to keep those jobs in Cork.  I hope Fords will respond positively to that invitation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also spoke of the creation of two special task forces and a high <Col N="293" /> level special working group to advise the Government not only on the question of Fords but on the wider issue of job creation in Cork.  I welcome that.  I agree to a certain extent with Deputy Wyse that Cork Deputies can supply the answers, and I hope and believe that the Taoiseach and the Government will listen to what Deputies from both sides from Cork have been saying.  Of course we are experts to a certain extent, but certainly we are expert in regard to knowing what the people of Cork want, and we will all be lobbying for any assistance the Government can give in difficult financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said we are not asking Fords to do anything more than to create a viable profitable business for themselves, and if General Motors can substitute for their car manufacturing business a major component manufacturing operation in Ireland with 100 jobs, I do not think it is beyond the ability of their greatest competitor, Fords, to do likewise. That is what we are seeking and that is what the IDA and the Government should be trying to work out as quickly as possible.  I hope Fords will co-operate in every way.  Indeed in the statement which Mr. Paddy Hayes made there is a small glimmer of hope.  He said there is always the possibility that a reasonable proposal could come from some other source.</P>
    <P>That is a ray of hope which we must pursue, and I ask the Taoiseach to consider raising the issue at another level. The main level must be discussion between the Minister for Industry, Fords and the IDA, preferably Fords in America. However, there is another dimension to this.  It is the relationship between this country and the US.  We are not just two any old countries: we are two countries that have ties which are unparalleled and unequalled.  In the US there are 40 million ethnic Irish, ten times the population of the mother country.  If we do not have in them a strong lobbying force for Ireland there is something wrong with us.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach, through our various diplomatic channels, particularly through the Washington administration, to get across the message that 800 jobs in <Col N="294" /> Cork are not the same as 800 jobs in Detroit.  During the recession the American car industry has shed thousands and thousands of jobs.  It is easy, if one is sitting in Detroit on top of a major international company, to think of 800 jobs as a relatively minor affair.  It is important that we get across to them that this is not a minor affair for us, that this is a catastrophe for the city of Cork and for the country.  It is up to us, and the Taoiseach in particular, to get that message across through all the agencies at our disposal.</P>
    <P>There are other fora as well.  There has been a recent development, not much spoken of in Ireland, the setting up of a group called Friends of Ireland, composed of Congressmen and Senators in Washington, drawn from every State in the US.  They are people who have a particular interest in Irish affairs and who are only too anxious to do something for Ireland.  To some extent they were set up to counterbalance some of the US organisations who are trying to help Ireland in different ways with which we disagree strongly.  I refer to organisations like Noraid.  Friends of Ireland are a moderate political group.  They are there to help and it is up to us to lobby them.  There is now in this House a parallel organisation, The Irish-US Parliamentary Group.  That all-party group should make contact quickly and speak to that group in Washington who could bring pressure to bear, because those Senators and Congressmen bear household names in the US. This is an election year; the US President bears a noble Irish name, and I do not believe that the American political system will be unresponsive to the prospects of 40 million ethnic Irish votes.  I believe there would be a positive response to a united call from this House, from all parties, to do something in regard to Fords for the benefit of the people of Cork and Ireland.</P>
    <P>This debate enables us to refer to other problems in Cork.  I and other Deputies would invite the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Industry to Cork during the coming weeks to meet the trade unions, the employers and a variety of other groups to listen and to find out at first hand the feelings of the people <Col N="295" /> there and the opportunities which exist there.  Cork, despite our high unemployment, is still a great area of opportunity with great natural resources and great people.  They should acquaint themselves with the situation at first hand, not just from advisers but on a personal basis, to get a feeling for the problems of this region which is so devastated and well above the national average in relation to unemployment.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things which could be done which even in these difficult financial times would not cost an unacceptable amount.  I am aware of a live proposal to provide a ferry link to the UK by a combination of Irish Continental Lines, Cork Harbour Commissioners and the Swansea Port and Docks Board.  I understand that all three are prepared to participate in a financial way in a joint venture to run a summer service as a minimum between Cork and Swansea. The Government must give approval to that proposal.  I hope the Minister will look sympathetically at that and that the announcement will be made early rather than late.  Last year the announcement was made so late that it was very difficult to get bookings.  There is widespread agreement among the Cork Deputies about the question of the deep water berth.  This is essential not only for the attraction of industry but also for the maintenance of Cork Harbour as the most important port in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving him all the encouragement I can.  If ever Cork needed a shot in the arm it needs it now and I hope the Cabinet will decide to support that venture this year.  Deputy Gene Fitzgerald referred to the low river crossing today.  Obviously the money is not available for that at the moment but a step could be taken in relation to a bridge order.  I ask the Minister to give an undertaking that the bridge order is made as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are a number of positive things which I hope the Government will be <Col N="296" /> able to do within their limited resources in the coming weeks, because we need all the assistance we can get in Cork.  It is often said that the greatest problems often present us with the greatest opportunities. If this disastrous day brings us all together for the good of the Cork region, then so much the better.  I hope we can get over this disastrous decision together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1980 the managing director of Henry Ford stated:</P>
      <P>We plan to continue car assembly after 1984 irrespective of what our competitors do.  We are now here for 63 years and we intend to be here after 1983.</P>
      <P>The managing director in his statement yesterday said:</P>
      <P>You are all aware that there has been a great deal of speculation over recent months concerning the future of the Cork assembly plant because virtually all our automotive competitors have ceased car assembly in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's address today when he expressed his profound regret and surprise at the closure announcement because of the hardship this decision will create for so many families in Cork and the damage which the loss of so much employment will cause to the economy of Cork.  I worked for Henry Ford for 13 years and was very close to the workers who are now affected by yesterday's decision, so I assure the House that I am very conscious of their feelings on this sad occasion.  What has happened between 1980 and yesterday's announcement? Deputy Coveney made some points and one should not be political.  I certainly will not be political but I will make points regarding a lack of communication which has been very evident throughout the last year regarding Henry Ford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company sought a meeting on tripartite talks regarding the whole future of the company and it appears, because of lack of communication, that there was not any contact between the Government or the Minister and Henry Ford in relation <Col N="297" /> to that meeting.  This is the Minister's admission today.  The Government never communicated with Henry Ford on this issue.  I am making this point because we are here tonight in regard to the future of Henry Ford but in doing that we must at least look at the overall aspects of it and what has happened since 1980 when the managing director made that statement and yesterday when he made a further statement.  The Taoiseach said today:</P>
    <P>I also wish to announce that I am establishing a small high level expert working group to advise the Government urgently on the impact of the measures already being taken to provide jobs in the Cork area, on the action necessary to provide additional new jobs and on all action possible to safeguard existing viable jobs in Cork. This group will, of course, liaise closely with both the IDA and the task forces.</P>
    <P>Where will the people on this working group come from?  What has happened to our contributions in the House during the past 12 months, particularly in relation to the Dunlop situation when every Deputy from Cork made his contribution and brought home to the Minister and the Taoiseach the serious situation in Cork?  Nothing was done.  How am I expected to stand here tonight on behalf of the people of Cork and say that what is in the Taoiseach's document is anything new?</P>
    <P>We have a very serious situation in Cork.  Unemployment there is 4 per cent higher than the national average.  We do not need experts going to Cork to bring this message home to the Government.  I am very concerned about the sincerity of the Government.  We have come into the House far too often talking about situations like Dunlop and tonight about Henry Ford.  Where do we go?  It is gone then until the next occasion.  The Government are not sincere about this situation in Cork.  I do not mean the Deputies here tonight in relation to their contributions. I am saying this because of the Government's performance during the past year. Since I came into the house everything I have seen going on here shows that the <Col N="298" /> Government have not any interest in Cork and this is borne out by two statements in the space of three years when Henry Ford said they intended continuing in Cork and now they make another statement.</P>
    <P>We were told today, 24 hours later, that all the measures we had been asking for over the last year can be done.  The Deputies from Cork, including the Deputies from the other side, have been calling for those things for a long time.  Deputy Albert Reynolds sought this on the radio today.  I am asking what have the Government and the Minister been doing over the last 12 months?  Why were they not in Cork last week for a debate which discussed the whole situation in Cork?  I am very concerned about the sincerity of the Government or anything said here tonight regarding the future of Cork.</P>

      <P>Where do we go from here?  In his statement Mr. Hayes said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> Although we believe our studies have been exhaustive as far as Ford is concerned there is always the possibility that a reasonable proposal could come from some other source.  If so, of course, we will examine it carefully.  It would, however, be dishonest of me to give you false hope since conclusions have so far indicated no realistic alternatives.</P>
    <P>I worked in Fords and knew that things were very serious because free trade would be at an end this year.  Nevertheless I was confident that there would be diversification in Fords.  I met Mr. Hayes recently with other Fianna Fáil Deputies and he said they had looked at many options open to them.  He said they could do the job cheaper elsewhere.  I was surprised and shocked at the announcement as I have relatives in Fords and many friends.  The only glimmer of hope I have regarding Fords is contained in that paragraph.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government can play a role in this.  I can only express the concern and opinions of the people.  I do not make the decisions. The Taoiseach, the Minister and the IDA can do something and I appeal to them at this late stage to do so.  I know I expressed concern about their sincerity as regards Cork.  In the last 12 months no matter what happened in Cork it fell on deaf ears.  We heard the same comments made about Dunlops and other areas in Cork.  We got nowhere.  Many small industries have closed in the Cork region and there was not a word about them. Fords is the biggest in the city.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to take this very seriously.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of the Government because up to now there was no proper consultation with Ford.  There was a lack of concern about the whole approach to the car industry and the effect on the 800 workers involved, their families and relatives. In all 5,000 people will be affected by this closure.</P>
    <P>This is horrific for us in Cork.  We had a traumatic experience in Dunlops.  The future of other industries in Cork is in the <Col N="300" /> balance.  Young people have no confidence in their future.  We have a regional college and a university but the young people see nothing in Cork for them.  This is our responsibility.  We have tremendous power.  We make decisions.  The Government can show their real concern for Cork for the first time this year.  We in Cork seem to be the forgotten people.</P>
    <P>There is no need for new studies to be carried out.  We have travelled with deputations from one group or another and outlined exactly what was happening in Cork.  There is no need to send experts down to Cork to assess the situation.  We have enough experts in the IDA and so on who are fully aware of the difficulties. That information has been given to the various Ministers.  There is no need to say that further groups will be set up to investigate the matter.  The people in Cork want action from the Government.</P>
    <P>I am not over-optimistic regarding Fords but there is a glimmer of hope.  We will endeavour to give the Government every assistance in keeping any avenues open.  I make no apologies for being critical earlier.  My association with Fords gave me to understand that there was a lack of communication and goodwill on the part of the Government regarding Fords difficulties.  That I say with conviction and sincerity.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for bearing with me. It is a difficult time for Cork and a very sad time for me having worked in Fords for such a long period.  I have many close friends and relatives there and know what they are going through just as I know what those involved in Dunlops went through.  We have an opportunity to do something about it and I hope it will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to re-group if nothing else, because for the past 24 hours most of the people who represent Cork city and county have been reeling from the shock announcement that Fords will shed a major portion of their staff and just continue with their marketing activities in the Cork area.  It is of some significance that Cork city which next year will celebrate its 800th birthday now seems to be in decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> I was encouraged by the Opposition spokesman for Labour, Deputy Fitzgerald, when he said they would not make a political issue out of this.  For that reason I was saddened by Deputy Wallace's attack on the Government.  He seemed to lay a lot of blame on the Government for their inactivity in this area.  I do not accept that.  It poses many questions regarding our industrial policy and our dependence on multinationals. What we have to do is see how many jobs we can salvage.</P>
    <P>The company have said that it is not profitable for them to continue to assemble in Cork.  Quite a reasonable argument can be put forward in this regard because the cost of conveying a fully built-up car to the continent is sizeable.  However, there are alternatives.  I was saddened by the statement made by Mr. Hayes stating that a survey was carried out regarding alternatives in the manufacture of components. The argument is that the cost of getting the car produced in Cork to the market is excessive.  Coupled with that there was a fear that the car produced in Cork, the Sierra, did not meet the projections set for it.  The car was not readily acceptable to a large sector of the motoring public.  People tended to go for the traditional type of saloon from which the Sierra was a departure.  Without much fanfare they introduced another car, namely, the Orion, which has taken a slice of the market.</P>
    <P>We will have to campaign in Detroit if that is necessary.  The Minister has already told us he is prepared to go there but to what extent he will be successful is difficult to say.  There seems to be an element of doubt as to who took the decision regarding the closure in Cork, whether it was taken in the US, in Cork or in Europe.  It seems incredible that any management would take a decision that would make them redundant. There is a contradiction here that I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>There is a need to lobby the people who have befriended this country in the past.  There is a large Irish-American population in the United States: Deputy Coveney mentioned a figure of 40 million. <Col N="302" /> The message will have to be brought home that they will have to be Irish for a little longer than on St. Patrick's Day. Never before in the history of the State has there been such a need to be befriended by our American friends and now they have an opportunity to demonstrate this to us.  The trade unions can play an important role, having regard to their contacts with their counterparts in the US.  In America there is a large automotive workers union and it is very powerful politically.  The ICTU have a role to play and I have no doubt they will put a little pressure in that direction.</P>
    <P>The most fundamental point is with regard to the direction of this country from the industrial point of view.  We have been dependent to a large degree on multinationals to employ many people and recent events have proved we are fairly vulnerable when we place too much emphasis on this sector.  I wish to stress that I welcome the jobs they provide but it is wrong for a government to be totally dependent on some organisation that is subject to outside control.  We had the cases of Ferenka, Telectron, Dunlops and now we have Fords.  The Government will have to ensure that our industrial base is native-controlled, as applies on the continent.  Denmark is a country somewhat like Ireland.  Is has an agricultural base but its agricultural base is 90 per cent native-owned.  They do not provide the same kind of incentives to foreign investors as we do.  This is something that we should take account of and I think we could copy their example to good effect.</P>
    <P>There was an interesting discussion on television before the discussion from Cork last week regarding the Irish <i>entrepreneur.</i> Does he really exist or is he a mythical figure?  I think he is scarce as a leprechaun because I have yet to see a person who could be rightly described as an Irish <i>entrepreneur</i>.  I accept that we invest but where there is a risk involved I do not see Irish capital rushing headlong into it.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the kind of technical education we provide.  It is my view that we downgrade it and I speak as a member of a vocational education <Col N="303" /> committee.  We have tried to provide a system that will cater for all but we have failed dismally.  At the moment there is controversy regarding curriculum development. Greater emphasis must be placed on technical education.  Most of the successful men in manufacturing industry &mdash; the real creators of wealth &mdash; are people who have gone through the technical school system.  They are the people with the skill in their hands.  There is a greater need for technical education.</P>
    <P>In the Cork area there is a feeling that we are under siege as regards jobs.  We feel everything is against us.  It is essential that the Government ensure that the jobs under native control are safeguarded.  I refer specifically to Irish Steel, to the Verolme Dockyard, to NET and to the Whitegate refinery.  There is a need for the Government to give a commitment on this and as a backbencher on the Government side I will ask for that commitment. There is a vast area as yet unexplored in the spin-off of natural gas.  The job potential has not been realised.  When natural gas was being piped to Dublin and to Cork there was an argument about whether this was the best use that could be made of it and that discussion will have to continue.  There are many sectors in the petro-chemical industry that can be explored to provide the jobs we need. We have the means to develop our natural resources.  Further investment in the Whitegate refinery is essential.</P>
    <P>I am sure every speaker will refer to Ringaskiddy.  It is very important and it has become the phoenix symbol of Cork. Many people have put their faith in the future development of the area.  The IDA have invested massively and Cork County Council and the Department of the Environment have provided the services and the infrastructure.  It is all there except for the final link which is absolutely necessary.  The argument can be made that if an industrialist needs the facility it will be provided in advance. There have been taunts from the other side about promises from this side of the House.  At this late stage, prior to the budget, I say it is absolutely essential for <Col N="304" /> the Cork region that this facility be provided.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Ford closure cannot be exaggerated.  Many small industries have served Fords and Dunlops for many years.  Harringtons and Goodlass Wall have been the suppliers of paint to Fords who were their greatest customer and they will be affected by the closure.  Many small firms, extending to the constituency of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; the glass for the cars was produced in County Tipperary &mdash; will be affected very severely.  The IDA should investigate the position and see how it can assist those firms who will be threatened by the closure. The State agencies can use their influence and be of assistance to what now appears to be a crumbling industrial base in Cork.  I have met my party leader and if any commitment or co-operation is called for it will be forthcoming.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We all regret the announcement made by the chief executive of Fords yesterday, and the workers have described it as devastating news.  In the light of the happenings and the loss of jobs in the Cork area this decision by the Ford motor company to discontinue production of the Sierra car will have endless repercussions in spin-off work as well as direct jobs loss. It rings very hollow when a statement alleged to have been made by Mr. Hayes, the chief executive, in 1980 quotes him as saying, when talking about the future of Fords: &ldquo;We plan to continue car assembly after 1984 irrespective of what our competitors do&rdquo;.  That is the sort of spirit we know and have known in Cork.  That is the sort of statement we would expect from people in Cork in 1980.  The determination to succeed was there.  It begs the question: what has happened since? Three years on why should that commitment so expressed in all sincerity &mdash; we are only at the beginning of the fourth year &mdash; suddenly be in doubt?  What has happened in the meantime that that commitment and that indication of what Ford <Col N="305" /> planned to do in Cork regardless of what competitors would do suddenly comes amiss?  It is grand for all of us from Cork to be united and encouraging the Government in doing whatever we can to arrest the situation, but in the past 12 months this is the third or fourth occasion on which we have come in here on matters relating to Cork in particular and the country as a whole showing a united front.  There is some laudable political comment here and there but I am getting a bit tired of it because in the programme nothing has been given to the Cork area and the Cork people.  I am not now talking about financial hand-outs.  I am talking about incentives and encouragement. I know well that given encouragement and incentives Cork could be restored to what it formerly was up to the year 1980 when Mr. Hayes made that comment.  I do not profess to look into any crystal ball to see the future but in Vol. 345 of the Official Report of 9 February 1983 at column 1616 I am on record as saying:</P>
    <P>Representatives of the motor industry told us in recent weeks that in 1982 there was a drop of 34,000 in new car sales compared to the previous year resulting in a loss to the Exchequer of at least £50 million from excise duty and VAT.  It should have been obvious to the Government that there was no scope for imposing a further increase in the tax on new cars.  The recent massive hike in the price of petrol has also affected the industry.  I should like to know what Fords of Cork will do now.</P>
    <P>This was 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>How will the Government backbenchers from that county explain to the workers of Fords the effect of Financial Resolution No. 7 on that thriving industry?  That industry gives tremendous employment, direct and indirect, in Cork city and county but undoubtedly it will be under tremendous pressure.  We should be considering ways of expanding such an industry to take up the slack in other areas. The increase in VAT in this area will <Col N="306" /> have disastrous effects on the motor industry.</P>
    <P>That may be only a small aside but nevertheless I do not at all believe that we come in here now palsy-walsy, all united, as we have done before, without a response from this Government.  As I have said earlier, I am getting a bit cheesed off.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism said he had a message for the people of Cork. He said: &ldquo;Have confidence.&rdquo;  Confidence in whom?  Is it the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism?  Is it the Government?  We have always had confidence in Cork, that is always until such time as Coalition Governments are elected.  Then the confidence disappears very quickly.  Government Ministers and other Government spokesmen have talked about the suddeness of this decision. Do they forget that in April 1983 the Irish Congress of Trade Unions wrote to the Minister seeking a meeting?  Subsequently they requested in numerous letters a tripartite meeting of the workers, management and the Government. Public representatives in Cork met the workers.  We had to make two attempts to meet them because the night the Government Deputies were meeting them they were making some promises of a meeting, a meeting that never took place.</P>
    <P>On 15 November we tabled two questions to the Minister for Industry and Energy.  The questions were in the names of Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, Deputy Lyons, Deputy Wallace and Deputy Wyse.  The questions were as follows:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Industry and Energy if and when he will meet the Cork Ford trade union group to discuss the future of the plant there; and the steps being taken by him and the Government to guarantee the future of the workforce; and if he will make a statement on the matter to allay public concern on the future of the plant.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald, Mr. Lyons, Mr. Wallace and Mr. Wyse asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if and when he will meet the Ford management <Col N="307" /> in Cork to Discuss the future of the plant there and the question of any Government assistance necessary to guarantee future employment there.</P>
    <P>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton): I propose to take Questions Nos. 309 and 310 together.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Mr. Eddie Collins, within whose area of responsibility this matter lies, has had several contacts with Fords management over the past months concerning the future of the Ford plant in Cork.  The Minister of State again met Mr. Hayes, the chairman and managing director of the company, on 14 October last to discuss the situation.  The Minister of State has also indicated that he is prepared to agree to the trade unions' request that he participate in a tripartite meeting with representatives of Ford management, unions and ICTU.  A date for such a meeting is being arranged and I have asked Mr. Collins to report back to me on the outcome of this meeting.</P>

      <P>I had better hurry then.  I have a great deal to say but I will do the best I can.  I do not accept for one minute that we cannot continue the production of Ford cars but, if the non-viability of the plant is established, there will be a massive loss to the economy as a result of Fords discontinuing the production of cars.  Tyres, batteries, glass and many other fittings produced in Ireland and supplied to Ford will mean a loss of £4 million; services, power, heating, telephone, rates to the local authority, charges for water etc. amount to £12 million. There will be £11 million annually out of the commercial life of the city in wages and salaries and loss of exports of the Sierra car will mean a loss of £80 million.  I do not know the outcome when we have that measure of loss in addition to the loss of 800 direct jobs, all that cost and what has happened on the Cork scene already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refresh the memories <Col N="308" /> of some people and go back to November 1982 when the present Taoiseach put himself before the country and stated, presumably through all the media: &ldquo;We will provide more secure jobs particularly for the young.&rdquo;  He has failed without question and miserably.  Unemployment is now a national problem; it is growing daily and recent figures show that 23,000 people are idle in Cork city and county without counting the recent closures.</P>
    <P>I have a further quotation from propaganda that the electors of Cork were given in that November.  A Fine Gael candidate in Cork north-central said: &ldquo;Without doubt the single most important issue in this election is unemployment.&rdquo; Where is the action from Fine Gael now 12 months after that statement was made to our electorate in Cork?  My Labour Party colleagues have gone.  I remind them of a slogan they had in Cork for the Labour Party: &ldquo;Vote for Labour, a voice that will be heard.&rdquo;  The Government are not listening to that voice which must be out in the wilderness.</P>
    <P>We must ensure collectively in whatever way we can that job opportunities will be created in the Cork area.  The drift cannot be allowed to go on any longer.  I shall end with a quotation from the Deputy Leader of Fine Gael.  One of the most responsible statements to surface when the problems of Cork were being discussed recently was that of Deputy Peter Barry, Minister for Foreign Affairs.  When interviewed on what the Government were doing for Cork he replied that he would take bets that Fine Gael would hold their six seats in Cork at the next election.  They have only four seats; he must expect to win two more.  I make one more suggestion, that the Government encourage the Ford plant, who were planning to have their new engine for the Sierra built not in England but in Cologne, to have it built instead in Cork if car production has to cease there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday's news from Cork was another major blow to the city which has already experienced several such blows.  We had heard rumours recently that some major news was about to break but what came yesterday was a <Col N="309" /> shock to all of us.  It was sickening particularly for workers and their families now facing unemployment.  Ford's managing director, Mr. Paddy Hayes, speaking in October, said difficult choices would have to be made sooner rather than later. He gave that warning but since then the Ford company have been most unforthcoming in their response to any Government overtures.</P>
      <P>We sympathise, on this side of the House, with the workers and their families in the Cork area but the workers there deserve more than sympathy.  They deserve a united, positive response from all sectors in Cork, political or business people.  Deputy Lyons spoke of the loss to the Cork region and to say it is another body blow is an understatement.  When one looks at the figure for salaries of £12 million and for goods bought from other Irish firms of £12 million in one year one can see that hundreds of other jobs are depending on the continuation of the Ford operation.  I am encouraged by the Minister's opening remarks where he said he has already been in contact with the IDA requesting them to assess the effect of the possible closure on other industries in the Munster region.</P>
      <P>The impact, if the closure goes ahead, will be devastating for Cork's economy. When the idea of this debate was raised my first reaction was to oppose it because I felt that we all require time to recover from the shock announcement yesterday. We need time to assess our own positions, the position in Cork and to come to some conclusions on what our future action should be.  One could be accused of being indecisive but one should weigh opinions and views before one speaks and there is great danger of statements being made without much thought being put into them.  Eventually, I felt we should go ahead with the debate.  Otherwise, our party would be accused of running away from an issue but I have grave reservations about this debate.  Even though it started in a constructive way it has degenerated into a political mudslinging match, especially with the views of the previous speaker who was totally negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put a few points that I <Col N="310" /> hope will be positive.  Opposition speakers can indulge in the luxury of their position but we all have a responsibility to make a united effort to save the Cork operation.  We should commit ourselves to working together in that regard.  Some recent statements give me the impression that the Opposition party intend to make political capital out of people's misfortunes in the Cork region and I do not like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We were subjected to a lot of interruption in the last few moments. There is an obligation on the Ford company at the highest level to spell out their position.  They have so far failed to do so. Secondly, they must inform the Irish Government of what is required from that Government for them to continue in operation in the Cork area.  A face to face meeting must take place with the decision makers in Detroit, not those at local level &mdash; although consultation must take place at local level.  Contrary to media statements, I do not believe the decision to close the Cork plant was taken at local level.  From my dealings with them, the management in Cork were committed to the Ford plant, to Cork and to this country.  I could not see local management making a decision of this nature. I believe that those who talk of the decision having been made at local level spoke in a European context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am presuming that the decision was made at the European Ford headquarters and rubber stamped by the Ford company <Col N="311" /> in Detroit, without taking into consideration the major social effects of that closure on a city such as Cork. Deputy Coveney said earlier that a group of people in Detroit who have wiped out thousands of jobs in the United States in recent years because of the recession there looked upon the elimination of 800 jobs in Cork as just a paper exercise, without considering the catastrophe which that would bring about in Cork in economic terms.  It is imperative that we lobby Ford management in Detroit to reverse their decision because of the consequences in the Cork region.  This decision was made in a most inhumane way, not taking account of the economic situation.</P>
    <P>We have prided ourselves on being a neutral country.  That neutrality must be used in the world theatre.  Deputy Coveney said that there are 40 million people of Irish extraction in the United States. That is a fairly big political lobby which must be utilised.  I visited the United States in July with a party who made contact with the most senior of American politicians.</P>

      <P>The social importance to Cork of the Ford plant must be impressed upon these people.  Because of unemployment, our social fabric has been undermined.  If this fact is driven home to the United States authorities, some pressure will be brought to bear on Ford's.  I have not time to elaborate on this, but cannot stress too forcibly the importance of the Irish population in the United States.  To our shame, the Irish-American businessman and Irish-American labour official have been ignored by successive Irish Governments.  At our July meeting, these people pointed out that they resented the attitude of people from this country preaching to them rather than speaking to them.  If we speak to them, we can harness a great amount of goodwill in that area which has not been tapped.  There is a large number of influential people in US labour circles <Col N="312" /> and I have evidence of that from proposals made to them in recent months on another matter which have been fruitful. We will not win our case in the United States on sentiment alone.  It is important that the Government present a package which will sell over there, so we need the co-operation of all sectors in the Cork region, including the trade unions.  From previous contact with senior union officials, I know that this will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I shall ignore the two last speakers on the Fianna Fáil side as I do not want to become involved in exchanging abuse across the floor.  The Government attitude to Cork region has not been negative, as has been portrayed by some.  For that reason, I shall point out the positive initiatives taken.  We are only 12 months in office and cannot be blamed for all the ills of Cork, which did not occur overnight. I agree with Deputy Mac Giolla that planning should have been done for today with regard to our motor assembly industry because of the European factors. Recently the small industries division of the IDA have been moved to Cork, where the decisions are made.  If we are to prosper it is in this area that we must succeed.  We must encourage our own people to develop their industries. If encouraged, the small industries will grow into larger concerns.  We need only look at the American experience to see how true that is.  The enterprise centre has been located in Cork.  Planning is progressing and construction will commence shortly.  Factories on the Model Farm Road and at Kilbarry have opened in the last 12 months.  We must not forget the continuous injection of large capital into the harbour industries.  These industries are under threat, but the Government's continued commitment has ensured that they continue to operate.</P>
      <P>In the justified comments on the Ford problem, we have lost sight of the fact that only this week a decision has been made to allocate a further £89 million to Irish Steel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I must say this is a tragic development for Cork city, the Cork area and indeed for the country generally.</P>
      <P>The Ford Motor Company has been very good to Cork for the past almost 70 years.  Likewise Cork and Ireland have been very good to Ford.  The Ford Motor Company have enjoyed a major share of the Irish market for the past 70 years. Indeed, the original Henry Ford was born in Ballinascarty, the town from which I come myself.  Different generations of Fords have come back to Ballinascarty since he left which inculcated a lot of goodwill among the 40 million-odd Irish people in the US.  There has been a tremendous spin-off effect for the Ford Motor Company not alone in Ireland but throughout the world.  The Ford company, after 70 good years of profit-making in Cork, have a responsibility to maintain production there and remain manufacturing cars in Cork.  It is just not good enough to suddenly pull out of production, terminating their business there and to say: we are very sorry, we cannot continue because of a change in EEC regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage there are a number of things that can be done to influence the directors of the Ford Motor Company in Detroit to reverse their decision.  It is just not acceptable for the Government to say that they cannot make an appointment with these people, that they cannot contact them.  I do not think communications are that bad yet, that a sovereign Irish Government cannot make an appointment with the directors of the Ford Motor Company.  If necessary I would suggest that the Taoiseach and the relevant Minister should get on a trans-Atlantic flight, meet the Ford directors, putting before them the problem in Cork, a major one for us, but no doubt constituting only a <Col N="314" /> very small irritant for the international Ford Motor Company.</P>
    <P>I was discussing the problem with one of the Ford company personnel recently when I was told that the Ford operation in Cork &mdash; whether it went well or badly &mdash; would not change a decimal point one place in their international turnover. That is how small and insignificant is the Cork plant to Ford International.  That may be so but in Cork and in Ireland it is a major industry and will have serious repercussions if something is not done to have that decision reversed.  As others have said, not alone are there the jobs directly involved but there are the various service industries as well; there are people supplying the various parts and components going into cars.  They will find themselves in dire trouble if Ford do not continue in Cork.  Not alone should the maximum amount of pressure be exerted on the Ford Motor Company in the States but also through the very influential contacts this country has, for many reasons and many generations, built up with the business people and the Administration in the US.  Each and every one of those avenues should now be tapped; no stone should be left unturned in ensuring that this matter is resolved satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>In addition to going to the US we should go to Brussels and insist that the degree of protection we have up to the end of this year be extended.  I know that does not constitute an ideal solution, that we should be able to be competitive and should not have to depend on protection barriers.  At the same time we have a particular difficulty.  In our Accession Treaty, in the Protocol, our people, when they voted for entry into the EEC, believed that if there was anything which directly affected in a major way any sector of our economy, then we could renegotiate that matter.  I would urge the Government to pursue that avenue as well.  It must be remembered that week in week out, year in year out, other members of the Community receive special concessions for particular sectors of their economies.  There are even non-members of the EEC, third countries, renegotiating import arrangements they have had, <Col N="315" /> who have succeeded in doing so for historical or other reasons.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Industry to go to Brussels and say: Look, we have a major problem here, we need an extension of protection for our car assembly industry, and not come home empty-handed. If he does come home empty-handed it will mean the death knell, not alone for the 800 workers in Fords of Cork but for the service and supply industries of which it has been estimated there would be at least five to one for each worker employed in Ford's.  In the negotiations &mdash; assuming the Government will eventually establish contact with the Ford directors &mdash; it is essential that the negotiating team be made up of the Government, the management of Ford in Cork and the unions, that the package should be endorsed by that tripartite negotiating team, and that there would be no fear of any industrial problems, having succeeded in arranging such a package.  It is most important that the trade union movement, the management and the Government be involved.  This latest announcement may shock people into the realisation that nobody really owes them a living, that we must be competitive, we must be as good as those in other countries who produce the same product, not only in throughput, in the numbers of units completed per day or per hour, but in quality of product as well.  I have no doubt that this can be arranged.  Indeed the onus and responsibility rests with the Government to do so.  Since last October for the Government to give as an excuse that it was not possible to make an appointment does not lead to a great lot of confidence amongst the people of Cork.  An effort should be renewed to get these talks going, to resolve this matter not alone for Cork but for the country generally.</P>

      <P>It is most appropriate that this debate be held in this House this evening.  It underlines the urgency which the Government attach to this very serious problem for Cork, news of which we all heard yesterday.  It is a measure of the Government's concern <Col N="316" /> for the workers of the Ford factory and the need for more employment in the Cork area.  I support the other representatives from the Cork area who have contributed to this debate.  It is important that all Members from this region are united in their efforts to have the decision in regard to Ford's reversed.  Solidarity on the part of all Members from that area is important at this juncture.</P>
      <P>There is little point in apportioning blame.  It is lamentable that some Members resorted to accusations that the Government did not have any interest in Cork.  Those statements were unjustified and inappropriate.  Solidarity was displayed by all Members from the Cork region in recent years when we were facing industrial decline.  Cork's industrial structure consists of large harbour-based multinational heavy industries such as textiles, motor assembly, ship building, fertiliser manufacturing and steel production. Those industries suffered in the recent recession.  There is little point in blaming the Government, or any Cork representatives, for the decline in those industries in recent years.</P>
      <P>In the debate before we joined the EEC some of us, particularly members of the Labour Party, warned that we would face many problems as a result of membership.  We do not take any pride in referring to that and we do not shout about the fact that we issued such warnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Member complained that there was little effort to prepare for the difficulties foreseen for the car assembly industry when we joined the EEC.  The derogation expires in 1984 and there is no doubt that many industries will suffer, including the motor assembly industry. We must remember that in the last 12 years the EEC has fund-aided many projects in the Cork region.  We are not happy about the effectiveness of the regional policy but it has helped.  There has been a lot of progress in regard to infrastructure in that region.  The Cork city and harbour water supply scheme was aided to the extent of £5,250,000 by the EEC.  EEC funds were provided for roads also.  I appeal to the Government to ensure that the millions of pounds that <Col N="317" /> have been poured into the industrial estate, the IDA's land bank and industrial preparations at Ringaskiddy, are not wasted for the want of a few more million pounds.  The Government should make a favourable decision for Cork on that issue.  There is no doubt that there is a great need for proper deep water berth facilities there.  The prospects for the Ringaskiddy area should not be hampered by the lack of such facilities.  The problem in regard to unemployment in Cork is of such magnitude that that investment must be made immediately.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot be blamed for the closure of Ford's.  I hope the Opposition will not be tempted to adopt the attitude of some people and accuse the Government of being responsible for the decision to cease car assembly in Cork. This problem would have arisen irrespective of the party in power.  However, it is the responsibility of the Government to seek to reverse the decision.  I am aware that some Members have expressed doubts about that but the Government at least must seek to minimise the impact of the closing of the factory by other options such as the replacement of car assembly by the manufacturing of components.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us that the IDA had two task forces working in the area, one on the Ford problem and the other on the unemployment situation in Cork. He also informed us that the Government have established a high level expert working group to advise them on the problem. As a local representative I must express my appreciation to the Government but it is important that the Government task force visit the area to hear the views of the local people.  Local representatives are made aware of those views daily when they interview the unemployed or the parents of school leavers who cannot secure a job.  A visit to Cork by the Government task force would give them an indication of the full measure of the industrial crisis there.  There is no doubt that contact with local people helps create a lasting and effective impression.  We would like to share our concern for the future of the area with members of the Cabinet.  There is great concern in Cork about the future of industry there.  That <Col N="318" /> is not surprising when one considers the many setbacks Cork has had in recent years.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to comments made by Opposition Members in the course of the debate.  There has been a sharing of concern and an acceptance of the fact that we must all work together on this.  We are not on a campaign of point scoring: we are dealing with people's lives.  A worker was reported in one of today's newspapers as saying that he was reluctant to go home to share the news with his wife and family.</P>
    <P>Situations like this have become all too numerous in the recent past.  Allegations were made today in regard to the arrangement of a meeting between Ford management, the Minister and the workers.  We tried to arrange that meeting and when I hear statements that imply that the Government are responsible for that meeting not taking place I must contradict them.  I can state categorically that the Ford management did not seek such a meeting.  As late as last December the Department of Energy issued an invitation to the Ford management which was never taken up.  These points must be put on the record.  The suggestion has been made that the Government are to blame. The Government, as any government would do, did all in their power to remedy the situation.  They did all in their power to ensure that this would not happen, but now that it has happened I hope they will do all in their power, short of saving the continuance of the Cork operation, to ensure the establishment of a substitute labour-intensive industry, associated with the motor industry, in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>It occurs to me that if this factory was in Dublin the Visitors' Gallery would be packed tonight.  Therefore, it is important that we stick together and fight for our common cause.  I make the plea that we will all work together to ensure by all means that contact will be confirmed with Detroit.  I hope that when that meeting takes place the impact of this crisis in Cork will be stressed with a view to bringing an alternative industry to the city.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the <Col N="319" /> opportunity to contribute.  In the last 70 years Ford have had a good innings in Ireland.  Since they came here they have been manufacturing tractors and cars.  I presume that the fact that Henry Ford came from Cork had a bearing on getting and holding the largest market for cars here.  They played on that.  For years they played on the Irish connection not only here but in the US where they named one of their cars after a street in Cork.  They played out the Irish game to the bitter end.  Now they see they have played out the game, that there is no more profit in the Irish connection, that there are areas elsewhere where they can set up a factory at lower cost and produce the same goods &mdash; the costs would be less and consequently the profits greater.</P>
      <P>We should not forget that people in that business are in it for one reason, profit.  In any organisation there must be a profit because otherwise they could not compete.  Productivity is most important not only in the car business but in ship repairing, farming or any other business. It is not often said in public that the productivity necessary to maintain a business is not being delivered.  In Ireland we must face up to this as the economy becomes more open.</P>
      <P>In the Cork region we have had not only the announcement of the closure of Fords but we had Blackwater Limited in Youghal losing 90 jobs, and only half the work force were taken back after the holidays in Youghal Carpets.  They are all examples of how Cork has been hit by the recession.  I ask the Minister to take careful note of the Cork situation.  I suggest that the IDA increase their grants from 45 per cent to 60 per cent because we will not have any more big employers in the near future.  Therefore, people with the ability to set up small industries but who have not got the money should be financed properly.  In that way the level of unemployment could be reduced. This important issue should be tackled immediately.  With the budget coming up we have a suitable occasion to spell this out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of Fords means that many other industries in the area will be hit <Col N="320" /> seriously.  Paint and window suppliers depend for their success on what is being purchased by Fords.  The repercussions of this closure will spread down the line. Now we are talking about the loss of 800 jobs in Fords, but there will be probably 3,500 indirect job losses.  We must therefore try to ensure that car manufacturing will be carried on or that something will be put in its place.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that since last October the Government have been attempting to arrange a meeting with Ford management in Detroit.  It is a hopeless situation if a sovereign government cannot contact and arrange a meeting with a company in any part of the world. It is a flimsy excuse to say that a meeting could not have been arranged.</P>

      <P>It was clear over the last 12 years that at the end of 1984 the embargo on the importation of cars would go.  During that time it was remiss of anybody who was responsible that some plans were not made to replace the jobs which were to be lost.  At this stage the Government, as well as going to the management of Henry Ford, should also approach the EEC and ask them to renegotiate the regulations regarding the importation regulations for the end of 1984.  No matter what Deputies say it is up to the Government in the final analysis to put the pressure on to ensure that <Col N="321" /> Henry Ford will either exist as they are today or be replaced by some other type of employment in the Cork factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with regret that we are here tonight discussing the closure of a major industry in Cork.  Protocol 7 says that there is no further protection for the motor industry after 1984 but the fact remains that the bureaucrats of Europe cannot be allowed to remove the bread from the tables of 800 families in Cork to whom my heart goes out tonight.  It is regrettable that since the late seventies successive Governments have turned their backs on the people.  What right had they to do that?  The responsibility lies with us to be seen to be doing the opposite. A general impression was given throughout Cork that there was no hope after 1984.  This is utter nonsense to me as a local Cork politician.  I say to our newspapers, radio, television and, above all, our politicians, who are making a hue and cry about what has happened in Henry Ford, is it not a little late in the day?  We all know that since the late seventies it was inevitable as day follows night that Henry Ford had to go.</P>
      <P>The editor of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> highlighted this today when he rightly asked what have Henry Ford done to provide other options?  Why was this not done? We also understand from the leading article in today's <i>Cork Examiner</i> that Henry Ford indicated that they tried for alternative uses without success for the Cork plant.  I do not accept that they have done that.  Have the Government or any semi-State body any indication that Henry Ford were serious about facing the reality?  Where is the evidence that they have sought alternatives?  I suggest that Henry Ford are taking the easy way out. They cannot turn their backs on Cork. They have got their pound of flesh out of the sweat and blood of the Cork workers. We must not accept this greediness of the multinationals, which is now becoming a characteristic of these companies.  I say to Henry Ford management: &ldquo;Contribute part of what you have got from the city back to Cork.  There is a moral and social duty on you to do this and you owe it to Cork&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> With regard to the question of suitable replacements, the competitors of Henry Ford, General Motors, who also got their pound of flesh from the workers of Dublin, did not walk away from their problem.  They faced reality and they did their duty.  Not alone did they provide alternative employment but they created extra employment which is a clear indication of the resourcefulness and ingenuity of our work force which we can be proud of.  Henry Ford say that the Cork operation is uncompetitive.  I suggest to the management of that company that if they spent the same money in the Cork operation as they did in Belgium on the provision of facilities for making the Sierra I have no doubt that Cork would compete with anything in the world.  I have every confidence in the Taoiseach and the Minister to leave no stone unturned in making sure that Henry Ford provide alternative employment for their work force in Cork.</P>

      <P>I would like to speak in support of the debate tonight.  This is a sad occasion and is breaking with the great tradition of Cork and its county. We have seen a lot of industrial development being eroded in County Cork during the last few months.  Henry Ford are one of our finest industries of which we have all been proud over the last 70 years.  We have learned a rather difficult lesson from our over-reliance on multinational industries to provide us with jobs and wealth.  In the future we must have a rethink on where our industry comes from.  I was here when the Taoiseach read his statement today, and we had statements from the leader of my party, Deputy Haughey, and Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, in reply to it.  We had Deputy Mac Giolla speaking on it also.  He had all the answers, but tonight there are two blank spaces where the smallest party sit in the House.  He was telling us all he knew but he did not make one solid constructive proposal in his best Leninist-Trotskyist-Marxist-type tradition.  That is <Col N="323" /> the kind of policy he pursues to wreck industrial development here.  He has never made a solid constructive contribution in the House.  I am sorry he is not here to hear what I am saying.  There is no use in his attitude.  We will never develop by always knocking.  We cannot all be wrong.  He has nothing to contribute.</P>
      <P>I remember as a young lad when my father bought his first car and I am proud to say it was a Ford Prefect, coloured green.  There were many of those cars in the parish at that time.  The Ford Prefect was a popular farmer's car in rural Ireland.  I come from a fairly rural background and at the church there would be five or six Prefects.  We expanded further and the Ford car became the famous farmers' car.  That is synonymous with Henry Ford of Cork.  It gave something to the rural community of which we could be proud.  As technology improved and other people took the market share here that changed.  The Ford Prefect was a famous car for many years.  Ford held the market share in Cork for 70 years.  They did that by having a good backup and service.</P>
      <P>We must ask why all our traditional industry has ceased to be productive since we entered the EEC.  The Minister has an obligation to investigate this.  Other countries have developed in spite of the recession.  In the Cork area paint manufacturers, those who supplied the glass, nuts, bolts, springs and other fittings will be in trouble.  There will be many more closures as a result of this decision.  The families of the workers who will not have bread on their tables will suffer most.  As Deputy Walsh said, we must go back and renegotiate our car assembly terms with in the EEC.  We have a duty to do so.  This is one of our best industries and we cannot afford to stand idly by and let it close in six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to pin down a multinational. We must have a united front.  We must have trade union involvement in any negotiations which take place.  The Ford company have made a major contribution to agricultural development. The first Ford tractor was manufactured <Col N="324" /> in Cork many years ago.  Deputy Hegarty probably knows more about the Ford tractor and its impact on agricultural development.  Look at the Ford range. They have a predominant share of the tractor market.  Irish farmers stood by them through thick and thin and bought their tractors.  The company cannot walk away from the Irish scene.  There is an obligation on them to look at the position in Cork.</P>
    <P>They have a very extensive car range. Cork happens to be a victim of new technology. The development of the Sierra must not have been a success.  If Ford had spent the same amount of money on the Cork plant as they spent in Belgium they might not now have these problems.  The Sierra is a popular car.  It has taken on in a big way.  It was a change from the traditional type car.  For a company of this size and with its turnover&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was happy to share my time with a Cork Deputy because the Minister and I are probably the only non-Corkonians to speak tonight.  It is only right and proper that the people from the area should have an opportunity to speak.  It is a dismal day for Cork and for the country when we consider the size of the disaster that has struck.  We must think seriously about what we will do. The total loss to the economy will be in the region of £100 million.  We will lose £80 million in exports because Ford exported 80 per cent of their output and if they close we will have to import 4,000 more cars.  Fords pay out £4 million to small service industries and about £12 million for electricity, telephone and other services.  Approximately £11 million in salaries and wages will be taken out of the Cork area.  This is the size of the problem we are talking about.  It is <Col N="325" /> only right that it should get a full airing in this House.</P>
      <P>We need immediate action.  We cannot rely on writing letters to Detroit.  We will support the Government in any action they take trying to solve the problem. The boss man in Detroit or in Europe must be contacted quickly and the calamity that has been inflicted on Cork and on our economy must be put before them. As a company which has been in the Cork area for over 60 years we expect some sensible contribution from them in relation to what will happen if they decide to close.  We are entitled to see replacements. The average age of the work force is in the region of 41 years.  There were 200 people with over 25 years service.  It is a calamity for the workers, their wives and families.</P>
      <P>Somebody asked: where do we stand? Somebody else asked if it was good enough to ask for meetings.  To illustrate the kind of action that is needed I will quote briefly from <i>The Economist</i> of January 14, 1984:</P>
      <P>Ford announced this week that it would spend $500 m. on a new plant in Hermosillo in northern Mexico, to build 100,000 small cars a year from 1986 ...</P>
      <P>Ford's decision came after months of arm-twisting by the Mexican government, which is trying to force its heavily-protected foreign car companies to make better and cheaper cars and earn more foreign exchange.</P>
      <P>That is the kind of action required.  It is the only kind of action the people in Detroit and Europe will respond to.  If it takes the Taoiseach or the Minister, so be it; but that is the only kind of action that will bring a solid response from Fords.  It is the least they can do for Cork and the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Starting tomorrow morning the IDA should list every single small supplier to the company and make sure that they have the whole picture and see the problem before it arrives on their doorstep. We will not hear about the loss of three jobs or seven jobs.  I welcome any action taken by the Government.  I hope the task force which is being talked about will <Col N="326" /> be more active than those we have heard about from the Government.  I will back the call of every Deputy from both sides of the House in saying that Cork needs an injection of confidence now.  It needs a deep water berth and anything else that can be put in straight away to raise the hopes of the people there.  A glorious opportunity was lost this year when a £30 million construction investment in the centre of Cork city was allowed to go by the wayside because An Foras Forbartha decided they would not go there.  Go back to the early seventies and look at the economy in Cork.  What carried them through that recession?  It was the construction industry that carried them through and they did not feel the effects of the recession during that period.</P>
    <P>The first action the Government can take is to inject money into the construction industry.  Whatever projects are ready in Cork should be proceeded with, starting with the deep water berth. Throughout the country one in every two persons in the construction industry is out of work and I am sure the proportion is higher in Cork.  This is due to the complete depression in the industry.  That industry does not affect our imports.  It uses Irish materials and employs Irish people.  Help should be given to this sector in the Cork region to give some hope to the people.</P>
    <P>The Government should also consider the other industries in Cork.  We do not want to find during next summer or winter that the Verolme dockyard is going to close.  We know they have no work other than the project they are finishing.  They did not get any orders.  The Government may decide to close the dockyard but we will not accept it.  There is an order outstanding for a vessel that could keep the company going.</P>
    <P>I understand Irish Steel are improving their position and I am glad about this. However, the people of Cork are still awaiting a decision regarding the future of Irish Steel.  Last August the Commissioner in Brussels commented that by the end of the year or shortly afterwards Irish Steel would close but I did not hear any comment from the Government or anyone else to contradict that statement.  It <Col N="327" /> is time we had a decision on the matter and the same applies to NET and the Verolme dockyard.  However, the Government should start with the construction industry and get the show back on the road.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Government cannot solve the problems for everybody and I agree with him.  He said there was a need for an entrepreneurial spirit and for everyone to do what they could.  The people who are getting a large amount of money from Fords may have an opportunity to consider the matter.  However, despite all that talk from the Minister, the Government have the major responsibility to have an environment in which investment can flourish and get a return on that investment.  If the Minister thinks industries will spring up overnight in Cork or elsewhere without a proper capital venture market to sustain them he is living in cloud cuckoo land.  I ask the Government to ensure that there is the right environment for investment so that profit can be made.  The word &ldquo;profit&rdquo; has become a dirty word in Ireland.  It is time the Government took the part of the people who are investing their money and who are taking risks.  Today's profit will be tomorrow's capital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation to my colleague, Deputy Collins, who has allowed me a few minutes to make a short intervention.  I should like to speak at some length on this important issue but because of the time constraint I shall be very brief.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress that the closure of Fords is not just something that will affect Cork city but it will affect the entire region.  This is because the work force is not exclusively drawn from the city and because many of the suppliers are from out side the city.  From that point of view it is regarded as a disaster not just for Cork but for the entire southern region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second reason for intervening is the historical association of Fords with Cork.  The roots of the Fords company go back to my own constituency <Col N="328" /> in west Cork, to a small farm not far from Ballinascarthy near the town of Clonakilty. We have all been proud of that association with the Ford company and I am hopeful that in the negotiations ahead and in the pressures that will be applied that historical association will not be forgotten by Fords.  A reminder of their roots may create some additional pressure in facing up to the situation.</P>
    <P>The Ford company has a lot to lose as a result of this decision.  There is a substantial allegiance in Ireland to the products of the Ford company and this applies not only in relation to their cars. Although many Irish people may have thought their tractors were produced in Cork that was not so but the allegiance of the agricultural population to the Ford tractors obviously related to the fact that the Ford company was situated in Cork. That same argument probably applies also to their cars.  I believe that the position of the company as far as sales are concerned will be affected substantially by this decision.  If they are making their decision on commercial criteria that is a factor the company must bear in mind.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see all-party support behind the efforts of the Government to salvage something from what is proposed now.  In general all Members have united in support of the Government in their efforts to deal with this disastrous situation. It is clear that the Government are making and will continue to make every effort possible to retrieve the situation with Fords or to get the best deal possible in the interests of Cork, the surrounding region and the country.</P>
    <P>The other factors raised by Members will be borne in mind by the Government and I will not hesitate to remind the Government that the Cork area is a special case.  The Ford decision, combined with what happened in Dunlops and other companies, has created a disaster area in Cork.  I can only say that I will continue with my colleagues to press this point with the Government and ensure that steps will be taken not just in relation to Fords but in relation to a rescue operation for Cork.  I have every confidence we will be successful in getting a good response from the Government.  In that <Col N="329" /> context, even in this disastrous situation there is a message of hope and confidence for our people in Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply saddened by the decision of Fords to close the Cork plant.  I am very conscious of the position of that company in the economy of Cork. In discussions and in contacts which I have had with the Ford management during the past year I have stressed the importance that I and the Government attach to the continuation of the Ford manufacturing presence in Cork.  My concern was made known to the management in that period.</P>
      <P>I realise that, given the massive structural changes in the motor industry in the past few years such as the consolidation of production in larger units, robotics and general modernisation there must have been some question about the continuation of what is a relatively small-scale assembly in Cork.  In these circumstances I have stressed repeatedly to Fords the importance of looking at the problem to see what was on offer from them if assembly work were to cease.  In that period I offered Fords every assistance from the Government and the State agencies to deal with this problem and in every move of diversification that they would consider viable.  This assistance is still on the table as the Taoiseach and my Minister, Deputy Bruton, have already said, in the form of two task forces under the IDA.</P>
      <P>One aspect of Ford's statement on which I must take issue is the inference that Ireland is not a very profitable location for investment.  According to the United States Department of Commerce it is the most profitable overseas location for American investment.  I must take exception to the following statement yesterday by Fords:</P>
      <P>Even assuming maximum possible Government grant assistance, we have found in every case that somebody else could do the job more cheaply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were referring there to alternatives such as specialised low volume vehicles and components.  It is important to note <Col N="330" /> that the growth in employment in the automotive components industry here has been staggering.  This refutes positively the assertion made by Mr. Hayes yesterday.  The growth in that industry which employed 2,500 in 1972 has resulted in 5,600, almost 6,000 now being employed.  We have been successful in becoming a supplier to the motor industry, with many companies in the length and breadth of the country supplying components to that industry.  It is this negative aspect of Fords statement which causes me concern and which I refute.</P>
    <P>This problem will be taken up immediately by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, during a trip to America to meet senior management.  It is hoped that he may be accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is anticipated that the contacts made by the IDA with the Ford Motor Company will clarify matters in large measure.  The assistance offered by the Government and Government agencies, such as the Industrial Development Authority, must be seen to be the best efforts of the Government, as indeed they will be and have been.  I hope that Fords presence here will continue, whether in the form of motor assembly, which is now doubtful, or in the form of a diversified manufacturing unit, which is more probable.  We can offer them an excellent package in an industrial environment which is becoming increasingly more competitive and is seen to be so.  I am confident that the Industrial Development Authority, who support the Government and our Ministers, will succeed in offering them a package which they cannot refuse.  I ask Ford, on behalf of the people of Cork, to realise the importance to Cork of the presence of Fords and I hope that they will be in a position to take up a decent offer from the sincerely concerned Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Members for a constructive debate.  Unfortunately, as the House will be aware, I had not the opportunity of being present throughout the debate, due to the necessity of attending a Government meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> I would like, firstly, to respond to the point made by Deputy Wyse, who led the debate for Fianna Fáil, that he regarded it as of considerable importance that approaches should be made to the United States side of the Ford organisation.  As pointed out to the Deputy by Deputy Coveney, that is precisely what I have been doing and was doing before this news became known.  Indeed, I have been following up that initial contact throughout today, with a view to pursuing the matter to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have suggested that the provisions of the Protocol with regard to the ending of the requirement of motor assembly in Ireland should be revised or renegotiated but I regret that that is simply not relevant or feasible at this stage.  The position on the negotiations concluded by the President, while Minister for Foreign Affairs, in regard to this matter has been accepted by every Government who have held office since then and it is not sensible to suggest that because of this particular decision we should seek to renegotiate the matter. Indeed, in my view it would tend to divert attention from the true issue.</P>
    <P>There are many other firms here who had been assembling for quite some time under the protection of the previous arrangement and who have successfully diversified into other lines of manufacture &mdash; I have already mentioned one such case.  The key question is: &ldquo;Can we get Fords to put in an alternative manufacturing project?&rdquo; To divert our attention into any other area of activities would be to waste our efforts.  We should concentrate on presenting the best possible case to Fords, both in terms of their profit and motivation and of their social responsibilities.  There are many on both sides of the House who see many merits flowing from having free enterprise, but in a free enterprise system the only sure guarantee is that those involved realise the social responsibilities that business has.  If people fail to take account of these, the system does not work.  This must be realised by Fords management decision-makers.  That will be one part, but only a part, of the case that we must <Col N="332" /> put to the Ford people in the United States and indeed in Ireland and Europe.</P>
    <P>I concur entirely with the Minister of State's view that we do not accept Fords statement that in every case somebody else could do the job of manufacturing components more cheaply.  I agree entirely with Deputy E. Collins, the Minister of State in saying that we do not accept the statement by Fords that in every case somebody else could do the job of manufacturing components more cheaply in regard to those cases they have examined.  I do not believe that is actually the case.  I am confident that the example set by other people in this business and the many opportunities that exist in an economy &mdash; I am speaking now of the European economy which is beginning to recover &mdash; must indicate that there are such projects.  The challenge is to get Ford management on both sides of the Atlantic to give enough time, to devote enough intellectual effort to finding a suitable project.  It is easy to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It is much more difficult to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in a situation such as this because to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; requires a commitment of time and effort to working out a suitable project.  Our objective must be to get them to devote the time and effort, not just to going through a list with a view to ticking off the difficulties &mdash; because undoubtedly there will be difficulties with every project they will consider &mdash; but to look at it in the light of trying to find a solution and keep at it until they find a solution in terms of a manufacturing project they can locate in Cork.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Irish industrial scene has suffered from a lot of bad press. There have been many people who, for one reason or another &mdash; and I am not here speaking about anybody in this House &mdash; have tended to highlight the things that have been detrimental about the Irish industrial scene, situations in regard to industrial relations and so on. The fact of the matter is that we have just come through a year wherein there were less man-days lost through strikes than was the case for many years in the past. We have come through a year wherein our exports met with outstanding success.</P>
    <P>We have already established an industrial <Col N="333" /> base which is in many senses the most modern in Europe.  We have a young population who are much more flexible in their work practices than many of the generations of industrial workers who are older than they are, who are now coming towards the end of their industrial careers.  We are moving very much more into the area of flexible work practices. It is much easier to persuade younger workers coming into the labour force for the first time to do away with restrictive practices and to work flexibly than it is to persuade people who have been working under a particular regime for many years to do so.  Ireland, with a young age structure, is a much more flexible industrial location than any other country in Europe, all of which have a more aged structure.</P>
    <P>We must in this House&mdash;and I suppose it is not appropriate in this debate to talk too much in terms of general industrial policy &mdash; remind people listening to us overseas that this is a good country in which to develop industry.  It is a country which has a proven record in providing profit for those foreign companies who have located here.  We welcome foreign industry.  Already we have had the Ford Motor Company for many years.  I believe that if they can come in with a <Col N="334" /> new project, new ideas, applying effort and thinking to what they are doing &mdash; and already all of our endeavours at the political level of Government and State agencies are to get them to give that effort &mdash; I have not the slightest doubt that Ford can find a project that will make money for them and provide jobs for Cork.</P>
    <P>I am very glad this debate has provided so many speakers.  The tone of the debate has been extremely positive.  It has afforded an opportunity to give a message which I hope to be able to convey directly to the management of Ford, from all sides of this House, of our will to ensure that an industry can be established by Ford in Cork that is entirely viable, modern, in tune with the new needs of the motor market, and one that will provide a secure future for all.</P>

      <P>Two civilian drivers, Mr. Michael O'Hara and Mr. Anthony Rouse, are employed on a temporary basis by this Department in respect of Mr. Ted Nealon, TD, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and at the Department of Communications. They are remunerated at a rate equivalent to £172.50 per week and receive subsistence allowances at Civil Service Class C rates for official absences from home. The Minister of State receives the appropriate mileage allowance in relation to the official use of his private car.</P>
      <P>Drivers are not employed by this Department on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and at the Department of Justice, Mrs. Nuala Fennell, TD, receives the appropriate mileage allowance in relation to official travel in her private car.  Mrs. Fennell also uses official transport on an occasional basis.</P>
      <P>The average estimated annual cost of officially provided ministerial transport for each Minister of State was £77,000 per annum when the decision to alter the system was taken in 1983.  Under the revised system, the annual cost to be met out of this Department's Vote, based on expenditure in 1983, would be an estimated total of £40,000 for the transport of two Ministers of State.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, in the interest of security the names and addresses of drivers should not be divulged.  Two drivers took up duty during November 1983.  Both drivers had extensive driving experience before appointment.  Allowances and other expenses paid are a weekly wage of £172.30 plus Civil Service Class C rates of subsistance.</P>
      <P>The cost of travel of the Minister of State for 1983, under the new arrangements, was £2,755.  As the Deputy will probably be aware, mileage expenses are paid on a reducing scale over a 12-month period.  I understand that the cost of providing official transport for Ministers is not kept in Garda records in such a way as to enable the comparative cost sought to be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will give a detailed account, and the cost thereof, of the investigations into the disappearance of a person (details supplied) in Zambia.</P>

      <P>The person in question went on a boating trip with three companions on Lake Tanganyika on 2 July 1983.  A storm blew up.  When the group did not return the supervisors of the camp from which they had set out searched the area of the lake on 3 and 4 July in the hope that the group had put in to a small island or were otherwise stranded on the lake or lake shore.  When no trace was found, they decided on 5 July to call for the help of the Zambian Air Force, and to notify the consular representatives of the four citizens involved.  The Zambian Air Force searched the lake in good visibility on 6 July but found no trace of the group.</P>
      <P>As soon as they were informed of the loss, three days after the storm, the consular representatives of the four countries, including Ireland, whose citizens were involved immediately co-ordinated their efforts.  The authorities of Zambia, Tanzania and Zaire were informed of the event, and were asked to make inquiries and searches to find the group, or to find traces of them or their boat, or for any news that might clarify their fate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Missionaries, aid workers, expatriates and villages in the lake area were alerted and asked to make inquiries and report immediately any information or rumours concerning the group.  Every lead was followed up, but regrettably no trace emerged.  In particular, a rumour that the group had got ashore in Tanzania and <Col N="43" /> were being held by the authorities there for illegal entry was checked several times.  It is a matter for the authorities of the countries in the area of the loss, rather than for the authorities of the countries of the missing people, to conduct searches and inquiries in the area. However, we sent an aid worker employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs who is familiar with the district to the lake area.  He spent about four weeks almost exclusively engaged in making personal inquiries in the area, checking rumours, and meeting local officials and others.</P>
    <P>Every lead or rumour is followed up, the local authorities are kept fully aware of our continuing interest and concern, all relevant information is carefully examined and appropriate additional action is urged, for example the more remote areas of the Zaire coastline have, at our request, been searched.</P>
    <P>In cases like this it is not considered appropriate to keep or calculate details of the costs incurred in seeking to deal with the tragic situation.  From the moment an Irish consular representative was notified that an Irish citizen was among those missing, our objective has been to do everything possible either to find the missing persons or to find out what happened them.  Our efforts have been pursued in co-operation with the authorities in Zambia, Tanzania and Zaire and also with the consular representatives of the other countries whose citizens are missing.  Our efforts will continue. I have recently again asked the authorities in Zambia, Tanzania and Zaire, to whom I express my deep appreciation for their help to date, to renew their efforts and to ensure that everything possible is done to solve this sad case.</P>

      <P>I understand that in October 1983 the Industrial Development Authority approved grant assistance to the company in question to restructure its operations and this has helped to reduce the number of planned redundancies.  The company is currently restructuring its activities; the IDA will continue to work closely with it and will encourage further development.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that during 1983, they assisted the Westport Shoe Co-Op to establish in the former Dubarry shoe factory.  This company is at present recruiting staff. Lastra Foundations was also approved grant assistance for an expansion which has already provided additional jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 217 together.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the most recent survey carried out in this area, it is estimated that 61,000 companies (78 per cent of the total) have not filed up-to-date returns and that 20,000 (26 per cent of the total) are more than four years in default.</P>
      <P>The major element of the measures which are being taken to improve the operation of the Companies Registration Office is the installation of a computer-based system.  Tenders for the supply of the necessary equipment are being examined and it is hoped to have the system installed and working by the end of June 1984.  While the process of conversion to a computerised system could hardly be concluded before the end of 1985, it is expected that significant improvements will be achieved in many facets of the operations of the Companies Office shortly after the system has become operational.  It is expected that, by early 1986, most of the companies at present on the register will either have registered up-to-date returns or have been struck off the register.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256 and 257 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties in the construction industry.  These difficulties arise primarily from a reduction in demand for certain types of construction work and from a decline in the level of private sector investment.  Public expenditure now accounts for about 70 per cent of all construction output.  It is the Government's aim to maintain public sector investment in the industry at the highest practicable level consistent with the need to ensure a proper return on such investment and with the overall constraints on public spending generally.</P>
      <P>Despite the difficult economic conditions house completions in 1983 totalled about 26,100.  This performance was made possible by an increase of about 500 (from 5,686 to about 6,200) in the number of local authority houses completed, by a satisfactory flow of mortgage funds from public and private sources and by the success of the Housing Finance Agency in raising funds from institutional investors for lending to house purchasers with modest incomes.</P>
      <P>As far as the Housing Finance Agency income and loan limits are concerned, I have already arranged that the review process be undertaken.</P>

      <P>My Department provide a 100 per cent subsidy in respect of the capital costs incurred by local authorities in providing special housing schemes or serviced sites for travellers.  In addition, the Department recoups 90 per cent of the expenses incurred in the employment by local authorities of social workers to assist in traveller settlement.  There are no proposals to introduce further assistance in respect of administration and operating costs which have traditionally been met from local sources.</P>

      <P>Payments of instalments of grants in respect of group schemes are not dependent on a formal application by the trustees and it is not possible, therefore, to identify individual schemes in the category indicated by the Deputy.  In general instalments up to 90 per cent of the amount allocated are paid within three weeks of being certified by the Department's inspector as being warranted by reference to progress with the work.</P>
      <P>As regards the final 10 per cent, it has been found necessary generally for some months past to insist on the submission by the trustees of a form confirming that water has been installed in each of the houses in respect of which the grant is to apply as a preliminary to the final inspection to establish that the scheme has been satisfactorily completed.</P>

      <P>Proposals for revision of speed limits are dealt with in the context of periodic overall reviews of speed limits in the county/county borough concerned. In the case of Limerick city and county, proposals for revisions and additions to the limits prescribed in the Road Traffic (Speed Limits) (County Borough of Limerick and County of Limerick) Regulations, 1977 were submitted by Limerick County Council to my Department on 10 February 1982.  The proposals involve revisions to speed limits in the city and in 18 areas in the county as well as the <Col N="73" /> introduction of speed limits in a further 15 areas in the county.</P>
      <P>Following consultation between the Department and the local authority revised proposals for certain areas were submitted by the council to the Department on 30 November 1983, together with further proposals for an additional speed limit area and an extension to speed limits in three further areas in the county.</P>
      <P>Draft regulations to give effect to revised speed limits for Limerick city and county are now being prepared in the Department.  Subject to clarification of a few minor points, it is expected that the regulations will be brought into effect within about two months.</P>

      <P>The fair wages clause of the standard conditions of contract for building works by local authorities require the contractor to &ldquo;pay rates of wages and observe hours of labour and conditions of employment not less favourable than those laid down by the National Joint Industrial Council for the Construction Industry&rdquo;.  The pension scheme referred to by the Deputy is considered to be part of such conditions of employment. Infringement in this respect, if established and not remedied when brought to the contractor's notice, renders the contractor liable to having the contract terminated. It is considered that this clause is a sufficient safeguard in this respect.</P>

While the Employment Equality Act, 1977, does not apply to employment in the Defence Forces, the principles of equality enshrined therein are borne in mind in the continuing development of the employment of women in the Defence Forces.  Since 1980, 20 female cadets, five female doctors, one female dentist and 40 female other ranks have joined the Permanent Defence Force.  As regards apprenticeships, because of a shortage of suitable accommodation, it has not been found possible so far to provide for an intake of female apprentices to the Permanent Defence Force. The question of providing such accommodation will continue to be considered in the context of competing demands on scarce resources.</P>

The pension scheme is considered to be part of such conditions of employment.  Infringement in this respect if established and not remedied when brought to a contractor's notice renders the contractor liable to having the contract terminated.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 359 to 368, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>It is the practice not to divulge information regarding commercial transactions with individual private parties but I can state that it is the policy of the Commissioners of Public Works to recover the full cost of the services provided for commercial interests in the harbour.  Subject to the constraint affecting commercial transactions, the information sought by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>Any problems of siltage at Dún Laoghaire harbour are kept under review by way of periodic hydrographic surveys and dredging operations are carried out as and when required.  Current dredging requirements, if any, will be determined on the basis of the information provided by the survey at present being conducted.</P>
      <P>There are 26 harbour constables, 84 industrial employees and 11 civil servants employed by the State at Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The car ferry pier and terminal at St. Michael's Wharf was built on foot of a contract with Irishenco Ltd. at a cost of some £1.15 millions.  Vote accounting arrangements do not provide for the allocation of separate maintenance and repair costs to specific areas within the harbour and it is not possible, therefore, to give a figure in respect of such costs for the car ferry pier.  Maintenance and repair works are normally undertaken by the labour force employed by the <Col N="113" /> Commissioners of Public Works at the harbour but the services of outside contractors are engaged as and when required.  Tenders have been invited for the repair of that part of the pier structure which was damaged by a vessel; a significant amount of underwater repair work has already been carried out to the piling to the pier and the nature and extent of the further repairs which are required will be determined by underwater surveys. The future use of the pier is under consideration by the Commissioners of Public Works in consultation with the appropriate interested authorities.</P>
    <P>The old mail boat pier is being used for the cross-channel ferry service to Holyhead and plans for future use of this pier will be determined in conjunction with the taking account of the deliberations in regard to the future of the car ferry pier.</P>
    <P>With the consent of the Commissioners of Public Works, the area to the west of the National Yacht Club premises, which forms part of the club's leasehold property, is being filled in by the club authorities with the purpose of providing accommodation for dinghy parking.</P>
    <P>A dinghy park is being constructed adjacent to the Motor Yacht Club's premises on the west pier.  The principal terms of the lease to the club in respect of the area involved have been sanctioned by my Department and the details have been agreed between the club authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Details of capital expenditure by the State on the harbour for the years in question are as follows: 1963-64, £19,581; 1964-65, £73,890; 1965-66, £206,730; 1966-67, £213,942; 1967-68, £239,237; 1968-69, £294,397; 1969-70, £94,388; 1970-71, £21,064; 1971-72, £Nil; 1972-73, £3,821; 1973-74, £1,306; 1974 (9 months), £158,487; 1975, £174,661; 1976, £63,476; 1977 to 1982, Nil.</P>
    <P>The amount expended in the year ended 31 December 1982 in respect of the upkeep of the harbour, inclusive of staff remuneration, was £1,200,000 approximately; receipts for that year amounted to some £950,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Health Act, the persons who are eligible for the general medical service are adult persons who are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants, together with the dependants of such persons.</P>
      <P>The determination of eligibility in individual cases is a matter for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  In order to assist in determining eligibility and to ensure uniformity of decisions in all areas, income guidelines have been adopted.  These guidelines are based on gross income.  If the guidelines were based on net income without any expansion of eligibility, this would require a lowering of the guidelines. This would tend to favour persons with larger incomes.</P>
      <P>If the current guidelines, instead of being measured against gross income, were to be measured against income net of PRSI contributions and income tax an expansion of eligibility would result.  It is not possible to estimate with any precision what the extra cost might be but it could be of the order of £15 million in a year.  Moreover, the increase in the numbers covered by medical cards might make it necessary to renegotiate the fees payable under the scheme and this could add considerably to the extra cost involved.</P>

      <P>In his claim to disability benefit the person concerned indicated that he had been last insurably employed in the United Kingdom.  Under the EEC Regulations on Social Security his claim was, therefore, the responsibility of the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  Accordingly, his claim and medical evidence were transferred to the UK anthorities on 1 June 1983.  Also transferred was an Irish insurance record, in his name and under the RSI number quoted by him, showing 11 Class A contributions paid in respect of the 1980-81 year.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Social Security were not, however, satisfied that the claimant was last insurably employed in Britain and requested recently that his Irish insurance record for the 1980-81 year be investigated.  When this was done the person concerned stated that he had never been employed in this country and that the 11 contributions for the 1980-81 contribution year may be proper to another person of the same name and address.  This information has been sent to the Department of Health and Social Security and that Department will be in touch direct with him.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance of £32.25 weekly until 12 July 1983 when following a review of his means he was assessed with weekly means of £43.50 derived from land, capital and his wife's pension with effect from 13 July 1983. Due to an oversight payment of unemployment assistance to him ceased. Unemployment assistance has now been authorised at the weekly rate of £4.85 from 13 July 1983 increased to £7.25 from 5 October 1983.  These are the maximum rates appropriate in his case of £48.35 and £50.75 respectively less means £43.50.  All arrears due will be paid to him this week.  Further weekly payments of £7.25 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

The unemployment benefit claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that by reason of not genuinely seeking work she was not available for work on and from 21 July 1983.  She appealed the disallowance but did not attend the oral hearing which was arranged for 16 November 1983.  The appeals officer disallowed the appeal.</P>
      <P>She claimed disability benefit from 29 July 1983 until 27 September 1983 when she was found capable of work by a medical referee.  She was again examined by a medical referee on 23 November 1983 who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She then submitted a final medical certificate stating that she was fit to resume work on 1 December 1983.  A form of appeal issued to her on 25 November 1983 for completion should she wish to have her case in respect of the period 28 September 1983 to 30 November 1983 referred to an appeals officer for determination.

      <P>The unemployment benefit claims of the workers concerned were disallowed on the grounds that they lost their employment by reason of a trade dispute at their place of employment. The disallowance was upheld by an appeals officer following an oral hearing which took place on 22 July 1983.  An application was then made to the Social Welfare Tribunal but the tribunal rejected the application.</P>
      <P>The document furnished by the Deputy was brought to the notice of an appeals officer but he did not consider that it contained any new evidence or new facts which would warrant a revision of the original decision.  Accordingly, the persons concerned are not entitled to unemployment benefit for the period of the dispute.</P>

      <P>There is at present no civilian driver <Col N="214" /> employed by the Minister of State at my Department and it is not his intention to make an appointment.  He did employ a driver from 14 November 1983 to 12 January 1984.  The person concerned was remunerated at the rate of £172.50 per week; he received no other allowances or expenses.</P>
      <P>The cost of travel in 1983, exclusive of driver's pay, under the new arrangements was £1,461.30.  I understand that the cost of providing official transport for Ministers is not kept in Garda records in such a way as to enable the comparative costs sought to be given.</P>
