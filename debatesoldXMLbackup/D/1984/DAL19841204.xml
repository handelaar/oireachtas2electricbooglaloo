    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service the number of employees who have taken leave under the temporary release scheme from the Civil Service; the duration of such leave of absences; and if he will give a report on the success or otherwise of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service the number of civil servants who have taken advantage of the career break and job-sharing schemes since their introduction; and the progress which has been made in expanding the schemes throughout the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The number of civil servants granted leave under the career break scheme for the period to 31 October, 1984 is 414.  Of these 274 are for one year, 52 for two years and 88 for three years.</P>
      <P>The number of civil servants who have commenced job-sharing in the same period is 86.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of both schemes, which were introduced by me earlier this year, is to create additional job opportunities for young people in the Civil Service and to facilitate those with special domestic <Col N="1255" /> responsibilities or wishing to pursue particular interests.  I am very encouraged by the number of staff who have availed of both schemes in the short period since their introduction.  I am confident that the high level of interest in the schemes will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The success of the schemes in the Civil Service has prompted the Government to have them extended to other areas in the public sector, and a commitment to this effect is given in the national plan.  I have recently written to my colleagues in this regard and I expect that the schemes will attract as much interest, and enjoy the same level of success, in the rest of the public sector as in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health have already introduced a scheme of career breaks in the health sector.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to put on record my appreciation of the co-operation received from Departments in the promotion and implementation of the schemes in the Civil Service and in the plans to have them extended to the public sector.  As is so often the case, the success of schemes devised centrally is dependent largely on the goodwill and commitment of those whose responsibility it is to have them implemented.  I am particularly grateful to the staff involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that the schemes give incentives to some officials. Will the Minister give a broad outline to the House of how the job-sharing scheme works?  Will the Minister tell the House if the 86 people mentioned are employed on a half-week basis or do they work a specific number of hours each day?  Will the Minister tell the House how the benefits, entitlements to pensions and other matters operate for such people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The job-sharing scheme operates on the principle that a person may opt to be employed on a half-time basis and provided there is somebody of the same grade in the same office who is prepared to work on a half-time basis those two people constitute a full-time <Col N="1256" /> job.  For each two people who opt for half-time working one full-time job is released to be filled by new entrants to the Civil Service.  In addition a small number of jobs were advertised recently by the Civil Service Commission on a job-sharing basis.  It is hoped that a number of those will be filled in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the people who have taken advantage of these schemes to go abroad been given a commitment that on return they will be appointed to the same grade in their Department? What commitments were they given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>People who opt for a career break are entitled to return to the office in which they had previously been employed having given a reasonable length of notice.  If it happens that there is not a vacancy in the grade in which they had previously been employed at the time when they want to return they can take one or other of two options.  They can wait until a vacancy occurs in that grade or they can take a vacancy in a lower grade and occupy it until such time as a vacancy occurs within their own grade.  Those who have opted for a career break have done so for a variety of reasons and travel abroad is the largest category by far, representing more than a quarter of the total number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When these people return to their posts following their career breaks, will their replacements be given the first vacancies which occur in the Civil Service or will the view be taken that they were never in the Civil Service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, 414 people have availed of the career breaks scheme to date.  When they return to the service their replacements will be retained in the service.  The replacements are recruited if they are in a promotion post by somebody being promoted into the vacancy and a new person is recruited to the recruitment grade.  The person recruited is already in permanent employment and will be retained within the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1257" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that in line with the embargo?  Are they recruited under the one-in-three scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Already 414 people have taken career breaks and they have been replaced by 414 people.  In other words, the effect of the two schemes since they were introduced at the beginning of April last has been to bring about the employment of 414 people through the career-breaks scheme and 43 people through the job sharing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister wish to give a date when this scheme will be extended to the other sectors of the public service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health have introduced a scheme which started about the same time as the Civil Service scheme.  Recently we made a conscious decision that it should be extended to the wider parts of the public sector.  I understand that the Department of the Environment in relation to the local authorities and the Department of Education in relation to educational interests are pursuing the possible implementation of the scheme at the moment.  Other Departments have discussed this matter with the State agencies and bodies which come under their aegis and I hope there will be an early introduction of a scheme, particularly in the educational and local authority areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of widows of deceased civil servants currently in receipt of pensions under the Civil Service spouses' and children's schemes is 3,170.  The average annual amount of such pensions is £2,333 (including payments in respect of dependent children).</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the widows of civil servants get a raw deal because they lose out on a number of other entitlements?  Has the Minister any proposals with his colleague the Minister for Social Welfare to improve their entitlements because at present they are debarred from almost every entitlement under the Social Welfare Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is speaking about particular categories of widows.  I understand that most Civil Service widows are also in receipt of contributory social welfare widows' pensions which amount to £2,267 per annum, with additions in the case of widows with dependent children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>How is that pension scheme funded?  Recently in the private and semi-State sectors a number of difficulties as regards pension schemes arose. Has the Minister any comment to make on the security of the funds which pay Civil Service pensions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is on record as saying that if the pay deal is not accepted under the terms of the national plan, one of the areas where civil servants might be in difficulty would be in relation to their pensions.  Maybe if I framed my question that way the Minister might answer it.</P>

In relation to the funding of these pensions, as in most other countries Civil Service pensions are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis rather than a formal funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government announced in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> that a White Paper on this topic is to be published shortly.  Work is now almost completed on the detailed proposals for that White Paper and I intend to put them before the Government shortly. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be proper for me to comment further on the proposals prior to the Government considering them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say on what date the White Paper will be issued?  Will it be a comprehensive document on the public service or will it cover only areas covered by his Department? When the Department of the Public Service was set up its purpose was to deal with financial and organisational units.  It is generally accepted that it failed as a Department to do what it was set up to do.  Is the White Paper covering the failure of the Department of the Public Service or is it a wide-ranging White Peper to cover all Departments and the entire public service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say with accuracy and I would be loath to give the Deputy an accurate date for the publication of the White Paper, except to say that a submission to the Government in draft form is imminent.  It would be wrong for me to begin to engage in a discussion as to its possible content until <Col N="1260" /> the Government have had an opportunity to consider the proposals and to decide on the form they wish to put forward and enunciate.  In relation to other aspects of the Deputy's question and the insinuations contained therein regarding the performance of the Department of the Public Service, I have to reject them and point out that there is a question in similar vein on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service is the only area of the public service where I currently have statutory responsibility for control of numbers and grades employed.  At present there are 30,600 non-industrial and 5,500 industrial employees in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Information in relation to numbers in the wider public service was supplied in answer to a question by Deputy Molony on 23 October 1984.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Civil Service, the information sought about grades is set out broadly in a statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  Information is not readily available in respect of the industrial Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Number of non-industrial civil servants by grade group&mdash;Administrative and Executive, 7,268; Clerical, 10,562; Typing, 2,042; Professional, Scientific and Technical, 4,084; Inspectorate, 2,326; Supervisory, Minor and Manipulative, 2,524; Messenger, Cleaner etc. 1,794.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="1261" /> accept that there are far too many grades in the public service.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he will give a report on the working of the flexi-time system in the public service; if he considers it a success; and if he has any proposals to extend the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The system of flexible working hours for which my Department have responsibility is concerned solely with the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Flexible working hours were introduced in the Civil Service in 1977 on a pilot basis.  Initially less than 600 staff, mainly in the executive grades, in six Departments and offices were included in the pilot schemes.  The pilot schemes were later extended to cater for clerical and other grades and under these arrangements there are at present approximately 4,500 staff on flexible working hours in ten Departments and offices.  I consider that these schemes have, generally speaking, been successful.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the pilot schemes, agreement was reached in March 1983, on guidelines for the future operation of flexible working hours in the Civil Service.  These guidelines provide an agreed general framework within which individual flexible working hours schemes may be negotiated by the Departments and offices to suit local conditions. At present, negotiations for the introduction of schemes are well advanced in a number of Departments and offices.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any plans to introduce flexible working hours <Col N="1262" /> in relation to sick leave?  Perhaps they could be given credit for attendance as is the case in the system of normal flexible working hours.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that I follow the Deputy's line of argument.  Sick leave falls into two categories, certified and uncertified sick leave.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that hours might be worked up on a flexi-time basis to compensate for uncertified sick leave?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  At present people are rewarded for working flexible hours. Before this system was in operation there was no incentive to sign on earlier and work later and it is well known that people did not stick to the regulations.  Under the flexi-time system they have to do so because the system is automated and there is an incentive to build up a day or so per month.  I am asking the Minister to extend that system to cover uncertified sick leave as an incentive for people to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for flexi-time leave, people must work core hours per day and they can make up the normal working hours through working earlier or later than the core hours.  They may work extended hours over and above the normal daily requirement of hours and, by doing so, they may build up hours spent on duty to provide them with the equivalent of a day or a half day's leave per month.  I am not sure whether the Deputy is suggesting that those who attend on a normal basis, as required, should after a particular length of time be allowed uncertified leave and that civil servants should be given leave for attending normally at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister knows the record in regard to uncertified sick leave.  It is very annoying for people who do not use up uncertified sick leave <Col N="1263" /> to know that others are abusing the system.  If I were to put down a question to the Minister regarding the level of uncertified sick leave per individual it would be quite embarrassing.  I am suggesting that a positive incentive should be given to people who do not use their uncertified leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The insinuation that many or most people in the public service abuse uncertified sick leave is not true.  Many officers serve for years without taking uncertified sick leave in any one year.  I understand that a study some time ago of comparative sick leave records between the public service and the private sector showed that sick leave records were roughly comparable.  That is not to say, of course, that the amount of uncertified absences whether in the public or private sectors is satisfactory but perhaps the matter might better be addressed by examining the uncertified sick leave record of certain personnel rather than extending the concept of giving uncertified sick leave to the personnel who attend at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme has not had any particular effect on staffing levels. The concept of the scheme is that while all personnel involved are required to attend during the core hours, there is a theory that certain people perform better in the early morning and that others work better later on.  Within the parameters of the core hours, personnel may opt to work early in the morning and leave relatively early in the afternoon or, alternatively, to start work at 10 a.m. and serve until a later time in the evening.  It is designed to recognise the preferred working pattern of different individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if any consideration is being given to making conditions for early retirement more attractive throughout the public service with the object of creating more vacancies for young people attempting to join the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>In the course of examining job creation measures, generally, consideration was given to the question of reducing retirement ages in the public service.  The extra costs of immediate pensions plus lump sums which would arise &mdash; even without any extra retirement incentives &mdash; were such as to make the matter prohibitive.</P>
      <P>With regard to making conditions for early retirement more attractive, incentives to encourage such retirement on a voluntary basis at age 60 have been introduced in the Civil Service in recent years &mdash; for example, the qualifying service for maximum lump sum has been reduced from 45 to 40 years.  Furthermore, persons who resign before the minimum retiring age can, provided they have at least five years' service, have their accrued entitlement to pension and lump sum preserved and paid on an uprated basis at age 60.  I am, however, reviewing retirement ages in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that there would be many employment opportunities in the public service if people retired early?  Could he also say how many people have taken up the option of early retirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is yes but, if it were to be implemented as an employment creation measure, it would be one of the more costly <Col N="1265" /> options which have been examined.  A relatively small number of people retired before they reached 65 years of age.  In 1983, 157 people in the category 60 to 64 retired and it is estimated that about 150 out of a total of 1,220 in that age category of serving civil servants will retire voluntarily during this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fairly small percentage.  The Minister said it would be a costly scheme to implement if it was orientated towards employment, has he the figures regarding the cost of early retirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the retirement age in the public service generally was to be reduced from 65 to 60 years, the estimated cost of doing so in one fell swoop would be £97 million by way of superannuation lump sum, together with additional pension costs of £33 million.  That is in the context of a public service superannuation, lump sum and pension bill this year of £157 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if there is any other method that would not be as costly for the State?  As I understand it, there are many civil servants who would like to go on early retirement if the conditions were right.  Is the Minister saying it is financially impossible to have a pension scheme that would allow these people to get an amount at 62 or 63 years fairly relative to their pension at 65 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Various options have been examined and all of them have major cost implications.  If they were to be used purely as an employment generating scheme for people coming into the workforce for the first time it would be a very expensive method of employment generation.  However, there are other aspects, including that of the age of retirement generally.  There is much to be said for having a flexible retirement age generally and that is one question which we hope may be addressed in the proposed White Paper.  Of course the Deputy is now leading me down a path that I tried earlier not to tread upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he will report on the embargo to recruitment in the civil service; and the effects the system is having on the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>1.  Since 23 December 1981, only one vacancy in every three arising in the Civil Service may be filled. Exemptions from the embargo have been allowed in certain cases, for example, to replace officers taking career breaks or going to serve with international organisations of which Ireland is a member.</P>
      <P>2.  Vacancies may also be filled when they reduce the strength of a grade by more than one-third.  In such cases a vacancy in the next lowest grade must be held open in compensation.</P>
      <P>3.  To date, some 2,650 vacancies in the non-industrial Civil Service have been left unfilled as a result of the embargo. Staff required for new or expanded services are being provided for by redeployment both within Departments and, in some cases, from one Department to another.</P>
      <P>4.  The Government are satisfied that as a result of the big expansion in public service numbers in the late seventies, there is still considerable scope for staffing economies in the Civil Service. Accordingly, as announced in the national plan, <i>Building of Reality,</i> it has been decided that the embargo will continue in operation until the end of 1987.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a similar question last week.  Will he accept there is much unfairness in the way the system operates at present, particularly in relation to the non-established grades in the public service?  What will he do to stop the abuses that are occurring in the system?  What happens is that when it <Col N="1267" /> comes to a section losing a grade it is not lost out of the established grades or from the senior officers but is taken from the grade of usher, attendant, storeman or paperkeeper.  That happens on a wide scale and the Minister agreed with me on that last week.  I am asking him now what he will do to stop that kind of unfairness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this matter last week.  I pointed out to the Deputy that where it has come to our notice that there is a pattern of embargo that seems to stretch the bounds of credibility too far we have taken the matter up with the Department concerned.  We are working to ensure that the effect of the embargo is felt evenly across grades.</P>

The scheme covers transfers between the Civil Service, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, national and secondary teachers and other participating organisations.  A person transferring between two participating organisations on or after the agreed operative date &mdash; which must not be before 1 June 1973 &mdash; automatically transfers service for superannuation purposes.  The scheme may also be applied, at the discretion of the final employing organisation, to persons who transferred before the operative date and are still serving on that date and, in so far as pensions are concerned, to persons who retired before the operative date.</P>

    <P>Determination of Annual Leave&mdash;</P>
    <P>Annual leave for grades in the non-industrial Civil Service (established and unestablished) is determined on the following basis:</P>
    <P>(a)  The various grades are divided into eight groups, fixed primarily by reference to salary maxima.  The lowest group in this hierarchy (subordinate grades such as paperkeepers, messengers and cleaners) has a leave allowance of 18 days per annum; the highest (grades with salaries in excess of the Principal Officer maximum) has an allowance of 31 days.</P>
    <P>(b)  As a general rule, a recruitment grade (i.e. a grade to which appointments are made by public open competitions) has a graduated leave allowance; a promotion grade (i.e. a grade to which appointments are made solely by way of internal promotion) has a flat annual leave allowance.</P>
    <P>The current annual leave allowance for industrial grades (none of whom are established) is 18 days.</P>

Fees were reintroduced for competitions announced on or after 1 March 1983 and were terminated for competitions announced after 31 December 1983; they do not now apply.

The people in this area have a perception that they would have no chance of success in any case because of their address and people who are living on assistance and benefits are not even encouraged to apply.

      <P>For the purpose of the reply I am taking employees to mean civil servants in the usual definition of the term, i.e. established and unestablished officers excluding temporary staff and industrials.  The information sought is as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  723 civil servants commenced maternity leave during the period 1 November 1983 to 31 October 1984</P>
      <P>(b)  Ten temporary staff were recruited to cover absences on maternity leave during the period.</P>
      <P>(c)  The 723 civil servants referred to at (a) were on maternity leave for a total of 49,018 working days during the period.</P>

      <P>In my reply on 26 June 1984 to a question from Deputy Mac Giolla on the operation of the new procedures for the appointment of senior civil servants I made it quite clear that the function of the Top Level Appointments Committee (TLAC) is purely an advisory one.  The statutory power of appointment remains with the Government, in the case of Secretaries of Departments, or with the appropriate Minister, with my sanction as Minister for the Public Service, in the case of other appointments.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 3 November 1984 the Top Level Appointments Committee were asked to, and made a recommendation on the filling of a post of Assistant Secretary in the Department of Defence.  The acceptance or otherwise of this recommendation is entirely a matter for the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>Do the Top Level Appointments Committee receive the names from the Civil Service Commission, short-list them and leave the final say to the Minister?  If so, what is the normal short list?  Do they give the Minister the option of choosing from three, ten, 20 or more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When a position becomes vacant it is advertised, normally internally, by the Top Level Appointments Committee.  Candidates apply to the committee and the committee can then decide whether they need to engage in a short-listing process.  In their initial period the committee have chosen to use the services of the Civil Service Commission to conduct interviews and to do short-listing for them.  The persons on that short list are then interviewed by the Top Level Appointments Committee who recommend one name.  In certain cases the services of the commission have not been availed of and the committee themselves have carried out the short-listing and conducted the interviews, but in every case the procedure culminates in the recommendation of one and only one name.</P>

      <P>(1)  Civil servants are not permitted to stand for election to either House of the Oireachtas, or to the European Parliament. This restriction applies to all categories of staff.</P>
      <P>(2)  Civil servants in the industrial categories and in manipulative, sub-clerical and manual grades are free to engage in political activity, subject to the general restriction in relation to parliamentary elections.  Civil servants in this category may, therefore, contest local elections.</P>

    <P>(3)  Members of the clerical classes in the civil service, and civil servants in non-manipulative grades with salary maxima <Col N="1284" /> equal to or below the clerical officer maximum, may apply for permission to engage in politics on the same basis as the staff referred to at (2), but officers employed on particular types of work may have their applications refused.</P>

      <P>This will become a live issue for many people who grew up in the public service &mdash; it will not concern my party any more than others &mdash; and they would like to understand clearly what their entitlements are if they stand, if they win or if they lose, what will their future be if they get leave of absence or take their annual leave during the course of elections?  I am sure there will be thousands of people who will let their decisions be influenced by what their circumstances would be.  In other countries membership of local authorities is treated entirely differently from membership of national parliaments because local authorities just deal with local matters &mdash; it is not a matter of dealing with security or any major State decisions.  Therefore, it would not need the same rigid attitude.</P>

      <P>I do not see the difference. Supposing a civil servant is a member of an executive of a trade union, or supposing he was in the Revenue Commissioners, a very important Department, and if there were political activists in that Department, extremely vocal and powerful, who influence many people, surely that is more important to the State than a person standing to look after roads, public lighting, parks and so on in their local areas.  I contend that a person who is a staunch union representative and who has access to records in that context would not be any less damaging to or feared by the State.</P>

      <P>While I would have fairly exact details regarding claims which are current, at any one time there are claims which might have been entered some time ago, perhaps even a year ago or longer, which for one reason or another are not being pursued by one party or the other.  It is very difficult to define whether they should be regarded as current claims.  I was not trying to be unhelpful in my reply.  Quite a number of claims are encompassed by the conciliation and arbitration procedure, one of the basic tenets of which is that, once entered into discussions are agreed as being confidential between each side.  My difficulty is that, were I to begin to discuss them, essentially I would be in breach of the provisions of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the information broken down in that form.  When I began to examine it, my difficulty was that we encountered quite a number of claims which were entered over a period extending much further back than six months.  It was difficult to assess whether they could still be regarded by either of the parties involved as current claims. They were not being pursued actively for one reason or another.  For that reason we did not compile details of claims based on periods back over six, 12 or 18 months. If the Deputy is particularly interested in the number of claims lodged through the conciliation and arbitration procedure in the past six months, I will be quite happy to get that number for him.  I think it is readily ascertainable and I will be happy to send that information to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The main functions of the Department of the Public Service are to develop, implement and monitor Government policies in relation to personnel, organisation and pay matters in the Civil Service and, as appropriate, in the wider public service.  The Department, therefore, have as their basic objective the achievement of continuing improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> Significant progress has been made in this direction, particularly in the past year or so.  A comprehensive plan for further major development of the public service will be set out in the forthcoming White Paper on this subject.</P>
    <P>The Department's activities have, in many matters, been confined to the Civil Service.  An important step in removing this constraint has been the Government decision announced in <i>Building on Reality,</i> to assign responsibility to the Minister for the Public Service for the co-ordination, across the whole public service, of policies in relation to manpower, personnel management, organisation and pay and to give him clear authority to ensure that arrangements decided on are implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to get these additional powers and the functions at present undertaken by the Department of Finance.  Does the Minister agree that the difficulty for the Department of the Public Service is that, when they were divorced from the Department of Finance some years ago many of the decisions to be made remained with the Department of Finance and, therefore, Public Service cannot implement any of their aspirations and have not made significant progress in any area in recent years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the functions now being assigned to the Department have not been assigned specifically previously to any single Department.  The question of co-ordination of policy is one of the most important aspects of the assignment of the new functions.  The implementation of those will be made clear in the White Paper.  I would not accept that in the past two years there has not been significant progress in the achievements of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not expect the Minister to accept that.  Would he admit that the original plan of the Department was to divide each of the other Departments into organisation, finance and personnel <Col N="1296" /> units and that this has not worked and has been more or less abandoned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring basically to the Devlin proposals.  We have to realise that they were put forward in the context of 1969.  Fourteen or 15 years have elapsed since and many events, including our membership of the Community, have meant that the work of certain Departments has become radically different.  We need to establish the proper type of organisation and management of Departments commensurate with the needs of today and of the future. In that context, the Devlin proposals and other developments all need to be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service the number of candidates for Civil Service posts disqualified this year because of representations made on behalf of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year I requested the Civil Service Commissioners to make a regulation strengthening their long-standing prohibition against canvassing by, or the use of influence on behalf of, candidates at Civil Service competitions.  This regulation was duly made and I wrote to all public representatives to inform them about it. At the same time I appealed to members of the public not to put their representatives in the embarrassing situation of making requests which it would be improper for them to pass on.  The Civil <Col N="1297" /> Service Commissioners have also given prominence to their new regulation in documents issued to intending applicants.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to say that these steps have proved most effective and it has not been necessary to consider disqualification in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give an assurance that nobody on whose behalf representations have been made has been refused?  The vast majority of the population realise that we cannot make representations to the Civil Service Commission.  Sometimes people seek information on placings and how many jobs have been filled.  This is not an interference with decisions.  If we were to give that power arbitrarily to some civil servant he could cut people off the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The new regulations have not been interpreted in that way.  Because of the change, public representatives have not been put under so much pressure by constituents.  There has been a change in the type of queries addressed to the commission as a result.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft&mdash;</P>
      <P>Ombudsman Act (First Schedule) (Amendment) Order, 1984</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 23 November, 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft order before the House, a Cheann Comhairle, is a logical development of the process begun when I introduced the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill in the House last month.  During the debate on that Bill, I indicated that I would come back to the House shortly with proposals for a major expansion of the Ombudsman's remit, and I promised that I would fully involve the House in all decisions affecting this remit.  This I am now doing.  If the House approves the draft order before it, it will mean that the actions of an additional 100,000 public servants approximately would come within the remit of the Ombudsman.  This <Col N="1409" /> represents, in numerical terms, almost a threefold increase in his existing remit. Given that the Ombudsman has been in operation for less than a year, I think that the expansion proposed must, by any reasonable standards, be considered a major one.</P>
    <P>In the complex series of relationships which exist between the bureaucracy and the public, the Ombudsman has a vital role to play.  His primary concern is to ensure that the public is protected against administrative malpractice.  At the same time, it is likely that, in many cases, his investigations will show that decisions taken were justified.  He is, therefore, in a real sense the man in the middle.  He is the friend of the public but he is not an enemy of the bureaucracy.  I think that it is important to make this point as a prelude to considering the specific expansion proposed in the Ombudsman's remit.</P>
    <P>During the earlier debate, both in this House and the other House, on the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill many speakers emphasised the role of the Ombudsman as the protector of the public.  Indeed, one of the contributors in the other House, to my recollection, referred to him as the &ldquo;Tribune of the People&rdquo;.  I think these points were well made and I fully share the sentiments behind them.  In fact, these sentiments provided the impetus for the all-party agreement to establish the office of the Ombudsman in the first instance, a decision which has been shown to be fully justified by his operations to date.</P>
    <P>As I have said, however, the Ombudsman is not the enemy of the bureaucracy. I think that, on all sides of the House, we can be proud of the public service we have.  It has served us very well, but it is also true to say that it is a vast organisation, and all organisations, both in the public and private sectors, make mistakes and are capable of improvement.  That is a fact of life.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important that the bureaucracy, whose work impacts so much on the public, should operate efficiently and effectively.  Where wrong decisions are made, they must be rectified. <Col N="1410" /> When injustice is done, it must be put right.  The Ombudsman is there to help to ensure that necessary remedial action is taken.  He seeks fair play for all &mdash; for the bureaucracy as well as the citizen.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the framework for the extended remit, the Government took into account the availability of resources and the areas where these resources could be employed to optimum advantage.  In essence, they had to balance resources against priorities.</P>
    <P>The discharge of the extended remit envisaged in the draft order will require a major increase in the existing staff resources of the Ombudsman's office.  To this end, the Government have provided some £300,000 for extra staff in the 1985 provision of the office.  In percentage terms, this represents the largest increase in 1985 provisions generally.  It underlines the Government's firm commitment, even in a time of stringent economies, to ensure that the remedy of citizens' grievances be treated as a major priority. I am glad to say that the provision indicated will fully meet the additional staff resources which the Ombudsman indicated were needed to discharge his extended remit.  It will enable the Ombudsman to recruit, at senior level, an extra three senior investigators and 12 investigators during 1985, together with necessary back-up staff at lower levels. The additional senior investigator and investigator posts represent a threefold increase in the existing staff complement of the Ombudsman's office at these levels.  All of the new posts would be filled through a special public competition. This would allow the Ombudsman to obtain people of the highest calibre.</P>
    <P>Even with this major increase in staff resources, it was necessary for the Government to make a choice as to what areas the extended remit should cover.  It was clear that this remit should embrace health boards and local authorities.  The 1977 all-party committee, whose work did so much to provide the basis for the establishment of the office of Ombudsman, considered that his remit should be quickly extended to these areas.  I fully agree with that view and I have, in fact, <Col N="1411" /> given an earlier commitment to the House that this would be done.</P>
    <P>The basic question facing the Government, therefore, was what other areas should be covered with the resources available.  During the earlier debate in both Houses on the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill, many Members on all sides commented on the position of Bord Telecom Éireann.  Reference was made to the large volume of complaints which existed in this area and, indeed, some criticisms were made of the way the company reacted to representations.  It was clear to me, therefore, that a level of dissatisfaction existed among public representatives with the position here. This seemed also to mirror a similar feeling among the public at large.  I must also say that the points made reflected my own basic viewpoint which I made clear during that debate.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, took fully into account the view of the House, and indeed my own views, in deciding to extend the Ombudsman's remit to Bord Telecom Éireann.  In taking that decision, there was, of course, no wish on their part to single out this body among all State-sponsored bodies.  Indeed, the Government accepted that Bord Telecom Éireann have, since their establishment, built on the large-scale capital investment in the telecommunications area over the past number of years to make major advances, but they also recognised that, in tandem with these advances, there seemed to exist a serious level of public grievances.  These grievances embraced not only telephone accounts but other matters such as service and connections as well.  In such a situation, where such a large number of public complaints arise, the Government rightly decided to utilise the Ombudsman whose primary role, as I have said, is to seek redress on behalf of citizens in their dealings with bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>An Post would also be included within the Ombudsman's proposed remit.  I think it is only right to say that the level of complaints in relation to An Post does not seem to be comparable with that in <Col N="1412" /> the telecommunications area.  It is, however, appropriate that the remit should embrace An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann, since both bodies were established at the same time and since their operations have such an important and immediate impact on the public in the postal and telecommunications area as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, have decided that the proposed extended remit is the most appropriate one by reference to the resources available and the priority areas arising.  It is proposed that the new remit would take effect from 1 April 1985.  This is to allow the Ombudsman to recruit and train the additional staff required.  He is, as the House is aware, already deeply involved in the Civil Service area and he needs a certain breathing space before he takes on the major additional responsibility envisaged.</P>
    <P>In relation to health boards, the Ombudsman's remit would not cover actions involving the exercise of clinical judgment.  The primary purpose of the Ombudsman's is to investigate administrative malpractice, not clinical judgments reached by doctors and others as a result of their professional medical expertise. The exclusion of clinical judgment reflects the clear view of the all-party committee to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the reserved functions of elected members would be excluded from the Ombudsman's remit in the local authority area.  These functions are essentially policy matters and would not be appropriate for investigation by the Ombudsman. Their exclusion reflects the practice followed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and, I understand, other administrations.</P>
    <P>With these exceptions, the whole area of health board and local authority administration, which impacts so much on the public at large, will be open to investigation by the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the expansion now envisaged in the Ombudsman's remit is a major one.  That is not to say, however, that further additions could not be made to this remit as appropriate.  This is a matter which I intend to keep under <Col N="1413" /> review.  I also intend to review later, as necessary, the underlying legislation under which the Ombudsman operates. If the Ombudsman's remit is extended as now proposed, his responsibilities would embrace a vast area of the public service. While I have no reason to anticipate it, it may be that experience of his operations in these areas could indicate the need for some changes in the relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>I think it would probably be best if both reviews were carried out together at the one time.  I consider that it would be wrong now to indicate a definite time-scale for these reviews but it might be appropriate to start them about eighteen months hence.  I will, of course, take immediate action on any specific matter arising which requires my urgent attention in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of the proposed expanded remit will depend, to a great extent, on the co-operation which the Ombudsman receives from the organisation, and indeed each individual member of their staffs, involved.  I have no reason to believe that such co-operation has not been forthcoming to date. This, to my mind, is a tribute to the way in which the Ombudsman has approached his task.  It also reflects well on the attitude of the Civil Service.  I would expect and, indeed, have no doubt that this attitude will be reflected in the bodies covered by the proposed extended remit.  I need hardly say, however, that any absence of co-operation would not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>It is very important, particularly in the context of the proposed extended remit, that the general public are made fully aware of the important work of the Ombudsman.  I am glad to inform the House that I have recently discussed this aspect with the Ombudsman.  A major publicity campaign to this end, which may have come to the attention of Deputies, has just now been launched.</P>
    <P>I intend to come back to the House in the new year with proposals for some further changes in the Schedules to the Ombudsman Act, 1980.  Basically, these changes will be aimed at bringing the <Col N="1414" /> Schedules up to date &mdash; to take account of the establishment of new bodies and other matters since the original 1980 Act. I have thought it best to treat these separately from the change proposed now in draft order before the House.  This change envisages a major extension of the Ombudsman's remit and is one deserving the full consideration of the House in its own right.</P>
    <P>I also look forward to debating in the House in the new year the forthcoming report of the Ombudsman which, I am sure, we are all awaiting with interest.</P>
    <P>During the debate on this matter in the other House last week, the point was made that the draft order involved not just an extension of the Ombudsman's remit.  It was an extension of democracy. I think that this comment went to the heart of the issue.  I am glad to have helped by taking action to increase the protection of the public against administrative malpractice.  As a public representative, I have always firmly believed in the right of the public, who after all are the ultimate payers, to receive fair treatment at the hands of the bureaucracy.  I am sure that this is a view which is shared by my fellow public representatives in the House.</P>
    <P>Motion No. 4 asks the House to take note of my decision to add Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post to the schedule of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  The Joint Committee asked me earlier this year to take such action and I am glad to comply with their request.  The necessary procedures as indicated in the Orders of Reference of the Joint Committee have been complied with.  It is appropriate that these commercial State-sponsored bodies should be included within the ambit of the joint committee.  I commend the two draft motions to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago when speaking on the amending legislation in this area I said that it should be extended without delay to local authorities, health boards, non-commercial State-sponsored bodies and to some other areas, including <Col N="1415" /> An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann. There has been no delay and I welcome both the motions before us today.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note also the date of the coming into operation of the extension. I remarked on the last day on which we discussed this matter that the extension had been delayed for a number of years. I cannot blame the present Minister for that.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion too, and also during discussion of the matter in the Seanad last week, the point was made that the ordinary public consider administrative injustices whether at local government, health board, State-sponsored body or any other level, as being a matter for the State and that they do not distinguish as between the clauses in the Ombudsman legislation.  In other words, they fail to realise that the Ombudsman's authority extends only to certain areas. However, we can all be happy that in future the Ombudsman will be in a position to investigate matters relating to many other arms of the State.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister, I shall be anxious to read the first report of the Ombudsman. Undoubtedly the report will illustrate certain administrative injustices that have been inherent in the system for a number of years.  In some of his recent statements the Ombudsman highlighted one matter which any active public representative would be familiar with, that is, the 1953 Social Welfare Act whereby thousands of people without them realising it were removed from the social welfare code.  Apparently they were never informed that they could have continued as voluntary contributors.  I shall be interested in hearing the suggestions of the Ombudsman in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust that the Minister will seek an opportunity of having the report debated here.  In recent weeks we have spent a lot of time debating matters that are of much less importance.  After the report has been debated the next step is to bring in amending legislation to deal with the injustices, the anomalies and the discrepancies that may be highlighted in the report.  Perhaps it has been because of <Col N="1416" /> legislation being interpreted in different ways that the anomalies and so on have arisen, but it is for the House to make the necessary amendments in legislation as soon as possible; otherwise, the whole exercise would be a total waste of time. The Minister seems to be concerned genuinely with ensuring that the grievances of citizens are dealt with properly.</P>
    <P>Following the debate in the House on the last occasion there seemed to be some hysteria on the part of the chief executive of Bord Telecom.  In my remarks I was concerned solely with a situation in which all of us as public representatives were receiving numerous complaints about, among other matters, the billing system of the board.  In other countries the Ombudsman is involved in that area. Outside experts are called in to examine the various procedures and to ascertain whether there are irregularities in the system.  Regardless of whether some of the executives of Bord Telecom are so aware, their billing system is a cause of great concern to many people.  We can no longer raise such matters here because of the board being semi-State.  While the parliamentary question process has many disadvantages, at least it enables us to come here and raise individual cases in the knowledge that they will be investigated. Now if one puts down a question in relation either to Bord Telecom or to any other semi-State body, one is informed by the Ceann Comhairle's office that the matter is outside the function of any Minister and consequently cannot be dealt with by way of parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>I think we all agree that Bord Telecom are doing a fairly good job but it would be rather odd if they were to regard themselves as being outside the authority of anyone.  In their own interests they should not react so violently to comments that are made here in the interest of those whom we represent.  I fail to understand why when anyone here utters a word of criticism about that semi-State body certain individuals take great umbrage.</P>
    <P>It would not be my wish that the Ombudsman would have the task of dealing with thousands of complaints about <Col N="1417" /> telephone bills but I understand that in other countries there are set down formulae and standards relating to telephone account billing systems and that these enable people to at least do some kind of check themselves rather than the Ombudsman having to check each case.</P>
    <P>The advantage in regard to this motion compared with other motions which come before the House is that the necessary finance is provided in the 1985 Estimate. In addition, the Minister has set down clearly the date for the implementation of the amended legislation.  That procedure is to be welcomed.  Obviously, for whatever reason, the Minister has issued a warning somewhere that delays will not be tolerated.  He must have his reasons for that because he would hardly expect people to be delaying deliberately such an important matter.  He indicated on both the last occasion and today that there have been delays.  If that is the case it is worth clearing up the matter now.</P>
    <P>The only people I can think of who might not wish to co-operate are the county managers who have such massive powers and control and who perhaps would not wish the Ombudsman to have the power to check some of the rather peculiar decisions they make.  It is of considerable importance that such decisions can be investigated.  Perhaps county managers would not be prepared to co-operate with the Ombudsman to the same extent as other people in the public service might co-operate.</P>
    <P>The workload of the Ombudsman and his staff must be extremely heavy and in these circumstances the appointment of the additional staff as outlined by the Minister is to be welcomed.  During 1984 the Ombudsman dealt with almost 1,000 cases so it is obvious that he has a case for extra staff.  I welcome, too, the Minister's statement regarding the launching of a public media programme to make people aware of their entitlements.  However, it must be set out clearly that the Ombudsman is not to be used in every local authority and health board case where a person considers he has a grievance by reason of not being given a house or a medical card or in cases of some local <Col N="1418" /> authority systems in respect of which people often have grievances in relation to welfare officers, health officers and various local authority inspectors who deal with the public on a daily basis. People are often unhappy with findings of these officers.  If people were to stop referring to the guidelines for obtaining medical cards, houses and so on and bring all these cases to the attention of the Ombudsman it would damage the service for which the office was set up.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that any publicity campaign should clearly set out that the function of the Ombudsman is to deal with legislative or administrative injustices and not to change regulations which are clearly set out in explanatory leaflets available from local authorities and health boards.</P>
    <P>The public service is doing a very important job and the Ombudsman is part of this service.  A lot of people see the public service as being a bureaucratic administration against the ordinary citizen but the findings of the Ombudsman in most cases show that the interpretation of the regulations and of the legislation by various officials is correct.  However, it is important that a person can have a check so as to ensure that he is not being treated shabbily.</P>
    <P>In relation to An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann no doubt the findings of the Ombudsman as a result of any complaints will follow the same pattern and the officals will be found to be correct.  There have not been many complaints about An Post which is giving an excellent service. The Minister said the last day that the level of complaints to the Ombudsman by people who are not aware of his present remit in relation to the health boards is not very high either, but the local authorities area is one where citizens would bring many cases.  From my experience of Dublin Corporation, complaints about the interpretation of the regulations that govern the allocation of houses and flats in the city would keep a number of ombudsmen busy.  I hope these complaints will not smother the Ombudsman with papers relating to decisions that he cannot change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> I welcome these motions that the Minister has brought before the House and I welcome the Minister's commitment that if further regulations or amendments are needed the 1980 schedules will be updated in the new year to cover new organisations.  I could argue that these schedules should be extended further to cover non-commercial State-sponsored bodies and I could put some arguments in relation to the clinical area of medicine. However, I agree that to put clinical judgments in the hands of the Ombudsman would mean that he would have to bring in expert people and that that would be a duplication.  As in other countries, the whole area of medical investigation will expand, but I hope that we will not get into the area of clinical investigation to the extent that they do in the States and in Canada and in some other European countries where almost every time something goes wrong with a patient a case of malpractice is brought, involving solicitors, insurance companies and other experts.  If clinical investigation were brought into the ambit of the Ombudsman it might entice people to bring that sort of case.  The Ombudsman should deal with administrative rather than medical areas.  In some of the Canadian states where the ombudsman has clinical powers it brings his functions and role into disrepute.  That would not be liked by the medical profession here, so I support the Minister's decision to keep clinical judgements out of the Ombudsman's ambit.  I would ask the Minister to consider at some later stage the position of the other State-sponsored bodies so that when we see how the health boards and the local authorities get on they could be considered for addition to the list, if not in 1985 then soon afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the previous speaker in welcoming the motions before the House particularly in relation to An Post and Bord Telecom.  It is appropriate that these motions are brought together. Now that these two bodies are outside of what was formerly the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the two groups <Col N="1420" /> that can keep an eye on them are the Ombudsman, as a result of the passing of this order from next April, and the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies. We all welcomed the setting up of the office of the Ombudsman and from all reports the decision to set up the office was a felicitous one and a lot of good will result from it.  We look forward to seeing the first report showing the numbers and type of cases which have been investigated and adjudicated upon.  We are all concerned with ensuring that both the public and the public servant get the best value.  The public are entitled to such service, partly because they pay for it and any such service should be provided in an effective and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said this afternoon, the public service today represents a vast organisation some parts of which were established many years ago.  There is now a need to remodel and update that organisation, bringing it more into line with the eighties.  Without being critical of it, it can be said that there is room for improvements, some of which have been initiated by the present Minister through his concern to make the public service more accessible to the man in the street, thereby ensuring that such members of the public are treated as persons who are entitled to the utmost respect and attention so that they do not feel they represent merely another statistical problem.</P>
      <P>Some innovations effected in the public service in the past year or two are to be welcomed and, hopefully, constitute a beginning only.  As we public representatives know through complaints made to us by constituents, very often it is little things that lead to many of the larger problems and on many an occasion, the mere reception of personal attention can easily sort out one's problems.  However, on other occasions bureaucratic delays and so on lead to people becoming frustrated, resorting to their local representative in order to have their problems teased out, problems which should not really come within the remit of public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall welcome the first report of <Col N="1421" /> the Ombudsman illustrating the types of problems he has been investigating and on which he has been adjudicating.  I hope this report will contain suggestions for improvements in many areas, perhaps the disbandment of certain practices the initiation of innovative ideas and reforms resulting in an overall better public service. I hope the Minister will take on board any such suggestions.</P>
    <P>The fact that the office of the Ombudsman is to be allocated additional staff will guarantee that persons' complaints are dealt with as speedily as possible, ensuring that people receive acknowledgements that their complaints are being investigated and, if it transpires that there should be a common problem obtaining, that it be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Minister today mentioned a publicity campaign.  I would hope such a campaign would ensure that certain public offices &mdash; for example, post offices and the like &mdash; would be advertised, showing telephone numbers to be contacted in case of complaint.  Some constituents have come to me with complaints and for some time I did not even know where the office of the Ombudsman was or whom should be contacted.  It is imperative that people have easy access and that when complaints are received, whether by telephone or in writing, they receive some acknowledgement.  While some such complaints may be of a somewhat trivial nature, if adjudicated on and results issued, the same problems can be avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>The extension of the remit of the Ombudsman is to be welcomed so that he will now be able to investigate complaints in regard to An Post or Telecom Éireann, health boards and local authorities. The main problem springing to most peoples minds will be that in relation to Telecom Éireann which inherited many of the problems and difficulties of the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We need only look at today's Order Paper to observe the few questions down to the Minister for Communications, whose former remit was Posts and Telegraphs, to see the number of queries Deputies are receiving, many of which are of a <Col N="1422" /> minor nature, sometimes with regard to telephone accounts, telephones being out of order or other problems encountered with the telephone service, people inquiring when they will receive telephone service and so on.  The investigation of such problems should not come constantly within the remit of public representatives, particularly in the case of a telephone being out of order.  But if a business person's telephone is out of order thereby affecting his business, then there is a duty on public representatives to inquire why it may take sometimes three or four weeks to deal with that problem, whether the excuse advanced is that of the old reliable about cabling or whatever.  Given present recessionary times business cannot afford to carry added burdens in respect of what should be their basic right.</P>
    <P>While one would hope that the changeover to Telecom Éireann will mark a fresh beginning, it must be remembered that they do inherit historical problems. It has been amply demonstrated by correspondence to date that there still remain many problems to be resolved for which we cannot necessarily blame officials of Telecom Éireann who within the resources available to them are endeavouring to do the best possible job. However, in some areas perhaps they could do that little bit better, improving on their performance even in little ways. In recent years there have been the problems in regard to An Post, Telecom Éireann and the public service generally which it has not been possible to resolve; and, if we cannot resolve the smaller problems how can we expect to resolve the larger ones?  We must ensure that certain procedures exist.  For example, if a person is concerned about his or her telephone account, certain procedures should be followed with, hopefully, an acknowledgement being issued as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that there is a duty on those providing that service to reinstate or repair, whether it be the case of an individual, an old person who may need a telephone in order to contact medical personnel or a business or firm, <Col N="1423" /> and to do so speedily.  On occasion inordinate delays occur in resolving small problems. I do not know what the problem is. Perhaps there is inordinate delay from the time a complaint is received to the time it reaches the engineers or technicians on the ground because of lack of communication or something else along the way.</P>
    <P>While hoping it will not be necessary for the Ombudsman to investigate every individual complaint I am sure he will receive many queries with regard to telephone accounts, of which there are so many at present and, despite assurances on the part of Telecom Éireann, there must be something going wrong somewhere along the line, whether it be their computers or whatever going out of order.  I heard of a case recently in which a person was billed two or three times for the same call made on one day, which call was trebled on the same bill. Obviously, if such errors can happen, so can others.</P>
    <P>With the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman to these other areas, particularly with regard to Telecom Éireann, hopefully he or one of his officers will be able to investigate the practices in operation with regard to complaints received by members of the public, how they are dealt with and how such procedures can be improved on.  At times people may report that their telephones are out of order and technicians arrive the same afternoon while others, even businesses, doing likewise do not see an engineer or technician for over a month. In such cases there must be a breakdown in communications.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman to those new boards, the health boards and local authorities, in investigating individual or group complaints thereby guaranteeing an improved service for all.  In the light of the first report I hope there will be suggestions and recommendations about certain practices which will be followed by a response from the Government or from individual Ministers.  The public deserve an efficient and effective service, <Col N="1424" /> no more and no less than would be given if they were paying directly over the counter.  Operations must be carried out on a commercial basis and there must be a resultant benefit to the public.</P>
    <P>As a member of the committee I welcome the new terms of reference of the committee in relation to these two boards.  The committee were set up in July 1983 and since October of that year have met 42 or 43 times.  They have done a certain amount of good work and, apart from the Ombudsman, the committee are the only body which can render the board and their operations more accountable. Much public money is being spent on these bodies and, in the light of results from some of them, we have to be careful about how they operate and perform. A stringent watch must be kept on the expenditure of public money and services provided to the public.  Any wasteful expenditure of public funds must be eliminated. The committee have issued one report and have examined a number of bodies.  We are concerned to ensure that the public get a certain return.  Some of the bodies have performed quite well and some are obviously meeting difficulties. Serious questions have arisen in relation to some of the uses to which public money has been put.  In future the Government and individual Ministers will have to look carefully at the operations of these boards to see that the public are getting a good return.</P>
    <P>Similarly the committee are responsible for examining the operations of these bodies and it is important that the reports of the committee should be considered. Ministers must ensure that the people chosen to serve on these boards are efficient and competent.  In relation to the OIE report, individuals admitted that decisions were taken which would not have been taken if their own money rather than public money was being used. We must ensure that people are even more viligant when using public money than they would be in relation to their private funds.  This has not been the case.</P>
    <P>I hope that with the setting up of various committees it will not be necessary to go to Ministers repeatedly for <Col N="1425" /> permission to do this or that.  The House should have the opportunity to discuss these reports.  We submitted a request some months ago for a debate on the OIE report but is has not yet been acceded to.  In relation to the operation of these hotels and restaurants serious questions have come to light about how money was spent and decisions were reached.  While it may be too late to do anything about that operation, there are lessons to be learned for other State-sponsored bodies since we must ensure that the public get an efficient and effective service and a return for the money which is being pumped into these bodies.  The Government and this House must be concerned at the operations of some of these agencies. Some of them were set up many years ago and may have outlived their usefulness.  Their objectives may need to be redefined and brought up to date.</P>
    <P>I hope these few comments will be taken on board by the Minister who is always responsive to any suggestions.  I welcome the two motions.  It is clear that the operations of the Ombudsman have been successful so far.  It is important that the process does not become snarled up so that it becomes another link in the bureaucratic chain.  The Ombudsman's office must be able to come up with reports, recommendations and suggestions. The solving of individual problems is in itself a success but greater success would be achieved if these problems could be avoided in the future by changes in practice or codes, by a quiet word from the Ombudsman to a Department or by a suggestion in the report upon which the Minister can act.  We are looking for a better and improved service and I hope this will be ensured by the passing of these two motions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome both these motions regarding the extension of the Ombudsman's duties in relation to Telecom Éireann and An Post and the inclusion of both bodies within the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  I thank the Minister for including these organisations because he admitted in the <Col N="1426" /> Seanad that there was great disquiet, particularly in relation to Telecom Éireann and their accounts system.  There have been numerous debates over the years in relation to the inadequate billing system. Members of this House and the public have very little recourse to complain about this organisation because it was taken out of the political spectrum when vesting took place on 1 January last.  Since that date all Deputies and Senators have been inundated with complaints regarding the accounts system.  The Minister for the Public Service mentioned that in the region of 100,000 active complaints or queries on accounts had been received so far</P>
      <P>When the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were responsible for this service the public had recourse to Members of the Oireachtas to air their grievances but there is no facility now for the public to do so.  The Ombudsman will now have the responsibility to take on board complaints regarding the working of Telecom Éireann and An Post.  Mr Michael Mills, the Ombudsman, deserves our compliments for the fine work he has done since his appointment.  I have read many interesting reports issued by his office where serious anomalies were highlighted, particularly in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Last April I mentioned the disquiet among the public regarding the telephone accounts system.  At that stage I appealed to the Minister to make public the report on the accounts system carried out by a Swedish firm of telecommunication consultants. I should like to repeat that plea. That firm was appointed more than 12 months ago but their report has been suppressed by the Government and not made public.  That is one of the few reports that was commissioned by a Government Minister, and paid for by the taxpayers, but has not been published. The Minister should place a copy of the report in the Oireachtas Library and make it available to the press so as to allay the fears of the many subscribers who are concerned about the difficulties in relation to their telephone accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of many complaints <Col N="1427" /> about telephone accounts.  I am aware of a postmaster who, following very high telephone bills, arranged to have all calls from his telephone put through the local operator.  However, when his account arrived he discovered that he was charged for quite a number of units although that was not possible.  In spite of the fact that all his calls were operator assisted his accounts showed that he had used between 950 and 1,000 units.  That case is being investigated.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat my recommendation that Telecom Éireann arrange open days so that the public can view the meter connected to their telephone operating.  People concerned about the accuracy or efficiency of the meter in the local telephone exchange should be invited to carry out spot checks.  The system of private meters should be introduced.</P>

      <P>The Ombudsman will now have an opportunity to carry out a serious investigation of the accounts system.  I have no doubt that he will be very busy and will need a lot of assistance. The annual report of the Post Office Users' Council for 1983 outlined difficulties in relation to the accounts system. In effect, the Ombudsman is taking on board work which that council are engaged on at the present.  I understand that the council have power to appoint consultants to investigate certain matters and I suggest that they appoint such a group to go into the telephone accounts system.</P>
      <P>Very few complaints have been made in regard to An Post.  That body is operating a very efficient service.  The innovations since vesting date were welcomed by all.  However, there was a miscalculation of the demand for the special offer of 17p Christmas stamps.</P>

      <P>If the Chair was not able to get 17p Christmas stamps he would have a grievance also.  I do not believe the Ombudsman will be overburdened with complaints about that body.  However, I hope he will have power to investigate personnel problems.  The personnel of the two bodies had more security under a Minister.  I am not saying that there are many staff problems but such matters should be considered by the Ombudsman. When I was Minister of State I heard many grievances from staff.  Under the Department of Posts and Telegraphs staff could refer their grievances to a Minister who adopted a humanitarian approach.  That has been replaced by a bureaucratic system.  I am pleased that now the public and the staff will have an opportunity of highlighting any grievances they have.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman to health boards and local authorities.  There has been a tendency for the Oireachtas to hand over too much power to semi-State bodies, health boards and local authorities.  In a sense, the Oireachtas is becoming less relevant because we have set up so many organisations and distanced ourselves from the people.</P>
      <P>The people elect us to this House and we in turn elect the Government of the day, but members of semi-State organisations or chief executives are not elected and much more is expected from semi-State organisations, local authorities and health boards.  The fact that we have an Ombudsman who can be approached as a last resort to highlight grievances is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister for bringing forward these motions which are positive steps towards the restoration of democracy.  Through the Ombudsman a certain amount of democracy has been restored and the public will <Col N="1430" /> have an opportunity to highlight their grievances.  I regret that the position of Ombudsman was not created many years ago because in my first year as a councillor an ex-local authority employee never had his case heard.  He had a grievance about his pension rights but he could not get satisfaction from the Department or the local authority.  With the extension of the terms of reference of the Ombudsman he will now have the opportunity to consider cases dealing with pension rights and so on.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post will be examined by the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  I believe they will be a help to those two companies in relation to investment policy and future developments.  By approving motions Nos. 3 and 4 we are doing a very good job today and I would like to compliment the Minister for bringing them before the House.</P>
    <P>Under the Post (Telecommunications Services) Bill, 1982, Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post were set up.  I would like to draw the attention of the House and the Minister to section 34(6) which states that an election for the purpose of this section shall be held within 12 months after the vesting date or as much longer a period as may be agreed between the company and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Ombudsman may be required to investigate the reason why worker directors are not being elected within 12 months of the vesting date of both An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann. I will bring this to his attention if this matter is not resolved when the Ombudsman is given power to take responsibility for An Post and Telecom Éireann.  The worker directors and the postmasters have not been given an opportunity to elect their representatives to both boards.  If that matter is not resolved before next April it would be for the Ombudsman to resolve it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the extension of the terms of reference of the Ombudsman.  I hope before long his powers will be extended to the IDA, CTT, CIE, Aer Lingus, ESB and Bord na Móna.  If he had been involved with Irish Shipping who knows what might have happened.  We are bringing within his ambit the newest semi-State bodies, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann. Already there are a number of cases which he could deal with.  Telecom Éireann took £100 deposits last August from a large number of people, many of them old people, but have not yet provided a service.  This amounts to a cash flow free loan from people who cannot afford to be funding a large semi-State body.  In my view this is a matter for the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>As regards An Post, I know a man whose application for employment was turned down because he grew up in St. Teresa's Gardens and he got a lift in a stolen car when he was 16 years of age. How long do we operate black lists?  This young man is of very good standing in the community, is very highly recommended and does not have a criminal record.  He has not done anything wrong since he was 16 years of age.  Given the environment in which he grew up, that was a very mild offence.  If a black list can be operated against a person for the rest of his life, that might be investigated by the Ombudsman.  The powers of the Ombudsman could be extended to semi-State bodies and all areas of Government, including local government.  We must guard against involving the Ombudsman in so many areas that he becomes ineffective because that would not benefit anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister examined the British legislation but it might be desirable if, instead of examining every case sent to him, the Ombudsman had a sifting arrangement whereby people should first raise the issue with their local representative and if they did not get a satisfactory reply, they could send their complaint to the Ombudsman.  I do not want to create another layer but if the Ombudsman's terms of reference are extended to cover local authorities, <Col N="1432" /> health boards, vocational education committee and all semi-State bodies, he will not be able to see the wood for the trees. I understand that in Britain a Member of Parliament can refer an issue to the Ombudsman if he has not had a satisfactory reply from the company concerned. This ensures that only serious issues are sent to the Ombudsman.  That is something the Minister might consider.</P>
    <P>Like the Comptroller and Auditor General who reports to the Committee of Public Accounts and issues a report annually to the House, I believe the Ombudsman should also report to a Dáil committee and that committee should go through his report while he is present. Where Departments, local authorities or semi-State bodies regularly offend against the public, they should be called in before the committee and, in the presence of the Ombudsman, asked to give an account.  I do not believe the Ombudsman should issue his report and leave it at that.  His report should be referred to a Dáil committee who could review it and see if further action is required.</P>
    <P>Since the Government are considering an independent complaints procedure for the Garda Síochána, if we were to extend the powers of the Ombudsman to cover this area it might deal with the problem. As Deputy Leyden said we are setting up boards for planning appeals and so on and we are becoming increasingly remote from the people.  We have here a man who can deal very effectively with complaints against the public service.  Therefore, why not extend his terms of reference to include complaints against the Garda Síochána?  I cannot see why that is not a practical possibility.  I ask the Minister to consider this suggestion when he is again extending the terms of reference of the Ombudsman, which I hope he will be doing before long.</P>
    <P>I would like to see civil servants and public servants being encouraged to report inefficiencies in the public service to the Ombudsman.  When they come across inefficiencies they should be allowed, without penalty, to draw them to the attention of the Ombudsman and should be encouraged to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> Many of us as public representatives build up a relationship over a period with public servants and sometimes find that the best way around a problem is to take the advice of a public servant.  Indeed, many public servants abhor the complicated and difficult procedures which citizens are put through unnecessarily.  Not all public servants are happy to go along with the present system and often have good suggestions to make.  I would like to see a specific commitment and encouragement given to civil servants to report to the Ombudsman inefficiencies in matters relating to the public.</P>
    <P>I hope that we can consider extending the same powers of the Ombudsman to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  In other words, the Ombudsman would act for the public in the area of State or semi-State bodies and the Director of Consumer Affairs would act similarly in relation to the private sector.  I hope that the Ombudsman will not get himself tied up in knots, rendering him as ineffective as some consumer legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Ombudsman, who is an excellent choice, and has the confidence of the House. However, I appeal to the Minister and the House to discuss with the Ombudsman ways and means of sifting through the complaints he gets so that he will deal only with those which have been turned down through other channels.  This would mean he would be more effective and that people will have confidence in him. I commend the Minister for bringing in these motions and for extending the powers so quickly.  I hope it will not be long before we give the Ombudsman the full range of public bodies to examine as part of his responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is not often that a Minister can sit happy in the knowledge that his motion will be accepted. We know that the establishment of the Ombudsman was welcomed by all sides of the House and the character and personality of the man appointed added further delight to those of us who had felt <Col N="1434" /> the need for the establishment of such an office.</P>
      <P>To some extent we are handicapped from speaking at any great length about it in so far as what was theory for so long is practice for such a short time that we have not yet got positive results.  We look forward with eagerness and a certain amount of optimism to the report which will come before us.  Naturally, I welcome the motion to extend the deliberations of the Ombudsman to other areas.  My reason for speaking is to reinforce what Deputy Liam Cosgrave said earlier on.</P>
      <P>Every public representative knows that the country is strewn with bureaucratic victims and disasters.  Every day we meet people who have applied themselves to extracting their entitlements from the system which, because of inefficiency or lack of co-operation, they are denied. One of the greatest sources of frustration to the man-in-the-street &mdash; as there are no ladies present I will not extend it to a lady-in-the-street &mdash; derives from the fact that he feels so helpless against all the power machines which control him and over which he has so little control even though ultimately he pays for them.  In so far as the spirit of this legislation is aimed at removing a citizen's frustration we should, in tandem with the development of this office, be careful not to develop it as an office which must reside in Dublin.  More than ever nowadays people want to be able to associate a person or persons with their problems.  I acknowledge the advances that have been made whereby you can now ring a Department and ask for the civil servant with whom you are dealing and where members of the public can be referred to identifiable people in the Civil Service. However, we still have a long road to travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody referred earlier to the practice of making complaints to the Ombudsman by letter or by telephone. That is not the best way for someone who is not skilled in letter writing or in articulating his problem.  We are concerned about the people who do not have the capacity to articulate their problems over a telephone or present it on paper. <Col N="1435" /> They are able to speak at a counter and we meet people like that in our clinics. They always shy away from the suggestion that they might write or telephone about their problem.  I hope that the Minister does not see the Ombudsman's role as a reproduction of the appalling and frightening bureaucratic institutions which are already established.  That even applies to local authorities, although they are at last becoming aware of the fact that they should have local offices.  I remember the time of the great controversy regarding the centralisation of Dublin Corporation in offices at Wood Quay.  I was not as concerned as other people about the nature of the soil on which the offices were being built or about the fact that there were archaeological digs taking place on the site; I was concerned about the fact that the people who are paying for the service in Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Ballymun, Swords or Rathfarnham would not have access to this office, that they would need a day to come in.  The best service of all is where you can discuss your problem at a counter. I know that the Ombudsman cannot have counters in every area but I hope it is envisaged that his office will be decentralised; otherwise I cannot accept what the Minister has said that this is an extension of democracy.</P>
    <P>I know Ministers have to be cautious and that they cannot antagonise individuals or institutions.  The Minister said that the Ombudsman is the friend of the public but not the enemy of bureaucracy. If he is not the enemy of bureaucracy we must presume he is the friend, but if the Ombudsman is pursuing the interests of the offended person, <i>pro tem</i> at least he will have to appear to be the enemy of bureaucracy.  He must attack bureaucracy if he is to secure for the offended person the rights that have not been given to him.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be too apologetic about whose toes are tread upon. We all know that at times certain elements of the bureaucratic system are insensitive to the needs of the people whom they were established to serve.  In <Col N="1436" /> attacking them at times we must appear to be their enemy because those elements in bureaucracy are not doing what is correct. Where a bureaucrat is not acting in accordance with his duties and responsibilities he is our enemy and we will attack him for what he is doing or is not doing if it is not in accordance with his duties. Further, if he insists on continuing on that course it is our responsibility to have him or her removed elsewhere.  For far too long we have shown a concern for people who are not operating in the way expected of them.  We do not owe them any apologies.  They are the servants of the people to whom the Minister for Finance must go to collect money.  The least the bureaucrat should do is to perform his duties with efficiency and sympathy. The Ombudsman cannot be the friend of bureaucracy and of the person whose rights have been denied because of a lack of proper interpretation of those rights.</P>
    <P>I am linking my final point with something said by Deputy L. Cosgrave earlier. The Minister said that all organisations both in the public and private sectors make mistakes and are capable of improvement.  That is a fact of life.  The Ombudsman and his office will not be immune.  It is a human institution and perhaps we should be considering what vigilance the Ombudsman might want from us with regard to charting a course for him.  I am not expecting that the Ombudsman will come to us and tell us he wants to decentralise a certain service. We should be able to indicate from our experience what we know is desirable.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Ombudsman will have a three-fold increase in staff.  Where he had one senior investigator and three others he will now have an additional 12 staff members.  I am happy the Minister has succeeded in getting the necessary financial provision for that.  Far too often we have heard Ministers come here and tell us what is desirable and necessary, that they intend introducing various measures but that unfortunately the appropriate financial provision is not made.</P>
    <P>With regard to recruitment, the Minister has said that the people appointed will <Col N="1437" /> be of the highest calibre.  I remember years ago when I had the honour and pleasure of sitting on interview boards and often I had to contend with my colleagues that high academic qualifications, even in respect of teaching, did not necessarily guarantee that that person was the best available.  I would not presume to indicate to the Minister what criteria should be laid down for the appointments in this case but from my experience I would be happy to advise him that I would not base selection on high academic qualifications.  I could argue that a knowledge of or a degree in law might help, that a person who had studied psychology and politics might be a worthwhile candidate, but I would also argue that a person without either qualification might be the better investigator and better officer.</P>
    <P>I am not at all suggesting that the people selected should be the appointees of the Minister, even though in many cases those people might be as good as anybody else.  I hope that when the advertisements are being issued it will not be a <i>sine qua non</i> that the successful candidate should have an honours degree in A, B or C.  I hope that there will be an interview board where the suitability of the person in dealing with the public will be the key factor.  We will assume that the person has intelligence and the other qualifications but the people for whom we are catering want initially a sympathetic ear. Those of us who hold political clinics know that often by listening to a constituent we can send him away happy, although I am not saying we can solve his problems.  What is needed is somebody who will respond to the person who seeks help rather than somebody who just tells him the cold, legalistic position.  That will not serve the spirit or purpose of the legislation that gave rise initially to the establishment of the Ombudsman and to the worthwhile motions introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I will not follow the usual fashion of castigating Telecom Éireann.  Some years before Telecom Éireann were established I had a personal problem in trying to convince the Department of Posts and <Col N="1438" /> Telegraphs &mdash; we were in Government at the time &mdash; that the fact that my telephone had been linked to the public telephone in the local public house for a fortnight &mdash; which they knew &mdash; indicated that the bills they sent to me were not the correct ones.  It took me a long time to convince them but, happily, they gave me some credit.  Since the establishment of Telecom Éireann I have had occasion to write to the chief executive officer and, even though I got the same reply that is sent to everyone, I do not condemn him in the way that has become fashionable. In this computer age appalling situations are arising because of demands in respect of telephone calls that are not made.  If Bord Telecom Éireann would admit that it is due to the peculiarity of the system of computerisation they have introduced rather than try to defend themselves, there would be far less criticism of them. Therefore, one does not regret that the remit of the Ombudsman has been extended to them, but they are not the only institution that occasion injustice and botheration to the public.  Anticipating the Ceann Comhairle's eternal vigilance I will only say that if I had my way there is one area to which I would have the attention of the Ombudsman extended, and that is the appalling injustices that happen under our legal system. I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I do not think this House will ever have the key to the presentation of problems. I must say with a certain envy that I am amazed at the rapidity with which Gay Byrne can have a problem solved as against the painstaking efforts I would have to exert to do likewise.  It causes me to think.  My only answer is that people fear Gay Byrne because of the publicity. It is not that they accept him as an endearing man: they fear the ability he has to expose them.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we here are doing an injustice to ourselves.  Up to some years ago there is no doubt that there was a certain response to the prospect of a matter being raised in the House.  That is as it should be because this House must always be the court of final appeal.  Those people responsible for injustice or omission must <Col N="1439" /> fear this House.  I do not think that is the case now and it is regrettable.  What is proposed here, as the Minister said, is an extension of democracy and we, as parliamentary elected representatives, should examine our position.  More power to Gay Byrne and other personalities in the media because, I suppose, the pen is mightier than what we can say here.  They are able to have these matters resolved.  Perhaps the Ombudsman, a good media man, will be able to do the job better than we can, but the elected Members of Parliament should always have the biggest clout in these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party and my own behalf I not only welcome what the Minister is doing by these two motions but congratulate him for the welcome, human and very simple but fundamental improvements he had made in attitudes in the public service since he was appointed Minister to that Department.</P>
      <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies I am thankful to the Minister for his response to our request that An Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post would be brought within the responsibility of the committee.  That is beneficial because semi-State bodies know they will be expected to give a public account of their actions to the taxpayers through the committee who are subject to this House which, as Deputy Tunney pointed out, is the ultimate arm of democracy here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long held the belief that the Scandinavian system of politics is the finest in the world.  They have given western democracies, especially, many good leads, and their concept of an ombudsman is the greatest benefit they have conferred on any democracy.  Though we introduced it belatedly, I welcome the Act that appointed the Ombudsman here.  When the appointment was first made I was critical of the concept that it should not extend to local authorities and health boards.  As everybody interested in such affairs would be, I am delighted <Col N="1440" /> that these two sectors of local government are to be brought under the microscope.</P>
    <P>For many reasons, the Ombudsman is a most important arm of democracy. Week after week, public representatives hear thousands of complaints from constituents throughout the country against the many forms of bureaucracy.  I often smile when I hear that word being used. We call people bureaucrats because they do not meet what we are looking for and appear to be too rigid, though 99 out of 100 of them are very human and cooperative people and can help to ease problems.  I suppose it is human nature that we all tend to highlight those with whom we do not succeed.</P>
    <P>In spite of the best endeavours of people in the public service to answer a very demanding public there is in some quarters a residual attitude that they are there for the benefit of the public but not there to serve the public.  Therefore, when we make representations we tend to get the &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; approach, with much cover up.  On many occasions we go with serious distressing complaints many of which have caused great emotional distress to people and their families, but when we go to an authority &mdash; I speak particularly about the health boards because by the very nature of their operations they deal with people in hospitals &mdash; it is very difficult for public representatives to get satisfactory answers to complaints by citizens and sometimes we are put in the invidious position of having to raise the complaints in public which only exacerbates the hurt, sensitivity and the embarrassment of the individuals or families who raised the complaints in the first instance.  That is why the Ombudsman has a vital role to perform and that is why it is crucial and pressing that the Minister's undertaking to introduce a publicity campaign to highlight the existence and the work of the Ombudsman is very welcome.  It should be done as soon and as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>As somebody who is an advocate by my training as a trade union official I can say that when you go to make complaints <Col N="1441" /> or submissions sometimes you come up against a stone wall.  There is nothing so effective in redressing grievances or complaints as the knowledge on the part of civil servants or public servants that their actions will be subject to the most minute and professional scrutiny by somebody as competent as the Ombudsman and his staff.  Civil servants can fob off public representatives who cannot get the necessary background or detail to enable them to articulate the grievance fully and carry it through to the end.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion made by previous speakers that the Ombudsman should make a report to this House every year.  The present Ombudsman was the most excellent choice which could have been made.  That is agreed by all sides of the House because of his manner, his disposition, his training and his general outlook.  So far as possible his staff should be endowed with the same virtues.  That kind of collective image of the Ombudsman and his staff should be brought very much into the perception of the public.</P>
    <P>No area of public life should be kept from the Ombudsman.  I am talking about the Garda and the Army.  It may be said that, for reasons of security, secrecy or confidentiality, the Ombudsman should not be allowed to direct his attention to that area.  That is wrong.  It is incorrect if there is a miscarriage of justice or a breach of equity and natural justice.  I have one example in mind.  A high ranking Garda officer was dismissed apparently without any proper trial or opportunity to defend himself.  This happened many years ago and he had no redress.  I hope to raise this matter shortly.  Had the Ombudsman been there at the time the individual would have felt that his case had been examined rigorously by a competent, objective and neutral and, at the same time, friendly advocate.</P>
    <P>If it emerged that any element of security or secrecy was involved in a case the Ombudsman could have access to the information but need not necessarily disclose it in his report.  He could indicate to the person who came to him with a grievance that he had investigated the <Col N="1442" /> position and was satisfied that, in all the circumstances, justice had not been done.  That would appease any sense of hurt or grievance such a victim, if you like, felt.  Nothing adds more to a sense of hurt or grievance than the feeling that your case is not being examined fully, fairly and objectively.</P>
    <P>We should have an Ombudsman's office in each region.  This should be part of the general image.  It would be the ultimate in democracy.  I make due allowance for the fact that at times our geographical situation impinges on our nature as a people.  We tend to crib and gripe. We have a highly over-democratic population with a healthy disregard for the law and the institutions of the law.  In a democratic context that is very much to be welcomed.  Some people, because of a sense of inadequacy or bad education through no fault of their own, are afraid to go to the establishment or the bureaucracy to put their case.  If we had regional offices a local person would be there and poor or humble people could go there.  I am talking about cosmhuintir.  Perhaps I could say it better in Irish than in English.</P>
    <P>I am talking about deprived and underprivileged people who could go to these offices and pour out their grievances, imagined or otherwise, with full confidentiality and sympathy to a representative of the Ombudsman who would have the matter examined sympathically.  To me that is an essential corollary to the whole concept of the Ombudsman.  He will be in Dublin.  That kind of concept is as remote mentally as it is geographically from people down the country who would feel there was no use in going to see anybody and they had to put up with it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's intention to review on a continuing basis the remit of the Ombudsman to see where improvements can be made.  I have an unreserved welcome for the whole concept of the Ombudsman and the extension of his powers.  That is one of the greatest things this Government or any other Government could do for the people.  While welcoming the office of the Ombudsman and the move to extend his powers, my party also press upon all Ministers the need to <Col N="1443" /> examine clients' grievances against their Departments, whether they come through a TD or the office of the Ombudsman.  This would enable Ministers to be fully aware of the type of grievances which arise and eliminate them or help to redress them.</P>
    <P>We should also ensure that local authority and health board staff who deal with the public are trained to cope with the type of problems which cause clients to come to their offices.  Very often clients meet the most junior staff who are not trained to cope with clients suffering from personal hardship or depression.  In the name of the Labour Party I ask the Minister to provide a level of confidentiality for clients who, under the current system, have to discuss details of their private lives while standing in a queue.  Nobody in public life could fail to feel humiliated and upset by the system which applies in the local offices of Departments.  People have to queue or wait in a room almost in a Dickensian atmosphere.  Somebody shouts: &ldquo;What is your name?  What is your problem?&rdquo; There is very little privacy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the moves which have been made over the past ten years or so to humanise that situation.  The Minister for the Public Service is a pre-eminently practical and humane man.  I ask him to consider civilising and humanising offices where there is a one to one contact with the public.  In so far as possible, the public should be able to come into an office and do their business in private with the officer or the civil servant.  Under other European systems, clients have the privacy of an office where they can discuss their personal problems.  I ask the Minister to give more encouragement to citizen's advice bureaus which operate in the local areas.  Citizens may drop into these offices and get advice which helps them to pursue their complaints.  This immediate advice eliminates much of the distress which is caused by lack of information or by clients not providing adequate information in their own cases.  All these measures would help the office of the Ombudsman but, more important, would <Col N="1444" /> ensure that fundamental problems would be dealt with sympathetically and, where possible, eliminated.</P>
    <P>This, in turn, would enable Deputies to spend more time on research and legislation and could create a more effective form of Government.  It is to be deplored that politicians elected to Government spend most of their working week at present processing clients' grievances against the agencies of the State.  That is the tradition and culture of clientism which we have developed here.  The appointment of the Ombudsman and the extension of his powers will help to do away with that.  I congratulate most heartily the Minister for his very welcome initiative on this.</P>

      <P>Like the previous speaker, I wish to congratulate the Minister for his speed in bringing in this amendment to the Ombudsman Bill, extending the remit of the Ombudsman.  I particularly wish to refer to the extension of the writ as it appertains to local authorities. Almost 12 years ago, when I was elected to the local authority in my area, a reporter interviewing me asked how I saw my role as a local authority member.  I said that I saw myself as an ombudsperson. That was long before the terminology had come into local parlance or into our everyday life.  Essentially, local authority members spend a lot of their time in their constituencies involving themselves with the executive and housing officers and various personnel who go to make up local authorities.  I have mixed feelings on the extension of this writ.  The Minister has said, rightly, that the Ombudsman's writ will not extend to the reserve powers of local authority members.  However, might I put it to the Minister that it might be time to look at the whole county manager system, although that is not the province of this Minister.  The number of complaints by people who feel that in one way or another they are being discriminated against by local authorities has grown enormously over the past few years.  Part of this growth of discontent among those living in towns, villages and rural areas arises because they feel that <Col N="1445" /> the bureaucracy of local authorities in many instances is removed from their daily lives.  I would reject Deputy Prendergast's belief that we should not concern ourselves with problems in our local areas.  Local authority members meet the people in the towns and villages but very often one comes up against an impasse when dealing with a particular county manager.  When set up first, the local authority system envisaged a very good, vibrant working relationship between the members elected and the members appointed &mdash; that is, the elected representatives and the county manager. Together they were to run the system effectively and in many counties that is what happens.  The county manager sees the interchange of ideas and submissions put forward by the members as very useful to him in the formation of his final decisions, particularly on matters of housing allocations and various similar matters.  At times, however, county managers take upon themselves supreme powers.  They do not care to listen to, and treat with contempt, representations, statements or wishes of local authority members. This is very regrettable, but it does happen.  When the open contempt of a county manager towards the elected representatives is clearly shown, then the marriage &mdash; which was meant to be happy &mdash; of elected members and managerial persons becomes a strained relationship, one which is likely to founder at any time and end in stalemate in many instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be sorry that the Ombudsman would have to intervene in matters regarding local authorities.  At the same time, local representatives in some instances are definitely not being treated with the courtesy and respect which was envisaged in the County Managers Act when it was set up.  The Bill brought in here last year, which gave to the county manager the power unto himself alone of fixing the rate of the water charges without any reference to the views of the elected members was essentially a great negation of democracy.  At one stroke the local authority members were left in an extremely humble and, dare I say, lowly position.  If the extension of the <Col N="1446" /> Ombudsman writ does something to rectify that, that is good.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this occasion pass without extending from the Minister for the Public Service to the Minister for the Environment, to whom I say that we in local authorities want some of the powers of which we were stripped given back to us &mdash; this is highly relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is right, Deputy, but Items Nos. 3 and 4 deal with the powers of the Ombudsman and the extension of those powers.  The Minister for the Environment is not directly involved.  While the powers of the local authorities may be involved, I am clarifying that the Minister for the Environment is not involved in these two <Col N="1447" /> items.  The Deputy should confine herself to those items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers of the Ombudsman have had to be extended because, unfortunately, the powers of the local authority members have been removed. However, that is not the province of this Minister but of another.  Deputy Prendergast said that he hoped there would be regional offices of ombudsmen set up throughout the country.  I do not agree with that at all.  The aura and attraction of this office is that people see it as a court of final appeal.  If everybody along the line fails, they have envisaged in their minds this one person to whom they may refer their complaint at a higher level.  I am a great believer in decentralisation and in Government Departments being transferred down the country, but this office of Ombudsman is for a central point.  I shudder at the thought of regional offices scattered around the country. That would be a grave dilution of powers. Deputy Prendergast mentioned the citizens bureaus as well as regional offices of Ombudsmen, but that would lead to a great amount of overlapping of powers.  I agree with him about the need for privacy when one is dealing with personal matters. Would it be possible to have free postage for those who wish to write to the Ombudsman?  Postal charges might not seem to us to be enormous but there are people who may have a case to relate to the Ombudsman and postal charges could be a consideration.  Perhaps some arrangement could be made whereby there would be free postage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the idea of an accelerated publicity campaign.  I know that this has started.  I have come across people who have said they do not know who the Ombudsman is, what the office is all about, where to contact him or what kind of cases he deals with.  They say, &ldquo;But sure he would not listen to us&rdquo;.  They are very courteous in that office and of course the Ombudsman would listen to them. This publicity campaign will let people know where the Ombudsman can be contacted, precisely what areas he and his <Col N="1448" /> staff will deal with and will give them an opportunity to correspond freely, in the correct sense of the word, with him whenever they wish.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the powers to embrace the operations of local authorities.  I regret that the decline in the powers of elected members means that we have as much power as people in the street in many cases in dealing with the county managerial system.  I look forward to the first report of the Ombudsman which will be brought before the House and to hearing the diverse cases with which he will deal.  Part of the complexity of modern life has led to this facility. I am glad that in an area of stringency the Minister has been able to increase expenditure for the office of Ombudsman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One can only welcome the extension of the powers of the Ombudsman as proposed here.  It is good to see that the armament, little though it is, which is available to the private citizen is being extended in this way.  I am pleased that the Minister referred to the question of taking urgent necessary steps from a publicity point of view to bring the work of the Ombudsman and his staff much more into the public eye than has been the case heretofore.  I referred to this when speaking on the Bill before the House recently and pointed out that it was interesting that the first Ombudsman was a media person.  I welcomed this because a crucial part of his work is to ensure that the work of the office is made known to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the publicity arrangements are to be expanded.  I note that some advertisements appeared in the press recently and I hope they will achieve the desired result.  It must be an ongoing process.  As well as providing for this publicity on the availability of the Ombudsman to investigate the grievances of people, it is also important that equal care be given to ensuring that the findings of the Ombudsman in case of maladministration, inconsistent decisions, unfair decisions, delayed decisions <Col N="1449" /> and so on are brought to the notice of the public and to the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an interesting comment in his speech when he said that when injustice is done it must be put right.  I agree but as the adage says, justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.  It would not meet the situation merely for the Ombudsman and his staff, behind the scenes as it were, to discover cases of maladministration, remedy them and keep them quiet.  The findings in individual cases, without the publication of names, must be brought before the public and this House or a committee of this House for evaluation and examination.  The Ombudsman's reports must not be confined to mere statistics.  They must give examples of actual cases examined by him and his staff, details of inquiries made and of the findings.  In cases where maladministration or injustice is found the result of the intervention of the Ombudsman should be given.  I do not say that names should be published in the report but the actual case history must be published and in certain cases where the Ombudsman thinks that injustice on a wide scale has taken place, it would be of value if in the newspapers and media a brief case history was published so that people could read those reports and say, &ldquo;That is interesting; something like that happened to me and I will now refer it to the Ombudsman for remedy&rdquo;.  I would envisage it in much the same way as the excellent advertising done by the IDA where they quote specific case histories, giving the photograph of the person who received benefits and saying what was done.  I am not suggesting that a photograph should be published but the case history should be published.  That would be a valuable step forward.</P>
    <P>Publicity is essential because it is directed not only to the end of apprising members of the public of their rights and the options open to them but also at civil servants.  They will know that there is a watchdog over them to which they might, on suitable occasions, be made amenable.  The Civil Service must be <Col N="1450" /> made sensitive to the needs, requirements and rights of the citizen.  By and large they are but all too frequently there is some kind of superior air that permeates too many of our civil servants who, as the name implies, are the servants of the public and not their masters.  We as Members of this House doing our constituency work all too often hear complaints about civil servants at all different levels, central and local, of high-handedness, off-handedness, discourtesy and matters of that nature.  If it is brought home to the civil servants that the watchdog office of the Ombudsman is there, it will make them more sensitive to the needs and rights of members of the public.</P>
    <P>There is and must be a special relationship between the office of the Ombudsman and this House and the Members of this House.  It is interesting to note that in the UK the Ombudsman is known as a parliamentary commissioner, which highlights the connection and interplay that must exist between the House and the Ombudsman.  I would like to suggest for examination at some stage that a procedure be set up under which one of the Joint Oireachtas Committees would be given the function of meeting with the Ombudsman from time to time in session to discuss with him his work and to hear from him the types of cases that he is investigating.  There may be particular patterns of abuse of operation in the Civil Service, central or local, and the Members of the Oireachtas in that Joint Committee would be enabled to discuss that work with the Ombudsman at regular meetings from time to time.  Likewise the same committee who would discuss the work of the Ombudsman with him would and should also be empowered to call in for discussion appropriate civil servants to discuss with them matters that have arisen that would be of interest to them in their discussions with the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Civil Servants of all ranks, central and local, should be amenable to be called in to that Joint Committee for consultation and discussion on possible injustices and abuses that might be brought to the committee's notice following on the meetings <Col N="1451" /> with the Ombudsman.  A typical situation could be described as negligent misstatement. Very often it has come to my notice that a member of the public would go into a Government or local authority office and would be given information which later would turn out to be incorrect or incomplete.  That could cause serious hardship to a member of the public and all too often the citizen concerned finds himself unable to redress the matter.  I hope that that kind of situation will receive the special attention of the expanded office of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The extension proposed here will produce a very substantial increase in the load of the staff of the Ombudsman.  I wonder if there will be adequate gearing, even with the increased staff that the Minister proposes, to cover it.  I can visualise a massive array of complaint and referral to his office.  In that context I must say that, so far as organisation is concerned whether it be on a central or local basis, it would be essential there should be at least three or four local offices staffed by senior officials of the Ombudsman's office to which people in local or remote areas would have access. I did not hear the contribution of my colleague, Deputy Prendergast, who it seems advocated some kind of local office arrangement up and down the country. Deputy O'Rourke did not agree with that; but I do, particularly where local Government is concerned.  Not everybody can write letters or make a case, and in this special relationship that must exist between the members of public and the Ombudsman's office, the possibility of person to person contact is essential. I doubt if the staff of the Ombudsman's office will be in a position to interview potential complainants all round the country and therefore some local presence in parts of the country outside Dublin would be essential.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister has decided to include in this extension the health boards to be made amenable to the Ombudsman's work but has left out the VECs who are in a rather parallel <Col N="1452" /> situation to the health boards, being subsidiaries or associated bodies of the local authorities.  I would have thought it logical to have included the VECs in tandem with the health boards.  Perhaps that could be considered as soon as possible on some future occasion.</P>
    <P>The type of work involved in this new arena being introduced here where local authorities and health boards are concerned would be of quite a different nature from investigations of complaints regarding the Civil Service.  A degree of specialisation would be required to investigate the new type of complaint under this extension.  For that reason I would have thought that the organisation may be found to require some kind of subdivision in the office of the Ombudsman under which particular subordinates of his would specialise in each of the fields concerned.</P>
    <P>I can see the question of inquiries into matters of planning by the local authorities giving rise to considerable difficulties. Very many complaints arise in the field of planning and planning laws.  In County Dublin re-zoning of land took place on a large scale in course of the work leading up to the last county development plan. Will that kind of matter be open for examination on an objective basis by the Ombudsman and his staff?  People seek planning permission in rural areas where, apparently inexplicibly, planning permissions are obtained by some people and refused to other land owners in the same immediate area for no apparent or obvious reason.  Will such matters be open to examination by the Ombudsman and his staff?  I would hope so.</P>
    <P>Disquiet has been increasing in the public mind regarding many aspects of the operation of our planning laws and it is important that it should be known that some kind of supervisory function will be available through this extension now proposed by the Minister and that it will be open to a person aggrieved by a planning decision, be it for him, against him or whatever, to refer his complaint for an examination in context by the Ombudsman's office.  An Bord Pleanála are the final court of appeal in planning <Col N="1453" /> matters, and I do not know whether or to what extent their activities will be open to critical examination and comment by the Ombudsman.  There would be little point in the Ombudsman looking at planning decisions of a local authority and yet not having the power to look at similar decisions in the same line of country by An Bord Pleanála.  Many of the decisions in recent years of An Bord Pleanála &mdash; not the present board but the previous one &mdash; gave rise to considerable public disquiet.  In respect of many of these I would have welcomed the opportunity to have been able to refer the reports I had to an official such as the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>There arises too on this legislation the question of the appointment of the Ombudsman and some members of his staff.  I note that the new posts to which the Minister refers are to be filled by way of a special public competition.  Great care is required in the manner of the appointment of the Ombudsman and of his senior assistants.  This is because of the particularly sensitive nature of these posts.  The Ombudsman is in an especially sensitive position.  Within his remit falls the investigation of most branches of the Civil Service, local authorities, health boards, with perhaps increased powers at a later date.  It must be absolutely clear that the Ombudsman is one who will be independent in every way possible, one who will owe nothing to those responsible for having him appointed.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that a committee of this House would have some role, even if only consultative, in the appointment of the Ombudsman and his senior assistants. I am not saying that the appointments should be made by a committee of the House, but when such appointments are in the offing there should be consultation with a committee of the House so that it would be seen, at least in the public eye, that the appointments were broadly based and were not within the realm of narrowly based internal appointments on a ministerial basis.  Such a procedure would be in the interest of the Minister, of the Department and of the public.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for the general welcome they have given to the terms of these motions and for the high degree of praise they have extended to the Ombudsman for his work to date in investigating complaints into the operations of the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to remind the House that the Act provides that the Ombudsman is appointed by the President after recommendation from both Houses of the Oireachtas. So far as I recall, Deputy Taylor participated in the debate in that regard last year.  The name was put before the House by me but required the consent of both Houses before the appointment was made by the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>One could carry democracy to such an extent that it would be impossible to arrive at decisions on any issue.  At the time of the debate last year I expressed the opinion that in general it would be a poor reflection on the choice of the Government if there was not unanimous acceptance by the House of the name put forward.  I would expect that normally sufficient care would be taken to ensure that the name proposed would be found to be acceptable generally on all sides.  I had discussions with the Leader of the Opposition prior to the name being put before the House.  Some such procedure, however informal, should be adhered to.</P>
      <P>Regarding the staff who were recruited at that time, the appointments were by way of the procedure of the Civil Service Commission.  It is the intention that the additional investigatory staff be recruited in that way also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tunney correctly expressed the view that academic qualifications are not always the best criteria for determining the best person possible for certain positions.  He speculated, for instance, as to whether a qualification in law or in <Col N="1455" /> psychology or politics or some other academic area might not be regarded as a particular qualification.  In general the main qualification that would be expected of applicants for these posts would be a knowledge of the operation of the public service.  If the motion is accepted by the House the new posts will be advertised immediately.  The particular requirement will be that applicants have a specific knowledge of the operation of local authorities or health boards since the powers of the Ombudsman are being extended to these areas.  It is very important that the staff recruited are seen to be independent of the political system.  I am not sure that even a committee of the House being involved in some manner whether advisory or otherwise, would lead to as much confidence in the system as would the employment of the Civil Service Commission to make the appointments after public advertisements.  In that way those appointed are responsible to the Ombudsman rather than to any Department or Minister.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the necessity for an advertising or publicity campaign for the purpose of informing people of the existence of the Office of Ombudsman. Since this point was raised here some weeks ago an extended advertising campaign has been embarked on.  I posed the question earlier today as to whether Deputies had noticed increased advertising in this regard.  As recently as the weekend I noticed some such advertisement on television.  It is the intention of the Ombudsman's office to conduct a fairly big campaign in relation to the supply of posters to public offices and to other places which the public normally would frequent. This advertising campaign is funded under a subhead of the Vote of the Ombudsman which is moved by me in the House, but the advertising campaign is ultimately decided on by the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the contribution of Deputy Liam Cosgrave when he referred to the fact that often the question of personal attention to the individual member of the public who comes to deal <Col N="1456" /> with the bureaucracy does not appear to impinge so much on the consciousness of the person working inside the bureaucracy as it does on the individual member of the public.  The words he used were that little things cause big problems.  I went out of my way in my introductory remarks to say that in general the public service have served this country very well over the years and many fine people are employed within it.  As happens in very many large organisations, they come to find it difficult to appreciate the areas which cause problems to the public and the greatest problem which the general public experience is the bureaucracy itself, its size and anonymity.  That is why we made a number of changes in the last number of years regarding the personalising of individuals working in the bureaucracy. I hope that that has gone some way towards helping people to find the service more personalised.  Civil servants are now personally identified and this has given them greater satisfaction in the conduct of their jobs.</P>
    <P>I found it very difficult to persuade the Civil Service of the reality of small problems.  Very often small problems frustrate or dishearten members of the public.  These problems would be regarded by people working in the system as little things but they cause major problems to the ordinary person if he does not know his entitlement, if he does not know where to have access to offices to obtain information about entitlements or to have forms completed, if he does not know how to go about pressing a complaint or if he feels that he cannot have a confidential hearing of his affairs.  All these things add up to a sense of frustration and helplessness.</P>
    <P>I have often described one aspect of the role of public representative as being the obligation to stop the relentless grinding of the enormous cogs of the bureaucratic machine and turn the cogwheel back to extract for that machine a file and identifying that file as being about an individual, to be considered more on the basis of an individual with a problem <Col N="1457" /> than as another file with a number.  The Ombudsman has a facility to do just that.</P>
    <P>In many of the cases addressed to the Ombudsman an informal contact between his office and the offices involved has been able to resolve the complaint. That reflects credit on the civil servants with whom the Ombudsman dealt during the course of the last year, because of their ability to respond quickly and to recognise the Ombudsman's role and responsibility and to be able to come up with a positive response to his inquiries. In that regard the sum total of his inquiries, especially into the more difficult and intractable cases with which he dealt over the first year will form the subject matter of his annual report.  The Act provides that that report should be laid before the Houses.  I have separately given a positive commitment that when the annual report is available I will, by way of motion here, ask the House to take note of that report so that there will be positive discussion both here and in the other House on the provisions, reporting and recommendations contained in the Ombudsman's report.  I hope that that more than covers the points raised by some Deputies when they suggested that there should be some Oireachtas committee who would regularly meet with the Ombudsman so as to ascertain from him a report as to his progress. The statutory requirement of the publication of an annual report and the commitment given that that report will be discussed in the House will mean that there will be the fullest of opportunities to discuss the findings of the Ombudsman on an annual basis.  The Act also provides for the Ombudsman to make special reports from time to time more frequently than annually on a generality of topics or on a special topic if he feels that it is of sufficient importance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden made a number of points which are more particular to the Minister for Communications in relation to his contact with Bord Telecom Éireann and to An Post than they would be to me in my proposing of an extension of the Ombudsman's remit to the two telecommunications and postal bodies but I will <Col N="1458" /> ensure that the content of the Deputy's remarks are passed on to the Minister for Communications despite my suspicion that this will not be the first time that he will have heard some of these suggestions from Deputy Leyden.  The extension of the remit specifically to Bord Telecom Éireann and to An Post is as a result of the reservations expressed by Members of the two Houses both in the course of the formal debate here in the last few weeks and since the bodies were established. There is progressively greater efficiency within the telephone system. Indeed that is to be expected after the enormous capital investment in it in the last eight to ten years.  One would have expected that there would be a radical improvement in the standard of the service. That has not always been matched by an improvement in the standard of treatment of the members of the general public in relation to their queries about billing, connections, repairs and service. One would have expected that an organisation so customer-related might become more customer-orientated when it became a commercial State body.  It is no harm to remember that courtesy costs nothing and improves the image of the body concerned.  It will be interesting to see the numbers and types of complaints made to the Ombudsman with regard to the operation of An Post which came into being on the same day as Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>I earnestly hope that one of the products of the extension of the Ombudsman's remit to the telecommunications body will be a much greater attention to and appreciation of the needs of the customer to have information supplied courteously and to have queries dealt with expeditiously.  If that happens the need for the Ombudsman to investigate an enormous number of complaints against the body will be diminished.  The remedy appears to lie very much in the hands of the people operating within those bodies about which complaints are made.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Mitchell was anxious that the remit of the Ombudsman should be extended to all of the commercial State <Col N="1459" /> bodies.  At the same time he seemed to have reservations lest the Ombudsman be snowed under with so many complaints he would be unable to deal with them effectively.  I am not sure that those two aspirations are reconcilable.  Initially what we have endeavoured to do is to have the Ombudsman investigate queries in relation to the Civil Service and then, as of now and on foot of an earlier commitment, progressively extending that to the health boards, local authorities, and to these two State bodies which have so many dealings with the general public.</P>
    <P>The British model, as advocated by Deputy G. Mitchell, was examined at the time the all-party committee conducted their investigations and when the legislation was passed through the House.  The model was specifically rejected because it was dependent on complaints being dealt with by the Ombudsman where they had been addressed to him only &mdash; in Britain he is known as the Parliamentary Commissioner &mdash; by a Member of Parliament. It was felt that that would inhibit the system to too great an extent and would mean that very many genuine grievances by individual members of the public and complaints of malpractices might never get as far as the Parliamentary Commissioner or, in our case, the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>It is right that the basic Scandinavian model, to which Deputy Prendergast referred, was adopted here, with all members of the general public having the right of recourse to the Ombudsman if they felt they had a grievance.  I should say that Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas have referred cases specifically to the Ombudsman when they have been following up representations made to them and have found that they have been unable to see them resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant.  With the passage of time I would expect there to be a much greater recourse to the Ombudsman by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to the more difficult matters of representation referred to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> Several Deputies who spoke &mdash; in particular Deputies Leyden and Prendergast &mdash; seemed to feel that the Ombudsman should have power to investigate personnel matters, matters of grievance of employees of the bodies concerned against their employers.  That point was made previously in this and the other House in relation to civil servants.  At the time the matter was discussed initially the feeling was that the Ombudsman should not act as a type of personnel officer for the public service.  There are fairly well laid down procedures, certainly in relation to the Civil Service, very detailed and complicated procedures laid down in the last year whereby any civil servant who has a grievance may go through a series of procedures to ensure that that grievance is given the fullest attention.  I presume that a similar practice applies in the public sector bodies which will now come within the remit of the Ombudsman. However, I must say that, in view of the number of Deputies and Senators who made the point last week, I have a relatively open mind regarding such personnel matters.  I am prepared to consider when next we come to look at the extent of the Ombudsman's remit whether that area might not usefully be taken within his ambit.</P>
    <P>I am equally impressed by the remarks of the former Northern Ireland Ombudsman, now a Member of the Seanad, Senator McGonagle, when he made the point that the Ombudsman should not attempt to replace the role of the courts nor the role or duties of trade unions.  Perhaps it might be more appropriate that personnel matters be dealt with by those who represent personnel in staffing associations, as happens to a large extent at present.  It is better that the present situation should obtain for the time being.  If there is a considerable volume of belief among public servants that in their own right as employees they should have recourse to the Ombudsman, then certainly that matter can be considered but it would require amendment of the 1980 Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney, I think, was inclined to be upset at my remarks to the effect <Col N="1461" /> that the Ombudsman, while being a friend of the public, is not an enemy of bureaucracy.  In a rather black and white situation, he seemed to feel that if an ombudsman was a friend of the public he could not also be a friend of the bureaucracy. Perhaps the fault is mine by my not suggesting that he need not necessarily be an enemy of the bureaucracy.  Quite a number of complaints addressed to ombudsmen throughout the world &mdash; and I understand that in the case of ours the situation is no different &mdash; about which individuals feel aggrieved, result in the Ombudsman deciding that the bureaucrats or those operating the system had operated it fairly and impartially and that there was no validity in the complaint of an individual complainant.  That was the specific point I had been endeavouring to make: that the Ombudsman was not appointed on the basis of conducting a witch hunt against the public service or the bureaucracy and that it would be very wrong had he so been.  Rather was he appointed to ensure that fair play operates, and of course that involves both sides.  Where the Ombudsman finds that the public servants involved have operated impartially and above board, without delay, and have administered thoroughly the law or regulations as handed down to them, then he should say so and find accordingly.  That is the point I had wanted to make.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney, as did one or two others, referred to a point I made myself in this House on 25 October 1983, which was that the Ombudsman should not be seen to be and should not be exclusively Dublin-based, that he should make himself available at other local offices.  I think there is a feeling in rural Ireland that all decision-making is centralised in Dublin, that the farther one is from Dublin the more likely it is that there will be a feeling of remoteness and alienation from the decision-making system.  I often suspect that that results in Deputies from the more remote rural parts being given a far greater volume of representations to carry with them physically to Dublin, because of their regular visits here, than Deputies in parts of Dublin, because of <Col N="1462" /> the proximity of their constituents to many Departments of State.</P>
    <P>At column 656 of the Offical Report of 25 October 1983 I had this to say:</P>
    <P>I would like to think in time to come &mdash; I am expressing here a personal opinion &mdash; and in the light of experience of the operation of the office of the Ombudsman and after his remit has been extended to take in areas other than the Civil Service proper, that there might be consideration given to the establishment either of regional offices for the Ombudsman or of regional Ombudsmen who would deal mainly with problems that arise in the regions.  If that development occurred over a period of time it would radically change the perception of the public service in the minds of the public and also the role, requirements and demands placed on elected representatives in the various regions.</P>
    <P>I still hold the view that that would be an ideal situation.  I should like to think that it might be possible to achieve that in time to come.  However, in the interim I have previously suggested to the Ombudsman that I feel it would be a good idea were he from time to time to advertise the fact that he or a senior officer of his Department would be available at centres such as, say, Cork, Limerick or Galway on some designated days of the following week.  This would mean that people who had addressed complaints to him in writing to his office in Dublin and who wanted to get a personal hearing might more easily be able to attend at that temporary, regional office, or that people who felt they wanted to discuss their case personally and who would not be in a position to travel to Dublin might, through advertisement, become aware of the office being available virtually on circuit and be able to attend there.  I realise that that could be done to a limited extent only but it would help to establish on an even basis throughout the country the concept of the existence of the Ombudsman and his powers.  I do not think it would be necessary <Col N="1463" /> always for the Ombudsman himself to attend at these offices; some of his senior investigators from time to time over the course of a year could usefully carry out that function.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Act to recompense witnesses who travel to give evidence to the Ombudsman, both in relation to travelling expenses and in respect of lost time and I gather that provision was included in the legislation specifically to ensure that people would feel they could pursue a case with the Ombudsman without its interfering with their income.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney and others referred to the handling of representations from Members of the House and some Deputies referred to representations coming to them from members of the general public.  I referred earlier to the proposed White Paper on improvements in the public service and I would hope that two of the areas which would be addressed in the White Paper would be the announcement of a much improved method by which Deputies could pursue representations, such as Parliamentary Questions, especially in respect of individual cases with the Departments of State and also an improved and more efficient method of processing complaints addressed to Departments by members of the general public.</P>
    <P>I would hope those proposals would meet some of the reservations and regrets of Deputy Tunney.  He seemed to regret that the ability of a Member of the Oireachtas to see a case resolved satisfactorily had lessened and seemed to feel that Mr. Gay Byrne was in a position to achieve much more speedily the resolution of complaints addressed to him.  I rather facetiously wondered whether the solution might not be to have Deputy Tunney conduct Mr. Byrne's morning radio programme and have Mr. Byrne represent the people of Finglas and Cabra and see whether that might improve the situation for Deputy Tunney.  What we need to do is ensure that the situation is improved for all members of the general public so that they do not have to write <Col N="1464" /> to Mr. Gay Byrne, and to ensure that Members of the House are able to resolve effectively and expeditiously any complaints addressed to them.  I hope that the White Paper proposals will receive a general welcome from public representatives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast spoke about the Citizen's Advice Bureaus.  They are an important adjunct to the democratic system and the work of the National Social Services Board in ensuring the progressive extension of advice centres in many parts of the country has helped to disseminate a wider knowledge of the availability of and entitlement to various schemes and programmes conducted by the State.  There are improvements which could be made which are worthy of attention.</P>
    <P>In relation to the extension of the remit to local authorities and health boards, Deputy Taylor asked why the extension had not simultaneously been designed to cover the area of the vocational education committees.  The committees, while appointed by local authorities, are not regarded as local authorities for the purpose of the legislation.  I should point out that the vocational educational committees in general provide second level education and some third level education in respect of those who operate regional technical colleges, but there are a number of other bodies and organisations such as voluntary secondary schools, community schools and community colleges providing second level education.  I felt it would not necessarily be right to include the vocational educational committees while other totally funded second level schools such as community schools would not be included.  The question of further extensions will need to be left until such time as there is an assessment of the level of public complaint regarding areas which are not within the remit at present and until the Ombudsman has been given a reasonable time to put into place effectively this major extension of his remit so that he is in a position to pursue complaints made to him by the public in relation to these four additional areas, as well as the area of the Civil Service where he <Col N="1465" /> has been operating since the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>Motion No. 4 is on foot of a specific request by the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies to allow them to conduct if they see fit investigations into the two bodies concerned.  This is an important committee and as well as considering the report on Irish Shipping and Údarás na Gealtachta I understand they are initiating examination of Bord Gáis Éireann, RTE, ESB and Irish Life. The work of the members of the committee is very much appreciated by the Government and I was happy to be able to respond, following consultation with the Ministers for Finance and Communications and the Leader of the House, to the request from the committee that their terms of reference be extended to allow them to investigate Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post.</P>
    <P>The response by Members of the House to these two motions has been very favourable.  I thank Members for the welcome they have given and the useful suggestions which I and the Ombudsman will find helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> This Bill will enable the Minister to introduce regulations for the proper grading and packaging of potatoes.  I would ask him to ensure that this new system starts smoothly.  Every possible advice should be made available by ACOT and there must be close working arrangements between the officers of the Department and the ACOT advisers.  The advisory programme must focus on two major shortcomings at consumer level, mechanical damage to potatoes and disease of potatoes.  I hope the Minister will give the House some indication of the regulations to be introduced under section 5.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to potato co-ops. I hope such organisations will receive positive support from the Minister and that grants will be made available through FEOGA for the promotion of those co-ops. The Government should make the necessary funds available to such groups on a pound for pound basis.  It does not seem likely that that will happen because an enormous amount of money has been left unclaimed by the Government in Brussels.  I accept that the Minister of State is concerned about the promotion of the potato industry and the setting up of co-ops and I hope he will ensure that the necessary funds are made available.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that the Bill provides for a system of registration of all who grow and pack potatoes for sale.  He went on to point out that in future it will be illegal to sell potatoes other than those grown or packed by registered growers and packers.  How does the Minister propose to ensure that potatoes will come from a registered grower and are packed by a registered packer?  I presume that grading standards will be laid down by the Department but, in the event of a dispute between the official of the Department and the farmer, who will arbitrate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> It is important that we ensure that unregistered growers do not have an opportunity to sell potatoes through a registered packer.  We are concerned at the size of the fine to be imposed.  Under section 8 the maximum fine is £1,000 and on Committee State we will consider putting forward an amendment to reduce that amount.  The amount of the fine is excessive.  We hope to be able to strengthen some of the provisions by the addition of amendments.  It is important that growers are organised.  In addition it is necessary to integrate the other main agencies concerned in the industry.  If the horticultural industry is to achieve its full potential we must ensure that it has the home market within its grasp.  The home market, unfortunately, is slipping away from native producers.  In order to achieve full potential the industry must be in a position to export.  Success in that area will leave it in a strong position to withstand any further assaults on our home market.  Our competitors are getting stronger daily and adopting more sophisticated marketing techniques.  A united and integrated approach by all concerned is needed to put the Irish potato industry into a prominent position on the home and export markets.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat disappointed that an important debate like this should be held at this stage of the evening and that the time allotted to speakers should be curtailed.  For too long issues of national importance such as this have been relegated to a time when their importance is not sufficiently underlined. The potato has been grown here for more than 350 years and it has had a profound effect on the history of the Irish economy starting with the social effect of the failure of the crop due to disease in the 1840s up to today.  As a result of its effect and influence over the years we could be forgiven for assuming that the potato crop has an importance in Irish agriculture. That is not so.  The Irish potato sector has declined in comparison to other countries, notably Holland, France and the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> Since the thirties many pieces of legislation concerning the potato have been debated here.  In fact, more than 19 different pieces of legislation were dealt with and umpteen committees met and discussed it.  As long ago as 12 December 1934 the House discussed a motion suggesting that a tribunal be established to inquire into certain definite matters of urgent public importance.  Matters affecting the potato industry were considered urgent more than 50 years ago but 50 years down the road we are still discussing issues relating to it.  I obtained that information from the Fruit and Vegetable Tribunal, Statutory Rules and Orders, 1935.</P>
    <P>Despite all the legislation impinging on the potato industry over the years there appears to have been an inherent difficulty in implementing the legislation, in policing it and ensuring that it was enforced. The potato production sector has not been developed to supply consistently ware potatoes or the needs of the processing sector.  The principal main crops grown here have traditionally been Kerrs Pinks, Records and Golden Wonders. We have the highest consumption in Europe at 110 Kilograms per head per year but our production has fallen from 136,000 hectares in 1940 to 45,000 hectares in 1980.  Thankfully, the Government in the last 12 months have recognised the problem and there have been significant developments in relation to the organisation of the industry.  Farmers were literally dumping their potatoes into the sea because they did not have any other outlet.  Producers have organised themselves on a county basis and a national organisation, the Irish Potato Farmers' Society, was registered.  That was done in conjunction with the IFA and the ICOS.  I understand that 12 co-ops are now in existence and a thirteenth is imminent in Carlow.  As the Minister told us last week, FEOGA grants are available for groups or co-ops who come together to organise the marketing and processing of potatoes.  That cannot be too strongly encouraged.  I understand that moves are <Col N="1469" /> afoot in many areas to bring such processing and marketing plants to fruition. Those concerned are to be commended.</P>
    <P>The Bill tackles some of the major difficulties in the supply of potatoes here. It is tragic to think that in a country that is synonymous with the potato we import rather than export them.  I understand that one in four potatoes consumed here last year was imported.  In fact, our dependence on imports has risen twentyfold since 1978.  In 1978 only 4,000 tonnes of potatoes were imported.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the system of Supergrass trials in the North of Ireland whereby persons are convicted of serious crimes, mainly on the uncorroborated evidence of informers as being totally alien to both Irish and British Court practice and contrary to the principles in accordance with which justice is administered throughout the democratic world, and calls on the British Government to terminate these trials and to institute an independent review of all such cases which have resulted in convictions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is signed by all members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  This is a very <Col N="1470" /> important motion because we are debating the administration of justice affecting one of the most fundamental human rights, namely, the right to freedom.  The system of supergrass trials in the Six Counties is unique in any western democracy. It involves persons, themselves convicted of serious crime, giving evidence on behalf of the prosecution, often without any corroboration, and this trial is held before one judge sitting without a jury.  Many people have been sent to jail, some of them innocent, by one judge on the evidence of an informer without any corroboration and this is the cause of much concern to people who value freedom, and is the reason for this motion.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous difference in the law as it is operated in England and as operated in the Six Counties.  In England, while accomplices are accepted as witnesses, their trials are always before a jury and it is incumbent on the judge to give a warning from the court about the danger of convicting a defendant on uncorroborated evidence, pointing out the danger of such evidence.  In England if there is no corroboration, and if the defendant cannot be connected with the crime the defendant will be set free &mdash; not so in the Six Counties.  If the judge does not give a direction to the jury about convicting somebody on the use of uncorroborated evidence, the case will be quashed in a higher court.  This is mandatory on the judge.</P>
    <P>We have a ludicrous situation in the North of Ireland.  We have the Diplock Court with only one judge who is supposed to issue a warning to himself as to the danger of convicting on this type of evidence.  This is totally illogical.  Human nature being what it is, it would be impossible for one man sitting on his own in judgment to be able to rationally discuss with himself such warning as is given in the courts in England.</P>
    <P>It is important in any trial that the witnesses should be credible.  The witnesses, the informers, so far used in the supergrass trials in the Six Counties have not been credible.  I will say a word about them later.  Lord Gifford, QC, when <Col N="1471" /> speaking about the use of accomplices in trials in England said:</P>
    <P>From the information available, there is no case in which it is clear that a person has been convicted on the evidence of a single supergrass, without corroboration from any other testimony.</P>
    <P>This is totally different from the type of justice that exists in the Six Counties.  He went on to say when speaking about the English system and comparing it to the system in the North:</P>
    <P>However, if even in a jury trial system, the practice of basing prosecutions on supergrass evidence were to be revived on a scale similar to or greater than that adopted in London in the recent past, there would be a cause for grave alarm and need for detailed research.</P>
    <P>He was referring to a number of cases in the early eighties where this type of evidence was used and where witnesses were offered immunity; although some of them were sentenced to jail terms, none of them served more than two years.</P>
    <P>In the Six Counties it is mandatory that serious offences would be tried under the Diplock Court system before one judge and no jury, unless the Attorney General decides otherwise.  A preliminary inquiry is normal in a magistrate's court but in most of the supergrass trials to date, this inquiry has been circumvented by the voluntary bill of indictment which allows the prosecution to have the case transferred without going through the magistrate's court, with the consent of either the Attorney General or the court.  This means there is no preliminary hearing and, on the evidence of one supergrass, the defendants are held for a long period until they come to trial in the higher court.  This has very serious consequences for the defendants because they spend long periods awaiting trial.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of those periods of waiting in a few of the supergrass cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> In the Christopher Black case the defendants were arrested in November 1981, the trial started in December 1982 and ended in August 1983.  This meant the prisoners were on remand for 21 months. In the case of Bennett, prisoners were arrested in May 1982 and the trial was not completed until March 1983, a period of ten months.  In the case of McGrady, the date of arrest was June 1982 and the trial was not completed until October 1983, a period of 16 months.  In the McGurk case the date of arrest was February 1982 and the trial was completed in October 1983, a period of 20 months.  In the Grimley trial the defendants were arrested in February 1982, the trial started in September 1983 and was completed in November 1983, a period of 21 months.  This must be a matter of grave concern to any right-thinking person because, in effect, it is internment without trial for many people.  At present one defendant is awaiting trial on the evidence of a supergrass and he has been on remand for over 1,000 days.  That certainly is internment without trial.</P>
    <P>Two of the judges in the North, Mr. Justice O'Donnell and Mr. Justice Higgins, were reported in the Belfast papers on 9 July and 6 April last year as expressing concern at the length of the remand. Prisoners should be brought to trial at the earliest possible time and the bill of indictment used to circumvent the Magistrates' Court is a gross abuse of any judicial procedure, particularly in this type of case.</P>
    <P>In the Republic, the evidence of accomplices has been accepted by the courts, but it is very important to point out that in our courts most defendants are still tried by jury.  However, in the Special Criminal Court three judges sit, unlike the Diplock Courts where only one judge sits.  In our courts the evidence is generally corroborated and we never have anything like the number of defendants that there are in the courts in the North.</P>
    <P>The number of defendants who are charged on the evidence of one accomplice or informer without corroborating evidence is a matter of deep concern.  In <Col N="1473" /> the Black case there were 38 defendants, in Grimley's case there were 22 defendants, in Gilmour's case there were 45 defendants, in the Budgie Allen case there were 22 defendants and there were 38 defendants in the Harry Kirkpatrick case.  There were 28 defendants held on the evidence of Robert Lean on remand. He retracted his evidence, the case folded, but they had been held for some time &mdash; again internment without trial.</P>
    <P>Prominent lawyers in the North, the UK, the US and indeed throughout the Western world have expressed the view that under this system the courts are being used as a political strategy rather than for the administration of justice. The informers are offered immunity and safe passage from Northern Ireland. Some of them have gone to prison but it is generally believed that they had already done a deal with the police.</P>
    <P>In England none of them served more than two years and it is probable that something similar will happen in the North.  The first case of an informer being used, not the highly sophisticated supergrass which we saw from November 1981 on, was in the case of O'Doherty and McCormick.  McCormick was an RUC man and O'Doherty, who was a paid informer, gave evidence against him.  In his summing up, Mr. Justice Murray said:</P>
    <P>At the end of the long day my firm conclusion is that it would be highly dangerous and wrong to convict the accused of any of the crimes charged against him on the evidence of O'Doherty unless that evidence is supported by clear and compelling corroboration.</P>
    <P>We all agree with that statement which comes from &ldquo;Supergrasses &mdash; The use of accomplice evidence in Northern Ireland&rdquo; by Tony Gifford, QC.  Further on, Mr. Justice Murray said:</P>
    <P>In conclusion I must refer to some very vigorous criticism of the police made by Mr. Boal.  The Inspector in charge of the investigation made dozens of visits to O'Doherty in prison <Col N="1474" /> and Mr. Boal made the allegation that O'Doherty was being &ldquo;schooled&rdquo; in his evidence by the police.  I think that the police action is open to criticism in the circumstances of this case but I am wholly statisfied in the event that no injustice of any kind resulted from it.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the judge, recognised that the police evidence was subject to criticism.</P>
    <P>In the trial of 16 defendants, another informer, Bennett, was referred to by the judge as a ruthless, resourceful and experienced criminal whose criminal acts extended to the use of his dead father's police uniform to carry out the daring armed robberies from which considerable sums of money were stolen and divided among himself and his accomplices.  That is an indication of the judge's opinion of the type of person he was.  The judge found that Bennett's dominant motive was that he could not face another prison sentence.  Bennett believed that he had to name as many people as possible to ensure that he would get immunity.  The only corroboration against the 16 persons charged in that case was that two defendants made remarks to the RUC which gave the impression of guilt.  One defendant had a key to a yard where explosives were kept and another had a cylinder in the boot of his car which was similar to those used in a particular bombing explosion.  In his evidence to the court, Bennett alleged that he received a cheque for £600 from one of the defendants but, under cross-examination and the cheque being presented to him, he admitted that he had not received it from one of the defendants, which is an indication that he had told lies.  This is the type of evidence on which unfortunate defendants with no other evidence against them are being convicted.  In that case Mr. Justice Murray said that Mr. Boal convinced him that Bennett had told lies.  Mr. Justice Murray also said that he was sure that a man who had committed murder would not have scruples regarding perjury if it suited him. These are the sort of people whose evidence is sending others to prison.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> Every defendant, except one, was convicted on the evidence of this supergrass. The judge said he thought there was a ring of truth in his evidence because of the detailed evidence regarding the offences and because the defendants were not able to produce an alibi.  Some of these offences were alleged to have been committed ten years previously and it is very difficult to see how anybody could produce an alibi in that case.  As regards the detailed evidence of offences, if Bennett was involved, obviously he could give detailed evidence.  There are no substantial grounds on which one could accept that he gave good and truthful evidence on which anyone could be convicted.  The annual report of the RUC came out at the same time and one of the comments of the Chief Constable was that the outcome of the case was crucial to the wellbeing of Northern Ireland.  Justice Murray stated that if it was a jury case that in itself would be contempt of court. That is an indication of the whole rotten system of justice in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>In the case of Christopher Black, there were 38 defendants.  They were arrested in November 1981, the trial began in December 1982 and went on until August 1983.  Black himself had been guilty of perjury in 1975 for giving a false alibi. Again, the bill of indictment was used to circumvent the Magistrate Court and so hold all the defendants in custody for almost two years.  He was granted immunity in November 1981, three or four days after he was arrested.  Having been in prison before he did not want to go back to prison and thus he had a good motive for giving evidence to convict 38 defendants to ensure that he would have immunity for himself.</P>
    <P>In that case Justice Kelly referred to him as a &ldquo;brilliant witness&rdquo; because of the detailed way he gave evidence.  He said.</P>
    <P>... he was one of the best witnesses that I have ever heard.  By that I mean that he was one of the most convincing witnesses that I had heard in my experience in criminal trials and other trials. <Col N="1476" /> ...I thought his memory for the numerous complex and lengthy incidents and their participants was outstanding, quite exceptionally good, and this became progressively apparent as successive cross-examinations proceeded.  Very, very many situations, conversations and comments he described in language and manner which suggested only truth.</P>
    <P>Lord Gifford studied that trial very carefully and he was very concerned regarding the accuracy of the evidence. He believed the reason it was so accurate and why the witness was so brillant was because it was the result of a careful rehearsal with the police.  In Black's case one defendant was convicted on the basis of one offence which was reported by Black nine months after the event took place.  Black allowed that he had had taken an instant dislike to the man in question from the first time he met him. Again, that is the kind of evidence on which unfortunate people are being convicted without anything to corroborate it. Black accused one defendant of being on a training course but that person was able to produce 40 witnesses to show he was not on the training course at the time. Nevertheless, he was convicted.</P>
    <P>In the case of McGrady, a number of defendants were arrested in February 1982 and the trial ended in November 1983 because the evidence was so absurd. Justice Gibson stopped the trial and he referred to the supergrass as living a pretence. This was a man with a psychiatric history whose evidence stood up for only three or four days in court and then the whole case collapsed.  A number of defendants were held in custody from February 1982 to November 1983 as a result of the evidence of this man but when it came to court eventually the judge had to stop the case.  In the case of Budgie Allen, two people were charged on the basis of his evidence.  The above are just examples of some of the cases that have come to court to date.  I visited Belfast and I attended the trial of Raymond Gilmore but as that trial is still going on I will not comment on it tonight.</P>
    <P>The main reason why anyone would <Col N="1477" /> want to turn supergrass is to avoid a long sentence.  In order to involve the maximum number of people the supergrass would play down his own role, particularly if the crime is murder.  He might have a personal grudge against somebody and it is also believed that the police influence these people to name others whom the police want to arrest because they believe they might be involved in some crime.  A supergrass also provides information for the police.</P>
    <P>The nature of the individual and the nature of the inducements is very important. The whole matter of judges sitting on their own is also important because it does not lend itself to any particular kind of justice.  The supergrass system is a new element in the whole administration of justice in the Six Counties and it is something that is deplored by Unionists and Nationalists alike.  Sixty years of injustice have caused the alienation of the Nationalists not only from the system that exists but from the whole statelet or whatever one calls the Six Counties.  There is a prison population there which is the largest in Europe &mdash; 164 per 1,000 compared with 35 per 1,000 in our jurisdiction.  The question must be asked why there is such a large prison population.  Most are young people who would go through life and never be involved in any kind of crime if they lived in any kind of normal society.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are opposed to violence from all sources, let it be from the IRA, the UVF, the Loyalists or from the British Army.  As a medical doctor I am more interested in healing than in the destruction of human life. There has been internment in the 1930s, the 1940s, the 1950s and also in the period 1971 to 1975.  Police went to the same houses in each decade and arrested people who knew nothing about violence and who were never involved in violent acts.  There were also the tortures carried out at Castlereagh and there was the Loyalist strike in 1974.  All of these things helped to bring about this alienation.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that the system of supergrass trials in the North of Ireland is totally alien to both Irish and British court practice.  It is widely accepted, as <Col N="1478" /> the motion states, that that system of trial is contrary to the principles in accordance with which justice is administered throughout the democratic world.  These two grounds are the two main grounds on which the supergrass system stands condemned, as it has been condemned at home and abroad by all those who sincerely wish to see fair, just and long-established court practice and procedures both here and in Britain upheld and the principles in accordance with which justice is administered throughout the civilised world preserved.  We call on the British Government to terminate these trials and to institute an independent review of all the cases in which convictions have been secured through the operation of the supergrass system.</P>
    <P>The amendment in the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs states:</P>
    <P>...Notes the damage which is being done to the legal and judicial system in Northern Ireland in the eyes of many in both sections of the community there by the regular reliance on uncorroborated accomplice evidence as a major feature of the prosecution system.</P>
    <P>I find this amendment quite extraordinary. The fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should ask the Dáil to do nothing more than &ldquo;note the damage which is being done to the legal and judicial system in Northern Ireland in the eyes of many in both sections of the community&rdquo; is incredible.  I should like to ask him if he really believes that the supergrass system is, as his amendment implies, acceptable to some sections of the Nationalist community or that is acceptable to all sections of the Unionist community.  The evidence is there that it is not acceptable to either community.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment carefully avoids the use of the word &ldquo;supergrass&rdquo; at all and instead uses the phrase &ldquo;uncorroborated accomplice evidence&rdquo;.  It appears that the Minister and the Taoiseach have not learned very much from their recent trip to London and that they do not know much about the feelings of the people in the Six Counties.  In <Col N="1479" /> conclusion, I ask the Minister to use his office and whatever power and pressure he can on the British Government to ensure that normal standards of justice will be applied throughout the whole of this island by applying them in the Six Counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to have the opportunity to speak briefly on the supergrass system being used in the legal system in Northern Ireland.  A few months ago the concerned community organisation of Belfast, representative of professional and lay people, came to Dublin to meet the various political parties to express their sincere concern about the supergrass system in the North of Ireland.  As a result I went on a two day visit to Belfast recently with two Fianna Fáil colleagues.  We observed a morning session of the Raymond Gilmour supergrass trial.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to me that, whether these trials are successful or not, many innocent people will be convicted on statements given by those supergrasses.  These are complete mock trials and nothing else.  It is another form of internment because many innocent people have been locked in prisons away from their families during the past two years awaiting trial.</P>
      <P>Opinion in the legal profession is very clear regarding the supergrass system. They are very concerned about the whole thing because they know the legal system is being dragged down to a very low level. The people in general are very concerned and are losing any faith they had in the whole legal system in Northern Ireland. I say it is the duty and the responsibility of the British Government to act immediately to change the system.  The only legal system is that which says you are innocent until proven guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take the case of Mr. X as a clear example of the injustice of trial by supergrass, of which the British Government approve.  I hope the Minister and the Government will take a serious interest in the whole affair and request the British Government to take the necessary <Col N="1480" /> action immediately to resolve these injustices.</P>
    <P>Mr. X was 24 years of age in February 1982.  He had no history of involvement in guerrilla activities whatsoever.  In 1979 he married his wife Kathleen and they have two children, a boy and a girl.  His daughter was six months old when he was arrested at 4.30 a.m. and brought to Gough Barracks in Armagh.  On Tuesday, 9 February 1982 an RUC man came to the room in the barracks and asked the interrogators &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; One of them answered &ldquo;Mr. X.&rdquo;  The RUC man turned back towards the other room and repeated the name, Whereupon a man, unknown to Mr. X, appeared at the doorway. The interrogators asked the newcomer &ldquo;Do you know this man?&rdquo; The man at the door nodded.  They asked &ldquo;Have you made any statements against him?&rdquo; Again the man nodded.  They asked &ldquo;Are you prepared to give evidence against this man?&rdquo; Again the man nodded.  The newcomer was then led away.</P>
    <P>That man was Patrick McGurk, supergrass, newly recruited.  Mr. X was not the first victim of the new tactics.  Mr. X was charged with possession of land mines at Ballygawley Road near Dungannon between 1 January and 31 December 1978.  He was also charged with an arson attack on the Ulsterbus depot in Dungannon in May 1978.  Mr. X made no statement while in custody and the only evidence against him were alleged statements made by McGurk.  He was transferred to Crumlin Road prison in Belfast in custody for the next 21 months. There is no precise location for the alleged incidents.  Ballygawley Road is at least ten miles long.  There was no precise date given for the alleged incidents. There were no explosions and no casualties. There was never any evidence of a bomb.  Such a charge that cannot be pinned down make an alibi impossible.</P>
    <P>On 21 April 1982 Mr. X was brought up for bail.  Under the Emergency Provisions Act, 1978, the conditions of bail are such that, instead of the prosecution having to prove that the prisoner would be a danger to society if released, the defence has to prove that he or she would <Col N="1481" /> not.  As this is extremely difficult, very few prisoners are granted bail and it was not surprising that Mr. X was refused. He was returned to Crumlin Road prison and was remanded in custody again.</P>
    <P>The next development was in September 1982, five months after the bail refusal, when the preliminary inquiry should have taken place.  This is when the accused are faced by the accusers who have to give evidence against them in an open court, so that the court can decide whether or not there is sufficient evidence to merit a continuation of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The surprise was that there was to be no preliminary inquiry as Lord Chief Justice Lowry had granted a bill of indictment to the Director of Public Prosecutions the night before.  This dispensed with the preliminary inquiry.  Mr. X and others who stood in the courtroom that morning were returned to Crumlin Road prison and so rests the future of Mr. X. This is one of the many examples of the injustice of the supergrass trial system in Northern Ireland of which the British Government approve.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak in this debate.  The contributions made by Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Hilliard were very interesting, except for the last few regrettable minutes of Deputy O'Hanlon's contribution.  Otherwise they were extremely good.  I am seriously concerned about the way in which the supergrass trials have been used in Northern Ireland.  I have outlined this concern in <Col N="1482" /> detail to the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Prior, and the present holder of that office, Mr. Hurd. On many occasions on my behalf my officials have repeatedly stressed the same concern.  I will go into detail in a moment as to why I feel I have to oppose this motion.  I should like to outline in detail the reasons why I am worried about the way in which this system has been used, but first I should like to put this whole question into its proper context.</P>
    <P>What we are discussing tonight is one feature of the present system in Northern Ireland.  It is an important and difficult issue but it is one problem among many. I have personally raised and pressed a whole range of such issues both in public and in private with the British authorities as have my officials, on my instructions, and this is very well known.  I shall continue to do so because I believe we owe it to the people of Northern Ireland to ensure that, even under the present system, their grievances should be attended to and redressed.  I believe that the British Government owe a far greater responsibility to the people of Northern Ireland in this sense and I believe they owe it to themselves for even the most selfish reasons to ensure that the alienation which exists in Northern Ireland on a large and threatening scale is checked and is reversed.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback by a letter in one of our newspapers today which suggested that it is somehow in our interest that alienation should get worse.  &ldquo;Surely&rdquo;, the writer suggested, &ldquo;from the Irish' nationalist point of view, alienation from British Government in the North is a good and highly desirable thing &mdash; the more of it the better.  Why seek to end it?  Wouldn't ending it, or even lessening it, mean an increase in loyalism, and how can nationalists possibly want that?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This extraordinary approach seems to me to expose a grave question which we must face head on.  Do we see alienation as a means of securing our national aims, in other words, do we see it as a weapon in our ideological arsenal?  If so, then by all means we should work to make it worse as the writer seems to suggest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> I protoundly disagree with this approach because it seems to me to be utterly callous and inhuman.  It fails to take account of the overwhelming reality which is that alienation equals intense human misery and anxiety.  Our commitment to the people of Northern Ireland and the principal reason why we constantly press the problem of aleination in our contacts with the British Government at all levels is that our concern for Northern Ireland is a concern for human beings first and last.  We are not playing ideological games with the lives and the happiness of innocent people and we will not do so.</P>
    <P>Our point of departure is expressed perfectly in the first of the Realities identified by the Forum:</P>
    <P>Existing structures and practices in Northern Ireland have failed to provide either peace, stability or reconciliation. The failure to recognise and accommodate the identity of Northern Nationalists has resulted in deep and growing alienation on their part from the system of political authority.</P>
    <P>Our desire is to create peace, stability and reconciliation in the lives of ordinary men, women and children.  It is not to win an ideological contest with the Unionists, a diplomatic contest with the British, or even a political contest in this House.</P>
    <P>The use of uncorroborated accomplice evidence &mdash; supergrass evidence &mdash; in the way this has developed in the past three years in Northern Ireland is extremely worrying and I believe it calls for a major reappraisal by the British Government. Nevertheless, it is not an absolute black and white issue as the resolution suggests and I have to ask, with all the sincerity and goodwill at my command, that all the Members of Dáil Éireann give this issue the most careful and responsible consideration in this debate.</P>
    <P>It is very important, in Anglo-Irish relations and in our relations with the two sides of the community in Northern Ireland, that the Irish Government and Dáil Éireann be seen to take a measured and responsible view of this problem. <Col N="1484" /> That is why I am asking the House to support our amendment rather than the resolution.</P>
    <P>I do this in the context of two basic facts.  First, the policy of the Irish Government towards Northern Ireland is based squarely on the Report of the New Ireland Forum.  We believe that there will not be peace, stability or reconciliation unless the basic principles of the Forum Report set out in the Realities and Requirements are implemented.  We have made it clear that we believe this will necessarily involve the transformation of the political, security and judicial systems in Northern Ireland.  All of these issues were discussed between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and they will continue to be discussed in the months ahead, as the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister reaffirmed yeaterday. Our object is to secure agreement on this basis.</P>
    <P>Second, pending the establishment of new arrangements, it is the responsibility of the Irish Government and of Dáil Éireann to ensure that whatever measures are necessary are taken to protect the people of this State from attack and from insecurity.  We also have a moral responsibility to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland are not, through our actions, omissions or words, killed or terrified. There are many aspects of the system under which they live which are unacceptable to us and unacceptable to large numbers of the people of Northern Ireland.  We are working to transform those structures.  Meanwhile we will not fail in our responsibility to their human rights and concerns.</P>
    <P>I would now like to give the Dáil some important background facts on the way in which the present pattern of the use of supergrass trials developed in Northern Ireland.  I shall start with the case mentioned by Deputy O'Hanlon, of Christopher Black.</P>
    <P>In November of 1981 Christopher Black was arrested by the RUC.  He agreed to inform on his former accomplices and so began a series of trials which came to be called the &ldquo;supergrass&rdquo; trials. The trial of those charged on Black's <Col N="1485" /> evidence opened in December of the following year, 1982, and lasted until August 1983, when 35 persons were sentenced to prison.  The only evidence against many of those sentenced came from Christopher Black uncorroborated by any independent evidence, either of a forensic nature or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Since that time over 20 informers have come forward.  They came from diverse backgrounds.  Some claimed to have been members of the IRA, others of the INLA, while there were some who were members of the UDA or the UVF.  They all had one thing in common.  They were, and are, prepared to inform on their former accomplices.</P>
    <P>Their motives for doing this are not simple, nor are they necessarily the same in all cases.  For some it has been a wish to avoid imprisonment.  In one trial the judge said of an informer that he could not face going back to prison and that he believed his only chance to escape was to pass information and give evidence.  That particular informer was granted immunity from prosecution because, in effect, he helped the police to obtain convictions against his former colleagues.</P>
    <P>In other instances the primary motivation of the informer seems to have been the promise of a new life.  They may have been helped to reach this conclusion by financial inducements of one kind or another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There may also be a religious element and there are instances where informers have claimed to be motivated by a change of heart leading them away from their former paramilitary activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of features about these informer trials which, taken together, are a cause for very grave concern. Firstly, there is the nature of the evidence itself.  I should stress that the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is admissible in law in the Irish courts.  That is one of the main reasons <Col N="1486" /> why I could not accept that the system is to be condemned without qualification. In our system and, indeed, in the British system, because it is always desirable to have corroboration of evidence, especially in a criminal trial when the evidence is given by an accomplice, the judge must warn the jury that while they can convict on such evidence, it is unsafe to do so.  In Northern Ireland the informer trials are held in the co-called Diplock Courts where only one judge presides without a jury.  The judges in these trials are aware of the dangers of convicting on uncorroborated accomplice evidence.  The absence of a jury, however, raises particular difficulties, especially when only one judge hears a trial, a jury being the most desirable safeguard when uncorroborated accomplice evidence is presented.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the evidence of an accomplice is tainted almost by definition.  That taint is slight where an accomplice has nothing to gain.  In some of the informer trials in Northern Ireland the accomplice informer had very much to gain, either by way of immunity or by way of financial inducement and the promise of a new life.  In such circumstances, the possibility of tainted evidence is increased and the danger of a miscarriage of justice all the greater.</P>
    <P>A third feature common to many of the informer trials is the large number of defendants in any one particular trial. Leaving aside those informers who have retracted their evidence, there are three cases in which the number of defendants exceeds 30 persons, while in almost all of the remainder anything between ten and 30 persons are charged.  This creates a difficult problem for the judge, who with so many arraigned before him on the word of one informer, may well find it exceedingly difficult to adjudicate on a whole welter of facts.  It also creates major difficulties for the law officers and for the legal system in general when there are large numbers of defendants in one case.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most dubious factor of all <Col N="1487" /> is that the use of uncorroborated accomplice evidence seems now to have developed into a system and its systematic use to have become a dominant feature of prosecution in the Diplock Courts.  In addition, it is widely held that the police are strongly motivated to seek accomplice evidence in many cases.</P>
    <P>Now there are important considerations which can be advanced to justify the use of such a system in certain cases. These considerations include very basic concerns for the lives and safety of innocent people and I would ask Dáil Éireann to give them the most serious attention. These considerations are among the reasons why I cannot agree that the system can be condemned absolutely without qualification and why I am asking all sides to support our amendment rather than the original resolution.</P>
    <P>Firstly, we must face the realities of Northern Ireland today and the circumstances in which justice is administered. We know very well, not alone from Northern Ireland but from our own experience here, that witnesses have been intimidated and are afraid of coming forward because of the savageries inflicted on them by the paramilitaries of both sides.  Judges have been attacked and both they and their relatives have been murdered.  In such circumstances is it any wonder that resort is had to evidence of this nature?</P>
    <P>And let us not forget that in recent times three Catholics have been killed just because they were Catholics, bringing the total number of Catholics killed by Loyalist assassins since the early seventies to over 400.  The fears of ordinary innocent men, women and children that they may be killed or their homes attacked for no other reason than that they are Catholics are once again revived. If the use of accomplice evidence serves to put these sectarian murderers behind bars and to help to allay the fears of the innocent, is there anyone in the Dáil who would object?  At least 32 Loyalists have been found guilty of very serious crimes, including sectarian murder, because their <Col N="1488" /> former accomplices chose to inform on them.  We should not forget that.</P>
    <P>Innocent Protestant people are also being terrified, attacked and murdered. In the Border areas especially, a campaign is being waged against them which is little short of genocidal.  The plight of these people is and must be our serious concern.  I do not believe that the Members of Dáil Éireann, for all our serious concern about supergrass trials, would oppose their use in the bringing to justice of the murderers of the innocent who died in the infamous slaughter which took place in Darkley Pentecostal Gospel Hall a year ago.</P>
    <P>Nor should we forget what is happening within the Nationalist ghettoes.  There the IRA spuriously claim to be the protectors of the Nationalist people.  In reality, they are prepared to injure and to maim, indeed even to kill, those who they say are guilty of crime.  Did they give their victims a fair trial?  Did they even give them a hearing, not to mention providing them with a jury or even a judge? The unfortunate victims have no more chance and no more choice than a beast in a slaughter house.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact that dangerous men deeply involved in the IRA and in the INLA have been locked up because their former associates decided to inform on them, nor can we ignore the severe damage done to the paramilitaries in certain areas as a result, We can only be relieved that this is so.</P>
    <P>Why then am I seriously concerned about the way in which supergrass trials are being used?  Firstly, because of the extent of the practice.  It is a device which should be used as sparingly as possible and only in the most exceptional of cases, especially in the absence of juries.  In Northern Ireland it has become a major feature of the legal system, is used in a systematic manner, and on occasions can involve a very large number of defendants. The pressures on the police to produce an accomplice and on the accomplice to produce the evidence, as well as on the judges, who in Northern Ireland are called upon to bear a very heavy burden, have produced strains on the <Col N="1489" /> legal and judicial system.  In my view that system, which is essential to the wellbeing of any society, is being damaged by the regular and over-reliance on uncorroborated accomplice evidence.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the over-reliance on the use of informers has led to very great delays in the length of time those accused spend on remand before they come to trial. That is a point which was made by Deputy O'Hanlon who quoted the case of one man who was almost a thousand days waiting for trial.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I am concerned that claims can be made that the regular use of uncorroborated accomplice evidence represents a new administrative alternative to internment.  Such claims are only reinforced when bail is refused, as it is in very many cases, to those who are held on remand, even if they have been in custody without trial for a very long time.  I had occasion recently to raise one such case with the British about which I was particularly concerned, and indeed my interest was mentioned by the judge in court when he was referring the case to the Chief Justice of Northern Ireland.  In this instance, the person has been held on remand for over 33 months on the evidence of five successive informers, three of whom retracted, the evidence of the fourth having been dismissed by the judge in court.  That person was charged last September on the evidence of a fifth informer and his case could go on until the end of 1985.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> Fourthly, there are serious risks involved in the use of informers which, I believe, are all the more dangerous because of the divided nature of society in Northern Ireland and because of the polarisation which exists between the two communities.  At best it is essential to be extremely cautious about the use of uncorroborated accomplice evidence.  At worst over-reliance on its use as a regular element in prosecutions leads to the undermining of the whole legal and judicial system and to the alienation from that system of significant numbers of people. The frustration with the supergrass system is not confined to the minority in Northern Ireland but is shared by a significant number within the majority community.</P>
    <P>I come back to the Forum report, which most of the parties in the Dáil subscribed to and which is the policy of the Government.  That must continue to be the primary focus of our attention.  I should like to use this opportunity to express on behalf of the Government our deep appreciation of the courageous solidarity shown by the SDLP in difficult circumstances in their statement issued last Saturday.  For my part, I would now like to invite the Opposition to join us in the same solidarity in our continuing effort to make progress in the exchanges which will take place with the British Government so as to secure peace, stability and reconciliation throughout this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While it was not my intention to deprive the Minister of the opportunity to make a full contribution I was hoping there might be a late conversion. I am extremely disappointed with the wording of the amendment and believe that it will condemn the Nationalists and Unionists to a continuation of the supergrass trials for some time to come. It is regrettable, harmful, damaging and sad for the Dáil that the Minister, despite a number of very strong expressions he made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Skelly will have an opportunity tomorrow evening, if they have confidence in him, to speak on this aspect.  In view of the number of statements the Minister made he could quite clearly have come forward and endorsed our motion.  However, he is couching his views in wording which is vague and which can only be referred to as milk and water.  It is very sad for the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>At the end of his speech the Minister asks us to join in solidarity with the Government.  Earlier he justified the wording and framework on which his amendment is based.  He referred to the policy of the Government towards Northern Ireland and said it was based squarely on the report of the New Ireland Forum. If we could honestly believe that that situation still obtained there would be some scope for us to show our solidarity with the Government.  I have very little confidence in the Government with regard to their serialisation of that very important and unsurpassed document known as the New Ireland Forum report. Irrespective of the Minister's views about violence &mdash; they are shared by all sides of the House &mdash; there can be no settlement in Northern Ireland within the existing boundaries.  Most of the terms and conditions laid down in his speech are couched along the lines of an internal matter.  I disagree with him on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to his statement that there are a number of features about these informer trials which, taken together, are a cause for great concern, he points to the fact that uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is admissible in law in the Irish courts.  However, we all know that in the Irish court system uncorroborated evidence is very rare.  It is not part of an overall system.  The Minister will agree with that.  On the rare occasions when it is presented, used or admissible, it is admissible to three judges, not one.  This is a very important distinction which the Minister should have highlighted and put unequivocally before the House.  He did not.  I regret his failure to call for a commitment from the British Government <Col N="1492" /> to ensure that at least three judges will always be provided in the case of such hearings.  It is essential that the Dáil unequivocally condemns the system of supergrass trials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We should call immediately on the British Government with a united voice to do so.  Unfortunately we do not have a united voice tonight.  We should call on them to permit an independent review of all cases which have resulted in convictions.  This is the basic fundamental stance that Dáil Éireann should have adopted in a unified manner.</P>
      <P>Britain has always seen the problem of the North as a law and order one.  For the past 15 years she has seen herself at war with the Nationalist community there.  The supergrass system is an administrative process feeding off Unionist prejudice rather than a judicial process. It is a deliberate act of exploitation of the legal system by the RUC and the British authorities and is best exemplified by the use of uncorroborated evidence in a systematic way.  The charging of suspects irrespective of evidence is widespread. The deliberate and calculated avoidance of preliminary hearings in a number of instances has assisted the re-introduction of a form of internment without trial.</P>
      <P>Northern Ireland for the most part is a land of lawlessness, alienation, injustice and human degradation.  Distrust is deep and very pervasive as elements of security, both legal and judicial, are exploited to the very last in order to subjugate the Nationalist minority to the interest of the war effort.  The fabric of society has irretrievably broken down in many cases and some of those still ritualistically applying the code for their British lords are doing so with considerable tongue in cheek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a well known fact in the legal circles in Northern Ireland that the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lowry, has strong <Col N="1493" /> reservations about the supergrass trials system.  Many consider him to believe that the British and the RUC intelligence have gone too far this time.  Not alone is the present system distasteful and undignified but he is believed to consider that it falls well below acceptable judicial standards in any democratic system.  We would all agree that is very much the case.  He is said to fear that it will do irreparable damage to the judicial and legal systems in the North.  Yet he, like others, is compliant in administering the corruption.  Brigadier Frank Kitson, now a general and commander of UK land forces, as part of his annual report on strategy for anti-subversion said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the law in Northern Ireland should be used as just another weapon in the Government's arsenal and in this case become little more than a propaganda cover for the disposal of unwanted members of the public....  The activities of the legal services have to be tied into the war effort in as discreet a way as possible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This quotation along with others I have come across, which are very frightening, are to be found in <i>Low Intensity Operations</i> by Brigadier Frank Kitson.  The wording of that statement speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland from its very inception has been an unstable, incongruous and a most unreal political entity.  Yet because of the overwhelming dominance by the Unionist tradition successive British Government have been able to allow them to rule as they wish, irrespective of injustice or corruption.  However, the inevitable eruption of political violence in 1969 and the turmoil it has sustained since then have caused the British to react in a number of ways.  They have tried a saturation of military operations and internment without trial.  Finally, they have settled on the invocation of emergency laws, devising a special judicial process for politically motivated crimes as part of the overall political strategy.  The judicial process which replaced previous systems became known as the Diplock Court system, and Deputy O'Hanlon has <Col N="1494" /> referred at length to it.  Among its features are the abolition of juries and their replacement by only one presiding judge. There is a lack of prosecution witnesses and there are long periods of remand in custody.  More recently the strategy adopted in addition to these features has been that of recruiting large numbers of supergrasses who would go before the courts and make statements implicating people in military operations and conspiracies. As the erosion of the due process continues there has been a vigorous stripping away of all impediments to executive convenience in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is best exemplified by the following legal changes.  Arrested persons may now be held for questioning for up to seven days.  The liberal rule of the common law in relation to inadmissability of evidence has been turned on its head. The statutory requirement now is that confessions be admitted in evidence unless they have been shown to have been obtained by torture, inhumanity or degradation.  If we examine statements by Mr. Justice McGonagle and other justices in Northern Ireland as to the definition afforded in criminal law, the scope for inducement and for a certain roughness of treatment, to use Mr. Justice McGonagle's own words, is adequate and quite significant.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the easiest way to illustrate this is by reference to my own observations during the two hours I spent with my colleagues, Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Hilliard, at the cross-examination of Raymond Gilmore, supergrass, by Desmond Boal, senior counsel for the defence at Belfast Crown Court on Tuesday, 6 November of this year.  Deputy O'Hanlon, Deputy Hilliard and I went to observe these trials because of increasing concern within the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party regarding their operations. What I saw and heard left me shocked and saddened.  The court procedures themselves were extremely intimidating even to a detached observer.  On entering the courtroom we were confronted immediately by crowds and uniforms.  A large number of people, <Col N="1495" /> male and female &mdash; the accused &mdash; I understand about 45 in total were being tried together &mdash; had been charged with mostly unrelated crimes and all on the word of this one man, Gilmore.</P>
    <P>The positioning of the supergrass in the courtroom was very significant because he sat facing Lord Chief Justice Lowry who was presiding, and replies to questions from the defence counsel were directed to the judge, not to the counsel or to the court at large.  It seemed a subtle way to protect a Crown witness, perhaps with some degree of justification, from intimidation from the general body of the court, but the contrivances were very interesting.  I must confess that I am commenting on a case which is at present in progress.  I found that Gilmore's answers were riddled with inconsistencies, self-contradictions, retractions and altering of existing evidence, and in many instances he claimed not to understand questions put to him in the simplest English by defence counsel.  There seemed to me to be a very clearly rehearsed strategy to frustrate the process of defence counsels' cross-examination, yet all the allegations continued to be made by Gilmore against the people whom he named, even though over a short two-hour period the times, places and dates in relation to these crimes that were alleged to have been committed seemed to be constantly changing.  Even without referring to this man past record, I had to conclude that most of what he said bore little if any resemblance to the truth, whatever that truth might be, yet his statements of indictment were allowed stand on the record.  I came away from that court hearing shocked that any democracy would permit such a legal farce, yet I could be assured by many of the senior counsel and legal people present that the system had worked well over the previous two years in fulfilling its objectives so aptly described by Brigadier &mdash; now General &mdash; Frank Kitson.</P>
    <P>In the two-year period 1982-84 the number of people charged on the basis of supergrass evidence &mdash; most of these people were remanded in custody &mdash;<Col N="1496" /> superseded the number of people interned in the original swoop in August 1971. The 27 supergrasses &mdash; there were 29 altogether &mdash; who came forward between 1982 and 1984 named 477 people in their evidence.  The use of uncorroborated evidence along with other practices in the taking of evidence here surely must be examples of standards of evidence which are alien to any other system of justice in a Western democracy.  The uncorroborated evidence of an informer or supergrass is the word of a supergrass and nothing else.  When one takes into account that all the supergrasses had had a number of previous convictions, in many cases for involvement in and accomplices to murder, explosions and other forms of conspiracy and that in nearly all cases they are serving long sentences &mdash; I believe in all cases except one where a religious conversion was claimed &mdash;when they decided to turn Crown's evidence, this practice assumes a more sinister dimension.  The Christopher Black trial judge, Mr. Justice Basil Kelly, described Black's primary motive for agreeing to work for the RUC.  I quote from Mr. Justice Kelly at the opening of that trial: &ldquo;He could not face going back to prison and he believed his only chance to escape was to pass information and give evidence.&rdquo;  Lord Tony Gifford, Queen's Counsel, to whom Deputy O'Hanlon has referred in many instances during his speech, was a member of the Cobden trust and studied the supergrass trials in depth.  He made the following statement in relation to the Christopher Black trial: &ldquo;I think it highly probable that the brilliant impression which Black made was due, in part at least, to a careful process of rehearsal between him and the police.&rdquo;  He went on to say: `The amount of detail in his statements is indeed phenomenal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Black trial was that Tobias McMahon was named by Black almost eight months after Black had made his initial statements to the RUC.  He had remembered suddenly that McMahon was a senior IRA officer.  All this time Black was in the custody of the RUC, and everybody would have been <Col N="1497" /> very anxious to have identified a person involved in illegal activities, but it strikes one as curious, to say the least, that it took eight months for a person now being put forward by the Crown to recall that he knew a certain individual to be a senior officer in an illegal organisation whom he was so anxious and willing to expose.</P>
    <P>Defence lawyers in Northern Ireland have often argued very emphatically the reasons why it is dangerous for a court to convict on the evidence of a supergrass, even when that evidence is corroborated by evidence from other sources.  As has been demonstrated in so many cases in Northern Ireland, the supergrass will have been a participant in crimes of which his alleged former associates are being accused by him.  He may have been a perjurer in previous courts.  At least one of the supergrasses in question admitted openly to a justice that he had previously perjured himself in a court presided over by that same justice.  The supergrass may be motivated by the fact that he has been promised immunity from prosecution or promised financial reward and he will therefore be willing to give the sort of evidence the police expect him to give. In connection with the police influence on informers, there is a danger that the police themselves suggest the names of the people whom the supergrass should identify and indict.</P>
    <P>This danger is all the greater where it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to obtain evidence, particularly of a corroborative nature.  For example, Robert Lean, a supergrass who retracted his evidence, said he was supplied with photographs of men whom the RUC wished him to name.  He was given statements of terrorist acts, all of which he alleged were written by the police.</P>
    <P>Father Denis Faul and Father Raymond Murray have listed several reasons as to why the evidence of supergrasses should not be accepted.  They state that supergrasses have a unique opportunity to pay off old scores, that they can name persons they have fought with and persons whose business they covet or wish to ruin.</P>
    <P>The nature of supergrass evidence, the <Col N="1498" /> role of the RUC both in procuring informers and in compiling the evidence, what is known of the personal character of supergrasses generally and the extremely doubtful validity of statements and confessions all raise very disturbing questions about supergrass trials.</P>
    <P>Another practice of evidence taking which I suggest is totally improper is referred to in a statement by Peter King, an American criminal lawyer and an aide to Senator d'Amato, who came to the North to study the supergrass trials.  He said at a press conference on 7 October 1983 during a visit to the North:</P>
    <P>I notice in Court this week that you had defendants who were questioned day after day, after day, who didn't answer any questions, which was their right to do so.  And yet the police were allowed to read the questions which they asked the Defendants into the Court records....</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Now there is no reason why any of that should be read and there is no evidence for any of the allegations made in the questions, and yet that is being put into the record.  It is being brought to the judge's attention, putting it into the judge's mind, what the police think they have on this defendant. This is improper, none of this should be allowed.</P>
    <P>Another related feature to evidence taking is found in the Bennett supergrass trial where the Chief Constable of the RUC, Sir. John Herman, stated as part of his annual report:</P>
    <P>On this matter there is much at stake both for the terrorists and the community. The outcome is crucial to the wellbeing of Northern Ireland and it is essential that there should be a general understanding of the facts.</P>
    <P>On that occasion Mr. Justice Murray accepted that in the case of a jury trial this interference would have amounted to contempt of court.  However, he claimed not to be influenced by the statement. But when one looks at all these features <Col N="1499" /> of evidence taking in the North in the context of the most profound change that has taken place in a judicial process, that is, the abolition of the jury in all scheduled offences, and their replacement by a single judge as the sole arbiter of fact, it is inconceivable that he would fail to be influenced by such material.  The exercise whereby a judge at the opening of each judgement states publicly that he is warning himself that it is dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is nothing more than ritualistic nonsense.  How can we accept that in any way it assists or enables a judge to cast from his mind evidence that has been permitted to be put before the court and put on the record time and again and which in any court in any democracy which puts a value on fairness or balance would be dismissed?</P>
    <P>The use of supergrasses especially in the numbers in which they are being used today in the North has meant at times the abolition of another legal safeguard &mdash; the preliminary hearing in a magistrate's court.  The purpose of a preliminary hearing is to determine whether there is a case against an accused person and whether he should be sent for trial to a criminal court.  By obtaining what is known as a voluntary bill of indictment, the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland can avoid the preliminary hearing and proceed directly to the trial in the Criminal Court.  The word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; should not be misinterpreted as being synonymous with &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; as Patrick Kelly of Dungannon discovered to his horror after being arrested in February 1982.</P>
    <P>From the evidence available from all sources within Northern Ireland, this young man was not found to have been in any way associated with paramilitary or subversive activities.  He was refused bail initially in April 1982.  The preliminary inquiry was scheduled to be heard five months later.  The main charge against him was extremely vague.  However, the preliminary hearing would have decided if there was sufficient evidence to merit the continuation of proceedings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> Lord Chief Justice Lowry in his wisdom, though that wisdom is rather baffling, had granted a bill of indictment to the Director of Public Prosecutions on the night before the preliminary hearing was to have taken place.  Patrick Kelly was returned to Crumlin Road jail to be detained there until 24 October the following year on which date all charges against him and others held on the alleged statements of the supergrass, Patrick McGurk, were dropped.  All were found not guilty.</P>
    <P>By then Patrick Kelly and the other people concerned had spent 20 months in prison on the word of an accuser who had never been produced by the RUC and who claimed on his release that at no time during those 20 months had he intended to testify in court against any of the accused.</P>
    <P>Patrick Kelly was 24 years old on February 1982.  He had no history of involvement in any form of guerrilla activities. He had worked as a wages clerk prior to his arrest.  His life was ruined.  He had lost his job.  He had no recourse to take on the State and I understand that to this day he has failed to be re-employed.  His story is one of the many tragedies borne out of 15 years of British repression and criminal political blundering in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have said already that the operation of the supergrass system within the framework of the Diplock Courts and emergency powers is an administrative process feeding off Unionist prejudices rather than being a judicial system.  Perhaps this is best exemplified by reference to a conversation I had with a senior counsel of long standing in the main hall of Belfast Crown Court after observing the Gilmore cross-examination on November 6.</P>
    <P>For a period of from 30 to 45 minutes my colleagues and I spoke individually with a number of senior counsel and solicitors. One of these people who was of the Unionist tradition and who had served as a senior counsel for many years was anxious to engage me in discussion of the proceedings I had just observed.  I spoke frankly and told I found the entire <Col N="1501" /> scenario incredible, that the witness seemed to have no credibility left and that I found it impossible to imagine how Chief Justice Lowry could find anyone guilty on the basis of Gilmore's uncorroborated evidence.  I asked for the comments of that senior counsel.  He said that he believed all the accused would be found guilty.  He said, &ldquo;OK, so the Crown witness seemed to manifest crookery and other traits of that nature but had he not told the RUC where to find an ammunitions dump and had he not given two other accurate pieces of information to them?&rdquo; My friend went on to say at least that gave the witness some credibility in the eyes of the justice.  He said, &ldquo;Anyway, were not 80 to 90 per cent of the 45 accused guilty and was that not all that mattered?&rdquo; That is a true and accurate account of the conversation that took place on that day between that senior counsel and myself.  I judge the sentiments he expressed to be a chilling indictment of the system that was so ruthlessly portrayed.  The Unionist RUC are policing nationalists.  They are looking after nationlist prisoners.  Unionist judiciary are sitting in judgement over nationalist suspects.  This has facilitated the operation of the process.</P>
    <P>To take an example of the judiciary side, while there are many to whom I could refer, Justice Robert Babbington, Unionist MP for North Down in the late sixties and early seventies and who was a fierce opponent of the civil rights campaign said, when he was fining a member of the Loyalist Tara Group £600 for possession of ammunition and firearms components&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the change of business I was referring to the high level of potato imports over the last few years. Since 1978 there has been a twenty fold increase in potato imports.  In 1978 only 4,000 tons of potatoes were imported.  By 1982 this had increased to 85,000 tons. Most of these imports have come from places like Holland and Denmark whose climates, like ours, favour potato production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1980 and the harmonisation of the EC plant health legislation there is free inter-Community trade in potatoes. This makes it more imperative that we get our act in order in relation to the potato industry.  This Bill is at last tackling some of the issues which will go a long way towards improving our industry. One of the reasons for the increasing volume of imports has been the inconsistency in the production of potatoes for the home market.  This Bill will go a long way towards curbing the cowboys in the industry who have contributed to the short supply, high price potatoes followed by excess supply and low price potatoes phenonomen.  In 1983 the average price per tonne to potato producers was £200.  In 1984, despite extra prices and extra inputs, the average price was <Col N="1503" /> reduced to something in the region of £100 per tonne, this bearing in mind that the cost of production per acre of potatoes is around £1,200.  The approximate yield here is six to seven tonnes per acre. This shows that it is not an economic proposition to be in potato production at present.  The one big problem about the legislation before us is that we need a firm commitment from the Minister that this legislation will be implemented rigorously. Without that commitment it will not be worth the paper it is written on. We must make the effort to implement the Bill, unlike what has happened over the years with the 19 pieces of legislation that I have already referred to; we must change the scene in this area.  There is no point in getting the serious producers organised if we allow the cowboys to come and go as they please and take advantage of a high prices year.</P>
    <P>We will have to tackle the problem of varieties.  Kerr's Pinks have an inbuilt problem of endemic disease and they give poor yields.  We must encourage an orderly production of varieties that will increase yields and will be more suitable for the processing industry.  Much progress has been made with the Pentland varieties in this area and they have become more acceptable to the housewife. A survey done by the Agricultural Institute last year shows that over 50 per cent of housewives are dissatisfied with the potatoes on offer.  The consumer buys mainly on the marketing of the potato. Recent experiments of selling potatoes loose and allowing the consumers to choose for themselves, even at relatively higher price, have proved tremendously successful.  We have all heard the stories of weight being made up with stones, dirt and diseased potatoes.  This has gone on for many years.  The report of the Fruit and Vegetable Tribunal of 1940 referred to the fact that potatoes for sale on the home market were not subject to restrictions of any kind and said that there was little doubt from evidence submitted to that committee of speciments of potatoes taken at random from bags sent for sale on the home market that these markets <Col N="1504" /> had been utilised to absorb diseased and other potatoes which would not be allowed to be exported and that for far too long the home market had been used to dump potatoes that had no other outlet.  Ireland is a potato producing nation and nowadays we must bear in mind the appalling situation in which we are a net importer of potatoes with the exception of some seed potatoes.</P>
    <P>Even in the area of seed potato production we have a long way to go.  Some question marks still hang over bags of certified seed potatoes.  I have had complaints as late as this year in relation to seed Pentland Dels coming from the Department whose size range was totally out of order.  We should look to this and ensure that the service being given by the Department is what it should be.</P>
    <P>This Bill is extremely good and I compliment the Minister for bringing it before the House.  It is a far more important Bill than is obvious on face value.  We are aware of the inter-departmental committee of Ministers considering the food industry, particularly the value-added end of the food industry.  The potato chip and the crisp have had a very good history. The crisp was introduced by Joseph Murphy in 1954 when in a small Dublin warehouse he started frying small pieces of potato and manufactured the potato crisp.  The word &ldquo;Tayto&rdquo; has become synonymous with the potato industry and we have come a long way since 1954.  The processed potato in the form of the frozen chip industry has not been so successful mainly because we have not grown a suitable type of potato and also because of the lack of commitment to contracts by potato producers.  If we want to make sure that the chip industry is a viable industry we will have to encourage commitment to contracts by farmers and producers in general.  Getting in and out of potato production from year to year is no good and signing a contract for a certain acreage of potatoes means nothing to the manufacturer if the farmer changes his mind or opts to go elsewhere if he is offered a better price.  We will have to be businesslike in relation to potato production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> The increasing consumption of the frozen chip has been tremendous as indeed has been the increase in the consumption of convenience foods.  I suppose it is an expression of the busy life most housewives lead today.  There is no reason why we should not be to the front in this industry and why it should not become of tremendously important value to us.  Before we can get to that stage and encourage the businessmen into this we will have to guarantee sufficient yields of the right variety of potato to have a consistent supply for this market.  We are heading in the right direction with the Pentland Del.  They have been tested and proved elsewhere and they are very successful in the processed chip industry. We have had limited success over the years in the dehydrated mashed potato industry because the variety we have been growing is suitable but even this end of the market is reducing in favour of the chip industry which is growing out of all proportion and faster than people realised over the years.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a few of the provisions of the Bill.  Perhaps the points I have raised may be implicit in the Bill, but I know, for example, that some of the new co-operatives and producers would like the Minister to clarify a few points which could be very important if not cleared up now.  The potato co-operatives and those involved in them having read the Bill as it stands are not clear exactly what regulations it will now be necessary for them to comply with for the importation of potatoes into our market.  For example, will those who import potatoes be free of any registration in relation to their packing and selling?  Will the agents, particularly the Dublin market agents who import potatoes, who are free to do so, still be free to re-bag and sell potatoes where they like without any stamp or registration mark on them?  This whole area of importation is deserving of some clarification by the Minister.  At present imports of potatoes to this country bear no declaration of variety or size.  Perhaps we could ensure that they fall in line with the standards demanded of our producers. We should never apologise for, if <Col N="1506" /> you like, erecting barriers to improve the quality of imports, particularly if we are merely bringing such standard up to that we demand of our producers.</P>
    <P>Free trade is very acceptable and necessary for an exporting country like ours but there is no way people should be allowed to import goods here of a lower standard than we demand of our own producers.  I would ask the Minister to assure the House that the whole situation in relation to the importation of potatoes will be attended to and will come within the provisions of this Bill, particularly in relation to registration of the sellers and packers.  The Canary Islands and Cyprus early potatoes imported here are imported loose and bagged in the Dublin market.  There should be some control exercised over the agents involved.  If we control the small producer down the line who wants to sell his potatoes direct to the shops and to the supermarkets, then the bigger agents in Dublin should be subjected at least to equivalent restrictions and should not be free to sell what potatoes they like without any tracing of their source.</P>
    <P>A difficult problem obtains in the whole area of importation, an example of which arose this year in relation to cross-Border trade in potatoes when because Northern Ireland producers had their potatoes out of the ground before ourselves and were confronted by a shipping strike a huge amount of Northern Ireland potatoes ended up on our market. I should like to ask the Minister: what will be the position in relation to our neighbours in the North of Ireland?  Will they have to comply with our regulations in relation to the bagging and selling of potatoes coming to this part of the country? Will those growers who grow under contract for the processors we hope to encourage into business also be subjected to these regulations?  Will people who sell potatoes in bulk to processors and factories be controlled and will these regulations apply to them?</P>
    <P>I should like clarification or confirmation that the £15 fee for packing and selling will be £15 for both, or for one or the other, and not £15 on each occasion. <Col N="1507" /> There is some apprehension felt among the co-operatives that we will charge £15 registration for the packer and £15 registration for the seller with the result that if it happens to be the one man he will be caught for £30.  I feel that is not so but that its interpretation is not crystal clear. Perhaps the Minister would reassure us in that respect.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might refer again to this £15 annual fee.  We have been assured by him now that it will be a once-off fee.  But if the whole system is not to be self-financing how does he intend to implement it as an annual fee?  This will not be an issue in most cases.  But there are many small potato producers here who would worry were they not free to grow their small acreages, selling their produce to the local greengrocer.  Were they caught for a fee of £15 every year &mdash; or indeed a higher one as the Minister may see fit &mdash; they might find that to be a disincentive.  It is for the smaller producer that this is of greater concern. Indeed, in years like this they could all be called small producers because the profit has just not existed.  If he can at all I should like the Minister to give us some details of what sort of application it will be necessary to make to the Department for registration, as outlined in the provisions of the Bill.  For example, will specific forms be issued and, if so, from where, and through which agencies, or will the farmer or producer concerned simply write into the Department?</P>
    <P>I would encourage the Minister to insist that the acreage of potatoes due to be grown be shown on that application along with the variety intended to be sown which would help tremendously with the production of statistics.  It would also help co-operatives and others by way of ensuring that sufficient acreage of the right variety of potato be grown, dependent on demand either from the processors or from the ware point of view.  If there could be some statistical information included on such application forms it would render monitoring and control easier, directing growers toward varieties of which we need more and encouraging <Col N="1508" /> them away from varieties that perhaps are not so acceptable any longer.</P>
    <P>I have referred several times to the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us how soon after its passage registration will become compulsory.  For example, if the requirement to register drags on month after month there will be little point to its provisions.  Will there be a deadline by which all growers must be organised and registered?  How does the Minister intend to ensure that all growers, big and small, have indeed registered? In particular what are his plans for the next year as the regulations get off the ground and the system gains acceptance among producers?  What plans has he to ensure that everybody is complying with the provisions of the Bill, which constitute his wishes and I imagine those of most of us in this House?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the real tragedy of the potato industry is that we are not an exporting country.  If the provisions of this Bill help us to organise our industry in such a way that we hasten the day when that will happen, we shall have done an extremely good job.  As the Minister said, it would be a mistake to feel that registration and other issues included in the provisions of this Bill will constitute the answer to all the problems of the potato industry.  However, there is no doubt but that they will go a very long way towards co-ordinating the industry and ensuring that the potato variety produced is that most in demand from the point of view of the producer and housewife. <i>Solanum tuberosum</i> is synonymous with Ireland; we have been over that ground before.  Successive Governments have failed to develop its potential.  I hope that at long last we are on the right road, that the potato industry will be synonymous with the best in Ireland because the potato itself has been associated with us for generations through good times and bad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The very fact that we are discussing the provisions of a Bill affecting potato and vegetable production here <Col N="1509" /> must, in itself, constitute a move in the right direction.  It has long been recognised that the extent of disorder and lack of co-ordination in this area of our economy could not be allowed to continue any longer.  While the provisions of this Bill cannot and will not be seen as constituting the solution to the undoubted problems obtaining in the potato producing industry, they must be seen as a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Some previous speakers have outlined the history and origins of our potato production and the role it played in the social and economic life of our country over many years.  In the 1800s the potato crop constituted our staple diet.  The Famine of the mid-1800s saw us lose many tens of thousands of our population through sheer starvation because of the effects of disease on production of the crop.  That probably constitutes the most notable chapter in the history of the role played by potato production here.  But, when we move on to the 1980s we must examine the co-ordination of potato production and the part it can play in our economy overall.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that £25 million worth of potatoes and potato products were imported in 1982.  That emphasises the need to plan and co-ordinate the production and marketing of the products involved.  There is no doubt but that the industry has been bedevilled by a lack of proper planning and co-ordination.  We have the classical problem of over-production in one year, poor marketing and poor presentation and the next year there is a shortage with a consequent escalation in price for the consumer.  Consumers cannot understand how in 12 months there is such a great variation in the price they have to pay for the humble potato.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a problem which confronts the industry but solutions are not easy to come by.  The proposed legislation will not provide even the semblance of the solution.  Perhaps with other voluntary measures brought about by those involved in the industry it could provide the basis for proper co-ordination, presentation <Col N="1510" /> and marketing of the product.  The major problem has been that when we have over-production alternative economic uses for potatoes are very limited. We have very high production costs compared with other EC members and it is difficult for us to compete with them.</P>
    <P>The compilation and dissemination of information to those involved in the primary producing end is of paramount importance.  For too long, growers have gone around willy nilly with no regard for the demand for potatoes.  There was no feedback from the marketplace as to acceptable varieties of potatoes.  If the Minister is serious about bringing in measures for the good of the industry it is of prime importance that a start be made in the marketplace and that consumers needs be identified.  Tastes change over a relatively short space of time and the industry must gear itself towards these changes.  Otherwise those involved in the industry will not receive a viable income.</P>
    <P>The report of the monitoring committee on food imports in the Department of Agriculture stated that, in contrast with 1982, producer prices in the 1982-1983 season were the best due to plentiful supply.  A feature of the market was that due to lack of storage much of the crop was sold direct off the field at harvest period, that is September and October, and gave rise to glut conditions and low prices.  Existing storage is grossly inadequate and suitable storage, in particular long term storage which involves high capital costs, will go a long way towards combating imports.  Their statement identifies the root of the problem in the potato industry.</P>
    <P>Storage is a major problem.  Over 75 per cent of producers grow less than one acre of potatoes.  This leads to fluctuations in volume from one season to the next.  When we relate the capital investment that would be needed to provide storage facilities to the size of holdings and the acreage under potatoes it will be seen that it is a non-starter as far as small holdings and small areas of production are concerned.  The Minister and his <Col N="1511" /> advisers will have to address themselves to these problems.</P>
    <P>The concept of a co-operative has been floated for some time.  That would help to provide a vehicle for producers to streamline the industry.  The industry has a long chequered history of production and because of the great variation from year to year producers tend to shop around for outlets for their potatoes.  At the end of the day it will be a question of knuckling down and recognising the advantages that involvement in a co-op would bring.  It has been long recognised that continuity of supply is of prime consideration for supermarket buyers and other outlets.  They need a supplier who will guarantee them a supply of good quality potatoes.  A person who will supply this year but not next year is no good to them or to the industry.</P>
    <P>As regards the registration of potato growers and packers there are a number of questions which we will deal with by way of amendments on Committee Stage. Chip production is a very important aspect of the potato industry.  It is another way of presenting potatoes and making them more attractive to people.  It is unfortunate that the geographic location of our chip processing facilities is not as good as it might be.  In the Louth-Meath area where a considerable amount of potatoes are produced annually there is a big demand for chip processing facilities. Hopefully, the IDA and the Department of Agriculture will recognise the need for such a facility to give a ready outlet for local, well organised producers.</P>
    <P>We have been told that producers will be obliged to put a number on the bag or package.  Those involved in the industry hold the view that it would be more desirable to have the name, address and registration number of the producer and the packer on the bag or package.  If that is done it will be easier to identify the problem areas and get to the root cause of the trouble.  Consumers would then be able to identify those who are doing their job properly in the marketplace and act accordingly.  That may convince those <Col N="1512" /> who are not doing the job as well as they should to take the necessary steps to improve the produce and the presentation. We hope to table an amendment concerning that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view of the monitoring committee on food imports that storage is vital.  If producers get the required area for storage they will have the regulatory mechanism that is sorely needed in the industry.  We should eliminate the process of producers selling out of fields or pits.  The day of picking potatoes at the side of a ditch on a cold winter's day is long gone.  The storage problem must be tackled and grants provided to encourage people to provide that facility.</P>
    <P>Those involved in the industry have complained to me about the level of VAT on potato bags.  I understand the VAT rate applicable is 35 per cent.  If that is the case the Minister of State should use his influence with the Minister for Finance to change that rate immediately.  I should like to detail what happened to the industry from 1970 to 1980.  In 1970, 76,000 hectares of potatoes were grown but in 1980, 56,500 hectares were grown. Those figures relate to the North and the South.  We cannot consider the future development of the potato industry without taking into account production in the North.  The outlet for potatoes here, apart from human consumption, is very limited because of the cost involved in producing them.  For many years potatoes were used for feed for cattle and pigs but they have been replaced by milled cereals because there is greater emphasis on getting weight on animals.  An Foras Talúntais, and agencies involved in research and development, should look for an alternative.  We should not meekly accept that there is no possibility of getting an outlet to absorb potatoes in years of over-production.  I hope research and development work continues in that area. Any advancement would be of considerable benefit to the potato industry.</P>
    <P>One matter that is affecting agricultural production in general is the curtailment on the recruitment of staff to the advisory service.  It has long been recognised that the advisory staff have given <Col N="1513" /> great help to those involved in agriculture but due to a curtailment on recruitment the reduction of field staff is continuing. That will have serious consequences for farmers.  Vital decisions about changes in different lines are being made by farmers and they need the specialist advice and guidance of instructors.  Any curtailment in that area will inevitably rub off on vital decisions taken in the agricultural industry.  The Minister should look at this area immediately.  The impact of these cutbacks will be felt in four or five years' time.  Such a move in the country's primary industry is serious.</P>
    <P>The research work of An Foras Talúntais on new lines of potatoes is a slow process and I hope there will be no cutback on the money or personnel needed for this work.  We must be looking for potatoes that will be more attractive to the consumer and more productive for the grower.  There is a provision in the Bill for the registration of growers and packers but I should like to know how the Minister proposes to control the potato purchasing merchants who buy potatoes from registered growers and sell them through their own distribution network. Is the Minister satisfied that the Bill covers those people adequately?  I am not sure it does.  I will deal with the other points that concern me about the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Members are anxious to contribute to this debate I will be brief.  I should like to give a strong welcome to the Bill.  The Bill, coupled with the establishment of the national potato co-operative, with its 12 regional subsidiary producer groups, will provide the bones of a solution to what is a very serious problem.  The worst problem is in relation to imports.  In 1982 we imported more than £25 million worth of potatoes in one form or another.  This year imports amounted to £30 million.  The fact that we do not have proper statistics reflects the need for registration.  In two years we have imported more than £55 million worth of potatoes and, according to the AFT report of 1981-82, we have 90,000 growers.  In 1980 under an EC directive <Col N="1514" /> our outlets for selling potatoes were opened to all our competitors.  The game rules were changed and we were unprepared. We need more professionalism to beat the best at their own game.</P>
      <P>In the course of my work with the Committee on Small Businesses I spoke to hoteliers and restaurateurs about the proportion of Irish to foreign goods they bought and they were vehement, without being prompted, about the quality of Irish potatoes.  Retailers also told me that they cannot get the quality they want.  I was told that it was all too common to have mucky stones in the bag to make up the weight.  There is also the problem for the producer.  One year there is a famine and high prices and the next year there is a glut and low prices as happened this year when potatoes are selling at £60 a ton.  What we need is a planned approach to this problem and the co-operative will be a basis for this planned solution.</P>
      <P>If this is a success it will provide a remedy for the tomato, onion and apple industries.  We are importing approximately £500 million worth of food each year.  One out of every three and a half food products is imported.  This is ridiculous in a country which has climatic and other conditions necessary to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>This is a simple and straightforward Bill.  The identification section is very valuable, as is the £1,000 fine and so on.  This co-operative will provide the statistical data needed for the industry to plan properly.  The only statistics we have apart from AFT studies are the CSO figures and often when they are issued they are too late to be relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some specific queries on the Bill.  Will there be any exemptions?  Will people with one-tenth or one-quarter of an acre be exempt?  What will be the date of commencement for registration?  Will the 1985 crop be covered?  Will the penalties be applicable to both wholesalers and retailers who buy potatoes which are ungraded and unregistered?  Will they be liable to the £1,000 fine?  Are sales to certain contract caterers or hospitals <Col N="1515" /> liable for registration, or will they be exempt?</P>
    <P>If the Department are not serious about implementing this Bill, we might as well forget about it because many people will invest a great deal of money and if the cowboy and rogue operators are allowed to continue to flood the market at cheap prices there will be no future for a planned potato industry.</P>
    <P>If we want this Bill implemented we must look at the staff.  My understanding is that the potato section in the Department has a staff of five senior people, a total inspectorate of 40, but where will the people come from to implement this Bill?  Let us look at the track record of this Department and their implementation of the Food Standards Act, 1977.  Most of these regulations are honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  That Act covers potato grading regulations for mechanical and disease effects on potatoes and there is a £200 fine or six months' imprisonment.  It is notable that the day before this Bill came into the House there was a prosecution under that Act.  Prosecutions have been very haphazard and I suggest that this Act was not properly implemented.  Because the penalties in this Bill are £1,000 I suggest that the penalties under the Food Standards Act be increased from £200 to £1,000 so that there will be conformity.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus in the potato industry that it is essential to deal with these rogue operators.  It is very important from the commencement of the operation of this Bill that the Department make it very clear that they mean business. If they establish precedents and turn a blind eye to this and have a half-hearted attitude to the other, nobody will pay any attention.  The price of doing that is what happened in the 1984 production year. The cost of producing potatoes is around £200 an acre, depending on how intensive production is, and on the Dublin market this week potatoes can be bought at £60 a ton and a particular purchaser will take them for £40 a ton.  That is one way to ensure that good, efficient, intensive producers get out of business.  That is the <Col N="1516" /> price of not implementing the present legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the national potato co-operative because a Bill, regulations and red tape will not solve anything. We must have a plan.  The 12 localised producer groups will be concentrated in the main growing areas, each having one representative on the national co-operative council.  I understand John Aherne of the IFA will be chairman and John Tobin of ICOS will be secretary and it is already registered with the Friendly Societies.  In County Wexford there are 30 to 40 growers involved with a total acreage of 600 to 800 planned, 20 acres each: the national total is 160 growers and about 1,900 acres.</P>
    <P>To understand the potato co-operative and the industry it must be realised that there are two stages of development.  The first is to establish packaging and grading centres and in the Leinster area where there will be six producer groups, the packaging centre will be in Carlow.  The centres will be able to take in 50,000 tonnes per annum.  All this will be financed as follows&mdash;one third by the Irish Agricultural Wholesale Society, one-third by the producers and one-third by grants.  The packaging and grading centre will produce a quality product that can be sold to retail outlets but there is a problem as regard grants.</P>
    <P>Grant aid is only available for expenditure in excess of £75,000.  We must lengthen the storage season to ensure that we get out of the present cyclical problems. Even though there are double grants for disadvantaged areas the fact is the Department only give a meagre 8 per cent, the minimum to utilise EC money. There is a specific problem for the storage of potatoes.  Special loaders and buildings with air ducts and vents are required. Grant aid for this area should be looked at so that we will have a quality product all year round.</P>
    <P>The processing area is crucial.  We can talk about the Dutch and the British industries, but how did they succeed? They identified one factor, that is, if you want to make money out of potatoes you must ensure that 50 per cent of the crop <Col N="1517" /> goes to the ware trade.  By &ldquo;ware trade&rdquo; I mean potatoes for table consumption to be sold through shops and the Dublin market.  That rule has never applied here. The other 50 per cent must be taken up by the potato processing industry&mdash; potato powder products, crisps, frozen or oven-ready chips and so on and this is where the problem arises.  If one has a crisp processing project one gets a grant from the IDA but if one has a frozen chip product industry, the Department of Agriculture give a grant.  the whole area is in a mess.  There is no planning for potato processing and if there is to be a future for the potato industry it is essential that we have the processing facilities to take up 50 per cent of the crop.  The Dutch and British have made it clear to every Irish person who went there that that was the key to success.</P>
    <P>Stage two of the national co-operative's development is to carry out a major feasibility study into the processing opportunities that exist for 50 per cent of the potato crop and to look at export potential.  This will cost £500,000.  This is a great deal of money.  It is vital that the IDA, the NEA and An Foras Talúntais provide the money for this feasibility study so that we will get the proper information about crisps, chips or whatever. The co-operative should know before the crop is harvested where the potatoes will go.</P>
    <P>Last year we imported £14 million worth of frozen chips and this year the figure will be even higher.  I would like the Minister to give a commitment that the necessary resources will be made available for this feasibility study.  I wish to stress &mdash; because many potato producers are not in the national co-operative &mdash; that it will not be a monopoly; it will be an organisation consisting of a number of growers and there will still be independent larger growers who will also be registered. This Bill will bring order out of chaos so that both the independents and the co-operatives will have a future.</P>
    <P>The co-operative must be based on 100 per cent commitment in loyalty.  Previously, when there was a scarcity of potatoes, farmers sold to other producers <Col N="1518" /> and buyers.  They had no loyalty to regular buyers and Erin Foods went out of business for that reason among others. We must have contracts for tonnage based on share capital.  You should not be able to dispose of shares except through the co-operative.</P>
    <P>The area of the £100,000 payment is still due from the Minister's Department to the co-operatives.  It is very important that this money should be paid without delay.  At the moment Irish potato producers are going around with two bags of spuds in the boot of their cars.  The Dutch are so busy producing and looking at the quality, variety and productivity of their acres that they do not have time to deal with marketing end and they leave it to the IAWF.  The whole concept of the separate marketing structure is essential.</P>
    <P>The main varieties of potatoes in this country are Kerrs Pink, Records, Golden Wonders, King Edward and some new varieties.  I should like the Minister to clarify whether seed production is dropping as I hear some very alarming reports in that regard.  I understand that all the main Irish varieties are totally unsuited for processing.  Therefore, you cannot plan for a future processing industry if there is no variety suitable for it.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that An Foras Talúntais, ACOT and the Department of Agriculture are fragmented as individuals are working on hypotheses, studies and lectures but nobody is working in a concerted way to do anything.  There is a ban on the import of Northern Ireland seed products.  That is a pity as they would be a great help in improving our variety production here.  I hope that the Minister will ensure that the necessary sources will be made available for research and development in the area of variety.</P>
    <P>I strongly reiterate my welcome for the Bill as it is the beginning of getting our act together in this area.  We must lengthen the storage period which is the kernel of the problem, have a planned and controlled supply of potatoes and an outlet for them.  Unless the Bill is enforced and unless there are cash and incentives for the national co-operative, <Col N="1519" /> there cannot be total production of potatoes in a pre-planned, utilised fashion as they have in Holland.  If we do things properly, the rewards will be great in terms of employment, balance of payments, agriculture, incomes and consumer satisfaction.  I hope this Bill will be implemented without delay and that it will reverse the tide of the food import scandal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill and if anybody thinks this legislation is unnecessary, he merely has to examine the last three reports which were carried out by An Foras Talúntais in the Irish potato industry.  The reports included the quality of potatoes offered for sale at retail level in 1982-83.  We also had a report concerning potatoes and the Irish consumer and the competitive position of the Irish potato industry.  Those reports made very sad reading.  Of 288 samples evaluated from November 1982 to May 1983 in the Carlow-Dublin region, not one passed the test or came up to the standard of the Irish Potato Marketing Board regarding the export market. Mechanical damage was excessive in most cases and they also failed because of lack of grading and sizing.  We had a very lucrative trade in the export of seed potatoes since the war and during that time Counties Donegal, Monaghan and Louth were the seed producing counties. We were top of the list then and had no rejections because of mechanical damage.  The potatoes were graded and selected and were some of the best exported to Spain, the Canary Islands and Israel.  For a number of years potatoes were scarce in Israel and their inspectors came over to Derry, inspected potatoes and passed them in most cases. We have not attained that standard since <Col N="1520" /> and I have suggested here on numerous occasions that the Irish Potato Marketing Board should have had control and responsibility for ware potatoes or at least have given assistance, advice and direction in that regard.</P>
      <P>The crunch came in 1980 when the EC directive withdrew the protection which we had up to then.  It allowed other countries to compete on our domestic market. Our neglect in streamlining the industry before and since 1980 invited that type of competition to such an extent that it almost wiped out potato growers here.  In 1982 we imported £25 million worth of potatoes and it was then that the Department realised that the potato industry would be extinct in a few years if some measures were not taken.  Out of the figure I have mentioned, some of £12¼ million was in respect of processed potatoes in various forms.  We had competition from a large processing plant in England.  If we processed potatoes we could provide thousands of jobs.  We have discussed import substitution very often in the House and Ministers say that in most areas we can only reduce imports by a small amount.  However, in potato and potato products we could substitute imports completely and this is why the Departments have been remiss in not identifying areas where there could be complete substitution by creating the conditions where people could get into the business.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned varieties.  I was involved in the potato business for many years.  I remember meeting Department officials and I told them that I did not think there was enough emphasis on the production of potatoes, not just for the home market but for export.  The answer was that it was a small percentage of total agricultural production.  But it was important because it was labour intensive and it was in an area where we could have created many jobs.  However, we failed in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that what we want is additional storage.  I remember in the late sixties as a member of the Irish Potato Marketing Board going to Perth at the invitation of the British Potato <Col N="1521" /> Marketing Board.  We saw the harvesters they used and the grading procedures.  At that time they were spending enormous amounts in providing large brick buildings for storage for the growers.  We are short of storage &mdash; it is estimated there is a shortfall of between 50,000 and 100,000 tonnes of storage capacity.  That matter should have been attended to before now but better late than never.  Additional storage capacity will have to be provided if we want to compete and to have products in the off-season periods.  When we visited Perth I remember that with the air conditioning they used it was easy to have the correct temperature for potatoes.</P>
    <P>As was mentioned earlier, FEOGA funds are available.  The Minister should consider matching those funds pound for pound, especially in the Donegal area which is most suitable from the point of view of soil and also the areas in Dublin. Many farmers in my constituency depended on potatoes as a cash crop in the fifties and sixties but with the changeover to dairying they went out of potato production.  However, now it is possible that many may revert to potato growing.  It was a system of farming where rotation was possible.  In many poor areas it is very suitable to have such rotation and in this connection potatoes are ideal to grow in rotation with grain. FEOGA aid is available at the rate of 50 per cent in disadvantaged areas and I as the Minister to consider carefully the suggestion of providing pound for pound in respect of that grant aid.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems with regard to the marketing of potatoes is that of mechanical damage.  In the reports it was indicated that growers should be informed of what precautions to take to avoid damage.  Potato growers are very careful and if the conveyors had the proper rubber adjustments on the diggers they could practically eliminate mechanical damage.  Defective tubers are causing many of the problems so far as quality and marketing are concerned.  We have good quality potatoes but they are badly presented and they are getting a much lower price than inferior quality, well <Col N="1522" /> presented Dutch potatoes.  That is something we will have to remedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The main points of the Minister's speech show that the industry is totally disorganised, that the distribution system is extremely poor, that there are inadequate facilities for storage, packaging, grading and processing and there is an unequal supply from year to year.  All of these weaknesses in the industry led to £25 million being spent on the import of various forms of processed potato foods in 1982.  That is a shame because we have the best soil and climate for the production of potatoes.  I hope the Bill will help to improve that situation.</P>
      <P>State funding for the setting up and promotion of a marketing board for potatoes is long overdue.  I hope it will be successful.  The presentation of the product to the consumer is also given significant consideration in the Bill, as is the registration of all growers.  This means that the people who produce a bad product will be traced in time.  All of these factors are important.</P>
      <P>The Bill is important from the point of view of the protection of the interests of consumers.  However, it does nothing to protect the person who contracts to produce potatoes for processing at the various processing outlets, for chips, crisps and even for mashed potatoes.  In the past year in my constituency we had such a concern that went into receivership and large potato producers suffered almost to the point of total bankruptcy. There was no protection for them and neither is there any protection for them in this Bill.  Perhaps what I am saying is outside the ambit of the Bill but it is something that must be considered seriously in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view in company law the financial institutions are given preferential treatment but there is no protection for the providers of the raw materials. Nowhere was that more evident than in the recent closure of the Clover Meats co-operatives where producers who had supplied goods in good faith found that the cheques were dishonoured.  The same situation has occurred with regard to <Col N="1523" /> potatoes.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to that point.  The banking and lending institutions benefited for a long time from the endeavours of the farming community. They made large profits and I regard it as a shame and even immoral that large-scale investment by farmers can be so shabbily disregarded by the lending institutions in times of crisis.  The protection of such a high capital risk crop as potatoes must be considered seriously in this context.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to institute a national potato co-operative.  In essence this means the producer toes the line in regard to the marketing and presentation of his product to the consumer.  One hopes that only a good product will be put up for sale.  My main fear is that the farming co-operatives are too fast becoming the property of the financial institutions.  The producers are losing control and, consequently, in times of financial difficulties there is a lack of sympathy and concern for the hard-pressed producers.  This was never more evident than in the past few weeks in my area. Farmers cannot afford to lose the money they have earned to the banking instutitions. Therefore, the farming organisations quite rightly are demanding fair play from the banking institutions for the producers who supplied products in good faith to the Clover Meats group.  In my view existing company law permits the lending institutions literally to rape these people of their hard-earned money.  It is one thing to legislate for proper production and marketing standards but it is equally important to legislate for reasonable protection of the interests of those who supply the co-operatives with quality products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am developing the point.  The Minister further proposes in the Bill to introduce penalties for those who do not conform to the regulations laid down.  I agree with that but I disagree <Col N="1524" /> with the fact that there is no reciprocal penalty for those who are responsible for malpractices from the wholesaler to the retailer in terms of price and quality of product.  There are jobs in the industry. The poundage of potatoes consumed here is quite high, both in respect of chips, crisps, and potato mash.  It is in that form of product that the greatest level of competition from within the EC is now becoming apparent.  For that reason one can reasonably conclude that this Bill is being requested by the farming organisations.</P>
      <P>The quality of the similar Irish product is consistent with the imported product but in our supermarkets we find those products in abundance, from the Netherlands, the UK, Belgium.  If we are sincere about job creation let us be patriotic and buy Irish produce, whether the potatoes be in chip form or in crisp form.  Those people who stand up and scream about the recent attitude of the British Prime Minister to Ireland should be told to buy Irish produce.  In that way you would silence all your critics because there is a reluctance for people to peel fresh home grown potatoes.  It is far easier to go into a supermarket and buy a packet of processed chips or crisps.  We should give greater consideration to where these products are grown and processed.  We have a good quality product at home.</P>
      <P>When this marketing board are in full operation I hope that will be the case.  I welcome the Bill despite its shortcomings. There is lack of protection for people who commit themselves to growing potatoes on contract.  People who send not only potatoes but other crops to factories under contract have had serious losses.  The Bill was needed to bring order into the marketing of this product, which has become the staple diet of our people throughout the years.  The failure of this crop 150 years ago changed the course of our history, and let us hope this Bill will alter the course of potato production and ensure a just reward for producers and consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute, as I welcome the Bill, <Col N="1525" /> which gives Members a chance to discuss the potato industry.  A number of Deputies said that the industry is in chaos and personally I do not think this legislation will contribute much to improving it.  The 1977 Potato Standards Act provides for regulations which, if properly and rigorously applied, would eliminate the need for reports like that of an Foras Talúntais recently which stated that not a single sample was found to be within the regulations.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how the mere registration of growers and packers will improve the position if the will and commitment are not there rigorously to implement the regulations and enforce them so that consumers will get something better than the mechanically damaged and disease affected potatoes now presented in supermarkets.  The onus is on the Department of Agriculture inspectorate to insist that the consumers will be provided with properly graded good potatoes.</P>
      <P>There has been a call or a demand by large growers for registration.  They felt that the registration of growers and packers would ensure that maverick or cowboy dealers would be kept out of the industry.  I hope, however, that the small potato producer who grows an acre or perhaps less will not be squeezed out, because he has been the backbone of the industry.  I hope that in times of surplus when such growers would have a share of the market the Act will not be used restrictively against them.</P>
      <P>We have some very large potato growers and they seem to be the ones who have the lowest yields and the most damaged potatoes.  The Forus Talúntais survey found that mechanical damage contributed to a very large extent to the unacceptability of potatoes by consumers. Page 26 of the report states that the most important of the technical faults was mechanical damage, though the level of defective and diseased tubers was very high.  The report recommended that a national damage awareness publicity campaign should be launched to try to bring down damage levels to an acceptable level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see how the mere registration <Col N="1526" /> of growers and packers will improve the technical quality of potatoes or consumer acceptability of them, but at least it will let everybody know who is in the business. It will therefore be possible to trace those who infringe the regulations and ensure that they will be put out of business. It will give those in the industry, particularly those in charge of it, knowledge of the amount of potatoes in storage at any time.  It is important to have that knowledge.  Above and beyond those technical provisions a great deal remains to be done to make the industry comparable with that of the Dutch in terms of cost of production and of quality.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ware sector, a few changes could have significant effects. First, we need higher yields if we are to compete properly with imports.  Our present yield is only 75 per cent of Dutch yield.  If we improve that yield the Dutch will find it uneconomical to sell here.  We need better policy to improve harvesting &mdash; I spoke earlier of how badly harvesting damages potatoes.  We need better storage facilities, particularly from March to May, to ensure that potatoes will be kept properly towards the end of the potato year.  We need a labelling system similar to the Guranteed Irish label through which potatoes would be given the description of having a guaranteed Irish quality.  If the consumers were buying Irish potatoes of a guaranteed quality they would know they had a product which was above the normal run of the mill.</P>
    <P>On the processing side we have seen Erin Foods in Carlow and in Skibbereen and we have seen frozen chip factories running into financial difficulties and generally capitulating to competition from abroad.  One of the main reasons is the type and variety of potatoes we have which are unsuitable for processing.  We have not come to grips with contract growing which we will have to do if we want to get the processing sector properly organised.  We need new processing technology. The old freeze dry technology is long since gone.  We need improved marketing.  There is no point in producing or processing a product unless you <Col N="1527" /> market it properly.  Those objectives can be achieved and higher standards can be achieved if we have a product identification scheme.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State is committed to the industry.  I know this from his work as Minister of State and as a member of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture.  If he were allowed by the Department of Finance to get additional resources to promote and organise properly a national potato co-op and a producer feeder group to that co-op, we would be well on our way to having a proper potato industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill by the Minister.  It should have been introduced long ago.  The comments made by the Minister of State in introducing the Bill are true.  Everyone knows the potato industry is far from perfect.  I reckon that we are only skimming the surface of the full potential of this very valuable industry.  The recent survey carried out by the Department of Agriculture showed clearly that fewer than half of the potatoes grown had adequate production facilities.  Poor presentation, lack of adequate attention and wastage are the chief culprits of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well presented potatoes and potato products from other member states are making inroads into our domestic market.  We imported over £30 million worth of potatoes and potato products in 1983.  That is appalling in a country with the reputation of having the finest climatic conditions in the world for growing potatoes.  Not only could we produce sufficient supplies to satisfy our home market, but we could gain a valuable export market and export trade.  The quality of the potatoes in all the other European countries is far below the eating quality of the Irish potato.  We are only skimming the surface in capitalising on that good quality potato.  Potatoes were a vital food in this country for centuries since Walter Raleigh first introduced the potato to Ireland.  When the blight wiped out the crop in the late 1840s <Col N="1528" /> a famine similar to the one in Ethiopia today befell our country.</P>
    <P>Taking all the facts into consideration, it is vital for our potato growers to make an all-out effort to capitalise on this very valuable industry and produce a product which can stand up to international competition. Proper handling and storage facilities are essential.  Second best quality will not do.  Only the best quality product can survive.  Proper marketing is also vital to ensure that market gluts do not develop, thereby ensuring that a stable price will be realised for our Irish potatoes.</P>
    <P>In the past the Dutch have proved that they could sweep the market on different occasions by producing a well-presented package containing poor quality potatoes. The Department should foster and develop a potato processing industry to produce all our requirements of frozen chips, croquette potatoes, potato mash, crisps, and so on.  Why not investigate the possibility of providing such a factory in south-west Cork?  Why not utilise and re-open the vegetable factory co-op in the town of Skibbereen?  The structure of the factory is there.  All it needs is the installation of modern machinery to put it into production.  This would utilise all our surplus potatoes and rectify the market gluts which frequently occur.  It would also be a great help to our economy.</P>
    <P>The establishment of co-operatives to supervise the handling and storage and regular sale of the potato crop is vital. Quality is vital if the product is to maintain its rightful place against European competition.  In other words, we must take the mud out of the spud.  That is the clear-cut issue facing our Irish producers today.  If we are to gain the markets, and if we are to gain the confidence of the Irish housewife, we have to produce an excellent product because the competition is very keen.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that a sufficient foundation stock of high class seed potatoes is readily available to our growers. Good seed is the basis for successful ware production, but good seed must be accompanied by good husbandry.  ACOT <Col N="1529" /> have an important role to play.  The main deficiencies in Irish potato production lie in the area of harvesting, storage and marketing.  Weather conditions play a prominent part in harvesting.  There is a tendency to harvest too late.  This involves the risk of deterioration.  Careless harvesting and handling causing damage to tubers do not help the quality of our crop.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's recent decision to authorise the expenditure of £100,000 this year to assist in launching a national potato co-op.  I should like the Minister to elaborate further on that project.  He should give us more details about these co-operative societies. Where will they be placed?  Under the sectoral programme for potatoes, EC and national aid are available for new storage facilities and the modernisation of existing storage facilities and for grading, handling and brushing facilities.  The aid consists of 25 per cent FEOGA grants plus 8 per cent Department grants, making a total of 33 per cent.  This applies only to co-operative groups and not to individual farmers.  I ask the Minister of State to make this aid available to all potato growers who register under the new scheme.  That is not too much to ask.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to 1980 it was possible to exercise official control over the import of all potatoes.  Following the implementation of the EC Plant Health Directive in that year, control of imports of potatoes from EC countries has been lifted and even with the power of selection and eating quality of Irish potatoes, we imported 80,000 tonnes of ware potatoes in the year 1982.  This is a challenge which we have to meet and it can only be met if the Irish producer is prepared to supply the housewives with constantly good quality potatoes, properly graded, well presented and competitively priced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dutch producers are our chief competitors and have a number of advantages over Irish producers.  They have a much higher yielding variety called <Col N="1530" /> Bintje.  They have only 15,000 growers compared with 90,000 here, with a total acreage under potato three or four times greater than that of our producers.  The Dutch also have very good storage facilities and their products are well presented, brushed, cleaned and graded.</P>

      <P>I may not take my ten minutes, because there are several other speakers who are anxious to contribute. At the outset, I consider it to be an absolute scandal, that at this hour of the night we are expected to debate a Bill of such magnitude.  It is a kind of &ldquo;Get it over with and get it through the House&rdquo; attitude, with little consideration being given to its importance.</P>
      <P>On many occasions, both inside and outside the House, we have debated the scandal of the importation of £500 million of food, such as vegetables and potatoes which we ourselves could grow.  Not alone should we not be importers, we should be exporters.  What is happening here tonight is an absolute farce.  There are several other who wish to speak on this Bill tonight and it is not good enough that the debate will be foreshortened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard it said already and reiterate that a survey was carried out at the request of the National Prices Commission in 1977, with particular reference to the growing of potatoes.  Our report was prepared by An Foras Talúntais which consisted of studies on grading systems in three European countries &mdash; Germany, the Netherlands and Great Britain, and on an evaluation of quality and retail prepacks.  It was found that all three countries had a compulsory grading system.  The German and Dutch schemes were operated by the Government inspectorate, while the British scheme was the responsibility of the British <Col N="1531" /> Potato Marketing Board, a Government-sponsored agency.</P>
    <P>Again in the autumn of 1982, An Foras Talúntais were requested by the Department of Agriculture to carry out a study of the Irish potato market with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>To study the quality of home grown main crop potatoes during the 1982-83 marketing year from the point of view of the acceptability to Irish consumers, having regard to the availability, quality and price of competing imports and to make such recommendations as they consider in the matter.</P>
    <P>At last we have this Bill before us and on those points, I welcome it.  It is very vague and a beginning only.  I hope that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture will have the political will and, more important, the political muscle to support this beginning.  I am firmly convinced that the Minister is fully committed and I wish him well.  I guarantee him our support in facing these enormous problems.  I should like to quote from a report from An Foras Talúntais, to put the whole matter in perspective:</P>
    <P>Potatoes are the most important tillage crop in the Netherlands, for instance.  They occupy almost 25 per cent of the tilled land.  Production is so intensive that a strict rotational programme must be followed.  In Ireland, potatoes occupy little more than 7 per cent of the tilled area and are clearly a much less important crop than in the Netherlands.  In recent years the area under ware and seed potatoes in the Netherlands has been increasing while in Ireland it is falling.  The area under potatoes in the Netherlands is about three times the area in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It seems that we cannot find accurate information on potato acreage.  An Foras Talúntais give the figure for 1983 as somewhere between 98,000 and 123,000 acres and that is a very wide gap.  From that point of view, the registration of growers will be a significant advantage.  At least we will have an idea of the acreage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> Deputies tonight have been talking about gluts on the one hand and valleys on the other.  There is no stability in potato production.  One year, producers are successful and the next year everybody wants to get in on the act.  This has caused most of our problems.  One year, potatoes are going for nothing and the next year it could be the other way around and imports would be very desirable.  We must clear up this aspect.</P>
    <P>The market here apparently requires 890,000 tonnes and there has been a shortfall on what has been grown in the past years of 85,000 tonnes.  It is remarkable that we must import so much, but that is because we do not know where we are going.  This constitutes an enormous loss to the national economy of something like £25 million per year, as was mentioned earlier.  I understand that figure rose to £30 million last year.  In the Netherlands, for instance, there are 15,000 growers who produced four million tonnes from 250,000 acres.  Believe it or not, they exported one million tonnes. That is at a profit.  Surely there is a lesson there for us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister well.  I ask him to use his political muscle to ensure that this Bill does not just stay as it is.  It has a long way to go and I want the Minister to ensure that it does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputies that the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, must interrupt the debate at 10.20 to conclude the Second Stage debate.  It is now 10.07 p.m., which means that there are 13 minutes left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I could not in all conscience unreservedly welcome this Bill.  It worries me because there is no indication that it will in any way affect the import of potatoes from Northern Ireland.  The situation in that respect is very serious and it is important that we have this register, as the seed potato people have had for the last 30-odd years.  However, it is pointless having that register if people who grow potatoes <Col N="1533" /> outside the State can export them into this part of the country unlicensed.  It is interesting, and indeed alarming, to note from the Minister's speech of last week that £25 million worth of potato products are imported into the country.  We have an obligation to try to find a substitute for these, because import substitution could resolve many of our problems.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister what plans he has for the subsidisation of potatoes, as has been introduced in Northern Ireland in the recent past.  About 60,000 tonnes were withdrawn from the market there and a subsidy given.  Those potatoes, in turn, must now be dyed.  I would ask the Minister to investigate and let us know &mdash; if not tonight, at some future date &mdash; what the Department have done and will do to ensure that those dyed potatoes are not regarded.  Anyone with practical experience will know that it is possible to dye the top layers and have a sheet of plastic underneath so that anything under that need not necessarily be dyed.  These potatoes will find their way into our markets. It is only natural that people will try to do this but we must protect our own producers.</P>
      <P>In the short time available, I ask the Minister of State how he would classify a small farmer who grows a couple of tonnes of potatoes and may well barter those with the local shopkeeper or co-operative to obtain the basic essentials for his family.  Is that man selling to the local shopkeeper and is it right that he should have to pay a licence fee of £15, as would the larger producers?</P>
      <P>How does the Minister propose to implement this legislation?  How difficult will it be to administer?  Is it proposed to appoint new inspectors or will this work be done by existing staff?  Does the Minister have the power to bring in regulations requiring a subscription, as in the case of people involved in seed potatoes?  I understand they pay about £5 per tonne. I should like the Minister to clarify whether there is any possibility of such a subscription being required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that unless drastic steps are taken 1984-85 could be a repeat of 1982-83 when potatoes were dumped into the <Col N="1534" /> sea.  The Minister must consider a floor price.  If this is not permissible under EC regulations, he should tell us how the British and Northern Ireland authorities can do it.  It would eliminate the peaks and valleys.  I want an assurance that there will be proper control of imported potatoes and that they will be subject to the same regulations which apply to home produced potatoes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this simple Bill which enables the Minister to expend £100,000 to support the Irish Co-operative Movement in creating 12 regional co-ops.  The Minister has clearly identified the problems of potato marketing. We must start at the beginning and it is vital that we should have adequate research to ensure that we are producing the right potato for the Irish market and that we get the maximum yield.  The Department of Agriculture and An Foras Talúntais should be in a position to identify clearly the areas of the country where we can get maximum yields or where it would be profitable for farmers to specialise in potato production.  We should have information at our disposal <i>vis-á-vis</i> market trends.  It is vitally important that the Department should assist the co-ops in research into quality, varieties and market demands.</P>
      <P>The ICOS must be complimented on pioneering this project, particularly their secretary, John Tobin, who has given much time to it.  If the Department do not back them up the same thing will happen as in the case of the Western Potato Co-op, Erin Foods and others, due to fluctuations in the market place.</P>
      <P>There must be an incentive for the producer.  He must know what he will get for his potatoes and what demand there will be in the local area, as well as knowing how long these markets will last.  It is vital that the co-ops should be able to store the potatoes, display them and sell them on the local market.  If we are not organised in this way to produce the right products we will not be able to compete with foreign imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Gallagher, in saying that a weakness of the <Col N="1535" /> Bill is that it will do nothing to prevent smuggling.  Year after year foreign potatoes come in through Derry, Greenore, and other places and there is nothing in the Bill to prevent this happening.</P>
    <P>The Department should have information at their disposal to ensure that the farmers will have the incentive to produce. It is also of vital importance that the consumer should have information throughout the year, on similar lines to the type of information provided in the mornings by Bord Iascaigh Mhara in their fish market reports.  Consumers should know what they will have to pay for potatoes each day.</P>
    <P>It is vital to utilise scientific and technological progress to ensure that the right type of potato is produced and processed in such a way that fast food outlets and others will utilise Irish potatoes rather than foreign imports.  Until we get total support from the Department we cannot hope to provide for the Irish potato the type of stable market which it requires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I would point out that some of the criticisms of the Bill were not relevant because they related to what was omitted from the Bill rather than what was contained in it.  We should appeal for more legislation in this area as a matter of urgency.  The marketing situation is extremely haphazard and this is causing people to pause when they think of the heavy investment required for potatoes. The fluctuation in supplies will continue and a floor price will have to be established. This point was made by Deputy Treacy and others.  People should know where they are going pricewise before they invest.</P>
      <P>The import situation is grave.  Small villages which I thought would never see an imported potato now have Netherlands potatoes in net bags stacked roof high at a time when normally our supplies should be available.  Import substitution would be worth £25 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I went into a supermarket to see how matters stood.  I saw a 4Ib, bag of chipped potatoes imported from West <Col N="1536" /> Germany and selling at £1.19.  We must consider also that our punt is not very strong against the Deutsche Mark.</P>
    <P>We have the soil, we have the seed and we have a tradition of co-operative action.  We also have the scientific backup. Studies are being done in genetic engineering and bio-technology whereby it may be possible to grow potatoes from seed rather than from seed potatoes. That will come before the end of the year and will facilitate the cultivation of the potato.</P>
    <P>Official Department of Agriculture policy in relation to applied science is partly responsible for what has happened in relation to this £25 million import bill. In my own area there was a concentration on dairying to the exclusion of everything else.  I have spoken on a number of occasions about a possible national campaign emanating from the Department encouraging people to plant even their own gardens.  In order to give good example I did so myself this year with fantastic results in productivity.  One of the evening papers pointed out that the &ldquo;spud&rdquo; trade is in chaos because of illegal imports from the Six Counties.  I warn the Minister, through you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that action should be taken about it because we are very much exposed to these subsidised potatoes of poor quality being put on the market for the Christmas trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Members for their contributions to the debate.  I regret that time is short.  A measure of the interest in this is that people stayed on to this late hour to discuss it.  With all the points made I would not have a hope in hell of covering the entire scene, but I hope on Committee Stage that we can take it point by point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the North they are supposed to have their own controls on dyed potatoes, but our Customs and Department inspectors are constantly seeking out illegal imports. A point was made about new inspectors and existing staff.  Staff other than potato staff will be re-deployed initially.  The £15 <Col N="1537" /> revenue will be related to the cost of administering the scheme and everyone will have to pay.  That does not mean the small grower supplying the small shop. More than likely he is obeying the regulations anyway.  The standards of such people are usually very high, so they have nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>Many Members mentioned the right potato.  That the housewife is influenced by the visual impact is proved by the popularity of the Dutch variety which is mentioned as a poor variety.  We will have to consider high yield varieties in order to be able to compete with this type of potato.  Pentland Del and Cara, which is exporting so well at the moment, were mentioned.  Both are excellent varieties. They are high yielding and we should encourage their production.</P>
    <P>I must continue to repeat that we cannot really stop imports.  We are in a free trade situation.  I accept that this is only a beginning and we have to take on other countries at their own game.  The importance of the co-operative has been acknowledged by various speakers.  This Bill covers ware potatoes only; it does not cover potato chips or potatoes for processing.  The processor has his own way of dealing with this and a tare system is in operation.</P>
    <P>Some Members mentioned exemption for hospitals.  There are no exemptions. Anyone selling to a hospital, a shop or whatever, even from a parked trailer, must register.  We will have a simple application form and a simple questionnaire about varieties and proposed acreage. The committee mentioned are anxious that we would be able to budget reasonably well in advance for the tonnages that would be required.  The shops and supermarkets are very forthcoming in stating their requirements and they are also anxious where possible to use an Irish product if it is as good as the imported one, but it must be good.  At least one supermarket in the city has adopted a system of &ldquo;pick your own&rdquo; where the potatoes are in open trays. One speaker said that housewives are buying potatoes in this way even though <Col N="1538" /> they are probably half as expensive again as they would be in other places.</P>
    <P>About 85 per cent of growers are packers already, and they will have their own registration number, the idea being that a grower who grows specifically for a packer may bring the potatoes along in trailers and the packer brushes, cleans and prepares them for the market.  The 15 per cent of growers who are selling direct to the market will be directly responsible for the product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>We will consider any amendment.  We had some very difficult legislative problems with this simple legislation and I would not like any seize-up on any amendment that would delay unduly what we are trying to do.  Imports will be subject to all our grading regulations, and that is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major problem is the lack of storage, and with that in mind the co-operatives are examining the possibility of utilising existing stores for grading and packaging. I believe that in the south-east developments have been fairly dramatic along those lines, though not so much in centralised storage.  Storage generally will have to be in localised areas, and you do not have to be a big co-operative to get a <Col N="1539" /> storage grant.  All that is needed are five growers to qualify for the storage grant. It is hoped to implement the legislation for the 1985 crop.  I hope to deal with other points on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to section 5 under which the Minister will have power to make regulations.  Apart from the purpose mentioned in section 5, namely the keeping of records by registered growers and packers, regulations will be resorted to for the purpose of settling or altering the fee to be paid by applicants for registration and regarding the information supplied by applicants and middlemen in addition to the names and addresses.  I cannot foresee at this stage what other purposes may be served by regulations, but as time goes on there may be a need for further regulations.  It is precisely to cater as far as possible for the unforeseen that the provision for making regulations has been inserted in the Bill.  The alternative would be the much more laborious process of amending legislation and, as Deputy Noonan pointed out, any regulation made would have to be presented to each House of the Oireachtas, either of which would have the power to annul it.</P>
    <P>This is only a beginning but a real beginning.  The significance of it is that it is not emanating from our Department. The demand for this type of legislation came from the growers' organisations who had been dealing with the sort of problems we have been talking about, a year of scarcity when people made a great deal of money followed by a year of over-supply. They want to try to regulate this market so that we will have a budgeting of what we need for the ware market.  No ware scene is complete without a processing arm.  With the help of the IDA and a number of interested people we are considering the possibilities here.  We may not be able to situate it exactly where Deputy Sheehan has in mind, but the processing side is vital.</P>

      <P>A processing arm is vital to take the over-supply, but the biggest scandal at the moment, as Deputy Wilson pointed out rightly, is that all of the supermarkets have a large quantity of inferior potato chips and in that area we have a great deal of scope for improvement.  I do not mind telling the House that the only problem that I have found so far is that the project would have to be so big. Because the machinery and other equipment are so expensive we would need, in addition to supplying the home market, to engage in the export trade also.  A small operation in this area is not sufficient. I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be honest if I were not to accept that the raising of a matter on the Adjournment, especially at 10.30 in the evening, is not an attractive proposition for anyone in the House but I am hoping that when the House has heard my submission it will appreciate that it is never too late to do what is <Col N="1541" /> correct.  I appreciate that the Minister has seen fit to be present and I trust that when he has heard the facts in this case he will use his powers to direct that the mistake or the omission that led to the insensitive decision in the case in question will be put right.</P>
      <P>I refer to the case of a young man in my constituency, Terry Boland, who has been confined to a wheelchair for the past nine years as the result of an accident in respect of which he did not receive any compensation.  Within the terms of our social welfare regulations, regulations which indicate a sensitivity in respect of such persons, Terry was in receipt of a mobility allowance of £25 per month and of a disabled person's maintenance allowance of £40 per week.  Dublin Corporation were considerate towards him. They provided an extension at his home which made life easier for him.  Fortunately for this young man he has many friends in the area.  One of these, a young lady, used to visit him and as often happens in these cases, they fell in love and married on 18 August last.  Naturally, Terry and his wife, Margaret, were overjoyed. After they had been married for two weeks they had a visitor from the health board services and Terry inquired of this official as to whether he would be entitled to increased allowances to help him in his new responsibility.  His young wife is an employee of a local bakery and she is required to begin her day at 6 p.m. so as to be able to report to the bakery at 7 a.m. where she works hard until 3.30 in the afternoon.  Her gross pay is £90 per week.</P>
      <P>At the end of September Terry had another visit from an official of the health board.  I do not know whether it was the person who had visited him on the first occasion but this official informed Terry that because of his changed status and because of his wife working he would not be entitled to any allowance.  From then on both his mobility and disabled person's maintenance allowances were withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An added burden for this young couple, thought I accept this is not the responsibility of the Minister, was the <Col N="1542" /> fact that the wife spent many weeks endeavouring to have the Revenue Commissioners make the appropriate adjustments in her income tax liability so as to make some allowance in respect of her new husband.</P>
    <P>Having served both as a young civil servant and as a junior Minister I am familiar with the way in which the parliamentary question process operates.  The question is sent down along the line but unfortunately it happens invariably that the special merits of a case are not taken into consideration.  The reply I got to my question was that, because of a means test applying in respect of the two allowances Terry Boland was in receipt of, he no longer qualified for them.  That was an easy answer but it gives no indication of the caring society we claim to be. I am not levelling any accusation at the Minister in this regard but he, too, is part of this society.  I do not believe that the decision in this case and the circumstances were made known to the Minister. However, I wonder what his reaction would be if the person concerned were his brother, his sister or even his son or daughter.  We are talking about real people, people who are not very concerned about the outcome of our deliberations on wine lakes or any of the other matters that are been given high priority.</P>
    <P>When we think of the numbers of people who avoid complying with the various regulations in respect of social welfare, we can have some idea of how upset Terry Boland and his wife are as a result of what happened to them by reason of their complying with the regulations and disclosing that they had married. If they had not made that disclosure, Terry could have continued to draw both allowances.  That situation might have continued indefinitely.  But we are talking about two decent and honest young people.</P>
    <P>One can only ponder as to what the psychological reaction of Terry and his wife is to this decision.  Each time Terry wishes to go anywhere he must engage a taxi.  Nobody here would begrudge this young man a telephone or a television but all these amenities have to be paid <Col N="1543" /> for.  In addition, Terry must have special clothing and special food but here we are with a massive budget for social welfare and unable to allow Terry to continue to draw his allowance of £46 per week.  His wife is not very robust.  One would not expect her to be since she must start work so early in the day and work hard to earn money to feed and keep her husband. What happens if tomorrow she feels indisposed, and normally she should be able to treat herself to a few days at home?  Suppose she is in need of medical attention, she knows now that in the new position she would get from the bakery £6 per week and she would get from the State after a fortnight's wait, the approprivate welfare benefits.  Meanwhile, what happens to Terry?  Nobody here would suggest that, out of the paltry salary his wife gets and with all the demands on it, she should have any nest egg for the rainy day.</P>
    <P>On occasions such as this I am entitled to speak for 20 minutes but I have said enough to make known to the Minister the facts of this case.  This is not an imaginary case.  At this hour the gallery is inevitably weak and there will not be much publicity but I could not care less if as a result of the opportunity afforded to me to bring this to the Minister's attention I have encouraged him to take an interest in this case and to direct tomorrow that out of the funds available to the Eastern Health Board they renew forthwith the payment of those two allowances to Terry Boland.  If not, the cynicism and occasional depression I have arising from what I see about me will have been deepended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>This question has been the subject of a Dáil Question by the Deputy and he has elaborated this evening on the background and the issue involved.  The disabled person's maintenance allowance is governed by the DPMA regulations, 1984 and Article 4 of those regulations states very clearly that in assessing eligibility for the allowance the health boards shall have regard to the income of the <Col N="1544" /> person concerned and to the income of the spouse of that person.  I signed the regulations in July 1984 and all my predecessors implemented and processed the same regulations.  There has been no change in the regulations approved of and implemented by successive Ministers for Health.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the health boards were obliged, once the information was given, to end paying the allowance.  Once the health board became aware that the means of the spouse of the person in question exceeded the income guidelines laid down under the scheme they had to cease paying the allowance.  In order to qualify for an allowance of that nature the basic personal income is £39 a week.  If a single person has an income over £39 a week he does not qualify for disabled persons maintenance allowance.  Likewise a person does not qualify for the mobility allowance of £300 a year.  These allowances are means tested.  There is an allowance for a spouse of £22.15 which means affectively that if the income of a couple is £61.15 gross per week they are eligible but if the couples' income exceeds that amount the person is not eligible for the DMPA or for the mobility allowance.  In this instance I am not quite clear as to the exact income of the wife in question but her income has been stated by Deputy Tunney to be in the region of £90 a week gross and I noticed in a newspaper article in relation to the case that Margaret's wage is £85 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is in the region of £85 or £90 on the basis of the evidence heard.  The Deputy will appreciate that with the limit for a husband and wife being £61.15, the applicant has quite clearly well in excess of the guidelines laid down.  The Deputy will understand that in order for the regulations to be seen to be applied in an equitable manner the health board must apply the regulations in a standard way and <Col N="1545" /> they cannot make exceptions to the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>To do so would be in breach of the regulations.  I do not know what other income the family would have.  Presumably they have no other income.  Deputy Tunney stated that the person was involved in an accident.  I know that the newspaper referred to a car accident and Deputy Tunney stated that the person did not receive any compensation. I accept what the Deputy says and I will inquire as to why he did not receive compensation.  The other inquiry I will make is in relation to the matter referred to by the Deputy, that the applicant concerned requires special food and special clothes.  I can ask the health board to review his position to see what assistance might be required.  There is, as the Deputy knows, the supplementary welfare scheme whereby a person who is in need can be aided.  I do not know all the circumstances of this case as the matter has been raised so very recently in the Dáil and tonight by way of Private Notice Question.  I do not know whether the couple are living at home.  They may well be living with his parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <P>A couple living at home with their family and not having any rent to pay would have that taken into account by the health board in assessing any additional assistance which the family might need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make the point to Deputy <Col N="1546" /> Tunney that, if there is exceptional difficulty facing this family in meeting their ordinary financial commitments, then I would approach the health board on their behalf requesting that their situation be reviewed.  The regulations so stipulate, to use that rather official term.  They have been in existence for quite a long time now.  They are applied on that basis, whether in terms of the mobility allowance or the DPMA.  I cannot make any statutory exceptions in that regard.  I shall also check if the couple in question have a medical card.</P>

      <P>At present there are 21 small privately owned hydro-electric power units connected to the national grid whose surplus capacity is bought by the ESB.  During the year ended March 1984, a total of 6.5 million units generated by private hydro schemes was purchased by the ESB.  No direct financial incentives are, at present, available from my Department for the development of hydro-power projects.  In 1981, however, a competition was held for the design and development of small hydro schemes.  This competition resulted in thirteen projects being grant-aided to the value of £98,800.  The performance of four of these is being monitored. This programme will be completed in 1986 and in the light of the results obtained, a decision will be taken concerning our future plans in this area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy in view of the fact that work in other countries has shown that a considerable investment in Ireland of as much as £1,000 million in energy conservation would be more cost effective than investment in energy supply and distribution, would create jobs and would generate savings, the inducements and incentives provided by the Government to encourage energy conservation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of funds to meet expenditure of the magnitude suggested by the Deputy on Energy conservation could not be considered either practicable or feasible.  In any event, there is no evidence available to me to support the view that such investment would achieve the <Col N="1304" /> results claimed.  Within the limits of resources available to my Department, an energy conservation programme is being carried out.  The aim of the programme is to achieve cost effective savings with the greatest voluntary cooperation.</P>
      <P>My Department offers the following free services carried out by the HRS: (i) four regional energy conservations officers; (ii) a public building advisory service; (iii) a steam plant audit service consisting of a test of steam traps, boilers and pipe insulation.</P>
      <P>These services are aimed at the industrial, commercial and public sectors.  In addition, fifteen booklets on different aspects of energy efficiency have been prepared for industry and grants of one-third the cost of fuel efficiency surveys are also available.  An active forum for the exchange of information is the Energy Management Association, originally set up and funded by my Department and now semi-autonomous.</P>
      <P>For the domestic sector, advice on energy conservation is available on telephone Numbers 01-376666 and 01-375107/8. Advice and encouragement are given by the NBST to those interested in participating in the EEC scheme of aid for energy projects with new technology or demonstrations value of ways of saving energy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on my request to the ESB last May to re-evaluate the cost of electricity supply to Inisturk Island, County Mayo, it has now been decided to extend supply to the island through a central generating system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before work on the project itself can commence, it will be necessary for the islanders to form a co-operative to administer <Col N="1305" /> the electricity supply on the island and a suitably qualified person who will operate the system will have to be appointed.  The ESB have informed me that they are having discussions with the islanders in regard to formation of a co-operative at present.  Commencement of initial work on the project itself (construction of a suitable building to house the generation equipment and transport of the plant and machinery to the island) will depend on seasonal factors and availability of equipment.  The ESB estimate that, assuming early formation of a co-operative by the islanders, the initial work could commence in early summer of 1985.</P>

      <P>The request made to my Department on 26 November by a representative of Polasario for a specific sum in aid for Saharoui refugees is being considered. I should point out that the relief operation for the people in question is being handled by among others the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).  This is one of the normal international channels through which the Government provide assistance for refugees. The Government make a substantial annual contribution to the UNHCR for its work in assisting refugees.  In addition, at the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa held in Geneva in July this year the Government pledged IR£75,000 to UNHCR for its operations with refugees in Africa.</P>
      <P>The human suffering arising from the conflict over the territory of Western Sahara is a matter of concern.  It is to be hoped that a ceasefire can be brought about and that a referendum can then be held in which the people of Western Sahara could exercise their right to self-determination. The Government support efforts in this direction which have been made by the Organisation of African Unity.  The Government hope that these efforts can be resumed despite the setback at the most recent OAU summit in Addis Ababa.</P>

    <P>Note 1: The figures shown in this column are the block grant allocations made by the Department. The block grant supplements the provision made from the road authority's own resources for the improvement, maintenance and management of regional roads, for improvement works on county roads, and for traffic management works including works on national roads.  The determination of priorities in the expenditure of the block grants, including the amount to be spent on improvement works on county roads, is a matter for the county council.  Road grants are not provided for maintenance works on county roads.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has any proposals from Donegal County Council for the up-grading of the following roads to national primary or secondary standards: Bridgend to Buncrana, Muff to Moville, Buncrana to Moville via Carndonagh; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The national primary and secondary road system is now generally regarded as established, having been formally declared in 1977 following a long process of evaluation and consultation. Earlier this year Donegal County Council requested that the route connecting Buncrana / Clonmany / Carndonagh / Moville / Muff be upgraded to national secondary status.  This route, which is known as the Ring of Inishowen, comprises regional roads R.238 and R.240. The request was examined and the council was informed on 6 November 1984 that having regard to the criteria used to designate national roads reclassification was not warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was indicated in a reply to a parliamentary question from the Deputy on 22 November 1983 it is not proposed to reclassify the Bridgend to Buncrana road which is designated as regional road R.238.  Requests for the reclassification of this road were received from Donegal <Col N="1317" /> County Council when the designation of national roads was being prepared.  These requests were also examined and the council was informed that reclassification was not warranted having regard to the criteria used for the designation of national roads.</P>

      <P>While additional public investment in the building industry, over and above the level, envisaged in the national plan, could be expected to provide a boost to construction output in the short term, the implications for the overall level of public expenditure, for borrowing requirements and for taxation would in the longer term be damaging to all sections of the economy, including the building industry itself.  The plan provides for the maintenance of public investment affecting the building industry at the highest sustainable level and, in particular, provides for substantially increased investment in roads, for the maintenance of high levels of investment in housing and sanitary services, and for the introduction of a number of new policy measures in housing, the general effect of which should be to stimulate overall investment in this sector.  Within the public capital programme as a whole, it is projected that expenditure affecting the building industry will take up an increasing share of total public capital expenditure.</P>

    <P>In practice, all forest workers receive a measure of training in a variety of forest operations.  This training is generally given on the job as circumstances require and is occasionally supplemented by special short courses organised locally. The new forest worker training centre at present being established at Mountrath, County Laois, will afford an opportunity for more specialised training for selected workers in future.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to maintain recruitment of forest workers at a level consistent with Government policy to achieve a reduction in the numbers employed in the public sector.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the dissatisfaction referred to.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara is the statutory body with primary responsibility for the overall development of the fishing industry.  The board's export development strategy is part of an overall market development programme covering both home and export markets which in turn is an integral part of the board's plan for the development of the fishing sector.  The board provides a wide range of financial, technical, educational, resource development and marketing services to the industry, from the catching stage through to final marketing of the product.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the board's activities Irish exports of fish and fish products are continuing to expand.  Figures for the seven months ended 31 July 1984 indicate an increase in value of 15 per cent over that for the same period in 1983.</P>

Because of the complex nature of the proposed development works, however, comprehensive and time consuming surveys of the area were necessary before detailed plans could be prepared.</P>
      <P>At a meeting in July 1984 between officials of my Department, the Office of Public Works, Louth County Council and their consulting engineers, a further report was sought from the consultants.

    <P>The International Convention of Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978 (STCW) was ratified by Ireland on 11 September last and will come into force for Ireland with effect from 11 December <Col N="1327" /> next.  The provisions of the STCW Convention in relation to the continued proficiency and updating of knowledge of masters and deck and engineer officers are set out in Marine Notices Nos. 23 and 24 of 1984 which were issued by my Department.  Briefly, a certificate of competency or service held by a master, deck officer or engineer officer will remain valid for sea-going service for a period of five years from entry into force of the Convention or from the date of issue of the certificate, if later, subject to the holder being medically fit for such service.  Thereafter, the certificate will remain valid for sea-going service for a further five year period if the holder has served in his certificated capacity in sea-going ships of any flag for the last 12 months (which need not be continuous) during the preceding five years.  Alternatively, satisfactory completion of an approved shore-based updating course or three months sea-going service of a specified kind may be sufficient to revalidate a certificate.  The foregoing requirements, moreover, may be waived in certain circumstances e.g. if the holder of a certificate has served in certain employments which provide equivalent experience to sea service.  Marine Notices 23 and 24 of 1984 set out the relevant details.</P>

      <P>The number of children being placed by health boards with foster families has shown a significant increase in recent years.  One of the main contributory factors has been the introduction by my Department of a new approach to the recruitment and training of foster parents.  The new scheme, which is known as the &ldquo;Parenting Plus Scheme&rdquo; includes special training for social workers and foster parents and an educational programme for prospective foster parents.  This more structured approach to recruitment has resulted in a greater awareness of fostering.  I am confident that it will continue to assist boards to maintain and increase their pool of suitable foster parents.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 11 January 1980 to 8 December 1982 and was transferred to invalidity pension from 9 December 1982.  To determine his continued entitlement to invalidity pension he was examined on 17 July 1984 by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  Since the conditions for receipt of invalidity pension were no longer satisfied payment of the pension was discontinued from 2 August 1984.  The person concerned appealed against this decision and was reexamined on 14 August 1984 by a different medical referee who again expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  The case was referred to an appeals officer who has decided to hold an oral hearing.

My Department's main concern in relation to quality control is to ensure that food products are sound and wholesome and are processed under hygienic conditions.  It also enforces regulations on the grading and packing of certain products such as fresh fruit and vegetables, potatoes and eggs.</P>

      <P>There is of course, an ongoing need in the milk processing sector for investment in plant and equipment, and my Department and the State agencies concerned actively promote and encourage such investment.  This matter is, however, primarily one for the dairy industry itself as indeed, is the issue of product diversification. I am aware that the industry has been examining how best to achieve increased product diversification and I would urge that it should avail itself fully of the grant aid which is available from the Industrial Development Authority. The high priority given by the Government to the development of the food industry and the strategy for the production of added value, consumer-type products are clearly indicated in the national economic plan <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987.</i></P>

      <P>This scheme came into operation in 1981 <Col N="1378" /> and has been well publicised.  To date, 5,816 hectares of commonage have been legally divided but the situation in regard to the carrying out of follow-up work &mdash; fencing, reclamation etc. &mdash; by the owners of the divided plots is not satisfactory. The potential for commonage division in the counties mentioned by the Deputy is less than in other parts of the west and a lower uptake is accordingly not surprising.  The programme under which the western package operates is due for review next year in consultation with the EC Commission and opportunity will be taken to introduce any changes considered necessary to make the overall implementation of the package more effective.</P>

      <P>As the Community is only 76 per cent self-sufficient in sheepmeat it is reasonable to anticipate some expansion in flock numbers and production, particularly in Ireland's case.  In fact, between 1980 and 1984 the number of breeding ewes in Ireland has increased from 1.6 million to 1.8 million.</P>
      <P>My Department encourage increased production in a variety of ways, including the greater use of more prolific ewes.  In addition, expert advice is available from ACOT and AFT.  However, efforts to expand production further will have only limited success unless producers observe the necessary market disciplines in relation to the disposal of lambs of the right quality at the right time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The new Garda station at Gurranebraher serves the area formerly policed from Shandon station.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current overall Garda strength at Gurranebraher is 36, all ranks, which represents a net increase of seven over the strength of the station party which transferred there from Shandon on 3 August 1984.  The Garda authorities have no proposals at present to allocate additional manpower to Gurranebraher station but the matter will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>The superintendent at McCurtain Street station has responsibility for the policing of the Cork City North Garda District, which includes the area served by Gurranebraher station, and any question of altering this arrangement will be a matter for consideration in the course of the current review of the organisation of the Garda Síochána in Cork city and surrounding areas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the anomaly in the law relating to the family home whereby if the family home is in the joint names of both spouses, then, if one spouse deserts the other the general view within the legal profession is that the spouse who has deserted does not lose his-her rights over the family home for 12 years; if he agrees that this is unfair, particularly since, under existing legislation, a spouse who deserts another cannot object to the other spouse selling the family home after he-she has been deserted for two years; and if he will introduce legislation to rectify this anomaly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Even accepting what is said in the first part of this question and I express no opinion on the view set out therein, I do not see that an anomaly arises.  The question deals with two different types of rights in relation to property and different considerations would obviously apply in the regulation of them. Incidentally the Family Home Protection Act 1976 does not specify any period of desertion before a spouse's consent to sale of the family home will be dispensed with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As indicated in reply to previous Questions, it is difficult to be precise about such costings, but, on the basis of a detailed analysis carried out early in 1983 and allowing for (a) subsequent increases in pay and allowances and car costs such as fuel etc. and (b) savings due to reduced usage and smaller cars, it is calculated that the cost for the year ended 1 December 1984 was, on average, £78,000 per user.</P>
      <P>In relation to the year ending 31 December 1985, the cost would reflect changes in pay and allowances of drivers, in car costs and in the level of usage during that period.  Accordingly, it is not possible to provide more than a tentative estimate which is that there may be an increase over the 1984 figure of the order of 5 per cent - 7 per cent.</P>
