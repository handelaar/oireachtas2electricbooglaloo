      <P>I made a ruling the other day that I do not take anything before Question Time, the reason being that there is an allotted time for questions. The Deputy may say to me that he is raising one matter only, but sometimes we have 15 matters of this nature and this would erode Question Time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of local authority workers in each county who have lost their jobs or are on a reduced working week as a result of the cutback in Government grants and inadequate financial provisions; and if he will establish, by contacting each county manager, the number expected to be so affected by December 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question refers to cutbacks in Government grants and inadequate financing and I would like to take this opportunity to correct some misconceptions which have been expressed in this regard.  In so far as grants to local authorities are concerned, total Government grants and subsidies to local authorities will this year show an increase of £52 million or 10.3 per cent on 1983.  Capital allocations will be up by £12.5 million in spite of the limitations on public expenditure and borrowing.  In so far as the rate support grants are concerned, we have managed not alone to maintain the additional £31.5 million which we provided in 1983, but have provided an additional £2.27 million, bringing the total of the rate support grants to almost £280 million. Apart from the various increases in <Col N="681" /> grants and allocations, local authorities have had restored to them the discretion to strike whatever rate they consider appropriate and have been given extended powers to supplement their resources by way of charges for services.</P>
      <P>I do not, therefore, accept the implication underlying the first part of the question in so far as it refers to cutbacks in Government grants.  Statistical information as to the extent to which workers may have been put on short-time or laid off by particular local authorities as a result of local circumstances is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>By way of clarification, I should say that decisions as to the employment of local authority workers are a matter for the local authorities concerned, taking account of their circumstances.  Local authorities are not required to inform me as to their plans and intentions in this matter but, in view of my concern to see that workers are not laid off or put on short time unless all other reasonable options are exhausted, I am monitoring the situation on a regular basis and will continue to do so throughout the year. For this purpose, I recently introduced a revised reporting system covering local authority employment levels, as well as explanations for changes in these levels.</P>
      <P>I do not propose at this stage to contact county managers along the lines envisaged in the final part of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of supplementary questions to which I should like to get some answers with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle.  First, I should like to ask the Minister if he would not agree with me that it is a disgraceful situation for a Labour Minister to stand up in this House and say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and say that he has not available to him the number of workers laid off or on short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not try to shout down the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> The Deputy started his question by argument but he should not use argument at Question Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously there is but limited information on the Minister's file. Will he tell the House, even under this new monitoring system, the number of workers who have been laid off or who are on short time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it would be to the benefit of this House and the country generally if he had such information as he is Minister for the Environment and responsible for the local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the question, I said I had initiated a system whereby I would gather this information and keep in touch with local authorities to see what was happening.  At the moment that information is not available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The last part of Question No. 3 asked the Minister if he would establish, by contacting each county manager, the number to be so affected by December 1984 and the Minister said he had no intention of doing that.  Will he reconsider that decision because it would be of benefit to the workers involved know what was ahead of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say I had no intention of doing what was suggested said that at this stage I had not envisaged doing it.  I said I was initiating a procedure whereby this information would be got from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tried to claim as a major plus in local authority funding the fact that he has given them an increase of 8 per cent in respect of rates support while inflation is running 10 per cent.  Does the Minister not accept that local authorities are grinding to halt, that, for example, the road networks is disintegrating because he has given <Col N="683" /> local authorities an increase of only .8 per cent in respect of rates support at a time when the Government approved an 8 per cent increase for local authority workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I stated that an additional £52 million over the amount given in 1983 was being given in various grants this year which represented an increase of 10.3 per cent over 1983.  In addition, an extra £31,500,000 over the Estimate brought in by Fianna Fáil was allocated last year and I am maintaining that this year as well as giving an extra £2.7 million.  The whole rate support grant will amount to £280 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In other words, people who retire prematurely because of bad health are not being replaced.  People on short-time working or who are laid off are being paid by the State by way of social welfare.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together The maintenance of a satisfactory public water supply is a matter for the relevant sanitary authority and I have no direct function in the matter.  In the circumstances, however, I have had inquiries made of Dún Laoghaire Corporation on the matter.</P>
      <P>The corporation have indicated that the water supply at Sallynoggin and Blackrock is now satisfactory apart from a few isolated problems thought to be due to individual leaks or faulty fittings which the local authority are dealing with in the normal way.  There was a problem in the general supply some months ago when the Dublin Corporation supply to the area was restricted to reduce the draw down of water from the Stillorgan reser voir.  When it became clear that this restriction was causing problems in part of Dún Laoghaire, Dublin Corporation restored the pressure and it is understood that the general supply has since been satisfactory.</P>
      <P>As regards the water supply to Trim leston Gardens, Booterstown, Dún Laoghaire Corporation have indicated that they are not aware of any complaint regarding a shortage of water in this are except in the case of isolated incident pertaining to leaks or blocked pipe which are being examined in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just come back from Sallynoggin and I do not know where the Minister got his information. I was in O'Rourke Park, Sallynoggin Park, Sarsfield Park and Pearse Road. The Minister referred to a few isolated problems and I agree that Question No. 4 deals with the Sallynoggin area.  How can the Minister say that the problem is solved?  On the information he has he genuinely believes that the problem has been solved but this is not so.  It is particularly aggravated at weekends where people cannot even have baths.  It is just not good enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the responsible authority.  The Sallynoggin and Blackrock areas generally are fed from the Dublin Corporation's 24-inch main off the Vartry system from Roundwood to Stillorgan.  There is no shortage in the Sallynoggin and Blackrock areas although increased demands at weekends result in a drop in pressure.  There has been an underlying problem with regard to the Stillorgan reservoir and we hope this will be eased when the construction of the trunk main from Saggart to Ballyboden is completed in a few months' time.  This will permit of the augmentation of the Stillorgan reservoir by about 3 million gallons of water per day.</P>

      <P>Where works are in progress on water mains, it is usual for local authorities to inform the people in the areas affected so that arrangements can be made to bring in supplies before the work starts.  I have given as much information as possible from that given to me by Dún Laoghaire Corporation and I understand that continuing problems will be greatly eased by the new connection being made to the trunk main from Saggart to Ballyboden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 21 inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1984, the Government are providing £2.15 million for grants under the local improvements scheme in respect of farm road projects eligible for EEC aid under the western package.  The 1984 scheme does not apply to projects (such as drainage schemes and works on bog roads) <Col N="691" /> which do not come within the scope of the package.  EEC aid is conditional on a minimum local contribution of 10 per cent from benefiting land holders and is confined to the western counties.  Local authorities were notified by circular letter to this effect on 19 December 1983.  The authorities concerned were notified of their allocations on 24 February 1984. The allocation to Donegal County Council is £288,500.</P>
    <P>Regarding applications under the scheme, I do not propose to alter the established practice of giving local authorities discretion relating to the manner of inviting and processing applications, including the question of the stage at which the cost of a project is estimated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister specifically restricted the scheme this year to schemes eligible for EEC grant aid as well.  As the sum amounts to only £2.15 million, does the Minister not see the logic in granting additional sums to the local improvements scheme from social welfare funds to provide jobs for very necessary schemes and works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment cannot allocate money from social welfare funds to this area. However, as I said, the task force are considering methods by which the section of social welfare to which taxation is contributed by the Minister for Finance can be used for the purposes which the Deputy have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 to 31, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The directive in question was adopted by the EEC Council of Ministers on 30 December 1983.  It was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 11 January 1984 and I understand that a copy of the journal is available in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The directive is designed to secure more equal treatment throughout the Community for victims of traffic accdents. It requires member states to have compulsory motor insurance cover up to certain specified limits and to make compensation available to innocent victims traffic accidents caused by uninsured, stolen or unidentified vehicles.  Implementation of the directive will require amendments to road traffic legislation and the negotiation of a new agreement with the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive requires that national <Col N="699" /> laws be amended by 31 December 1987 and that the provision be generally operative by 31 December 1988.  Because of implications for motor insurance premiums, Ireland has been allowed an additional four years to introduce compensation for property damage caused by uninsured vehicles.</P>
    <P>The present agreement with the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland was negotiated on 30 December 1964.  It is now proposed to review the agreement in the light of the requirements of the EEC directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there has been a substantial and alarming increase in the number of motor accidents resulting in serious injury and loss of life in cases where uninsured drivers are involved?  Furthermore would he give serious consideration to the inclusion of a regulation in whatever legislation is before his Department providing for the display of insurance certificates on windscreens of cars so that uninsured drivers who break the law can be identified quickly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the position in regard to hit and run accidents in Dublin city and county has reached epidemic proportions arising from the theft of cars and in recent times has led to a number of people being knocked down.  Can the Minister give any undertaking that some emergency regulations or legislation, which would have the full support of the House, would be passed by the House to cover such victims?  Would the Minister consider that the Motor Insurers' Bureau would be the appropriate body to compensate such hit and run victims?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I said as clearly as possible to the Deputy that the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill, 1983, had reached Committee Stage and that I would be introducing amendments which I hoped would deal with penalties for the taking of vehicles, penalties which are grossly out of date for this type of offence.  This will be done by way of amendment and the Deputy will have an opportunity of putting his views at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I shall avail of that opportunity, but what I am talking <Col N="701" /> about in addition to penalties is compensation for hit and run victims.  Would the Minister consider introducing on Committee Stage amendments which would give the Motor Insurers' Bureau additional powers?  The Minister will be aware that their powers at present are limited to injury done to the person as distinct from injury done to property. The Minister will have an opportunity on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill to give additional powers to the Motor Insurers' Bureau to compensate the victims of uninsured car driving.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but I understand it is being reviewed in the light of the EEC directive.  Would the Minister clarify the position and say whether the agreement with the Motor Insurers' Bureau is being negotiated on the basis of that EEC directive and in respect of which we have got a derogation until 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that that is much too distant particularly when the rest of Europe will have this property cover in 1988?  Would the Minister not agree that we should be in a similar position, at least in 1988?  Would he not agree that even that is too far distant for those people whose cars are damaged and who receive no compensation? If there is damage to the individual that is covered but not damage to their car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I said this review would take place as soon as possible.  The minimum time in which the directive to which <Col N="702" /> the Deputy referred may become operational is, as he said, 1992.  I would hope that all arrangements would be established long before that and that we would be able to apply that directive within the time specified.  However, there is allowance for a derogation for a further four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is an allowance for a derogation but what happens in the meantime is a serious matter exercising the minds of many people, people who are extremely anxious about this damage to property, cars in particular. Would the Minister not consider bringing forward the provision before 1988 &mdash; in other words, how soon will this renegotiation with the Motor Insurers' Bureau take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This directive, which has to be implemented in all Community countries by 1987, I would assume would allow the Minister for the Environment to talk with the Motor Insurers' Bureau within the next year.  The Deputy must be aware that the implications of this decision probably would mean higher motor insurance premiums for everybody. We must take all problems into account and in our deliberations we want to ensure that we are fair to all sides.  I can assure the Deputy that it is not my intention to hold the matter in abeyance for another eight years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number and nature of accidents on Carysfort Avenue, Blackrock, County Dublin, in the period 1 January 1980 to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the most recent information available to me by the Garda authorities I understand that in the period 1 January, 1980 to mid-February 1984 one fatal accident and six accidents involving personal injury occurred on Carysfort Avenue.  The fatal accident resulted in the death of a motor cycle pillion passenger.  In the other accidents, three pedestrians, one motor-cyclist, one car passenger and one pedal cyclist were injured.  In two cases the injuries were serious, the remainder being minor injuries.  Reliable information regarding accidents involving damage to property only is not available, since a substantial number of such accidents are not reported to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the condition of the road in question, the primary responsibility for its maintenance and for the planning, <Col N="704" /> execution and timing of improvement works, as well as the provision of the necessary finance, rests with Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the Dublin County Council who are the road authorities concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister has been in touch with the Garda authorities.  Was he in touch with the local authority in relation to the time schedule for the widening and improvement of this very dangerous thoroughfare? Will the Minister agree that seven accidents in the last three or four years is seven accidents too many?  Is the Minister aware that during the winter months the gullies fill up with water and pedestrians walking on either side of this very narrow thoroughfare are drenched although it may not be raining at the time?  This amounts to a tremendous hazard, health and otherwise.  I should point out that this is about the fourth time I have raised this matter in the House in the last 20 years and while I do not expect to be here for a further 20 years to raise it on a similar number of occasions I hope the Minister will treat it as a serious problem. It is one of the most dangerous thoroughfares in the city and county of Dublin by any standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the reply I have given that there is a serious accident problem on that road.  I accept that the Deputy has been 20 years a Member but I have to tell him straight that this is the administrative area of Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin County Council. It is a non-national route and, therefore, the responsibility for carrying out improvement works rests directly with those authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put his ministerial finger on the nub of the problem, that this thoroughfare is the responsibility of two authorities.  The Blackrock end is the responsibility of Dún Laoghaire Corporation while the top end of Carysfort Avenue is in the area of Dublin County Council.  Will the Minister consider bringing the two authorities together to discuss the problem <Col N="705" /> or meet a deputation of Dáil Deputies from the area to discuss this serious problem?  Will the Minister suggest that the two authorities get together to deal with this?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is satisfied that local authorities around the country and in the greater Dublin region are complying with their statutory obligations to erect road signs in Irish and English outside the Gaeltacht areas and in Irish only within the Gaeltacht; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the responsibility of road authorities to ensure that traffic signs provided by them are in accordance with regulations made under the Road Traffic Acts or are as otherwise authorised under those Acts.</P>
      <P>In so far as informative signs are concerned, the regulations provide that, in Gaeltacht areas, place names on such signs shall be in Irish only and that elsewhere place names shall be shown in both Irish and English except where the spelling of the name is similar in Irish and English, e.g. Portlaoise.</P>
      <P>In so far as other traffic signs are concerned, e.g. warning and regulatory signs, almost all involve the use of symbols with no wording.  The major exception is the &ldquo;Yield Right of Way&rdquo; sign which also has an Irish version &ldquo;Géill Slí&rdquo;.  In this case, road authorities have been informed that, while the Irish version may be used in Gaeltacht areas the English version should be used elsewhere because of the importance of the sign from a road safety aspect and the need for all road users to understand its meaning clearly.  The latter principle would apply equally to any other warning or regulatory signs on which it might be deemed necessary to provide wording in addition to, or instead of a symbol, especially where experimental signs are being used.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that road authorities are aware of these requirements and that they are generally observed.  However, if the Deputy is aware of a particular instance where a requirement is not being observed, he should pursue the matter initially with the road authority and, if necessary, bring the matter to my attention.</P>

      <P>Very generous grants have been given by the Government to the GAA in this centenary year.  I do not have any proposals to change the regulations to comply with the Deputy's request.  Obviously, such a change would have to apply to all codes of sport.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister recognises the special role the GAA play in the life of our towns and villages.  Clubs <Col N="708" /> have provided improved facilities in recent years but rates are proving to be a great burden.  Does the Minister not see the merit in extending that relief to club properties also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not intend to change the rules in regard to rates for GAA premises that is not to say that I, like the Deputy, do not have a high regard for the association and the work it has done for young people in the last century.  However, I am concerned to be fair to all sporting organisations.  The Government have been generous in the allocation made to the GAA in this centenary year without interfering with the rates relief.  I should point out that in some instances rates relief can be sought if a community hall type of development is put forward by the GAA.  One of the problems is that clubs registered under the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904, are excluded from being termed as a community hall and, therefore, are liable for rates.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Kildare County Council that the waiver scheme is being operated by them in accordance with the terms and intentions of the scheme itself and of the relevant law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, charges may be waived under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983 on grounds of hardship only.  The Deputy is also aware that householders generally <Col N="710" /> in certain areas of Kildare are being urged on behalf of certain political interests to apply for waivers irrespective of their means in an obvious attempt to frustrate the operation of the scheme which has been adopted by the local council.  The council's responsibility extends not only to ensuring that all genuine cases get the benefit of waiver but that the charges are paid by those who should pay them under the law and under the council's scheme and that liability is not left to be carried unfairly by just some of the people in that category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for helping me out.  We were discussing consecutive sentencing for offences committed by a person while on bail.  I was arguing that such consecutive sentencing would not in any way act as a deterrent.  The Minister introduced a number of figures to indicate that there had been more than 8,000 offences committed by people while on bail.  He indicated that he would produce those figures for me but so far I have not received them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have a look at those figures.  However, I suggest there should be some more debate on this section because we are supposedly attempting to deal with crime particularly in the Dublin metropolitan area and we are supposed to be taking serious steps to deal with it.  When the debate outside the House on offences committed while on <Col N="767" /> bail started there were suggestions that bail should be restricted and that there should be a form of preventive detention for person charged while on bail.  An attempt was made to argue that all such persons should be put in preventive detention, but it was shown that it is not possible under the Constitution to detain such people for preventive purposes.  I should like the Minister to indicate how he thinks consecutive sentences will act as a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have a letter on the way to Deputy De Rossa. The records relate to offences for which the Garda have obtained sufficient evidence to prefer charges, not just ones in which the Garda have suspicion.  The figure I gave to Deputy De Rossa was 7,880 indictable offences committed by such persons in 1982.  Information on the basis of these figures was given in reply to various Dáil questions.  When we say that consecutive sentences will act as a deterrent I am working on the presumption that any sentence is there for a number of reasons, one of them being its deterrent effect.  One of the reasons why we would have shorter or longer sentences would be to do with whether the length of sentence would be a deterrent or not.</P>
      <P>The net issue in regard to offences committed while on bail at present is that because consecutive sentences are not given somebody who commits an offence while he is on bail knows when he is committing that offence that he will not be punished for it, so there is absolutely no deterrent.  Indeed there is a period of <i>de facto</i> immunity during which somebody who is on bail can commit offences on the supposition that he will be sentenced subsequently for the charge for which he is on bail.</P>

    <P>On the general question, any other approach to the vexed problem of offences committed on bail would involve a change in the Constitution and at the moment I am not convinced that such a change is desirable or necessary.  The Deputy pointed out that the O'Callaghan case dealt with this issue categorically &mdash; page 501 <i>Irish Reports</i> 1966 &mdash; It is to <Col N="768" /> the effect that the refusal of bail in order to prevent the commission of other offences by an accused while awaiting trial is a form of preventive detention and consequently unconstitutional.  I do not want to have a referendum on the question of bail which in effect would deprive people of the liberty they now enjoy.  We should defend the right to bail.  There is a very sweeping general right to bail now. It is given in the vast majority of cases but there is a problem that there does not seem to be any method of dealing with offenders who take the opportunity to offend while on bail because they have virtually immunity from punishment. Consecutive sentencing will help and the next section, which has been debated widely already, would extend the power of the District Court to sentence in such cases for two years rather than 12 months.  That is important and the District Court need that discretion.  It is only in cases of consecutive sentencing that the District Court has power to sentence for two years.  At the moment the District Court has not got the power to impose an aggregate sentence of two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the matters on which I would be in agreement with the Minister.  I have expressed grave reservations in relation to the detention sections and I will be expressing the same reservations in relation to sections 14 to 18 particularly.  Section 16 has been amended outside, and that is of great help.  In relation to bail generally, the criteria was set in the O'Callaghan case in 1966.  The general view was that to establish the right to bail the individual accused would have to undertake he would not abscond the jurisdiction and would not interfere with witnesses.  In such cases he would be entitled to bail automatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sympathy with Deputy De Rossa's point of view.  We are living in difficult times but we must be liberal in our interpretation of individual rights.  In the circumstances I do not think we should go overboard with punitive legislation. If this deterrent is introduced it will deter people who at the moment know that when they are out on bail they <Col N="769" /> can commit crimes without any prospect of retribution.  In the Bill, we are talking about the need to guard citizens.  It is fair to say that when an accused is out on bail he knows that when he comes to court to be tried other offences committed while he was on bail will be taken into account and the sentence will be made to run concurrently.  Individual criminals inevitably are recidivists anyway.  We are dealing with the worst elements in our society and those people work the system to a nicety.  It is at a very small minority of criminals we are aiming the section.  In the meantime, I am in favour of the idea behind the section, that in the case of an accused who is on bail, having been charged with a substantive offence, at the time of the trial proper, offences committed between the time of the granting of bail and the trial should be taken into account and that consecutive sentences should be imposed in respect of such offences.  That would be a deterrent, though Deputy De Rossa says there is no evidence to indicate that the section will be a deterrent.  That is so but when the section is in operation we will then be able to judge as to whether it is a deterrent. Therefore, Deputy De Rossa might be prevailed on to withdraw his opposition to the section so as to give it an opportunity to operate.  Subsequently, if it should be found that the section is not operating as it is intended to operate the Deputy could put his observations before the House.  In the meantime the section should be given the majority support of the House.  I will be supporting it.  It is reasonable and should be given the opportunity of being put into practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I had got as far as to say that we welcome and support this measure.  However, we must recognise that the Association of Criminal Lawyers do not support the new power of the District Court in respect of aggregate sentences of up to two years in prison but perhaps that is a matter we can discuss in greater detail later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question, as Deputy Andrews has said, is a very important, urgent and practical one.  It is a question which people do not seem to understand very well but it <Col N="770" /> is difficult for the ordinary citizen to tolerate a situation in which people are allowed out on bail after being charged with committing such crimes as housebreaking and the unauthorised taking of cars when during the bail period they continue to commit similar offences. We are all familiar with that situation so we can appreciate that there is a problem in this area.  There has been a tightening up of the definitions of bail and this restricts the position of the Garda in that respect.  The definitions are set out very well in John Kelly's book which deals with the O'Callaghan case and also with the general criteria for refusing bail or for granting it.  The principle points are the likelihood of the individual absconding, interfering with evidence or interfering with witnesses.  I do not know the extent to which the various criteria are used by the courts but in this book the author refers to the Supreme Court case of <i>The People (Attorney General)</i> v. <i>O'Callaghan.</i>  This was a case in which bail had been refused in the High Court where Judge Murnaghan erected a new and more extensive set of matters which might be or should be taken into account where appropriate in considering whether it was likely the prisoner would attempt to evade justice.  The extent to which this criterion may be applied is questionable.  In regard to the fundamental test the matters are enumerated as follows: the nature of the accusation or, in other words, the seriousness of the charge.  In this respect it is stated that it stands to reason that the more serious the charge the greater is the likelihood of the prisoner not appearing to answer it.  The next criterion referred to is the nature of the evidence in support of the charge and the remark in this context is that the more cogent the evidence, the more likelihood there is of conviction and consequently the greater is the likelihood of the prisoner attempting to evade justice.  As to the likely sentence to be imposed on conviction, there is the remark that the greater the sentence is likely to be, the greater is the likelihood of the prisoner trying to avoid it.  There is the remark also that a prisoner's previous record has a bearing on the probable sentence and <Col N="771" /> that that record should be before the court.</P>
    <P>When one recalls some of the sentences imposed in respect of drug offences despite there being provision for sentences of up to 14 years, one wonders why bail should apply in these types of cases.  A further point referred to in the Supreme Court case was that of the likelihood of the committing of further offences and in this connection there is the remark that a prisoner facing a heavy sentence has little to lose if he commits further offences, and since he may consider that he will have to go to prison in any event he may commit further offences in an effort to get money to support his family.</P>
    <P>These criteria relate to serious offences but the crimes of housebreaking and of the unauthorised taking of cars are the ones being committed most frequently. The unauthorised taking of cars would not come within the definition of serious offences so those who have been involved in that offence have been able to evade this clause.  There is reference to the possibility of the disposal of illegally acquired property and to the possibility of interference with prospective witnesses and with juniors.  The prisoner's failure to answer to bail on a previous occasion can be taken into account also as can the situation of a prisoner having being caught redhanded.  The objection of the Attorney General or the Garda may be taken into account but obviously this has not weighed too heavily in recent cases.  There is reference then to the substance and the reliability of the bailsman offered and finally there is reference to the possibility of a speedy trial.</P>
    <P>One point that could be raised is that offenders are not dealt with quickly enough and are given bail for the time during which they are awaiting trial.  This brings us back to the question of how such offenders can be dealt with in practice. The Minister's approach of consecutive sentencing, while welcome, is only a partial solution.  We must consider the length of time that elapses before offenders are brought to court.  The Minister may be able to tell us, for instance, <Col N="772" /> what is the average time from the date of arrest to the court hearing.  It would appear that we need quicker justice in these cases and particularly in those cases which would be regarded as the more minor but which are affecting the community most.  While normally it could be said that so far as the accused is concerned justice delayed is justice denied, but in this instance justice delayed is justice denied to the community.  Therefore, a shorter time in bringing cases forward would be an important contribution.  In the likelihood of an offender committing further offences, surely his case should be given priority.  Why is there a backlog in the Circuit Court?  What is the average waiting time?  It would be helpful if the Minister told us something about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic towards the goal the Minister is trying to achieve. Let us take an example of where a person is charged with offence A and is put on bail while awaiting trial.  He then commits offence B while on bail.  The first trial takes place and he is convicted of offence A and a sentence is imposed.  A trial takes place in relation to offence B and a sentence is imposed.  I take it that what the Minister is trying to achieve is that the sentence for offence B should be consecutive with the sentence for offence A. The section as drafted does not achieve that.</P>
      <P>As I read the section, the second sentence which is to be consecutive with the first sentence is consecutive on a sentence passed for any previous offence.  Let us say someone is charged with offence No. 1.  He is awaiting trial for that offence but is not on bail.  He is charged with offence No. 2 which occurs subsequently to offence No. 1.  He is put on bail while awaiting trial for offence No. 2 and is then charged with offence No. 3.  While he was on bail offence No. 3 took place.  Let us say he is tried and convicted for offence No. 3 but is not convicted for offence No. 2.  However, he is convicted for offence No. 1.  Is it the Minister's intention that the sentence for offence No. 3 should be consecutive with the sentence for offence No. 1?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> I take it that what the Minister is trying to achieve is that the sentence for offence No. 3 would be consecutive with the sentence on the offence No. 2.  However, in the example the person was not convicted of offence No. 2.  Will the Minister say if that is what the section achieves or if that is what he intends it to achieve?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I dealt with most of the points raised the last day.  Deputy Woods mentioned many points about the circumstances in which people can be refused bail at present.  It only happens in a small minority of cases. We should think carefully before we change that.  Much of what the Deputy said seemed to imply that the person would subsequently be found guilty at the trial.  Many of his arguments would only apply if there was an inference of guilt.  We must presume a person is innocent until the courts decide otherwise.  In that context there are very few occasions where the idea of refusing bail is not a form of preventive detection.</P>
      <P>The question of delays was raised and there are delays on some occasions.  In some District Court areas there is no delay.  The lists are cleared whenever the court sits.  In other areas there are delays. There was a delay in the Circuit Court in Cork but an extra Circuit Court judge has been appointed there and those delays have been reduced.  Much of the concern about delays arises from a certain amount of confusion about civil cases and criminal cases.  There are long and unacceptable delays in the High Court on the civil side.  Frequently people transpose criticism of the delays there to the criminal side where delays are not very long.  If Deputies want precise information on delays I will get it for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay may not necessarily occur before someone is brought to trial.  It can occur during the trial.  A person can be brought before the court and there might be an adjournment.  He may then be brought back again and there can be a further adjournment.  He is then found guilty and there might be an appeal.  With the best will in the world if we remove the right to bail the appeal process could lead to a position where a person could <Col N="774" /> spend a long period in prison if he was not found guilty.  We should not interfere with the right of a person to bail, because a person is innocent until proven guilty.</P>
    <P>The section is trying to close the loophole where at present a person who commits an offence while on bail at present knows he will not be punished for it. Subsection (1) provides that a sentence imposed for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive with any sentence passed for a previous offence, including the offence in respect of which bail was granted.  Where there are several previous offences the sentence for the bail offence will be consecutive with the last sentence to expire.  Whatever the combination the onus is on the courts to provide consecutive sentences and the elements of discretion will be removed. I have lost the example I had in mind.</P>

Under the section as drafted if a person commits an offence and is charged with it and subsequently is charged with a second offence, is put <Col N="775" /> on bail and is then charged with a third offence, the sentence for the third offence will be consecutive with the sentence for the first offence if the person is not convicted of the second offence which is the offence he committed while on bail.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is the intention.  It sometimes happens that offences are not dealt with in the courts in the order in which they were committed. The Deputy seems to pre-suppose that offences will be taken in the order in which they have been committed.  We must provide for the fact that they are not and that bail offences will be consecutive on any previous offence.  If a person is charged with offence A and while on bail commits offence B, the sentence for offence B must be consecutive on that for offence A and also on any previous sentence. The section is drafted to take that into account.  If this was not so the courts, by sentencing for offence B first, could get around the provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the need to ensure that people, whether or not they are on bail or have ever been in court, should not feel there is no way they can be brought to book for offences they have committed.  A large section of our society engage in what I consider to be the crime of tax evasion and never see inside a prison.  I consider that to be a far greater social crime than many crimes for which people, particularly young people, spend six to 12 months in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When dealing with this section we should be discussing whether this proposal will do the job we want it to do, in other words, deter people from committing offences while on bail.  No one has yet given any hard evidence to show that this is so.  On the contrary, there is hard <Col N="776" /> evidence to show that long sentences do not prevent people from committing further sentences and going back to jail. Statistics in the annual report on prisons for 1982 indicate that many young offenders have been in prison up to five times previously and that almost 45 per cent of them have been in prison at least once before.  Many of the adult population of our prisons have been in prison up to 20 times previously and 65 per cent of them have been in prison at least once before.  There does not appear to be evidence to show that prison sentences, whether they be long or short, act as a deterrent.  If a person is in prison for two years instead of one year he or she will not be available on the street to commit an offence for the extra year.  Evidence shows that at least half of the young people who have been to prison will return there.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to press opposition to the section, but in my view we have not given it sufficient consideration.  This is one of the sections which show up the inadequacy of the way in which this criminal legislation has been dealt with.  There was no in-depth discussion before this Bill was introduced by way of Green Paper, White Paper, a discussion in the Dáil Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, on the nature of crime, the reasons for it, why such a huge percentage of our prison population return again and again to prisons and so on.</P>
    <P>I have seen it argued that a prison sentence of a month or two months has a much better effect on young people because the number of them who return to prisons after short sentences is much lower than those who spend long periods there.</P>
    <P>Again I ask the Minister if he can give hard evidence that what he is proposing here will have the effect he and I desire &mdash; that people on bail will not commit further offences.  But there is nothing in this Bill, and nothing has been said in this House to date, that will convince me that this section will have that effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the intention of this section.  The public are aghast because people on bail are committing <Col N="777" /> offences and when they go to court the offences are taken together and only one sentence is imposed.  I hope this section will act as a deterrent because when various offences are taken into account the appropriate sentences will be added.</P>
      <P>I see one difficulty here.  At present prisoners are released early to make accommodation available for people who have committed more serious offences. I would like to know how these people are screened.  The Minister might be able to tell me today or at a future date what procedures are being used, if there is consultation between the probation officers and the prison authorities and the Garda and so on.  People should not be released at random.  I am worried that people on bail will flout the law by committing offences and will steal enough to keep their families while they serve their sentence.  I hope the deterrent in this section will be taken into account by these people.  The fact that all the offences will be taken separately and sentences added to the original sentence. People are aghast when they realise that a man can ask for ten or 20 robberies or other offences to be taken together and one sentence imposed, but if another person is in court having committed one offence, they may both get the same sentence, although by committing further robberies the person on bail may have ensured that his family are taken care of while he is serving a jail sentence.</P>
      <P>I support the intention behind this section but I am concerned about who is being given early release.  We hear of people being sentenced at 11 a.m. or 12 noon who are back on the streets in the afternoon, sometimes jeering the gardaí because they have been released after a couple of hours.  If a person is sentenced to prison, a certain proportion of that sentence should be served in prison.  Perhaps at a later stage the Minister will be able to say what rules, regulations or other criteria are being used in cases of early release.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that Deputy De Rossa will not take my comments personally &mdash; they are not meant to be. <Col N="778" /> It is hard to see what proposals the Deputy would support to deal with the crime of old people being beaten up and struck to the ground by offenders who are on bail.  As far as I can see, he is opposing every section in an attempt to plead a so-called liberal cause.  I believe in being liberal and not in taking away people's freedom.  I have been very questioning about certain sections of this Bill, but we must be realistic.  Are we to defend criminals to the point of giving them more protection than those, mainly old people, who suffer from their misdeeds? That would appear to be the logical consequence of Deputy De Rossa's proposals.  This legislation on its own will not solve the crime problem.  We must tackle many areas, not least poverty.</P>
      <P>Specifically in relation to this section dealing with crime while on bail, I do not find reasonable any of the arguments put forward, given the extraordinary number of such offences.  The Minister gave some figures on the last occasion and it is my experience that people who are not able to defend themselves &mdash; the old and the very young &mdash; are suffering very badly at the hands of those who deliberately commit crime while on bail, knowing that all subsequent offences will be taken into account.  This is one of our biggest problems. How can you reassure the old lady whose handbag has been snatched from her and who has been thrown to the ground, or the mother who is fearful of her children's safety?  These offences while on bail are committed not because of some social deprivation, but coldly and calculatedly because the culprits reckon that they might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one section which is very necessary and which I support very strongly. We are all under constant pressure from our constituents to do something about the present terrible crime problem.  Last night, on Curlew Road in Drimnagh, I was stopped by three people who were protecting their local school.  They wanted to know why crimes are taken into account when a person is being sentenced for the initial offence.  We cannot have it both ways.  Either Deputy De Rossa and all of us are here to represent the people and <Col N="779" /> put forward a fair and balanced point of view, or we are not doing a public service.</P>
    <P>This is a sensitive issue and the legislation is hard in many ways.  I have expressed many reservations about it and would ask for checks and balances.  Protection of the innocent must be tied into the Bill.  Arguments on recidivism cannot be used in relation to crimes on bail, because the two cases are different. People who are sentenced to imprisonment again and again constitute a great problem, but crime while on bail must be acted against and this section sets out to deal with it adequately.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, for the record, a question in connection with a person charged with an offence who commits other offences while on bail but is found innocent of the first charge.  Is it possible to get a consecutive sentence on the second and other offences?  Would the two year limit apply in the District Court for a second offence, for instance?  In that case is the second offence taken as the first?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Deputy Mitchell has made some charges it is necessary that I refer especially to the bail aspect.  I should be allowed to respond to the Deputy's remarks.  He expressed pious hopes that this section might act as a deterrent, but he did not produce any evidence whatsoever in support of that hope.  He sits on the Dáil committee dealing with crime, lawlessness and vandalism, but to date that committee have not come up with any proposals to deal with offences committed while on bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main argument in relation to this section is that I am not convinced that it will have the desired effect which all of us wish for, that no person would feel free to commit offences, whether on bail or in any other state.  There should be some form of deterrent.  I am not convinced that consecutive sentencing will end the commission of crime while on bail.  Deputy Cosgrave said there were people being dealt with for ten crimes and 20 crimes.  I do not know if the statistics I have are the same statistics the Minister quoted in relation to crime on bail.  The statistics I have indicate that in 1981 for the Dublin area there were 5,418 crimes for offences committed while on bail and 1,377 individuals were involved in those crimes.  Those statistics are from the document <i>Innocent until Proven Guilty,</i> published by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  They in turn quote an issue of the <i>Garda News</i> which in turn was supposed to be quoting from a confidential Garda file.  That does not indicate that everybody on bail is committing ten and 20 crimes at a time.  I am not convinced that this section will deter <Col N="782" /> young people on bail.  When you consider the cynicism indicated in the prison reports prison does not deter young people, in particular.  The evidence is in the annual report on our prisons for 1982.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quoted statistics for 1982 as 7,880 indictable offences committed by people on bail.  This represents about 24 per cent of all detected indictable crimes, so it is 24 per cent of one-third of the total crime figures.  I would like to get the source of the statistics. The approach to crime from the Garda over the last few years has been in the form of statistics but it is very important to get the story behind the statistics in each case.  The Minister told us that the type of crimes that are mainly committed on bail are larceny or burglary and, in recent years, certain drug related offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I would like to get the statistics is because it is very important to establish the reliability of statistics especially if one is using those statistics as an argument for increasing powers, introducing a Bill like the Criminal Justice Bill we are discussing or to frighten the life out of everybody in relation to how crime is going.  We have asked for these statistics many times.  We asked for them in the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, of which I am a member. We have many times questioned the statistics produced.  When we have carefully studied the most crime ridden area in the country we have been able to reduce the number of crimes committed to a small number of individuals.  We have been able to establish that a very small number of people are committing a huge number of crimes.  That is one of the reasons why I would like to see where the statistics are coming from.  It would be no harm if we could do a ten year study on the statistics produced, because there is a very important story behind them.  We need to uncover that in order to tackle the source of the problem and not just be satisfied with what is put out in numbers twice a year every year.  That is given as the reason for lots of things including the increase in the number of gardaí, the <Col N="783" /> extra money we will spend or how we will tackle the crime problem.</P>
    <P>We are not very up to date in our statistics.  The Minister mentioned the last day that these statistics came by means of parliamentary questions, which I presume somebody in the Department accumulated over that particular year.  I do not know how much weight to put on them.  I believe it is fair to say that we should not, given the experience we have had with the statistics in relation to crime, put too much weight on them because they are very inaccurate and they are introduced in a precise way in order to produce a certain course of action.</P>

I am very sorry about that because I had no intention of doing that at all.  I withdraw what I said if the Minister took it that way.  I did not mean to infer that.

I will not dwell on it because I will come <Col N="785" /> back to it again on section 10, if that is what the Leas-Cheann Comhairle wishes.  We must not pass this section without examining the role of district justices and examining how effective they have been in the past.  I stress that this is not a criticism of any individual district justice, they are all doing their best.  They face great difficulties.  There is a form of hit and miss justice in the District Court through no fault of theirs, but because of the volume and variety of cases.  With 80 per cent of criminals and crime coming before the District Court it is very important that we should look at the composition of the court and look at the appointment of the justices and how they are appointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not discuss their appointments.  The whole system in the District Court has come under the spotlight in the past number of years.  I am not an advocate of uniformity in sentencing. That should be left to the discretion of the justices.  To the best of their ability they take the circumstances of every case into consideration.  They have an enormously difficult task.  I have every sympathy for them because they face difficulties in carrying out their task.  Each case is judged on its merits and that is the way it should be.  Since we are giving this extra year in the case of consecutive sentences that whole area should be looked at.  If we get an opportunity later to discuss this in more detail I am sure it will be availed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know what criteria prevail in selection, appointment, training and monitoring in the District Court since they are being given these new powers. <Col N="786" /> It is not absolutely true to say that because somebody commits offences while on bail he does not suffer any punishment. I am sure the extra offences are taken into consideration by the justice when sentencing the person.  If a person commits ten crimes while on bail I am sure that will be reflected in the length of the sentence.  It would be regarded as very serious if he committed a number of offences while on bail.  I am sure the justice uses his discretion.  All the offences are not ignored.  It would be wrong if a person who committed offences while on bail was given a sentence equivalent to the sentence he would have been given if he had not committed the extra offences while on bail.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he hopes the community service orders legislation will reduce the pressure on prisons.  I hope it does.  I look forward to the implementation of that legislation.  He also mentioned the recruiting and training of extra probation officers.  There is a certain deterrent in this section.  I am not sure of the extent of it.  I imagine that a person without any means or with a family to be supported is under pressure to get some money and he is tempted to continue his criminal activities.  If he realised it could mean a longer sentence the section might deter him from committing crime.  One could also say that if bail was not granted in certain cases that would also be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>Generally the section is acceptable to most people.  The intention is very clear. We should not rush through any section. It is not fair to criticise people because they want to examine something in detail even though it has a high acceptability rate.  Very sincerely I would like to know more about the crime statistics which are used by penologists.  As legislators, we should have as much information as possible, the best we can possibly get.  I accept that the Minister has got the best information he can possibly get.  There should be no hesitation in giving us the best information.  We have an obligation to examine the implications of every section of the Bill.  I have not succumbed to pressure that a certain measure should be brought in and we should lock everybody <Col N="787" /> up.  I do not intend to succumb to that pressure.</P>

When we hear statements like the one made by my colleague, there is a danger of a blot on the name of anybody who questions a section such as section 9 because he might be considered soft on criminals or soft on crime.  On other sections he is considered hard on the Garda, or Garda bashing. These are very unfair allegations because they question the sincerity of people in relation to this legislation.  I do not think anybody, including the Minister, has enjoyed sitting in here for 12 hours over the past number of months.  We are doing it because we believe in it.</P>
      <P>I would be much happier if many more people were contributing to this section and other sections.  There is a need for this section.  Generally it will be welcomed by the community.  I have considered the implications of the section.  I do not think it will do much harm and for that reason I welcome it.  While imprisonment is not a deterrent against crime, there is a strong possibility of a reduction in crime given that the life span of criminal activity is over a relatively short number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what can be done with regard to the situation of bail.  Once criminals are out of prison there is pressure on them to commit further crime.  This <Col N="788" /> happens because they become involved in certain activities and in many cases get their living as a result of criminal activity even though they may be on bail.  However, that problem cannot be tackled by this legislation or in this way: that can only be done in the community, probably by voluntary and State organisations.  We should pay careful attention to what has been said about the Bill by those involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have some reservations about the precise wording of section 9, for once I find myself in sympathy with the Minister.  With due respect to all that has been said on the other side of the House and on this side also, the situation here is quite simple.  We have a system of imprisonment, of punishment for crime which includes imprisonment. The suitability or otherwise of imprisonment as a punishment depends on what one wants imprisonment to achieve, whether it should be with a view to rehabilitation, deterrence or punishment. That debate has been going on for centuries as has been the debate regarding imprisonment as an environment for rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>Except for the exceptional case which Deputy Skelly rightly mentioned, the position in relation the offences committed on bail is that the courts cannot impose the punishment of imprisonment for those offences, and to argue against closing the loophole here is to argue against the whole system of imprisonment as a method of punishment for crime.  While I have reservations about the suitability of imprisonment as a form of punishment or of dealing with crime, I do not think anyone is seriously suggesting now that we should or can get rid of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> To contribute further to the numbers game, in 1980 some 5,145 offences were committed on bail; in 1981 the figure was 7,310; in 1982 it was 7,880 and in 1983 it was 8,295.  The Garda say it understates the situation because they include only crimes where there was sufficient evidence to prefer charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> What do the 8,295 offences committed on bail in 1983 mean?  They mean so many cars stolen, so many houses broken into, so many old ladies mugged, so many handbags snatched and so on.  That is the reality behind the figures.  Because of an unwillingness on the part of the courts to impose consecutive sentences and because of the restriction of the power of the District Court to extend only to a period of 12 months we do not have consecutive sentences.  Criminals who are given bail know that during that period of bail they have, in effect, a <i>de facto</i> immunity from punishment and we have to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>I know of only two ways to deal with it: the way I am proposing or by way of a referendum to change the constitutional position on bail which would allow preventive detention to be imposed by the courts.  I am not prepared to propose preventive detention and, therefore, I am going for the other alternative.  I will refer to a booklet Deputy De Rossa is fond of quoting entitled <i>Innocent Unit Proven Guilty.</i>  If the Deputy reads page 58 of that publication he will find that the submission there supports what I am doing. While the authors of the booklet oppose the proposal of preventive detention, they say there are other ways of dealing with the problem.  They point out that legislation could provide for consecutive penalties for crimes committed while on bail.  That is what we are doing here.</P>
    <P>Questions have been asked about how the section will operate.  Rather than trying to debate the theory of that here, I ask Deputies to try to imagine what would happen in court.  A judge or a justice would have to ask himself a very simple question.  When a person came before him he would have to ask if the offence was committed while the person was on bail.  If the answer is yes the sentence for that offence would have to be consecutive on any previous sentence. There could be a situation where there would be a number of offences &mdash; A, B and C, for example.  If a person comes in on offence C the question is, was it committed while the person was on bail?  If it is the first offence being tried, obviously it is a question of imposing a sentence <Col N="790" /> because for the sentence to be consecutive it must follow on something that occurred previously.  However, if the offence was committed while on bail and there was a previous sentence of any kind, the obligation on the judge is to impose a consecutive sentence.</P>
    <P>At the moment the courts could impose a consecutive sentence but they do not do so.  In addition, in the District Court there is the time constraint of 12 months and on many occasions this makes it impossible for them to impose a consecutive sentence.  This will require them to do so.  I described the situation where there was offence A, B and C and offence A for which a person was released on bail was the last offence for which he was tried.  That offence was not committed while the person was on bail and there would be no obligation on the judge to impose a consecutive sentence for offence A if it was not taken in chronological order.  However, that is not a weakness in the section.  The section was drafted and is being promoted by me as a solution to the problem of offences committed on bail and offence A was not committed while the person was on bail. It was the offence for which he got bail in the first instance.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing is a reasonably modest way to deal with the problem. The other alternative is a constitutional change that would deprive people of personal liberties.  I do not believe in preventive detention and, therefore, I am putting forward this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the section which I consider most important.  It is something I have been asking for since 1977 as essential to the upholding of law and order.  I favour this method as against the question of preventive detention which operates in other European countries. However, there is no doubt in my mind that if a referendum to change the Constitution was called to allow for preventive detention it would be carried because of the degree of crime that exists at the moment.  People are crying out for something to stop this.  I know of many instances in my constituency of young <Col N="791" /> hooligans who are arrested committing crimes, released on bail and who go back to complete the jobs which they were caught on originally.  The hands of the court are tied, there is nothing they can do and I believe that this will have a profound effect on crimes committed by people on bail.  I see it is restricted to two years and two consecutive sentences.  I should like to see it operate for every crime committed by people on bail because there is nothing worse than people who have been caught in the act being released on bail and committing crimes for the next six months until their case is called.  This is the strongest section in the Bill, I welcome it and I am glad I was here to contribute to the debate.</P>

      <P>The Minister said there were only two approaches to the problem: the first is the way he is taking and the second is by referendum.  There is, of course, another way and, in fairness to the Judiciary, that should be recognised. In this section we are making statutory the consecutive sentences and extending them to two years.  The Minister has admitted that one of the constraints on the Judiciary at present is that they can only go to one year.  If they could go on to two years, presumably they would use the second one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the purpose of subsection (1) which shall apply notwithstanding anything contained in section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.  That section makes it clear that the requirement to impose consecutive sentences in bail cases takes precedence over the discretionary power to impose consecutive sentences conferred on the District Court by section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.  In fairness, in cases where offences are committed on bail, the courts impose a sentence which takes into account that an offence was committed by a person on bail.  However, in the District Court there <Col N="792" /> is no power to go beyond one year and to give them the power to impose two years might meet the situation.</P>
      <P>We are also faced with the problem that the court can impose two three-month sentences or two six-month sentences and can, therefore, bring it under control and have discretion in that way. I know that both sides of the House think it is the right thing to do and that consecutive sentences should apply.  I presume that in most cases of housebreaking and car stealing, bail is granted and this is where most of the problems arise in the community.  Many of the instances which the Minister mentioned relate to housebreaking and car stealing.  I read of a frightening case last night about somebody out on bail driving a stolen car.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court decision in the O'Callaghan case and others which followed gives some cause for concern.  For instance, in cases of car stealing where someone is found red-handed driving the car there is a basis which seems to be accepted by the Supreme Court.  In an appeal to the Supreme Court Mr. Justice Walsh recognised the propriety, though with certain reservations, of considering the matters which Mr. Justice Murnaghan had numbered one, two, three, five, six, seven, and eight but virtually tore up, with the agreement of Mr. Justice Budd, the rest of the scheme.  He would not stand over ground No. 4 but he maintained six, seven and eight as did others subsequently.  Number eight was the fact that the prisoner was found red-handed.  One of the problems which the Garda face at present is that prisoners who are caught red-handed get bail and commit further crimes.  The measure which we are adopting here may not do as much as we think it will and I am rather concerned about that.  I see it as a partial remedy although I hope I will be proved wrong and that it will prove to be a better remedy in practice than it appears.</P>

    <P>Where the alleged offender is caught red-handed and is seen by the Garda as likely to commit further offences, could special conditions be attached to bail such as reporting to a Garda station at regular intervals, be confined to the area around his home or give an undertaking to be at <Col N="793" /> home between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.?  I think these conditions would help, as we know that many crimes are committed late at night and in the early hours of the morning.  Perhaps the difficulty is that jail is too severe as a remand centre and that the Judiciary do not like to use it for remanding prisoners.  When people are caught red-handed the criteria offered by O'Callaghan and further agreed to by Mr. Justice Walsh seem to follow.  If that is the case surely conditions could apply to bail which would restrict the movements of these people until their cases came to trial.</P>

      <P>Will the proposed legislative mandate for consecutive sentencing mean that there will be an increase in the prison population?  Has the Minister prepared for the longer-stay prisoner as a direct result of section 9 of the Bill when it becomes law?  I am not trying to back-track on my support for the section but it must be an area of concern to the Minister and his officials.</P>
      <P>My basic reason for supporting the section is that there is a practice among a certain hard core criminal element to make a plaything of bail.  They are professional, hardened criminals and they have blackguarded the system and operated it to their own advantage.  While we are concerned about the criminal we should be equally if not more, concerned about the victim who has got little mention during the course of the debate on this section, and that should be a matter of concern to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tragic development is that a number of criminal families in Dublin city and county are engaged in the disposal of drugs.  They have brought this to a fine art.  Anything which prevents those individuals and families from using the bail system as it is operated at present will be of benefit to society.  Deputy Skelly is right to express his concern about the courts and I do not think anyone is querying his right to do so.  The courts and the judges operate the law given to them by us and, if we do not give them the type of legislation which is necessary, this House is at fault, not the Judiciary.  I am a practising barrister and I am not in any way <Col N="794" /> sycophantic towards the bench.  I have been critical of certain matters over the years in relation to the operability of the Judiciary but we must provide them with the required legislation.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy O'Dea was in general agreement with this section.  Deputy Woods talked in terms of other options which could be considered and mentioned that the courts could attach conditions to bail.  There is nothing in the section which prevents that.  The judges can deal with the problem as they see fit.  The District Court have the right to impose conditions. While there would not be an obstacle to the imposition of conditions, the difficulty would be in enforcing the conditions in any practical way.  If the level of enforcement was such that a person had to go to a Garda station every half hour or stay in a Garda station there would be another form of preventive detention and an interference with the liberty of the individual on bail.  If some kind of curfew were imposed whereby a person could not leave his house between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., it would be impossible to enforce. I would doubt the constitutionality of such a provision.  There would have to be some kind of monitoring so that the Garda could see whether the conditions were being met.  While something could be done by judges and justices, it would not be very easy to enforce the conditions which might be considered appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews raised the question of the availability of space in prisons. This is a major concern.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to it earlier.  People are not sentenced and then let out after a couple of hours or even a couple of days. There is a policy on this question and it is carefully monitored.  It has entered into folklore that people who are sentenced in the courts are back on the streets very quickly.  This is no longer so.  It is said by members of the public as a general criticism. It is also said by members of the Garda Síochána when they are criticised <Col N="795" /> for not being more effective.  People at the end of long sentences or those serving very short sentences of 14 days or a month are considered for early release in the first instance.  There is a report from the prison and the Garda as to whether these people are likely to get into difficulty again if they are allowed back into their own community.  This is taken into account.  In the case of people who have been in prison for a while there are reports from probation officers and from the prison committees dealing with remission and release.  It is monitored very carefully.  At peak periods such as late autumn when the court session resumes there may be a back-up of sentences and a lot of people may be sent to Mountjoy.  A total of, say, 15 people may be sentenced on a particular Friday when the prison is full.  Some of these people may be sentenced for very serious crimes. The only way to provide space for them is to let out people who are inside.  This is done very carefully.  Deputy Cosgrave made the point that we should always try to ensure that people serve a reasonable proportion of the sentence imposed.  This is being done but it is not easy.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister accommodation for an extra 400 people has been provided in our prisons by a combination of better use of space and the use of Loughan House as an open prison.  The average number of prison inmates was about 1,240 or 1,250 and the average is now about 1,650.  The occupancy varies from day to day.  I think it will be possible to accommodate another 80 or 100 this year but that space will not suffice in the light of the projections I have to hand. The first major relief will come with the opening of the new prison in Clondalkin which will provide 400 additional places. The target date for that prison is the summer of 1987, quite a long way off.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the community service order legislation will be of benefit. Staff are being organised and people have been short-listed for interview.  I hope that in the next session courts will be able to implement community service orders.  A seminar was held about two weeks ago where district justices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to get at the problem which we know to be in the community.  The Minister suggests that there would be difficulty in enforcing conditions. We may need to think more about such enforcement.  We may have to face reality in this respect, in that there are certain people who while on bail, particularly in the small hours of the morning, will commit further criminal offences.  While the consecutive sentences may act as a deterrent to some it is possible that for many others they will not.  The question of the enforcement of the conditions, as the Minister recognised, is one for the Garda in the first instance in that they would have to carry out any checking-up that needed to be <Col N="797" /> done.  In the case of somebody who is caught red-handed it would seem to be a reasonable condition, and one not very difficult to enforce, that the Garda would check on such people or get an undertaking that they would be in their homes between, say, 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. and, if they broke that undertaking, that they would lose their bail.</P>
      <P>Then the question may be posed: what about the constitutionality of losing bail? As matters stand at present it would seem that being caught red-handed is one of the fairly substantive matters that can be taken into consideration in refusing bail in the first instance.  I appreciate that the Minister is attempting to deal with the problem through this mechanism.  It may be that measures like those I have mentioned would be practical aids in tightening the situation further and I would ask the Minister to bear them in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister when he questions the constitutionality of imposing certain conditions in relation to people who are caught red-handed.  As far as I can recall, the whole basis of the O'Callaghan decision was that preventive detention was unconstitutional since it pre-empted what would be the decision of the court in relation to the offence in respect of which the person was on bail.  The more likely the conviction, for instance, in the case of people caught red-handed, the lesser the possibility that the terms of the Constitution would be infringed by attaching conditions to the bail granted such people.</P>

It was my understanding that the O'Callaghan decision was based on the grounds that one could not anticipate that somebody was about to commit a crime, that even in the case of a person caught red-handed one could not say that they were going to go out and commit another crime.  It was because of that it was ruled unconstitutional, rendering the introduction of this new law necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I asked the Minister if he could give the average length of sentence in the District Court was that this would have a bearing on the number of additional places he would have to find in our prisons in order to cope with the implementation of the provisions of this section.  The Minister referred to the fact that I have had recourse to the document <i>Innocent until Proven Guilty</i> which was the only place I could find statistics relating to bail. Indeed it was said in that document that they were not all that convinced of the reliability of those statistics.  It was said in that document also that in 1981, for Dublin and the rest of the country, there were approximately 2,000 individuals involved in committing offences while on bail.  If the average length of sentence in the District Court is less than six months and if 80 per cent of those 2,000 people are known to be involved in crime while on bail, then one is talking of something in the region of 700 years in sentencing time if the provisions of this consecutive sentencing section are to be implemented. My argument is that this section will not fulfil its task.  Could the Minister indicate how he proposes that kind of prison space can be found in order to render the section effective?</P>

      <P>I am quite happy to dispose of it now.  I might say, in relation to the question raised by Deputy Briscoe, and which I thought the Minister might have clarified, that there were two separate sets of criteria in relation to the O'Callaghan case.  Ground No. 4 had to do with the likelihood of the commission of further offences while on bail and No. 8 with the fact that the person was caught red-handed.  Therefore, they are two separate issues.  Subsequently on No. 4, on appeal in the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Walsh recognised the propriety of these and, in considering the matter, virtually tore up, with the agreement of Mr. Justice Budd, the rest of the scheme.  He said in relation to ground No. 4 that the likelihood of the commission of further offences while on bail was a matter which in his view was quite inadmissible.  But ground No. 8 stands irrespective of that ruling, that is, if a person is caught red-handed. That is why I asked the Minister earlier to clarify the position because there is considerable public confusion about the circumstances in which bail can be refused.  The reason we are introducing this consecutive sentencing provision is because of the concern felt about offences being committed by people while on bail.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The question of being caught red-handed arises from a consideration of whether a person would be likely to abscond or not. The pre-supposition would be that if somebody was caught red-handed there would be a very high likelihood of their being convicted and, therefore, there would be an incentive for that person to abscond.  It is not a separate cause.  It is tied in with the whole idea of absconding, and the courts can assess that.  It is not a separate question, that if somebody is caught red-handed <i>ipso facto</i> you do not <Col N="800" /> grant them bail.  It is all part of a debate on whether or not somebody is likely to abscond.  That is the issue of being caught red-handed which was debated in the O'Callaghan case.</P>

Lest anybody takes a different view I want it to be clear that of course we agree with the findings of the Supreme Court in this respect and the constitutional position in relation to No. 4, as stated in the O'Callaghan case.  However, No. 8 is still one of the factors that can be taken into consideration in regard to the other matters that are listed.  It may be that some further measures are needed for special cases.

They were taken to the station and charged but they had to be released on bail. Obviously, they were 16 or 17 years of age and the Garda knew they would not respond.  It may be that they had a long history of criminal activity.  I am concerned about such people whether they are handbag snatchers who commit further crimes after being released on bail although they may have been caught red-handed.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> To a great extent we have discussed section 10 in the context of section 9.  Section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 (No. 2), provides that where the District Court imposes consecutive sentences they cannot exceed 12 months on aggregate.  Subsection (1) proposes to increase this limit to two years.  It also amends section 5 to provide that imprisonment in that section shall include detention in St. Patrick's Institution.  This provision is necessary to take account of a Supreme Court decision that section 5, does not apply to detention in St. Patrick's Institution.  The relevent case is the <i>State (Séamus Fitzgerald) v. The Governor St. Patrick's Institution,</i> 2 March 1983, unreported.  Accordingly it makes it clear that consecutive sentences of detention in St. Patrick's Institution can also be imposed.  Subsection (2) is designed to avoid the anomaly which would otherwise exist in relation to consecutive sentences imposed under section 13 (1) of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, for an offence committed while serving a sentence. It increases the 12 month limit on aggregate term to two years in line with subsection (1).</P>

      <P>There are no amendments to this section and we accept it.  A number of points have been raised about it.  The Association of Criminal Lawyers say they would oppose the section on two grounds.  The first matter they raise is the quality of the justices now being appointed to the District Court.  They state that there seems to be no criterion on which many of them are appointed and many of them do not have the expertise, experience or ability to deal with the types of cases that regularly come before that court.  That view has been broadcast widely.  Perhaps the Minister will tell the House about the quality of justices and the criteria.  Is it true that approximately seven years' experience as a solicitor or barrister is required?</P>

      <P>If ten years is required <Col N="802" /> then there is considerable experience involved.  If there are defects will the Minister outline how they can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The association state that the section may be unconstitutional in that minor offences only may be tried by a court of summary jurisdiction.  According to the association this provision would allow a two year sentence in respect of a minor offence where that offence has separate constituent parts &mdash; for example, in the case of not co-operating with the Garda, obstructing or resisting, a breach of the peace or in the case of forging a cheque, fraud, forgery and uttering.  The minor offence test is regarded as 12 months by the courts.  The association referred to the book on the Constitution by Deputy John Kelly.  In that book he states that the Constitution nowhere defines a minor offence.  He states that it has been said that one can have little doubt that the framers of the Constitution, when in Article 38 they spoke of a minor offence, meant the kind of thing that had been generally understood to be minor under the laws of Saorstát Éireann, but some relatively recent cases revolved around the question of whether a particular offence was minor enough to be constitutionally trialable summarily and a more complicated set of criteria emerged without producing a result entirely clear or entirely satisfactory.  Will the Minister say something about the nature of the minor offences and the constitutionality of extending the term to two years.</P>
      <P>What will be the position in regard to two offences arising from the same facts? For instance, in the case of malicious damage to a pane of glass or window and the larceny of a bottle of milk would it be an abuse of the spirit of the section to have two offences included there?  We know well that when a charge arises in regard to a set of facts it very often includes a number of offences in relation to that set of facts.</P>
      <P>Another question is whether by increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court it will make it more attractive to opt for a trial by jury at the Circuit Court. If that is the case will it have the effect of overloading the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Association of Criminal Lawyers misread the section.  They argued against the section as if there was a general provision to increase the sentencing power of the District Court to two years.  That is not what is proposed.  What is proposed is that for the specific instance of offences committed while on bail the aggregate of two or more offences can come to two years maximum.  Many of the points that have been raised by the association are not relevant to the section for that reason.  The second point the Deputy raised was whether the provision is unconstitutional.  Two years for one single offence in the District Court which sits without a jury could probably be unconstitutional but that is not what is being proposed.  The Association of Criminal Lawyers interpreted it as such and made a submission to many of us on the basis that it would be unconstitutional. It could hardly be interpreted as a minor offence.  It is not the nature of the offence but the nature of the sentence. If the offence attracts a sentence of up to approximately 12 months then it is a minor offence that can be tried in the District Court.  What I am proposing does not affect that because it would be a second or subsequent offence committed while on bail.  It would be the combination of two minor offences which would give the period in excess of 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised whether a person while on bail could be charged with two separate offences arising from the same set of facts.  That happens all the time.  There are a certain set of facts, there are a number of offences and people are charged separately with those. The courts would be obliged to sentence people consecutively on those, but it is not mandatory on the District Court to sentence somebody to a total of two years.  In a set of offences, on offence A somebody is out on bail and gets 12 months for that offence.  If offences B, C, D and E are four offences related to the same set of facts the district justice has discretion on what period to allocate to any of the offences.  He is under two restraints.  He cannot exceed the two years <i>in toto</i> if it is in the District Court <Col N="804" /> and it is obligatory on him to provide consecutive modules for each offence committed while on bail.</P>

      <P>With certain offences a number of charges may arise out of the commission of an offence.  For example, a person who forges a cheque could be charged with forgery, larceny or a number of charges arising out of the one offence.  My understanding of section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, is that it was to put a limit of 12 months maximum imprisonment no matter how many <Col N="805" /> charges were brought against the person arising out of an offence.  That was brought in to ensure that sentences imposed by district justices that would be appropriate for minor offences would not exceed 12 months.  Leaving the question of bail aside, is there not a danger here that, as Deputy O'Dea points out, for one offence &mdash; say uttering a forged cheque &mdash; a person charged with the larceny of the money involved and with the offence of forgery itself could be sentenced to a term if imprisonment of, say, two years?</P>

Section 10 changes section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, and allows, where sentences for two or more offences are being imposed, that they can aggregate a total of maximum of two years, but there is no obligation.  The obligation which is in section 9 in relation to bail does not oblige him under section 10 to put in consecutive sentences.</P>

      <P>I understood Deputy Woods to say that the apparent intention of the section is that the number of consecutive sentences to be imposed by the <Col N="808" /> District Court in respect of one set of facts would be limited to 12 months.  It is proposed to extend that to two years, and I would urge the Minister to examine the position between now and Report Stage lest there be a danger that the section would be found to be unconstitutional. Let me give one example.</P>
      <P>If I steal a cheque from the Minister's cheque book and I write a cheque for £10 and I go to Christine in the diningroom and she cashes the cheque, I begin on a clear set of facts.  I have stolen a cheque which is valued at 25p or something; by filling in the cheque and signing the Minister's name I have committed the act of forgery; I have stolen the £10 I obtained, and I would have committed a crime of false presences or fraud.  Four different charges could be laid against me in respect of that one incident.  Generally speaking, when charges are brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions in such matters, every possible charge is brought.  In the instance I have cited I could be convicted of fraudulent offences. At present, the maximum sentence in the District Court would be one year.  It is proposed to increase that to two years.  I submit to the Minister that there is a possibility that the view of the Supreme Court has been overlooked.  A court might interpret the four charges with which I would be indicted as constituting one matter and therefore it would be unconstitutional if I incurred a sentence of two years imprisonment in the District Court.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated that the Association of Criminal Lawyers had misunderstood the section.  The intent of the section is to provide for consecutive sentencing of persons committing offences while on bail.  From the discussion so far it seems that the effect of the section will be far wider and that the Association of Criminal lawyers in fact did not misunderstand the section because it seems the position as explained by Deputy Molony is the correct one.  In view of that, would the Minister not agree that it is unsatisfactory that courts which were established to deal with minor offences and to provide for sentences of up to a year will not be able to sentence people to two years?  If the District Court feel that heavier sentences may be imposed they will transfer the cases to the higher courts and juries in order to have the cases tried.  It seems to me the section is far too wide.</P>

If certain justices say that particular offences are not minor they will refuse jurisdiction and the matter will go to another court.  There is no obligation in section 10 on justices to impose sentences aggregating two years.  They can opt for an aggregation of less than two years, perhaps the present 12 months.</P>

I am quite happy that the criteria laid down for the qualifications of persons to act as justices are sufficient because I think ten years of practice is a long enough period, but we must look at the whole system of the dispensation of justice in the District Court.  It is well known that in many cases in the District Court justice is dispensed in minutes &mdash; indeed I have seen justice dispensed in the District Court in less than one minute in many cases.  We will have to look at the entire system of this slot machine justice which operates in the District Court.  Now that the District Court will have the power to sentence a person to a maximum of two years, which is quite a long time, we will have to examine the whole system seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last point made by the Minister, but let us take a practical look at this.  It is becoming a feature of our system, particularly in the south of Ireland, particularly in Cork at the moment, that it takes years before a person charged with a crime in the Circuit Court is actually brought to trial.  If a person is charged, as has happened in recent times, with the larceny of a newspaper, or a bottle of milk, or a pint of Guinness, that person will opt for trial by jury in the Circuit Court in the knowledge that it will be a year or two years before <Col N="811" /> his trial will come up.  Justice by slot machine, as described by Deputy O'Dea is not at all satisfactory, but I would remind the Deputy that our Circuit and our District Courts are not so much courts of justice as courts of law.  If we want to infuse justice and practicality into our courts we must look at what we are doing on occasions like this.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to sympathise with Deputy O'Dea who said that if we increased the jurisdiction of the District Court to impose a maximum sentence of two years instead of one year we will be in danger of making the District Court a more unpopular place in which to have cases tried.  Let us assume for the sake of my argument that one would get the same measure of justice in the District Court as one would get in the Circuit Court, though it is my experience that in the great majority of cases where persons are found guilty of offences the sentences imposed by the District Court are generally much less severe than those imposed for similar offences by the Circuit Court, Because of the delay in the Circuit Court people are opting for trial by jury and this is resulting in the whole legal system being clogged up.  The sort of approach being adopted in section 10 may only encourage more people to opt for trial by jury.  Consequently, the Minister should consider the section carefully before persisting with its passage.</P>

An extra Circuit Court judge has been appointed and I understand that the President of the Circuit Court is allocating him to the Cork area, but there are no serious delays in the Circuit Court elsewhere in the country. On the question of people opting for trial by jury, in such cases the maximum sentence in respect of larceny, for instance, increases to seven years.  However, I take the point the Deputy is making.  There may be a problem and, as I have said to Deputy Molony, I will consider again the constitutionality of the provision but in many of these situations the Executive <Col N="812" /> do not have control over the Judiciary; the Judiciary must run their courts as they see fit but we cannot cross every &ldquo;t&rdquo; or dot every &ldquo;i&rdquo; because practice in the court might be different from what our intentions was.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the question of determining what a minor offence is.  We are dealing with an area in which in respect of minor offences, whether in cases of bail or in cases to which the Criminal Justice Act of 1951 applies, sentencing is being increased to two years.  The question then is whether that brings it outside the area of minor offences and into a major category.  Regarding the definition of minor offences which I quoted earlier, Kingsmill Moore J. said that, regarded from the point of view of the citizen, the difference between a minor and a major offence depends chiefly on the punishment meted out to the convicted person.  He went on to say that from a moral point of view the offence of smuggling varies enormously, that the importation of a pair of silk stockings for personal use would not be too sternly reprobated even by strict moralists but that large-scale smuggling of valuable items, organised and conducted as a profitable business, was not only being reprobated in severe terms by judges but would be regarded by most people as involving moral delinquency. Mr. Kingsmill Moore went on to say that if the introduction of a pair of silk stockings were to be made punishable by a fine of £100 and imprisonment for six months, if the offender cannot find the money, he could say, looking at the matter objectively, that the offence had been stamped <Col N="813" /> as major by reason of the extent of the penalty and that before being convicted of an offence involving such consequences he should be able to claim that his guilt be established before and by a jury.</P>
    <P>That deals very much with the sort of problem we are faced with here in providing for aggregate sentences of two years.  Ó Dálaigh J. pointed out also that, if one is to have regard to the reality of the guarantee of trial by jury, the amount of the penalty in every case must be a very important, if not the most important factor, in determining whether an offence is minor.  Therefore, it would seem that the whole question of whether an offence is minor would be in doubt particularly in relation to a number of charges arising from the same set of facts.  Because there is a question mark in this regard, I am asking the Minister to reconsider it between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The District Court provides a very valuable service to the community in dispensing justice even if that is not done too quickly in some cases. Most people in the District Court opt for summary trial there and then because if they opt for trial in the Circuit Court they are going into a new sentencing policy. This can involve much longer terms of imprisonment so obviously people are inclined to opt to have their cases heard in the District Court.

I will take what Deputies said into account.  We all want to do something about the position of offences committed while on bail and the House generally has agreed that section 9 is a very good section.  In order to impose consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail I need section 10 or something close to it.  I will look at it again to see if section 10 can be confined simply to the question of bail.</P>

      <P>As regards sentencing, the only figures I can get, having had a quick look through the annual report on prisons for 1982 for males and females, are that 80 per cent of sentences appear to be between three months and 12 months.  The other 20 per cent is divided between those over 18 months and those below three months and as low as two weeks.  I have no idea how many of these sentences apply to the District Court.  We have very little information about the practicality of applying this section.  I indicated earlier that statistics available to me showed there were in the region of 2,000 people involved in committing offences while on bail.  If 80 per cent of them are convicted and given consecutive sentences, we need additional prison accommodation to accommodate these people.  Apart from the question of constitutionality or whether the section can be confined, there is the problem of the practical application of the section.  Assuming we have consecutive sentencing where will we put these people?</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on section 9 I raised this matter and the Chair said I could raise it under section 10 if I wished as that was the section under which to raise it.  This is a very important element.  We are not trying to <Col N="817" /> put the Minister on the spot.  Many people have expressed concern about this.  We said we would like to discuss it and see in what areas the system could be improved, without unduly criticising any person in the District Court.  We realise the enormous burdens district justices have trying to dispense justice in the courts.</P>
      <P>How can we hope to improve the situation there?  Under the section we should maintain the existing sentencing policy with the proviso of consecutive sentencing for offences committed while on bail.  I agree that the modules element is a very good feature in the section in that a district justice could give, for example, a sentence of six months plus two months, plus one month plus two weeks.</P>
      <P>The only other point is in relation to the power we are giving district justices. I understand how the Minister intends this to work: that a justice can sentence up to two years.  That brings us to the question of district justices and how the District Courts operate.  We are increasing their powers.  I ask the Chair to accept that it has already been ruled on.</P>

      <P>I do not intend going into great detail on it.  Deputy O'Dea referred to slot-machine justice in the District Court and I referred to hit and miss justice. We realise that justice is dispensed very quickly.  One can get two years in two minutes or less.  The court deals with an enormous number of cases each day. It provides an excellent service to the community but there are great problems. One person is under tremendous pressure for a number of hours every day and cases pass through every two or three minutes.  It is very difficult to keep a <Col N="818" /> balance and dispense justice fairly in those circumstances.  That would bring us to the selection process for district justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I just mentioned it.  I do not intend to deal with it.  The Minister said that a barrister or solicitor with ten years experience is selected.  It may be that he has specialised in a particular area that does not cover the wide range of law which comes before him.</P>
      <P>Other people have asked for uniformity of sentencing.  It is important that a justice judge every case on its merits and take all the circumstances into account. Many of the comments made about sentencing have been unfair because those people were not present when the case was being heard and they did not realise just why a justice acted in a certain way.  I urge the Minister to review the selection process and to tell us more about how judges are appointed, who appoints them, what the criteria are, and so on.  I know very little about this except that 90 per cent of all crime committed comes before the District Court.  Society would like the Minister to look at this area again.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to dwell on this at length but in the past this has caused great concern because of the tremendous pressures on the District Courts and, unfortunately, the spotlight has been unfairly turned on individuals.  I do not want to do that because I do not approve of it but the system needs to be changed.  It is our duty to correct it and to ensure that before we pass this section this matter will be examined.  The Minister gave assurances about other measures that will be taken before certain sections come into force.  Before this section takes the force of law, I would feel much happier if we got a promise that the system would be looked at.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> By way of passing reference I would like to say that the vast majority of district justices serving in the District Courts were appointed not by this administration but by previous administrations.  Deputy Woods was a member of a Government who considered the appointment of many district justices and he should have a full knowledge of the criteria involved because he sat in Cabinet when they were being appointed.</P>
      <P>In general, I am happy with the quality of district justices, although there are exceptions.  In my limited experience I have found that it is very difficult to predict when one gets an application who will turn out to be excellent and who will turn out to be moderately good.  It is very hard to list the qualities which will eventually make a good district justice.  As I have already said, the District Courts deal with 90 per cent of all crime in an efficient and fair way.  We should always remember that what they do is not conclusive. There is always the right of appeal.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> At present, absconding while on bail is not an offence.  Subsection (1), taking the proposed amendment into account, makes it an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to £1,000 or 12 months' imprisonment or both.  Under existing law, section 33 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, states that a person who is about to abscond while on bail may be arrested on a warrant issued on the basis of sworn information given on oath by a garda or the person who went surety for the bail.  The offence is not committed, however, until the person fails to answer to his bail on the appointed day without reasonable excuse, which is defined under subsection (2).</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for the person to show that he had a reasonable excuse for not appearing and for the court to determine whether in all the circumstances the excuse is a reasonable one &mdash; for instance hospitalisation.  Subsection (2) provides that failure to surrender to bail will be treated under section 9 as an offence committed while on bail.  Consequently, any sentence imposed for this offence will have to be consecutive on any previous sentence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the creation of this new offence of failure to surrender to bail.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have raised a question <Col N="822" /> in relation to this section.  They say that section 11 should be extended to include provision for the Garda to have power to arrest any person who fails to surrender to bail without their having a warrant, where they know that a bench warrant is in existence.  At present a garda cannot arrest such a person unless he has in his possession a bench warrant. Would the Minister give us his views in relation to the proposal of the association and state his objection to allowing this? It seems fairly clear that the person will have committed an offence.  Therefore, the question arises as to whether a bench warrant was needed when apprehending or bringing in the offender.  The Minister said in his opening remarks that the offence does not occur until the person appears before the courts.</P>

    <P>(c)  an offence under section 6, 7 or 8 under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939</P>
    <P>(d)  a grave breach such as is referred to in section 3 (1) (i) of the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962,</P>
    <P>(e)  an offence under section 9 of the Official Secrets Act, 1963, or an offence under Part II of that Act committed in a manner prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State,</P>
    <P>(f)  murder, attempt to murder, conspiracy to murder or piracy, including an accessory before or after the fact.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person charged with an offence to which this section applies shall not be admitted to bail except by order of the High Court.</P>
    <P>We are trying in this amendment to include an offence under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, which is basically the offence of trafficking and dealing in drugs and where bail would apply to such offences it would have to be granted by the High Court.  It is to put a restriction on bail.  We have had instances where bail was applied at the District Court level.  We believe in the case of people who are trafficking and dealing in drugs, that these should be classed in the same way as the items mentioned here like murder and certain other offences, attempt to murder, conspiracy to murder.  This is a very serious offence and consequently the High Court should give the decision in relation to bail.  In many respects this relates to what we have been discussing previously: the circumstances in which people can get out on bail.  We have had our list of <Col N="827" /> conditions which can apply to bail and the various circumstances under which bail can be granted.  It seems clear to me that bail should not be granted easily in such cases and that the question of bail should in all those cases be considered very seriously and at a high level.  That is the reason we are proposing that such offences are brought under section 29 of the Criminal Procedures Act, 1967.  We believe that would be a very beneficial step.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The idea of the amendment is to provide that a person charged with drug pushing under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, could not get bail except by order of the High Court.  That is the situation at present with offences like treason, murder, attempted murder, piracy and certain offences under the Offences Against the State Act as well as other specified offences.  I would like to have time to think about this.  When we talk about a drug pusher we think in terms of a kind of godfather figures who are victimising the young population and making an enormous amount of money out of it.  A number of situations can arise where the victim is also victimising other people.  There is not a clear cut division between those who use drugs and those who traffic in them.  Very frequently a drug addict is put in a situation where, having been victimised by the traders in drugs, he is forced by his addictive habit to push drugs and consequently victimises others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the whole question of the idea of somebody who is a victim being held in custody and not given bail.  I would like to approach the issue which arises by asking a couple of questions about it.  If a person is smoking cannabis which he has acquired and is not a pusher but, at a party say, decides to give a cannabis cigarette to his friends, is that person a pusher?  Since it is a rather expensive commodity, if a friend asks for a smoke and instead of giving the particular drug immediately the person who has the drug gives it and says that it cost him £2 and he wants that money from the person, <Col N="828" /> does that constitute pushing?  If a friend or an acquaintance asks a person for drugs which he has in his possession &mdash; I am thinking of something like cannabis &mdash; and the person with the drugs has acquired them for a certain amount of money and he decides he will make a profit on them and says to the other person that he got it for £5 but that person will have to give him £6, £7, £8 or £10, is that pushing?</P>
    <P>We want to be very clear about what we are doing.  The offence of pushing can within its ambit, contain a whole series of different circumstances, some of which would be very serious.  I am fully in agreement with the Deputy that the person trafficking in drugs in a major way could be refused bail along the lines he suggests but there are a lot of other examples where people could find themselves deprived of bail in situations where subsequently they might not get a prison sentence.</P>
    <P>I would like more time to think about this and I would like to consult further with the Attorney General on the matter. What the Deputy is suggesting could be very wide-ranging indeed, and in his desire to get at the target we all desire to get at he may be bringing within the ambit of non-granting of bail except by order of the High Court people he may not have intended to bring within its ambit at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was listening to a different Minister for a minute.  I consider that is a very mature approach.  I visited the Coolmine Therapeutic Centre in my constituency yesterday and the phrase used by the person in charge was that &ldquo;every addict is a pusher&rdquo;.  Addicts buy a quantity of drugs, split it in half and sell half to another person.  This gives them enough money for the next shot they need.  I can see the dangers in the section and I can see the desire for it.  We should examine it very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know an instance where four or five people smoked cannabis among themselves. They assigned one person to buy it and they split it up and paid the person who bought it.  The Garda picked up the group and charged the man who bought it for the rest of them as a pusher and he <Col N="829" /> was sentenced to ten years.  We are really trying to get the pushers.  This needs to be very carefully thought about.  I subscribe to the way in which the Minister has responded to this section.  We should think about it a little more before Report Stage.  Something must be done in the area of drugs.  While we are putting this legislation through the Dáil it would be appropriate if we could find a way to tackle and really hit hard the people who are responsible for misery and death.  I would like to consider it from different angles.  I appreciate and accept the Minister's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the intention behind the amendment.  We all want to eliminate the drug pushers, the major people in this vicious business.  The Minister was right to suggest that it may be a bit too wide-ranging.  I am just marking the cards for Deputy Mitchell who may be listening on the monitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the problem arises from the original definition in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  When we try to make an amendment we have to refer back to the section in the Act which deals with this matter.  We want to make clear to the people who are trafficking in drugs what the intention is.  We must be careful not to be ambivalent about people who hand drugs around to one another.  Something like 80 per cent of those who were introduced to drugs got them from a friend.  A friend passing drugs to a friend is a major part of the whole system.  That may be why in the original definition they had difficulty in separating the two elements.</P>
      <P>The Minister understands what I am trying to get at.  We want to get at the godfathers, the traffickers and the major pushers who are not users.  We are not talking about bail being refused.  We are talking about the granting of bail by the High Court.  The High Court will have to give a decision.  The High Court can take all these factors into account.  In the long run the only way to deal with it may be to leave it to the discretion of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Misuse of Drugs Bill which has just been circulated does not help us <Col N="830" /> on this section so far as I can see from a preliminary glance.  It does not give any redefinition of section 15.  We want to ensure that those involved in trading in drugs will not get bail easily.  This is a very serious offence.  We discussed the criteria earlier.  While it may have been somewhat trying for the Minister and the Ceann Comhairle, that discussion was beneficial to the House.</P>
    <P>The criteria cover the nature of the accusation, in other words, the seriousness of the charge.  A charge of trafficking in drugs is a most serious charge.  It is a form of subversion of our young people. There is also the nature of the evidence in support of the charge, which is often quite substantial.  Then there is the likely sentence to be imposed on conviction. The sentence can be up to 14 years, which is a very substantial possible sentence.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that a person can be caught red-handed.  These people should not be free to continue trading in drugs while on bail and to put away funds and make arrangements.  The High Court can consider these matters very fully and give a judgment taking all these factors into consideration.  We do not want people who are well known in the drugs area to get out on bail and be free to abscond and leave the country during the court hearing as, I think, happened in one instance.  This is of great importance. It is very urgent.  We must give our attention to it.  I would be disappointed if we went through this Bill without addressing that problem.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will consider it between now and Report Stage and attempt to define more specifically the nature of the offence which is defined in section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my appreciation to the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and to indicate that I propose to divide the time with Deputy Woods who also wishes to raise the matter.</P>
      <P>Considerable disquiet was caused in the country during the weekend at the knowledge that a person who sought asylum at Shannon Airport was bundled back onto the Soviet plane on Sunday and returned to the Soviet Union.  We are aware that the Soviet Union is not a country whose citizens can leave at will and that from time to time people who find themselves out of that country seek asylum in western countries.  I think that a person who seeks asylum in this country or in the West should be given every sympathy and every opportunity to consider his position and to consult with embassies of western countries or whoever he or she might wish to consult with and that a reasonable time should elapse before such person is put back on the plane and sent back to the Soviet Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Monday evening the <i>Evening Herald</i> carried a lead story to the effect that Valerij Agapov, a 35-year old Russian, was returned to the Soviet Union on account of what it described as an unwritten agreement between the Irish and the Soviet Governments.  In a later statement the Taoiseach denied there was any agreement with the Soviet Union to that effect but nevertheless there is a feeling of unease about what happened.  One can visualise the situation when the Aeroflot agreement was being negotiated that the Soviet Government would have had concern about people wishing to defect at stop-overs at Shannon Airport and it does not stretch the imagination unduly to think the matter was discussed.  There is a nagging feeling, notwithstanding the Taoiseach's statement, that the matter was discussed and that there was some <Col N="832" /> kind of understanding.  This was not the first time such an incident happened.  It happened with a number of Afghanistan citizens and with Soviet citizens on quite a number of occasions before, and it seems remarkable to me that on each occasion the person concerned changed his mind and decided to go back to the Soviet Union.  That is a matter that strains credulity to some extent.</P>
    <P>According to reports in this instance, the 35-year old Russian indicated he wanted a visa for the United States but it appears from the reports that, notwithstanding his request to that effect, the US embassy in Dublin was not contacted at any time, nor were they given any opportunity to be advised on the situation or to interview the man to consider whether they would be prepared to grant him asylum in the United States.  I have the feeling that the Government are extending themselves rather too much not to offend the Soviet Union and I think they have gone too far in that respect.  I can understand the wish to have a commercial set-up operate with Aeroflot at Shannon. That is all very fine but I think the basic principles of international law should be regarded with the greatest care, and the rights of a person in the free world, in which this country is included, seeking asylum is a matter that should have a consideration equally strong, if not stronger, than those pertaining to commercial matters.  For instance, I have not seen where the Government have made any strong representations in connection with Andrei Sakharov and his wife, who are seriously ill on hunger strike.  On occasions in this House the Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated his preference to make representations quietly rather than in the open where matters regarding the Soviet Union are concerned.  Personally I do not agree with that approach.  If representations need to be made they should be made openly and in public and if disapproval is felt it should be stated openly.</P>
    <P>Another aspect also causes concern. Apparently it is the position that the people who were normally used as interpreters when these situations arise were <Col N="833" /> not called in and they expressed some surprise that they were not called on this occasion.  Instead, a woman who apparently lived in the Soviet Union for 20 years was called in to have discussions with Mr. Valerij Agapov.  At the end of it all, her comment was that she was dissatisfied with what had happened and was upset by the episode.  I find it calls for some explanation as to why she was dissatisfied with what happened and I wish to know what was it about the episode that upset her.  There is the suggestion, which needs clarification, that in the intervening period when this man sought asylum and freedom in this country, pressures of some description were brought to bear upon him, as a result of which he changed his mind.</P>
    <P>There is a parallel situation with previous would-be defectors.  I refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today's date recalling a previous case where a would-be defector was interviewed on a Monday morning and where the interpreter stated:</P>
    <P>He was pretty terrified when I saw him first.  He was terrified most that there might be Russians in the police station.  He absolutely did not want to go back to the Soviet Union.  He was insistent on that.</P>
    <P>The reporter said the man stated that if he was sent back he would be imprisoned or worse.  Notwithstanding that statement, later in the day he changed his mind.  The combination of circumstances and the similarity of the situations whereby a series of would-be defectors from the Soviet Union and Afghanistan sought asylum but at the end of the day did not stay on or were not given the appropriate facilities to meet with US embassy staff or other staff, calls the whole matter into question.</P>
    <P>Some questions here call for answer. Why was the US embassy not contacted? Why was an opportunity not given to staff from that embassy to meet this man, as he asked, and to have an interpreter or someone from the embassy present who spoke his language?  Why was it that the interpreter who spoke to him on this occasion was dissatisfied?  Why is there <Col N="834" /> no procedure laid down to allow a reasonable time, say, a week, during which the person concerned could be given a reasonable opportunity to settle his mind and to meet the people he would need to meet?  Then it could be seen quite clearly that the matter was dealt with in an open and proper manner.  In my view, it is essential that in such a situation justice not only be done but also be seen to be done.  In this case I cannot say whether or not justice was done although I have the gravest doubts in that regard.  However, justice did not seem to be done having regard to the way the matter was handled.  I should like to elaborate further but I agreed to share the time with my colleague.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Taylor in expressing the widespread public concern which exists in relation to the treatment which apparently was given to this man who appears to have sought asylum here.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 11 June 1984 said:</P>
      <P>... Mr. Agapov was refused admission to Ireland under Article Five of the 1946 amended Aliens Order.  Reliable sources said last night that the Taoiseach, Dr. Fitzgerald, was consulted about what should be done with Mr. Agapov.  It is understood that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Barry, and the Minister for Justice, Mr. Noonan, were involved in taking decisions on the case.  Problems with aliens come within the remit of the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In today's edition of the <i>Cork Examiner,</i> a Government spokesman flatly denied any Government involvement in the deportation decision and said that the aliens section of the Department of Justice had wide ranging autonomous powers to decide on immigration matters.  He added that the decision in the Agapov case was not one for the Government to take.  Conflicting views have been expressed in the media and we are not aware of all the facts.  I appreciate that the Government have difficulties in relation to decisions taken in this area and I made that clear at the outset when I was <Col N="835" /> asked about the case.  I also felt that the international convention should be fully examined and considered as I fear for Mr. Agapov's future when he goes back to Russia.  I should like the Minister to express that fear on our behalf and to register our concern which might be very helpful to Mr. Agapov.</P>
    <P>I tried to raise this by way of a Private Notice Question today but it was ruled out of order on the grounds that it was not urgent and also because it was a <i>fait accompli.</i>  However, it is still necessary to express our views and concern in relation to this young man who, quite obviously, sought asylum.  He is reported to have indicated that he wanted to go to the United States.  I should like the Minister to say if Mr. Agapov sought political asylum because we are led to believe that he was quite happy to leave and that he brushed off immigration officers on his way.  This was after a decision had been made and he had to accept it and be as cheerful as possible about it.  Information since then seems to indicate that he may not have been happy with the decision. Did the Minister or the Department of Justice refuse his admission to Ireland under Article 5 of the 1946 amended Aliens Order, or on any other basis?  If he was leaving of his own free will, why was it necessary to make the order, if the order was made?</P>
    <P>It has also been alleged that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was annoyed because he was not consulted before Mr. Agapov was sent back to the Soviet Union.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that aspect of the affair.  One gets a picture of a man who escaped from this aeroplane, wandered into the local area and was sitting on a bridge when a passing garda saw him.  That freedom does not come as easily behind the Iron Curtain.  I spent some time there as a scientist and I am very conscious of what freedom means and of the constraints on individuals there.  On that basis, I am particularly concerned that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should express his anxieties about this man's future in the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>One of the things mentioned was that <Col N="836" /> there was a final check with him on the aeroplane and the same news report in <i>The Irish Times</i> said:</P>
    <P>... officials went on board and spoke again with Mr. Agapov.  According to sources, Mr. Agapov again indicated freely that he wished to return to Moscow.  ...Mr. Agapov was apparently smiling and saying that he just wanted to get back to his home in Moscow.... Mr. Agapov confirmed his intentions and the flight took off.</P>
    <P>The environment within which that check took place is very hostile as far as the individual is concerned and it would be very hard for him to say that he wanted to get off the plane.  An attempt has been made to give a number of false impressions in relation to this incident and it would be valuable if the Minister would clarify the position and take note of the concern which has been expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Aeroflot flights between Russia and Cuba stop daily at Shannon Airport to refuel.  During stop over, passengers are allowed to get off the aeroplane and to go to the duty free area in the airport.  On the morning of Saturday last, 9 June 1984, one passenger was reported missing when passengers reembarked on the flight to Moscow.  A search was started immediately but the passenger could not be located.  The aeroplane departed for Moscow at approximately 9.45 a.m. without the missing passenger. There was no further news of the missing passenger until 3.40 p.m. approximately on Saturday afternoon when an immigration officer at Shannon Airport was told that a man had turned up at Shannon Garda station.  The immigration officer went to the Garda station to interview him.  As, apparently, the man spoke no English it was arranged that an interpreter would speak to him by telephone. As a result of three separate conversations between him and the interpreter, it was established beyond doubt that he was not an applicant for political asylum in any recognised sense of that term.  He made it quite clear that it was a matter of thinking that he would be better off in <Col N="837" /> the United States.  That, I need hardly say, is not the same as having a case for political asylum.  Accordingly, he was told that he would not be allowed to stay. On Sunday morning I gave instructions that the man's position should be double checked.  As he had already boarded the aeroplane the immigration official spoke to him there.  He indicated that he wished to return to Moscow and the immigration officer was satisfied that the man had enough knowledge of English to be able to understand the gist of what was said by the immigration officer.  Moreover, the officer was satisfied, from the man's demeanour, that he was not in any fear.</P>
      <P>I should now like to say a few words about the general question of passengers on Aeroflot flights indicating that they do not wish to continue their journey.  Records in my Department show that in the past four years, ten persons came to the notice of the immigration staff as having deliberately separated themselves from other persons transiting Shannon on planes going to or from Moscow or Warsaw. Three were USSR citizens, five were Cubans and two were from Afghanistan. Of these, only three sought refuge of any kind here or in the USA.  The rest were quickly identified as simply wishing to find better living conditions elsewhere than in the countries to which they were travelling.  It would not be in the interests of these persons to go into further details about individuals, but of the ten, three were sent onwards, two changed their minds and the rest were seen to be and were treated as ordinary aliens who did not qualify for leave to land and who therefore were sent back on the next suitable plane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to one other aspect of the recent case, namely some of the statements which appeared in the media.  I will confine myself to two points.  It alleged that the alien was escorted to the plane on Sunday morning by armed detectives. This is simply not true.  The man walked with just one immigration officer to the embarkation point for the Aeroflot plane.  There was no escort, armed or otherwise.  There was also a report that the person who acted as interpreter was concerned at the way the case was being <Col N="838" /> handled.  The person in question has stated categorically that the report is without foundation and that she had said nothing to any reporter to justify such a statement.  She has further given her consent to my quoting her as having made this denial.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor began by saying that this Russian gentleman sought asylum here.  That is not true.  Secondly, he said that this gentleman was bundled back on the plane.  That is not true.  He quoted the <i>Evening Herald</i> statement that there was an unwritten agreement between Ireland and the Soviet government on the treatment of passengers at Shannon Airport.  There is no such agreement, written or unwritten.  Of ten individuals who separated themselves from their fellow passengers over the past four years, three were given refuge.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor also said that we would have to stretch our imaginations to see people changing their minds on each and every occasion.  There was not a question of people changing their minds on every occasion.  As I have said, two of the ten changed their minds, three were kept here and five were treated as aliens who were refused admission on the same basis that in any country a person without appropriate papers would be refused admission.  We must distinguish between refugees or people who are looking for political asylum.  I am sure there are vast numbers of people in Eastern bloc countries who are very unhappy with the circumstances in which they find themselves and who would desire to be living in the West.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor said there was great concern on the part of the Government not to offend the Societ Union.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to two incidents which have occurred since this Government came into power.  Firstly, there was the expulsion of certain Russian diplomats which did not indicate any reluctance to take action which might offend the Soviet Union.  Secondly, we played our part in the same way as any other country in connection with the shooting down of a particular plane over Korea.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor spoke about the normal <Col N="839" /> people used as interpreters not being contacted on this occasion.  Of the ten people who were involved <i>in toto</i> five were citizens of Cuba and two from Afghanistan. There were three Russians over the period of four years and there is not a Russian interpreter on the staff in Shannon. People are used as the need arises. I think Deputy Taylor was commenting on an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning about a woman who acted as interpreter on a previous occasion.  If he had continued the quotation it would have transpired that the woman was quite satisfied that the man changed his mind.  He referred to the comment of the lady who spoke to this gentleman on the phone and said she expressed herself as being dissatisfied.  I would refer the Deputy to my statement that she categorically denies this and states that the report is without foundation.  She said nothing to any reporter to justify such a statement and furthermore, has given her consent to my quoting her in this denial.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor raised the point about people being given a reasonable time. The policy is and will continue to be that if there is a <i>prima facie</i> case of somebody seeking political asylum &mdash; the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; is almost synonmous with a person seeking political asylum &mdash; the case will be examined thoroughly.  The experience over the past four years is that three people out of ten were not returned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods raised a number of points which I have dealt with.  He said it <Col N="840" /> was quite obvious that the gentleman sought political asylum.  He did not.  I do not have the personal experience of the Eastern bloc which Deputy Woods has but it is generally accepted that there are limitations on personal freedom, that the standard of living in Eastern bloc countries is much lower than in the West and that many people there would like to live in the West.  There are many people in Ireland who would like to live in America but they cannot get in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked whether this man was refused admission under the Act which he quoted.  That is the only basis on which anybody could be refused admission.  He was refused on that basis but no order was made under the Act.</P>
    <P>If any future case arises where there is a <i>prima facie</i> case that a person is seeking political asylum, it will be examined thoroughly and dealt with appropriately.  On this occasion the case was dealt with in accordance with the policy laid down, under which the ten other people at the same airport coming off Moscow or Warsaw flights were dealt with in the past.  I do not envisage any change of policy because the policy is adequate.  I am glad to have been able to state the full facts in so far as they are available to me.  I agree with both Deputies that there was public concern.</P>

      <P>The State mining lease granted to Tara Mines Ltd. on 19 September 1975 provides for the payment of a royalty of 4½ per cent of the profits of the company as assessed by the Revenue Commissioners for purposes of corporation tax.  Accounts have been provided to the Revenue Commissioners for the years up to 1982, but the profits of the company for tax purposes since trading commenced on 1 January 1978 have not yet been finally agreed. Therefore, no royalty payments have been made as yet by the company.  It is clear, however, that because of the poor operational, industrial relations problems, and trading situation of the company in the period little or no liability for royalty arises in respect of the period to the end of 1982.  The lease also provides for the payment by the company of dead rent; the amount of £48,000 has been paid to date.</P>

    <P>Approximately 90 per cent of the total weight represents concrete, bitumen and steel.  The remaining 10 per cent comprises contaminated material and less than 0.01 per cent of this comprises the contaminating radioisotopes.  Only lowlevel radioactive waste is dumped at the site.</P>
    <P>At the most recent meeting of the London Dumping Convention in February 1984 the Irish delegation re-stated, in strong terms, Ireland's opposition in principle to the practice of dumping at sea and supported a motion maintaining that the disposal of high-level radioactive waste is prohibited under the terms of the convention.  At a meeting which I had with Mr. Patrick Jenkin, UK Secretary of State for the Environment in February last I called on the UK authorities to discontinue dumping at sea.  Since then Mr. Jenkin has stated that the UK has decided to suspend dumpings at sea pending the completion of a scientific study to be carried out in the UK in conjunction with the Trades Union Congress on the safety of disposal of radioactive waste in the North Atlantic dumpsite.</P>
    <P>As you will see from the table no dumping took place in 1983 and I am advised by the Nuclear Energy Board that it is unlikely also that any dumping operations will be carried out in 1984.</P>

      <P>Statistics are not compiled in such a manner as to enable the precise information requested to be given but the available data show that the number of self-employed individuals assessed to income tax in the year ended 5 April 1984 was about 165,000 or some 7,000 greater than the corresponding number of persons assessed in the year ended 5 April 1983. It is not possible to distinguish the amount of tax paid by the latter group as that amount is merged in the collection process with the tax paid by self-employed individuals as a whole.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer's liabilities to income tax for the years 1978-79 to 1982-83, inclusive, were reviewed by the inspector of taxes in July 1983.  The review revealed that insufficient tax had been deducted from the taxpayer's earnings in respect of each of those years and the tax underpaid will be collected by appropriate adjustments of his tax-free allowances under PAYE.  The position has already been explained to the taxpayer. The inspector of taxes will not be in a position to review the taxpayer's liability for 1983-84 until the taxpayer supplies the information requested by the inspector on 29 July 1983.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer ceased employment on 19 November 1983, and submitted a claim to repayment of tax to the inspector of taxes on 1 February 1984. However, the inspector has not been able to process the claim because he did not receive the employer's copy of the cessation certificate (which is required under PAYE regulations) confirming the amounts of pay and tax deducted during the taxpayer's period of employment. The inspector has written to the taxpayer's former employer on two occasions for the necessary details but there has been no response.  In the circumstances, he is arranging for an official to visit the employer with a view to obtaining the required information so that any refund of tax due may be made as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was assessed with means at £23.75 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging in her parents' home.  Due to an oversight, the amount of means assessed against her was not deducted from the maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance until recently when the matter was corrected.  She is at present in receipt of unemployment assistance at £6.60 weekly being the maximum weekly rate payable to her £30.35 less £23.75.</P>
      <P>To enable her to appeal against the amount of means assessed against her she may obtain an appeal application form at her local office and when she completes and returns it her case will be referred to an appeals officer for determination.

      <P>The present weekly rate of invalidity pension appropriate to the person concerned is £39.35 which is the <Col N="736" /> maximum personal rate for a pensioner under 66.  However the person concerned was overpaid the sum of £422.37 in respect of unemployment benefit claimed during the period 2 October 1980 to 23 June 1982.  A deduction of £2 per week is being made from her invalidity pension until the overpayment is recovered. Accordingly a pension rate of £37.75 is payable at present.  Living alone allowance is not payable to invalidity pensioners who are under age 66.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 9 April 1984 but she was not qualified for payment as according to the records of the Department she had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions recorded for the 1982-83 year on which entitlement to benefit is based.  The claimant was requested to supply details of her insurance record for the 1982-83 year and when these were received all benefit payable from 12 April 1984, fourth day of incapacity, was issued to her.</P>

The optician concerned has confirmed that the claimant presented this letter of authorisation to him and chose spectacles costing a total of £69.45.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The approximate costs of veterinary inspections and services at Rosslare Harbour for the years 1982 and 1983 were £81,500 and £97,000 respectively.</P>
      <P>A twenty-four hour service is provided at the harbour and the services consist mainly of:</P>
      <P>&mdash;inspections carried out on incoming vessels (ferries) at time of disembarkation,</P>
      <P>&mdash;disinfection, as required, of arriving passengers and vehicles,</P>
      <P>&mdash;supervision of the landing and inspection of permitted animals,</P>
      <P>&mdash;health and welfare inspection of animals prior to loading for export and inspection of the carrier vessels.</P>
      <P>The costs involved are borne on the Vote for Agriculure.  Since May 1982 a fee has been charged for certificates issued in respect of veterinary inspection of livestock prior to exportation and fees totalling £3,367 and £3,115 for 1982 and 1983 respectively were collected on cattle and horses exported through Rosslare Harbour.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 616, 617 and 618 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Association Agreement between the EEC and Cyprus a preferential rate of customs duty at 6 per cent applies to imports of new potatoes from Cyprus from 1 January to 15 May (the full rate is 15 per cent).  There is also a preferential rate of 9.4 per cent from 16 May to 30 June for an EEC quota of 60,000 tonnes (the full rate is 21 per cent).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cyprus authorities wished to ensure orderly marketing of Cyprus potatoes in Ireland and chose Irish Potato Marketing Ltd. as their representative to carry out the commercial arrangements. The allocation of quantities among <Col N="758" /> applicants was made by IPM following consultations with the trade.  Licences were then issued by my Department to 28 traders who had concluded purchase arrangements with IPM.  These 28 were included in a total of 57 applications received by my Department between 21 February and 7 June 1984.</P>
    <P>Three consignments were imported. The first contained 1,160 tonnes and was imported through Derry.  The second contained 1,645 tonnes and was imported through Greenore.  Both of these consignments were imported by 15 May except for 30 tonnes imported on 16 May. The third consignment amounted to 600 tonnes and has been imported through Derry this month.  In the event all imports subsequent to 15 May were accommodated under the EEC quota of 60,000 tonnes and therefore attracted the reduced duty of 9.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The distribution of licences and quantities were: Leinster, 21 licences for 2,815 tonnes (including 19 licences for 2,775 tonnes for Dublin); Connacht, 1 licence for 20 tonnes; Munster, 3 licences for 490 tonnes; Ulster (all Donegal), 3 licences for 80 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The Cyprus authorities and my Department agreed that special packaging in 25 Kg bags would facilitate the identification of the agreed supplies.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am informed by the Garda authorities that a member of the Garda Síochána called to the home of this family on three occasions in May 1984 in order to speak to a member of the family.  They say that on the first two occasions the garda was informed that the person in question was not at home <Col N="759" /> and that on the third occasion which was on 30 May 1984 when the member concerned was accompanied by another member of the Force they were asked by the person who answered the door to wait a moment and after about two minutes he came back and said to them &ldquo;you can come in now&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities also say that when the members entered the front room of the house the person who had asked them to come in switched on a tape recorder and began shouting and abusing the members and that two other men then opened the door of the room and commenced taking photographs of the members.  The Garda say that the members then left the house because of the hostility being displayed towards them.</P>

The matter was adverted to in the discussion which I had with the Right Honorable Mr. Nicholas Scott, MP, Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Education when I visited him in Belfast on 20 January 1984.  It should be borne in mind, however, that available surplus capacity in Northern Ireland does not necessarily occur in the areas of greatest need in our third-level colleges.</P>
