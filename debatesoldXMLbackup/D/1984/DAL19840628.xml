      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he is aware of the fact that there was yesterday evening a major incursion by the British army across the Border in County Monaghan.  Would he be prepared to make a statement some time today in the House about this matter, particularly in view of the very solemn assurances which had been received quite recently from the British government about incursions of this kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of reports of an incursion but I have not received a report on the matter yet.  If I receive a report which will be of use to the House I will certainly be willing to consider making a brief statement to the House on the subject.  I have no information other than from newspapers that enable me to judge whether the incursíon was of an accidental character or of a deliberate character. Of course there are many accidental incursions on both sides but, if it were a deliberate incursion, the Government would be deeply concerned about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>You will recall yesterday morning, a Cheann Comhairle, on the Order of Business, that I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the promised legislation for the mutualisation of the Irish Civil Service Building Society in view of its proposed take-over by the Bank of Ireland.  I did not receive any information yesterday morning but a statement was made later in the day by the Government yesterday which clearly indicates that they are reneging on commitments to introduce this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach what has changed since 3 April last and the various other commitments given on various other dates with regard to the introduction of legislation to prevent the Bank of Ireland taking over the Irish Civil Service Building Society and the statement of the Minister at the time which said that the takeover would be inconsistent with the concepts underlying the building society movement?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What has changed would appear to be the attitude of the Bank of Ireland, which opens the possibility of the Government's objective in respect of mutualisation being achieved by agreement rather than by legislation. If discussions yield that result then we will be very happy indeed to have achieved our objective without our having to bring the matter before the House. If they do not, of course the matter will have to come before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing it, but arising from the Taoiseach's reply has he now accepted the principle of a major bank taking over one of the big five building societies?  It is a matter of principle which has underlined the whole Bill because we were misled in this House on a number of occasions by the Minister for the Environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To respond to Deputy Burke's sound and fury, but more calmly, the Government's concern in this matter arose from the impact upon the building society system of a situation where a bank takeover of a society which was not mutualised could have the effect of having a building society under bank control which did not have mutualisation.  If it is possible to achieve the objective of mutualisation within the framework of this proposed takeover, then we will have achieved our objective.  If it is not possible and there is any difficulty about it <Col N="971" /> we will certainly come back to the House. Deputy Burke can be assured of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, there is a difficulty on which I would ask you to advise me.  Deputies occasionally make allegations which are out of order. Despite the most assiduous efforts of the Chair these allegations get through, then there is a difficulty because they are said loudly and the Chair is not in a position to shut them down, nor should he attempt to do so.  However, there is a difficulty that allegations are made and one is not permitted to reply to them.  What is the <Col N="973" /> appropriate course of action in these circumstances?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair feels that matters are not improved if after a disorderly intervention by one Deputy a Minister or some other Deputy wants to reply to that.  First of all, that is achieving the object of the disorderly intervention and prolonging it.  If the Taoiseach or a Minister feels that he has been misrepresented I think he has procedures whereby he may make a personal explanation.</P>

      <P>I hope there will be reasonable expedition in putting this Bill through Committee Stage.  I do not disagree with referring it to the joint committee. On balance it is a good idea but I hope it will not prolong the processing of the Bill.  I would remind the House that I started this process in 1960 and here we are in 1984 referring the Bill to a committee.  Perhaps the examination of the Bill in detail by that process is the best way of dealing with it, but it should be expedited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in respect of this Bill.  The law in the matter of bankruptcy has been in need of review and updating for a considerable time.  I understand we are still operating under an Act of the UK Parliament which is more than 100 years old.  That system has not been working very well in recent years.</P>
      <P>In effect the joint committee will be taking the Committee Stage of the Bill. Obviously, that will involve the attendance of the Minister at the committee.  I make a special appeal to him to be available in so far as is possible within his schedule of commitments to assist the committee in their deliberations on what is a difficult and complex Bill.  It will be a test of the operation of this aspect of the committee system, a system which perhaps should be used on even a wider basis.  In this way complex measures of this nature are taken out of the House in full committee, so to speak, and dealt with in one of the committee rooms.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity also of making an appeal to any Member of the House or of the Seanad who would be prepared to assist the committee in their deliberations on this Bill to communicate either with the Clerk of the committee or with myself as Chairman.  Some Members may have a particular knowledge of this difficult area.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East</i>): Members who spoke during the Second Stage debate were in general agreement with the view I expressed that because the legislation is both complex and technical it would be better to refer the Committee Stage to the special committee.  It transpired that that committee in accordance with their terms of reference can open their proceedings to any Deputy in the House who has expertise in the area under discussion.  The legislation committee are the appropriate committee to deal with this Bill.  I should like the preliminary sitting of the committee to take place some time in the next couple of weeks and for our business to be completed in September.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;reference&rdquo; to insert the following words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" />&ldquo;and that the Committee be required to provide a record of its discussion on the proposals not later than December 31st, 1984.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment I am proposing is that the committee be required to provide a record of their discussions on the proposals not later than 31 December 1984.  We sought to place an amendment that the committee would be required to report back to the Dáil by that date but we were informed that that would be out of order and that all we could require the committee to do would be to put before us a record of their discussions.</P>
    <P>The whole question of postal voting has been put off for far too long, but it is necessary for the House to come to grips with the matter immediately.  I am not convinced of the necessity to refer the Minister's proposals to the committee. There have been a number of examinations of this whole matter over a number of years.  In 1974 the Dáil introduced postal voting for local government elections. One would assume therefore that the question of postal voting and the form it should take was dealt with in some detail at that time.</P>
    <P>When I proposed a Private Members' Bill some months ago the Minister for the Environment indicated that proposals were ready and that it was only a matter of some short time before they would be before the House.  Prior to the EEC elections someone, presumably the Minister, floated the rumour that the proposals would be introduced before the EEC elections.  The Minister argues that there is a need to allow time, that we should not put a limit on the time for these discussions by the special committee and that there would be ample time for various bodies to make submissions.</P>
    <P>There is a report of the working party on the register of electors, and that dealt in some detail also with the question of postal voting.  Some 47 local authorities made submissions to that working party as did all of the political parties here.  The Irish Wheelchair Association, the Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped, <Col N="978" /> the Waterford Local Health Committee and the Western Health Board all made submissions to that body on the question of postal voting.</P>
    <P>I consider the issue to have been played around with for far too long.  We have just agreed a motion that the Bankruptcy Bill be dealt with by the special committee. The Minister for Justice indicated a wish to have that work completed by September, so clearly the Bankruptcy Bill will be given priority over the proposals for postal voting.  I am anxious that the committee deal with the postal voting matter as quickly as possible, and that by the time the Dáil resumes after the Christmas Recess we will be discussing the legislation to introduce the appropriate Bill.  For that reason I ask the proposer of the motion to accept my amendment and so ensure that the committee deal with this matter as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are fully in favour of extending the postal vote to categories of persons who, for one reason or another, are unable to be present at the polling station to cast their vote during elections.  To facilitate the extension of the postal vote to categories of that kind the former Minister, Deputy Burke, set up a committee which reported in March 1983.  The report was entitled <i>Report of the Working Party on the Register of Electors.</i> In that report positive proposals were made for the extension of the postal vote to the categories of persons that spokespeople in this House have agreed should have the postal vote.  That has been put on the record on numerous occasions over the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are opposed to this motion for several reasons and the amendment does not make much sense either.  There is no necessity to refer this matter to another committee.  It has already been expertly examined and reported on by the group set up by Deputy Burke when he was Minister.  The House has already debated that report.  During the course of that debate the Minister gave an assurance that he would take all the views expressed <Col N="979" /> in the debate into consideration and would bring forward legislative proposals as soon as possible to extend the postal vote.  He did not do that.  He made that promise in April 1983.  At that time we were told the reason why the matter was being brought before the House so soon after the publication of the report was to enable the Minister to prepare legislation in time for the elections which were due to be held in 1984.  The Minister said that those elections were the local and European elections.  We know that the Minister has since postponed the local elections but the European election has come and gone.  We have not seen the legislation to extend the postal vote to the handicapped, disabled and other categories of people.</P>
    <P>This motion is a complete farce and a sham.  It is an attempt on the part of the Government to hoodwink those people who were denied a vote in the European election and an attempt to try to show that the Government are concerned about them and intend to do something and that by referring it to the committee the Government's good intentions are being made clear.  There is no such intention. The Government denied these people the right to vote in a recent election. Obviously they have been so embarrassed over the outcry against their inactivity in relation to this legislation that they have thought up this device.  This is a public relations exercise and a suggestion from the handlers about how to get a message out to the community that the Government are concerned about extending the postal vote.  They have failed to fulfil the commitments they made.  They failed to implement the suggestions in the report of the committee established by Fianna Fáil.  There was adequate time to prepare the legislation. We indicated our desire to see that legislation and assured the Minister of our fullest support for the legislation.  There is no way he would have delayed it.</P>
    <P>This motion has no meaning whatever in our eyes when we look at the facts, the insincerity of the Government and the false promises they made in the House. Are we to accept anything from the <Col N="980" /> mouths of Ministers in debates?  The Dáil record contains the commitments made by the Minister for the Environment when replying to the debate on that report over a year ago.  Nothing was done.  The election came and went and these people were denied what the House had agreed should be given to them: the opportunity to vote.  What is the point in referring it to this John Bruton-established, toothless committee of the Oireachtas?</P>

      <P>Leader of the House or whatever his grand title is.  This committee has been condemned by the members of the committee as being useless and toothless.  It is not in a position to make positive recommendations.  All it can do is receive submissions and suggestions and consider them.  It cannot make any positive recommendations.  The Minister does not have to heed it.  It is a time-wasting exercise to suggest that this motion would be of assistance in advancing the cause of the people who have been deprived of their right to vote because of their circumstances.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Spring as Minister for the Environment was speaking on the motion to consider the report of the working party on 21 April 1983 he said:</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing these views and, again, I assure the House that all views forthcoming from Members will be carefully weighed.</P>
      <P>It was taken for granted they would be considered and that they would assist the Minister in formulating legislation to extend the postal vote.  When replying to the debate the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Quinn, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the contrary, it should be said that we face elections in May and it is desirable that we attempt to be in a position to implement whatever changes we in this House agree on in time for those elections.  Therefore an earlier debate was considered preferable <Col N="981" /> to postponing it....  I am talking about the European and local elections for 1984.  There is no ulterior motive in relation to the timing of this debate. We are anxious to hear the views of all Members as soon as possible and I assure Deputies that everything that has been said during this debate will be evaluated in conjunction with the recommendations of the report.</P>
    <P>Evaluated for what purpose?  That was over 12 months ago.  The Minister wanted it debated in the House so that it would assist him to formulate legislation.</P>

      <P>It is the Official Report dated 21 April 1983, column 1618.  Later on he stated:</P>
      <P>We are all anxious that the system be put right.  Experience of the last three elections indicated a wide range of anomalies and much dissatisfaction with the system.  People in all of the political parties especially in urban areas were aware that there were grave inaccuracies and that something would have to be done to put the matter right.</P>
      <P>The working party established by my predecessor, Deputy Burke, did a lot of good work.  I am now giving the undertaking to the House that we will evaluate carefully all the points made in the debate in conjunction with the recommendations of the report.</P>
      <P>The report dealt with the extension of postal voting and the improvement in access to polling booths for invalids.  The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>It would be our desire and our intention to come back to the House as soon as as possible with legislative proposals should such be necessary and with regulations designed to ensure that those who are entitled to vote are given every opportunity to do so and the accuracy of the register is maintained at the highest level possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also dealt with inaccuracies in <Col N="982" /> the register.  The recommendations made by the committee were extensive.  It recommended that a standing list of eligible postal voters should be prepared each year when the register of electors was being compiled and that persons on the list would be entitled to vote by post only at an election; that applications for inclusion on the postal voters list should be open to registered electors who are physically disabled or who are prevented from voting in person by the circumstances of their occupation; that applications for inclusion on the postal voters list should be supported by medical or employment certification as appropriate.</P>
    <P>They were some of the recommendations made in regard to the extension of postal vote by that committee.  This has already been debated in the House.  We have had the assurance of two Ministers that following the debate action would be taken to bring forward legislative proposals. That is over 12 months ago and we have not yet seen the legislation. Worse still, we are being asked this morning to refer proposals for legislation of the Minister for the Environment in relation to postal voting to the Joint Committee on Legislation.  We have not seen the proposals, there are none before the House and the Joint Committee on Legislation have no power to make any recommendations. If there is any doubt about that, I need only quote from the Joint Committee on Legislation's report for 3 November 1983, at column 64, Deputy O'Malley states:</P>
    <P>I believe it is correct to say, from the discussion that took place at the last meeting of this committee, that it was the understanding of the great majority of the members that we had a function something on the lines of committees in, for example, the United States Congress. Indeed, the publicity given at the time in newspapers and statements made by the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Industry and Energy led one to believe that.</P>
    <P>Later at column 65, Deputy O'Malley says:</P>
    <P>This committee is, in fact, a powerless <Col N="983" /> body.  Where the gathering of evidence is concerned, that could easily be done by the clerk on his own.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny, at column 69, states:</P>
    <P>This is most disappointing.  I may have misunderstood, but I had assumed that on the setting up of this committee it would have a decent role in the formation of legislation to go before the House.  I am afraid that I have to agree with Deputy O'Malley that under the terms of reference applied to us and the interpretation of those, that does not seem to be the case.</P>

According to the documentation I have read, we cannot deliberate or report.  The functions left to the committee could be carried out by a clerk without the committee being involved.</P>

Those were the only changes that were made. They can keep a record of the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee have been asked by the House this morning to consider proposals which the House has not seen. While any development on the road to legislation for postal voting by the Government is to be welcomed, nevertheless this must be a qualified welcome. The most obvious questions that arise in the motion before the House today are where are the proposals for legislation? <Col N="984" /> How can the House agree to consider something which it has not seen?  No proposals have been published.  How can the House agree to refer proposals if it is not aware of, or in possession of such proposals? As far as I am aware, the procedure being adopted by this committee is relatively new and was used only once before in connection with the local radio proposals and, in effect, the proposals represent a pre-legislation stage, as it were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows what happened then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, the House should not be asked to co-operate in a vacuum.  At the very least, the Government could have made copies of the proposals before the House for the information of Members.  This would have appeared to be a minimum requirement for courtesy to the Members of the House.  As shadow spokesman, I should have been made aware of the contents of the proposals.  The procedure which the House is being asked to sanction here today is in stark contrast to the usual referral of Bills to committees, where the Bill itself is before the House having passed Second Stage.  Consequently, the House is fully aware of its contents and the policy implications in referring the Bill to a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This leads me to my next point.  What is the purpose of referring these proposals to the Joint Legislation Committee? Are there any policy ramifications in these?  Is it a bona fide attempt by the Government to expedite the introduction and passing of such legislation by means of achieving a consensus at the initial stage, thereby allowing the committee to have a real input into the drafting of the Bill; or is it a more sinister exercise on the part of the Government to sidestep this vital issue so that any arrangements for postal voting will not be enacted in time for next year's local elections?  If one considers what happened when proposals for legislation were referred to this committee last year, namely on the local radio, one cannot help but suspect the Government's motives in this exercise. <Col N="985" /> What happened in the local radio proposal is no secret and was widely discussed in the record of the meetings of that committee.  I have already quoted some of this.  Also, my party colleagues who are members of that committee have kept me abreast of their basic handicap in dealing with radio proposals.  When the proposals for legislation concerning local radio were referred to the Committee on Legislation the members found, much to their dismay, that with the best will in the world they were prevented by their terms of reference &mdash; which they tried to get changed with little or no success &mdash; from making recommendations on the Government's proposals or even reporting to the House on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will accept that my special interest and responsibility here are in regard to environment legislation, and the handling of the extension of postal voting is a matter for the Minister of the Environment who, unfortunately again, is not here.  I have to fulfil my duties in the matter on behalf of my party as we see them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee are debarred even from reporting to the House on any recommendations which they would wish to make.  All they are empowered to do is to provide a record of their discussions and the oral submissions heard in respect <Col N="986" /> of the proposals.  It must be said to that committee's credit, that they made the best of a bad job in that the record of their discussions was highly regarded as being very informative.  Nevertheless that was the only positive result.  The Minister is not obliged even to pay heed to any of the points made at these discussions.  He does not even have to take them on board in his Bill to be brought before the House subsequently.  Even though the Committee on Legislation finished their proposals for local radio last February, the Government still have not produced their local radio Bill.  Is that correct?  Nobody can deny it.  Here again, this is a purely PR exercise, a bit of a farce, doing something clever, making a bit of a fuss about it &mdash;&ldquo;It would look as if we are doing something about postal voting and the public out there would not really understand the fine print.  They do not understand how these things work and if we get a headline it will look OK&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our job is to read behind the headlines and expose the thinking behind the Government's actions and decisions. This is an extremely blatant attempt on the Government's part to cover up for their inactivity in their failure to give the postal vote to a very deserving category of citizen.  They were told at the doors when campaigning what the people thought about them for refusing to extend the postal vote.  There was no excuse that this Government could offer to any person in a wheelchair as to why he had not a postal vote in the European Election, no excuse in the wide world. They are now seeking to create the impression that they are doing something for these people in the hope that they will not really understand all the goings on in the Dáil, that if they see that a committee are to consider postal voting they will think that the Government are doing something about it and will forget their inactivity; that they will forget that Fianna Fáil set up a committee which have already reported on the need to extend the postal vote.  That report was debated here over 12 months ago and, despite promises to bring in legislation, nothing was done by the Government. They are guilty on this issue.  In view of <Col N="987" /> the experience of this committee with the local radio proposals, I must ask: what is the purpose of referring postal voting proposals to that committee now?  It is clearly not to achieve an all-party consensus which, in any event, the committee are prevented from putting into effect.  It is the intention that we will be still waiting for the Government to produce their Bill in a year's time as with local radio?  The Government should prepare and introduce their Bill forthwith and not bother this House with what, in effect, is a sham exercise in that it would appear that the only function of this referral is for the committee to gather information on the proposals.</P>
    <P>All the necessary information is contained in this excellent document which was prepared by people with a special expertise in the field, whose proposals were debated by the elected representatives in this House, and who have vast practical experience of the democratic system.  I cannot see any need to gather further information to submit to a committee of the Oireachtas for them to look at and consider and discuss, and they will not be allowed to make any recommendations.</P>
    <P>Why should we bother the same people who already submitted proposals and suggestions to the committee set up by the then Minister, Deputy Burke?  Why should we put another advertisement in the newspapers inviting them to make submissions all over again?  Deputy De Rossa went through the names of some of the organisations who have already made submissions on these matters to the previous committee set up by Deputy Burke.  The list is long and extensive.  He is correct in saying it includes all the political parties.  It includes nearly every local authority in the country.  It includes all sorts of organisations representing handicapped and disabled people.  It includes people with practical knowledge and experience, and with responsibility for running elections such as returning officers, county registrars, sheriffs, and so on, and a number of other associations and organisations, and even Government Departments.  This is a very extensive, <Col N="988" /> very thorough, very worthwhile and excellent document.  It was fully debated in the Dáil and no action was taken on it. Now we are to have the same procedure initiated by the Government as an exercise to hoodwink the people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, in case my criticisms of this motion might be misconstrued as an attack on the committees of the House, I want to put it on record that I believe, generally speaking, committees are useful and can play a constructive part in developing policy by consensus.  As chairman of one committee engaged in such a constructive exercise, I am well aware of the value of the committee system.  In this case I am afraid I have to draw the line, especially in view of the previous experience of this committee with local radio and its lack of real power to deal with the issue involved, and especially in view of the fact that we have had full and adequate discussion.  We have had an expert report on it.  We have had practical experience of the 1974 postal vote extension during the local elections which should have been repeated in 1979 and should form the basis for an extension of permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>On the question of the amendment, I can see the good intentions behind it if The Workers' Party feel they should accept this motion.  We feel it is a useless exercise, that it is a delaying tactic and part of a public relations exercise by the Government to seek to create an impression, and to cover up their inactivity and their failure in this whole area.  The operative date in regard to compiling the register of electors is 15 September when work must start on compiling the revision. The draft register has to be published by 15 December next.  A month up to 15 January is given for the receipt of submissions and appeals for inclusion and the exclusion of people improperly included.  Officially the register comes into force on 15 April next.  If the committee were to make available a record of its discussions by the end of December, it would be too late for inclusion in the draft register.</P>
    <P>We submit there is absolutely no need for any committee of this House to discuss these matters.  It seems to me there <Col N="989" /> is general agreement on all sides that the postal vote should be extended.  We have the practical administrative experience of the 1974 postal vote extension during the local elections.  It is merely a matter of getting the mechanics right.  That can easily be done by the parliamentary draftsman and the technical people in the Department of the Environment.  I cannot see any great difficulty.  No objection in principle has been expressed in any of the debates we have had to a generous extension of the postal vote.  Therefore, I cannot see any sense in the committee reviewing this matter, and I cannot see any sense in the amendment which would require the committee to make a report by the end of December.  If they were to report by that date, it would be too late to have postal voters included in the draft register of electors.  There is a statutory obligation on the local authorities to have them published by 15 December.  Therefore, the date in the amendment would not make much sense.</P>
    <P>This House is about to go into recess. It is not usual for committees of the House to meet during the recess, and certainly not during July or August.  This committee have not been notified yet. The Dáil has not referred the matter to them.  I presume that, with their majority, the Government will force this through.  I do not know what business the committee have on their agenda at present. Assuming they have other business they will not be able to consider the proposal for the extension of the postal vote before October.</P>
    <P>Committees meet once a week or once a fortnight.  I do not know how often this committee meet.  Even if they meet for an hour or an hour and a half, it would require several meetings over a period of several weeks to deal with the matter, and I could see their deliberations continuing on well after Christmas, well after the date for the final acceptance of proposals and appeals against the published statutory list of voters.</P>
    <P>To me this is proof that the Government's purpose in putting this motion before the House is to enable them to do nothing.  In effect, that is what this motion will do.  There is no need for it.  If <Col N="990" /> the Government had a serious commitment and intention to bring in legislation to extend the postal vote, they could set about preparing a Bill which they promised to do 12 months ago and bring the Bill before the House and let us discuss it.</P>

I would not want anybody to try to take advantage of that and try to create the impression that we are not in support of an extension of postal voting.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not replying to the motion.  I merely wish to refer to some point made by Deputy Molloy in regard to the Committee on Legislation.  The first point I want to make is that the terms of reference of the committee were agreed in detail with the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  If the Deputy's party wanted to have the terms of reference altered, they had the opportunity to make that point at that stage.  It was quite clear to me that Deputy Haughey, speaking on behalf of Fianna Fáil did not want this term of reference, IA, under which this matter will be dealt with, to be any wider than it is.  He felt &mdash; and it is not an unreasonable point of view &mdash; that if a committee were holding hearings on a matter before that matter was the subject of legislation which had been debated in this House, in a sense the committee would be arrogating to themselves a function of the House as a whole in making decisions about matters that had not been the subject of debate and decision in the House: hence the term of reference of the committee in regard to the holding of hearings.  While it allows the committee to consider a matter and provide a record of their debates, it does not allow them to make <Col N="992" /> decisions on that matter.  The decisions fall to be made in the normal way as the debate on the Bill proceeds through the House subsequently.  Obviously, the value of the hearings is that it will be a more informed debate.  In particular, the contributions of members of the committee will be more relevant because they will have had hearings at which they were able to cross-examine outside experts.</P>
      <P>The committee have many other functions. It would be wrong for the Deputy to seek to present them in an unfavourable light solely by reference to this single function.  The committee have a number of other functions that they are performing quite effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>This motion does not need to be discussed in a partisan way and I would not have thought of saying anything partisan were it not that Deputy Molloy introduced that note quite needlessly, not once but several times.  The party for whom he is the spokesman in this area have only two achievements to their credit in the electoral area that I can call to mind off the top of my head.  One was the futile 1963 Electoral Act which set up the panoply of a register of political parties which has no function other than to adjudicate on something, the effect of which is to permit somebody to enter the name of his party after his own name on a ballot paper.  That has cost the State hundreds of thousands of pounds in futile litigation in the past 20 years with every person who felt he was being done in the eye by this register of political parties.</P>
      <P>The other achievement &mdash; not so much an achievement as two brave efforts &mdash; was to get the Irish people to adopt the English voting system.  This happened in 1959 but, not satisfied with the stinging rebuff they were given on the same day as the people elected Mr. de Valera to the Presidency, they tried again in 1968. It is getting to the time for them to have a third go at it.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that if they <Col N="993" /> were back on this side of the House there would be wise old heads in Fianna Fáil saying it was about time they put it to the people again.  Their attitude would be that many of the people who voted them down in 1959 have died, that they could recycle the old lies and the old arguments.

On the figures of those days that would have left 130 Fianna Fáil Deputies and as many other Deputies as you could put into a mini-bus.  It would have cemented himself and his pals and their children in Dáil seats.  That is the record of Fianna Fáil on electoral law.  It comes ill from them to harangue us about how they have been straining at the leash for the past 60 years to let disabled people vote, that they have been restrained only by the lethargy and malice of the Opposition from giving the rights of citizens to people whose physical misfortune it is not to be able to exercise them in the ordinary way.  I have said enough about that.  We do not want to <Col N="994" /> hear any more partisan rubbish and nonsense.

      <P>Once the Minister's proposals are before the committee, they will be able to look at them in somewhat wider frame and consider the objective to which all of us subscribe, namely, of allowing disabled people to vote.  It is not only disabled people who might be considered but those who may be engaged on State service abroad or in some part of the country other than that area where they are registered as electors or perhaps even those on their holidays.  The committee might consider if those people will be allowed to exercise the privilege of a citizen in electing a person to the Dáil or to the local authority by some method that perhaps is not open to the abuses to which we are told the postal vote is liable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the postal vote extension in 1974 in respect of local elections that year.  It was Jim Tully who was responsible for that experiment and I understood it had not worked very well. I am not an expert on it and I am willing to be contradicted by anyone who thinks otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard it said that the system was abused.  If the system of postal voting is inherently open to abuse, I think <Col N="995" /> the Minister's idea of sending this proposal to the Joint Committee on Legislation is correct.  They will be able to discuss the possibility of having some other system which would save disabled people the necessity of physically presenting themselves at the polling station.</P>
      <P>Two alternative systems come to mind, one of which is operated in parts of Europe.  One system which I admit could be open to abuse unless hedged around is the system of proxy voting.  It is not unthinkable.  I can see the abuses to which it might be open but I should like the Joint Committee on Legislation to spend a little time considering if there was any future in exploring the possibility of a system of proxy voting.  In that system elector X, disabled from attending in person, could authorise elector Y to cast his vote for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The other system which operates in some parts of Europe is that of pre-voting: in other words, between the close of nominations, when the lists of candidates were finalised and it was possible to print a ballot paper, and polling, it would be possible for somebody in a proper procedure to cast his vote in advance of polling day, perhaps by making a statutory declaration and giving his vote, appropriately sealed, to the returning officer who is generally the county registrar and a trustworthy person with access to some minimal measures of security.</P>
      <P>Voting in advance is done on the islands.  That is not strange to us, but it is done in the ordinary way at a polling station.  We could arrange for voting in advance, perhaps ten days after the close of nominations.  In this system an elector who was going to be away on polling day could present himself to the returning officer, or a physically disabled person could be attended in his own home or institution by the returning officer or his official, who would keep the vote in proper conditions of security in order to be counted with the general vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Legislation will consider the matter of postal voting if it is the decision of this House and the Seanad to refer to them proposals with regard to legislation and will, of course, carry out any mandate which is given to it by the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with its orders of reference.  However, I have reservations as to whether the committee could have a worthwhile or major role in this field at this stage.  The procedure under orders or reference 1 (a) under which the committee would operate seems to be appropriate to a situation where various sectional public interests are involved, where communication has to be made by advertisement or whatever to those sectional interests to probe and investigate their views, to find out what they are, and to have a record of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That perhaps was appropriate to the question of local radio where one could visualise a wide spectrum of opinion as to what would be appropriate.  However, I cannot see that there would be any great sectional interests, disputes, partisan disputes or political party disputes on an issue of this nature.  It is a very simple, basic issue and I am sure everybody agrees that the disabled should have a postal vote.  It requires some examination and thought as far as the <i>modus operandi</i> and the mechanism under which it would work would be required, but it is quite clear that that has been adequately done. I admit I have not read the reports but, from descriptions, it is clear that that preparatory work has been done.  The reason for having a further investigation on the investigation escapes me.  Another aspect of the Joint Committee on Legislation, particularly as far as the reports of the Law Reform Commission are concerned, also puzzles me.  I do not know whether Deputy Haughey concurred with it or not but, for some reason, one of the specific terms of reference gave a brief to the committee to examine the reports of the Law Reform Commission. The reason for that also escapes me, <Col N="997" /> because I would have thought that we had enough serious issues to be dealt with without having reports on the reports. There was an investigation carried out at great expense by the Law Reform Commission. Surely it should be a matter for the Government to either accept or reject the report and to put it before the Joint Committee on Legislation?  Doing a report on the report cannot put the matter any further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the terms of reference under item 1 (a) of the orders of reference of the Joint Committee on Legislation and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism referred to the fact that we could not have a situation whereby this committee could make decisions and arrogate the powers of this House which, of course, make the decisions.  He is perfectly correct, but that is not really the point.  Those members of the committee, some of whom were quoted by Deputy Molloy, were not suggesting that the committee should have the power to make decisions.  They thought they should have powers to make recommendations.  The distinction must surely be seen between the power to make a recommendation and the power to make a decision.  A recommendation is something that a committee could reasonably do having spent many hours hearing witnesses and evidence and discussing the matter among themselves.  Of course it would be open to the House not to accept the recommendations.  The House in its wider wisdom, having had an opportunity to look at the evidence, could disagree with the recommendation and deal with it accordingly, just as the House on Committee Stage may decide one thing which can be reversed on Report Stage.  There is a widespread feeling among many, if not most, members of the committee that the operation of the committee under the order of reference leaves a lot to be desired.  Members of the committee, of course, were not consulted about the nature of the terms of reference &mdash; that came from the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; but there is a feeling among committee members that their role is less than adequate as far as that section is concerned.  One could visualise <Col N="998" /> a role where it would be necessary to consult with a broad, wide spectrum of public interests and hear what they have to say.  As far as this item is concerned it is hard to see the necessity for yet a further examination of a relatively simple and straightforward measure which already has had a fair degree of public examination and a report prepared on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly suggested that the committee might look at other methods, perhaps proxy voting and so on, but that would not be within the terms of the motion now before the House, which confines the committee to examining the proposals for legislation in relation to postal voting.  I cannot see how they can go beyond that.  Having said that, if the decision of the House is that the Joint Committee on Legislation should look at these proposals, then, as chairman and speaking for all members, if the task is assigned to them they will perform to the best of their ability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore the fact that postal voting was not made available many years ago for the disabled and other people who are inconvenienced at election times.  I find the whinging and whining of Deputy Molloy and his public posturing in this regard particularly lacking in credibility considering his party's record in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I want to make two points about the proposals that the matter should be referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation.  The terms of the proposal seem to be worthwhile subject to one condition only: that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Kavanagh &mdash; and his predecessor, Deputy Spring, promised legislation in this area through his Minister of State, Deputy Quinn &mdash; rather than referring heads of a Bill to the committee, such as we received in the context of the local radio legislation, or sending us a note of what he is proposing, should make available to the committee a draft Bill.  That would facilitate the committee and speed up the legislative process.  The draft Bill should come within the terms of a proposal.  I see great merit in the Minister using that procedure. The last Minister, and the present <Col N="999" /> office holder, have had a considerable time to consider this issue.  I hope their proposals, by way of a draft Bill, are made available to the Committee during the next two weeks.  There was a reference to the fact that the Committee will examine the proposals but there is not any statement as to when they will receive them.  A draft Bill on this issue should be sent by the Department of the Environment to the committee in the next two weeks.  It must be remembered that Dáil committees will be sitting in the months of July and September and the Committee on Legislation should not be any exception.</P>
    <P>If we receive a draft Bill from the Minister for the Environment by the second week in July there is no reason why we cannot consider it then, look for public comment and submissions on it, and consider those submissions in September. There is no reason why we should not be in a position to produce a report to the House, not by December as was suggested by Deputy De Rossa but by October. If we succeed in doing that we will have speeded up the legislative process. The Minister, and the Government, would then be in a position of having had a draft Bill subjected to public debate and the worries of the general public and Members of the Oireachtas will have been aired.  In those circumstances there is no reason why the Minister for the Environment should not be in a position to introduce the necessary enabling legislation before Christmas.  It could be dealt with by the House speedily so that when the local government elections are held next year those who were excluded from voting in the European elections, the disabled and others, will be included in the register of electors.  I hope the matter is dealt with in this way.</P>
    <P>The approach I have suggested is more constructive than that suggested by Deputy Molloy.  In formally opposing the motion Deputy Molloy in effect is saying that the House, or any commitee of the House, should not do anything about this issue while the House is in recess.  He is saying that we should sit back until October and ignore this issue.</P>

      <P>I am saddened by the remarks of Deputy Shatter.  If one looks at his recent speeches one will see that the same narkiness runs throughout them all.  If Deputy Shatter was sincere in his observations he should have been calling for the introduction of the Bill in the House this week.  We are all aware that many Bills were dealt with speedily in the House this week.  All Members agree that there is no political division on this issue. As Deputy Taylor said, all that is needed is the <i>modus operandi</i> to deal with this issue.  One gets annoyed and frustrated at the carping remarks made by Deputy Shatter who should insist that the Leader of his party put the proposals before the House and have them passed.</P>
      <P>As a member of the committee I do not want to sit for hours interviewing people who have already been interviewed. We are all aware of the position, and had Deputy Shatter gone to the trouble of reading the report he would realise that many people and organisations made submissions.  Deputy Molloy has already listed the organisations representing the disabled that made submissions. We would all like to see this legislation before the House and not dealt with by a committee who will have to waste time and money on it, like occurred in regard to the legislation on local radio. We sat for hours on the committee dealing with local radio interviewing people who had already been interviewed and tendered submissions to the Minister of State at the Department of Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way to speed up this legislation is to bring it before the House now and not send it to a committee who must commence the interviewing process.  Irrespective of what Deputy Shatter says, with the best will in the world that Committee will not be in a position to bring recommendations to the House in October. As Deputy Taylor pointed out the committee will not be permitted to make <Col N="1002" /> recommendations.  It will be the duty of the committee to gather all available information and present it in the form of a report.  That is an utter waste of time. We are all aware of what needs to be done.  The report has been dealt with in detail and recommendations have been put forward.  It is now up to the Minister to prepare the legislation.  I should like to assure him that as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned he will get full co-operation in having the legislation dealt with speedily in the House.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the report was presented to the Minister in March 1983 and if its recommendations had been acted on the disabled, and others, would have been able to vote in the European elections.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Shatter that it was a Fianna Fáil Minister for the Environment, Deputy Ray Burke, who established the committee to deal with this issue.  It is 15 months since that report was issued but it is now being sent to another committee for further consideration.  That is a waste of time and money.  It is farcical.  I oppose the motion but I am not opposed to the principle involved.  We are opposed to the waste of time that is involved.  The legislation should not be postponed.  Instead of discussing this motion we should be considering a Bill to deal with this issue.</P>

      <P>I had the benefit of listening on the monitor to Deputy Calleary's remarks.  It is a pity that Deputies are reluctant to have committees such as the Committee on Legislation deal with business, particularly something as difficult as the question of postal voting.  We are all aware that there were abuses when postal voting was in operation for disabled persons.</P>

      <P>We all share the view that persons who are disabled should be facilitated. If this matter goes before the committee it will afford an opportunity to interested parties to come and discuss it. I cannot understand why Deputies opposite object to that.  This House will rise this week or early next week but the Committee on Legislation will meet throughout the summer months and any problems in relation to this matter can be teased out and resolved.  It is in the interests of everybody that this should happen. There is no likelihood of an election or referendum until the local elections are held next year.  Deputy Calleary is a member of that committee and if we put in the necessary work we will be in a position to report to this House when it resumes in October.  There will be plenty of time to put through the legislation and ensure that it is sensible and proper, unlike the earlier legislation which fell into disrepute because of abuses which undoubtedly took place.</P>

      <P>The Government are committed to the idea of postal voting for the disabled.  The proof is that it was the Coalition Government of the seventies who introduced the only legislation on our Statute Book to enable that to be achieved.  It is rather petty and silly of Deputy Molloy to infer that the care being taken in the preparation of this legislation and the proposals to refer it to the Committee on Legislation are an indication of a lack of willingness or enthusiasm on the part of the Government.  That is not so.  The Government are fully committed to the proposition that the disabled should be able to vote by post.  The Government are very concerned to ensure that the system devised will be, so far as man can make it, fool proof and abuse proof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous experiment failed <Col N="1004" /> because there was widespread dissatisfaction with its operation in practice and the widespread abuse.  The Bill introduced by the then Minister, Mr. Tully, was constructed as carefully as possible with a view to ensuring that there would be no abuse and that the system would work properly and effectively.  The Bill was debated fully and the Opposition spokesman was Deputy Molloy.  In spite of the accumulated wisdom of the Opposition and the Government they managed to let out from this House an Act which in its operation proved to be seriously defective and gave rise to considerable abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies should wait.  There was a widespread expression of dissatisfaction at the way the Act was abused on the one occasion it came into operation.  Notwithstanding that it was a carefully drafted piece of legislation, fully debated here by an experienced Minister and a former Minister on the Opposition benches, it proved unsatisfactory in operation.</P>
      <P>I refer Deputies to the report of the Working Party on the Register of Electors. It has been stated that because this report is in existence all that is necessary is for the Minister to adopt the recommendations and bring forward proposals and that there is no need for further examination of the recommendations.  It has been castigated by Deputies Taylor, Molloy and Calleary as a repetitious and unnecessary re-examination of matters already fully examined.  Paragraph 8.2 of the report states:</P>
      <P>The working party is not in a position to make a positive judgment on the level of abuse which occurred in 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems to indicate clearly that the <Col N="1005" /> working party, who were composed of people at official level, were not in a position because of lack of personal experience to make an assessment of the level of abuse which took place.  The people in the best position to make that assessment would be the politicians operating on the ground who would have seen and heard and maybe themselves abused the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, would the Minister mind if I asked a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a question at the end of the debate that may be permissible, but I want to finish.  Paragraph 8.2 also states:</P>
      <P>Experience in 1974 shows that the administrative difficulties in the operation of a postal voting system can be overcome.  The real problem arises out of the opportunities for abuse which an extended system of postal voting may provide.  The working party is not in a position to make a positive judgment on the level of abuse which occured in 1974.  As indicated, the number of prosecutions was small but many public representatives recorded the view that abuse was widespread and expressed strong reservations about the operation of the system.</P>
      <P>A footnote gives the numerous references in the Official Report of the proceedings of Dáil Éireann by Deputies referring to the extent of the abuse.  I am quite satisfied that Deputies were recounting their views accurately and I am not so naive as to believe that there was not abuse.  Any Deputy who had any experience at that time was aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely important that a system of postal voting should be devised which would be as free as possible from abuse. It is important that the integrity of the ballot should not be impugned after an election by any allegation of widespread abuse.  What has been proposed by the working party is a considerable extension of the postal voting system, and it is of paramount importance that the integrity of the ballot in the event of widespread postal voting should be beyond reproach <Col N="1006" /> and that there should be total satisfaction as to its being an accurate reflection of the wishes of the people.  That is the fundamental democratic principle.</P>
    <P>It is in order to implement that principle that the Minister is referring to proposals of the working party, who admit they are not in a position to give a judgment on the level of abuse, to a committee of experts who, from their perspective, would be able to give another point of view on this critical issue.  It is not a device to postpone decisions but it is essential to the validity of a postal voting system that it should be free from abuse. There must be a valuable contribution to be made by practicising politicians.  I will be very disappointed if the Committee on Legislation do not give this matter a lot of thought and bring to it the experience and expertise of individual members, bearing in mind that what we want is as foolproof a system as can be devised.</P>
    <P>The deliberations of the committee should not take long.  They will have, as the Deputy said, the report of the working party but they will have to look behind all that in the particular area to which I have referred.  The Minister will come to the committee but I do not think it is feasible to expect the Minister to bring a Bill to the Committee on Legislation. The correcting of a Bill is, in my opinion, consequent on the work of the committee.  The committee can have the draft report and bring their knowledge to bear with a view particularly to assisting the Minister in devising a scheme that will be free of abuse.  We have to bear in mind the experience of the past.  There is no way we can escape it, sweep it under the carpet, or greatly exaggerate it.  It happened and, because it happened, we must be careful to ensure it does not recur by extending the section to people who can attend personally to exercise it.</P>
    <P>On the question of time, I am not against the principle in the motion proposed by Deputy De Rossa that there should be a time limit and that the committee should report by a certain date. The only reservation is that the committee might possibly take the maximum time.  I am very anxious that the committee <Col N="1007" /> should report at the earliest possible moment.  Hopefully we could have the draft legislation before Christmas.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Molloy's point I would point out that members of his party will be on this committee and they will ensure that their contributions will be dealt with as a matter of urgency, that the recommendations will come back to the Minister at the earliest possible moment and that the Minister will then introduce the legislation as quickly as possible.  Referring the matter to the committee is not an effort to procrastinate. It is not a device to put legislation on the long finger.  It is inspired entirely and completely by an anxiety to ensure that the legislation so far as possible will be foolproof and abuse-proof.</P>
    <P>The 1974 legislation was debated here. But one has to say in regard to debates here that they are inclined to follow a certain ritual and often the depth of analysis that goes into the speeches is not sufficiently perceptive or acute at times to explore all the problems that may underlie what is being debated.  That certain type of ritual was followed in debating here in Committee.  I hope that will be overcome by a committee of Deputies and Senators sitting around the table and examining with a greater degree of analysis and a more acute approach to whatever problem there may be.  Some Deputies are embarrassed to find there were abuses of the 1974 Act.  The objective here &mdash; and I emphasise this again &mdash; is not about time, not about procrastination, not about delay.  It is designed purely to ensure that the legisation which emerges ultimately will be as effective as possible and foolproof in order to ensure the system of postal voting will not be discredited and that the integrity of the ballot and its results will not be impugned.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann noting:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the increasing social problems created by the breakdown of marriages, and</P>
      <P>(b) the specific undertaking given in the Fine Gael/Labour Joint Programme for Government that the Committee would report by the end of 1983,</P>
      <P>calls upon the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown to make its report not later than July 31st, 1984.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In debating the establishment of this Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown last year the point was made by the Minister at the time that clearly the committee could not report by December <Col N="1010" /> 1983 because it was being established in July of that year only.  The promise given in relation to divorce and marriage breakdown by the Fine Gael/Labour Parties in their Joint Programme for Government indicated that that committee would report by the end of 1983.  At that time the Government refused to accept our amendment that that timetable be adhered to.</P>
    <P>Now we are being asked to extend their period for reporting for a further six months, and my amendment requests that the timetable agreed last year be adhered to.  It is interesting to note that, as a result of the amendment we tabled, a news item appears in this morning's <i>The Irish Times</i> indicating that the committee propose to recommend various changes in relation to separation.  I suppose we should be thankful for that in itself.  But whilst those changes are very definitely required in our law, in the way in which separated couples are dealt with and the way people can gain separations, the very nub of the problem of marriage breakdown and the remedies available to people in that position appear to me to have been avoided by that committee. Very many submissions have been made to the committee in relation to marriage breakdown and the need for divorce legislation. I have made the point time and again to the committee, by way of submission, inside and outside this House that the first step that must be taken in order to deal adequately with this question is that of a constitutional change removing the ban on divorce.  It would appear to me, taking into account the number of submissions made to this committee, bearing in mind also that they have been sitting now for almost a year, that they should be now in a position to make a recommendation in relation to this key area of constitutional change.</P>
    <P>I suppose we should note that the original Terms of Reference proposed before the committee was established indicated that they would deal with the question of constitutional and legislative change but, when the final Terms of Reference were agreed, the reference to constitutional and legislative change had been removed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> I feel very strongly that this committee are not tackling the basic question in respect of which they were established. The establishment of the committee emanated from the very widespread concern about the absence of divorce legislation. At the time it was established, I expressed the view that it was an attempt simply to shunt the problem into a byroad and forget about it for another 12 months.  On this occasion my observations have been proven to be correct.  The promise was given in November 1982. We are now in June 1984 and we are told that the committee will not be in a position to report until December 1984 &mdash; two years in all in which to come to terms with a problem crying out for resolution. The problems of marriage breakdown and the remedies available to people finding themselves in that position will not be solved or advanced simply by burying our heads in the sand, refusing to accept the inevitable, that divorce legislation is required in very many cases.</P>
    <P>I accept fully that there are very many people in this country who will not avail-of the facility of divorce for various social and religious reasons, but that does not constitute any good ground for denying the right to those who feel they have a right to divorce.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment ensuring that the committee report in time, as agreed last year.</P>

      <P>I want to speak against this amendment.  I can understand the Deputy's frustrations and the reasons for him putting down his amendment, but I would ask him to bear with the committee and with the motion as tabled.  It is totally unrealistic to expect the amount of work that had to be done by this Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown to be completed in that short space of time. The statement about its establishment was released only on 24 June 1983 and it was quite some time after that before the committee began meeting.  It was one of the most important initiatives taken by this Government, and has proved to be more relevant than many people expected prior to its establishment.  The report is awaited with great interest.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to commend the chairman, Deputy O'Brien, on the manner in which he chaired the committee meetings and the members on the manner on which they are conducting their deliberations.  This is the proper way to approach a legislative programme in this area of human relations and conflict.  Nothing major has been done through the Dáil since 1976 on the whole area of material breakdown or family law reform.  At present law reform in regard to family and marriage is in a state of paralysis and requires great deliberation. I cannot see how the work of the committee could have been done more quickly and efficiently.  I would agree with the recommendation that there be an extension to December, and I feel that the report was well worth while.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of benefit to put on the record of the House what has been achieved so far by this committee and the difficulties under which they laboured. Most members of the committee hope that we will conclude our deliberations as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee, although established by resolution of the House in June 1983, only got around to commencing their work proper in December 1983 due to difficulties in obtaining staff.  Since <Col N="1013" /> December of 1983 they have had all the staff they require.  They acquired additional staff when it was necessary to do so.  So far this committee have received almost 700 written submissions from individuals, groups, organisations and religious bodies on the whole area of marriage and marital breakdown which comes within their terms of reference. They have heard 23 different groups and organisations, including representatives of many of the leading churches, by way of oral hearings.  Already in their discussions and decision-making process the committee have reviewed substantial areas of marital law many of which had not been dealt with or properly reviewed or debated in this House since the foundation of the State.  Their preliminary decisions have been referred to in the newspapers and are available to the public by way of the minutes of the committee.</P>
    <P>The committee have already made decisions on reforming the law in relation to the age of marriage and regarding the formalities of marriage.  They have dealt substantially with nullity law.  Yesterday evening they dealt in great detail with the law relating to judicial separation and many of the problems ancillary to marriage breakdown, such as maintenance, support, family property and custody of children.  This committee have in a very brief period reviewed a substantial area of family law.</P>
    <P>As a member of the committee I say &mdash; I do not think this is a contentious point because the committee were in agreement in regard to the time required &mdash; that I see no reason why this committee should not report to the House at the very latest by 1 December which the extension of time that has been granted to us allows.  I find Deputy De Rossa's amendment a little curious.  I understand that his anxiety and that of everybody outside this House is that the committee does not become a waffle shop, that they must be seen to be making decisions, recommending reforms and tackling areas that have long needed to be tackled by this House, and that they produce a substantial, coherent report that can provide the basis for legislative action.  To do <Col N="1014" /> that we on the committee must deal with a whole series of issues.</P>
    <P>The question of divorce and the dissolution of marriage is one of the issues the committee have within their terms of reference and which they will discuss in their July meetings.  That is the next item on the agenda.  I think that Deputy De Rossa and his party do not understand the length and breadth of the work being done by this committee and the needs in this area.  I say that more in sadness than in criticism because of their failure to comprehend fully the nature and importance of the work and the wide area that needs to be covered.  I do not mean to say this in a way that might distress Deputy De Rossa, but to some extent that was reflected in his party's written submission to the committee.  Deputy De Rossa's party also had an oral hearing from the committee and I think the Deputy would acknowledge that.  However, it seems that The Workers' Party believe that this is a very simple area that does not require great detail or much thought.  The submission that we received from The Workers' Party on marriage and marital breakdown ran to three and a half pages, half a page of which referred to resolutions passed at the Ard Fheis of The Workers' Party and virtually another page quoted an extract from F.S. Lyons's book entitled <i>Ireland Since the Famine.</i> The Workers' Party's submission did not deal with areas such as the need to provide proper education for marriage with State involvement in the educational process.  For example, it did not provide for the need for proper organised pre-marriage courses encouraged and, where possible, subsidised by the State.  It did not deal with the need for changes in the age of marriage, to which the committee have already agreed.  It did not deal with the provision of counselling services or family courts.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa's amendment talks about Dáil Éireann noting the increasing social problems created by the breakdown of marriage. His party seem to believe that the only issue in this area is whether we should have divorce.  I have no doubt that that is a very relevant and important issue which comes within the terms of reference of this committee, and this committee will discuss, debate and make decisions on it during the next couple of months.  Deputy De Rossa by putting the resolution in this form is doing it in a way that somehow suggests that either the Government are postponing tackling this problem or the Members of the committee representing all parties in the House are putting off tackling this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> The reforms that are to be made by this committee, the areas they are covering, are a great deal more involved and complex than the only issue Deputy De Rossa refers to.  That issue is important to many thousands of people in this country, and this House and the committee must face up to that, but we must deal with all the other areas that come within the committee's terms of reference.  The committee have now made decisions on substantial areas relating to marriage and marital breakdown which will require the Government of the day, this Government and the Ministers responsible, to introduce substantial legislation and substantial social reforms many of which will cost nothing and are very desirable.  Deputy De Rossa's suggestion that this should all be completed by the end of July might be realistic in the context of the minimal submissions his own party have to make in this area, but it is not realistic because of the comprehensive way this committee are dealing with this area.</P>
    <P>To put all this into context, before I was a Member of this House I criticised the Members for not tackling this issue. The terms of reference of this committee require the committee to recommend comprehensive reforms in the totality of the areas of marital laws and social services relating to marriage.  Having begun our work in December 1983 and expecting to complete it by December 1984 we will have spent 12 months in all on our deliberations.  In other countries where there are law systems similar to ours, law reform commissioners and other commissioners have taken from five to ten years to complete their deliberations. It is not correct for Deputy De Rossa to suggest that members of the committee are reluctant to tackle problems or are not making decisions.</P>

      <P>The Government are not running from the decision-making process. The committee have made considerable recommendations to date.  One would be far more impressed by the approach of The Workers' Party in this <Col N="1017" /> matter if their submissions had been a good deal more substantial.  I regard this type of political posturing by that party to be simply a self-seeking publicity exercise. They are not trying to solve problems or to tackle the question of marital breakdown.  Basically The Workers' Party are trying to use this motion to score political points at the expense of those who are victims of the tragedy of marital breakdown.</P>

When someone looks for substance behind their political postering, they have a problem.  What I have here represents the substance of their contribution to this area.  They think that by way of motions such as this they can fool the general public into believing they have a substantial contribution to make.</P>

      <P>There is no reason for our not completing our deliberations by 1 December.  The committee have been most constructive and one must pay tribute to all the participating parties.  We have had constructive discussions and have teased out various issues in a sensible and constructive way.  I am confident that the report of the committee will include a comprehensive programme recommending wide-ranging social and legal reforms that will demand a very swift legislative response.  Following the publication of the report I will be looking forward to the introduction of the appropriate legislation that will provide <Col N="1018" /> us with the system of family law this country requires as we approach the end of this century.  We must move away from the system of marital law which we inherited and which has remained largely unchanged since the last century.</P>

      <P>Lest anyone should think that not all members in all parties associated with the committee are not in support of the motion, I rise on behalf of Fianna Fáil to support the motion.  I am somewhat disappointed with Deputy Shatter's contribution in that I did not expect that in our discussions here we would in any way go into the substance of the submissions being made to the committee.  It was clearly understood by the participating members that most of these submissions were confidential.  I understood they were purely for reference purposes in helping the committee in their deliberations and that they would never be discussed here.  However, there are other aspects of the Deputy's contribution with which I wholeheartedly agree.</P>
      <P>There have not been any stalling tactics in so far as the committee are concerned. I join with the Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, in complimenting the chairman of the committee on the manner in which he has succeeded in keeping the committee to their task.  We are dealing with an area that is very difficult for many people and which will have a major effect on the lives of many future generations.  A considerable amount of time is needed to deal with this whole area.  It is an indication of the seriousness with which the public view the matter that there have been so many written submissions.  Some of these have been heartrending and some have been in great depth.  Some, too, have been skimpy.  There were others, and not only The Workers' Party, from whom we would have expected more but who did not take the interest that one would have expected them to take.  However, the committee have received a large number of well-thought out and researched submissions and these have been an enlightenment to many of us, even some of the so-called ultraconservatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> If the record were gone into in greater detail it would be understood clearly that this committee have met more times in the short time of their existence than have any other committee ever set up by the House.  Not only have a very large number of meetings been held but having regard to the other commitments of the participating members, the attendance has been remarkably good.  Not everyone found it possible to attend all the meetings because of their conflicting with other commitments and with the needs of other places but by and large the success rate in terms of attendance has been outstanding.  That is an aspect on which the members should be congratulated.</P>
    <P>It must be understood by the public generally that we are not talking merely of a question of whether to introduce legislation to enable a referendum to take place on whether to allow divorce in this jurisdiction.  As the members of the committee understood it, that was never the intention.  It forms part of their deliberations but the committee, and rightly so, regard it as their responsibility to act strictly in accordance with the terms of reference outlined in the Government order and agreed by this House in setting up the committee.  That concerns the whole area of the protection of the institution of marriage and the whole question of dealing in considerable detail with the reasons for the apparent breakdown in some marriages.  That includes an enormous range of subjects which must be dealt with at great length.</P>
    <P>Despite what seems to be suggested by some individuals the terms of reference are not narrow though perhaps that is the kind of publicity with which some would wish to surround the committee.  We are dealing with a whole range of social and economic issues and related problems and how they impinge on the institution of marriage.  I expect that when an agreed report is issued by the committee, it will include recommendations to up to half a dozen Departments in respect of reforms and that over a period of years, these various Departments, be they Education, Justice or any other, will be taking due note of a whole range of recommendations. <Col N="1020" /> We would have failed to deal adequately with the problem if there was not a concerted effort made by the various Departments to take note of these changes.  It is not necessary at this stage to go into details about the work of the committee.  That would be counterproductive.</P>
    <P>It has been slow in certain areas but that is due to the deliberations of the committee.  When we consider the large number of oral submissions the committee were prepared to hear we have an indication of the genuine interest of the members of the committee.  I was among those who pressed that as many as possible of the oral submissions should be heard.  We do not want to have a position in future where organisations who might have had a contribution to make would churn out something to the public which they were denied the opportunity of making to the committee.  It is very important to do the job well because of the complexity of the issue rather than to do it quickly to satisfy the sectional interests of any group in society.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am disappointed that Deputy De Rossa's party should seek to make capital from a publicity point of view out of what he sees as the apparent delay by this committee.  The length of time taken by the committee is an indication of the depth of discussion the members are prepared to give.  I wish to put on the record the fact that members of the committee, irrespective of their party, have made a great effort to do a good job on behalf of their parties and the public.  I hope no stalling tactic will be adopted by any party or individual in the committee.</P>

      <P>I look forward to the final report and recommendations of the committee. I understand why it has to be extended to 1 December 1984.  I hope it will be completed by that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right that this committee should concentrate on the social implications and the rights of the individuals within marriage and marriage breakdown.  I pay tribute to the members of the committee who met weekly and worked very hard. I also pay tribute to the staff who have <Col N="1021" /> endeavoured not only to produce the weekly work but the large amount of material needed for circulation to cover the number of written submissions received and who arranged for the oral submissions.</P>
    <P>We should not forget that this committee are dealing with one of the most urgent areas.  The fact that over 700 written submissions were received by the committee in the early stages shows the incredible need there was for such a committee. There is need for progress because, as Deputy Flynn said, of the heartbreaking tragedy and human damage that can be caused by delay.  Deputy Shatter said that in other countries law commissions have sat from five to ten years to deal with this area but we cannot afford that luxury because we are already ten years behind in even recognising the problem, much less having the courage to tackle it.  There is not a family, road or street which has not been affected by marriage breakdown.  We know that there are no legal or legislative procedures to cope with it much less a support or advice system.  None of us can feel comfortable that we have to extend the time for the committee to report until 1 December although we all accept the reason why this has to be so.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the staff and to the members who have compiled the report. I hope there will be no stalling with regard to facing up with honesty and courage, in an all-party sense, to all areas.  I hope we will not just deal with the recommendations we find easy.  We must grasp the nettle which we should have grasped long ago.  It has left this country with a legislative mess and human tragedy which we, as legislators, must feel ashamed of.  I should like to think we will not add to the sense of disillusionment and disappointment experienced by those in these intolerable situations nor to the cynicism of an electorate in regard to the treatment given to this committee and its recommendations by the House.  We must take up their recommendations urgently and with courage.  We must not allow this situation to continue.  It should have been repaired <Col N="1022" /> long ago.  I look forward to the recommendations of the committee and to the legislators in this House facing up to the problem as they should have done long ago.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to thank members of the committee. I was appointed as chairman and confess I had doubts about how an all-party committee would work.  I am proud to say that I found all parties committed to the people who need our help.  The political hats were left outside the door.  It is a pity this amendment has been put down.  It is bad to try to give the impression that any party is the conscience of the nation.  That attitude did not exist in our committee.</P>
      <P>We are very grateful to those who sent in written submissions.  There were approximately 700 of them.  I place on record our appreciation of their interest in society and their recognition of the great value of such a committee.  We are also grateful to the many people who travelled long distances to make oral submissions. It is nice to come before a committee and make an oral submission knowing that your views will be recorded verbatim and that everything will be on record.  I sincerely hope that when we have completed our deliberations our report will be acceptable at least to the vast majority of people and that we will be recognised as a committee which did their utmost to help the people who needed help.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Keating, I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Report of the Committee on Public Expenditure: Proposal to establish a <Col N="1024" /> centralised State agency for persons registering for employment or training.</P>
    <P>This is the second report of the Committee on Public Expenditure since we first met in September 1983.  Our first report last February on recruitment by the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission highlighted an unacceptable situation whereby costly Civil Service competitions were being held, in some cases with thousands of applicants, following which the actual number of vacancies filled was in single figures.  The committee are glad to note that the Minister for the Public Service, who welcomed the committee's report, has since taken action on the report's recommendations and the saving involved will, I understand, be considerable. I mention this by way of illustrating that the Committee on Public Expenditure are dealing with issues of immediate concern to the public and on which there is a virtual guarantee that appropriate corrective action will be taken where it is found necessary.  It is our intention that there will also be immediate follow-through on all further reports.  The committee now have a well-established system for monitoring recommendations in all cases.</P>
    <P>The committee's second report, which is the subject of today's debate, is entitled &ldquo;Proposal to establish a centralised State agency for persons registering for employment or training&rdquo;.  Before I summarise the main points in the report, I would remind the House of the committee's terms of reference: To review the justification for ineffectiveness of ongoing expenditure in Government Departments and offices and of non-commercial State bodies in such areas as it may select and to report thereon to the House recommending cost-effective alternatives and the elimination of obsolete programmes where desirable.</P>
    <P>The committee's programme for reviewing Departments and State bodies falling within our terms of reference is now well under way and we expect to produce a formal report in our detailed examination of the Department of the Public Service in the near future.  We <Col N="1025" /> have retained the services of a consultant to assist in this very important work and we feel that this review will provide a bench mark for all the reviews which will follow.  Apart from the ongoing review of the Department and agencies, the committee decided at the outset that specific areas of public expenditure which warranted urgent attention because of the actual or potential waste of taxpayer's money should be dealt with as a matter of priority.  It became clear to us that one such area that required immediate rationalisation was that of the multitude of Government Departments and agencies involved in recruitment, training and employment.  The committee felt that there was clearly a need to find out exactly, first, what services were being provided by the various institutions at present; secondly, what liaison or co-operation, if any, existed between them and, thirdly, to identify avoidable duplication of those services with a view to eliminating such waste as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In undertaking that review the committee were, of course, mindful of the fact that any streamlining of the State services for employment and training should not be just an academic exercise but should be an improvement and of benefit to the users at a time when people must be provided with skills necessary to compete on the job market today.</P>
    <P>The committee studied much background material on the subject and took evidence over four separate meetings from the Civil Service Commission, the Department of Education, the Department of Labour, the Department of Social Welfare, AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the Irish Vocational Association.  We would like to put on record our appreciation of the courteous and co-operative manner in which many officials involved readily provided information on which we based our report.</P>
    <P>The main conclusions of the committee are set out at paragraph 8 on page 26 of the report.  It must be said that we confirmed our original fear that there was widespread fragmentation, duplication and lack of co-ordination of services that <Col N="1026" /> had led to a waste of public expenditure at a time when there was unprecedented demand on the Exchequer resources. From the unions' point of view it was quite obvious that the very existence of so many agencies presented a bewildering array of offices, forms and so on, which is an example of the type of bureaucracy that we are determined to change in the interests of greater cost-effectiveness and efficiency.  The committee's recommendations are set out in detail on pages 28 to 31 of the report.  In summary, they imply some fairly radical changes and improvements that must be made to ensure that the most up-to-date services are made available for people who may be seeking training and employment. While there is some emphasis in the report on school leavers and those under 25 years of age, who experience particular problems, the committee recognise that those in older age groups must also be catered for by the National Manpower Service, AnCO and other agencies.</P>
    <P>I would like to read into the record of the House the recommendations, but I understand that we are short of time and other Members wish to contribute.  I must emphasise that all the committee's recommendations are, of course, without prejudice to the possibility of the setting up of an umbrella organisation referred to in paragraph 9 (14) of the report which will ultimately provide the best solution to the overlap and duplication revealed in the committee's investigations.</P>
    <P>If that is proved to be the correct course of action, then we would, of course, endorse the early introduction of such an institution.  We have recommended that the agencies involved at the moment should hold urgent discussions under the direction of the Minister for the Public Service, to arrive at a more streamlined cost-effective service for users.  The outcome of those discussions will be awaited with interest by the committee and I am sure will lead to the type of service that the public deserve and to which they are entitled as a basic right. The more cohesive structures which should emerge will, in the committee's view, set a headline for other State <Col N="1027" /> services and will, no doubt, trigger off similar evaluation and assessment, either internally or externally, which would lead to better value for money all around.</P>
    <P>The committee, as will be seen from the report, are determined to ensure that the level of duplication of services for employment and training is eliminated. We are confident that the agencies involved will welcome such a development and will co-operate in ensuring that the committee's recommendations are acted on with all possible speed.  I therefore recommend the report to the House.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like on behalf of the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the committee, to thank Deputy O'Kennedy, my fellow colleagues on the committee from all sides of the House for their active participation in what is recognised as the valuable work of the committee.  Their participation has enabled us to achieve the objectives which were set when we were appointed by this House in June of last year.  We now look forward to the challenge of the goals we have set ourselves in the year ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the committee I wish to support the proposal made by the Committee on Public Expenditure for the establishment of a centralised State agency for persons registering for employment and training.  I ask the House and the Government in particular to take serious note of the findings and recommendations contained in the report for the purpose of achieving greater cost effectiveness in the spending of public money, a great proportion of which is raised through taxation, and also for the purpose of streamlining the system for those who wish to avail of the services provided by the various State agencies in the area of employment, recruitment and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As administrators we are all seriously concerned about the growing number of economic and social issues facing us at this time.  I do not think anyone will disagree seriously when I say unemployment and the problem of taxation rank amongst the most urgent and the most serious of the problems calling for our <Col N="1028" /> attention.  As the number of unemployed continues to increase, so does the tax demand on those who are working.  Taxation generally has reached breaking point and saturation point for those who have to bear the burden.</P>
    <P>While there is no immediate or overnight solution to the problem, it behoves the Government to ensure that the money so raised through taxation is used as effectively as possible for the purpose of creating productive employment &mdash; and I use the word &ldquo;productive&rdquo; deliberately &mdash; and stabilising the economy. In that context the Committee on Public Expenditure have faced the challenge and set themselves the task of monitoring and evaluating the return to our taxpayers on this very scarce and valuable resource.</P>
    <P>I agree with the previous speaker.  I am greatly impressed and encouraged by the activity of the committee to date and the dedication of members to this very important task.  The committee have enormous potential and will give real meaning and effectiveness to the democratic process in general, provided the findings and recommendations are taken seriously and acted on by the Government.</P>
    <P>The committee provide a forum for a public input into their deliberations.  To date the response of the public has been most encouraging and will go a long way towards restoring confidence in State institutions.  This report examines in depth the operations of the agencies involved in the general area of recruitment and training, particularly for young people.  In their own way all of these agencies are doing a very good job, the job which they were entrusted to do by the State.</P>
    <P>The report reveals that there is unnecessary overlapping and duplication in some of these agencies, and inevitably a poor return for the money invested in them.  This must not be taken as a reflection on the agencies concerned, or on the excellent personnel involved in the administration of these agencies.  It is a reflection on the Government for failing to organise and order their affairs in a way which would eliminate the duplication <Col N="1029" /> and the waste of money highlighted in the report.</P>
    <P>In the area of public expenditure the committee highlighted duplication which, if eliminated, would lead to savings and improvements in the services. We should move in the direction of establishing a centralised recruitment agency with one single point of contact for people wishing to enter into the training or recruitment process.  All of us in public life have evidence of the fact that there is confusion among job seekers about the range of services available and who they should contact.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Department of Education, AnCO and the vocational education committees have agreed that there is duplication in some of the services.  This is commented on in the report.  The Department of Labour have also admitted that there is unnecessary duplication.  I feel strongly that our deliberations in the committee have been fruitful in bringing those matters to the notice of the Government.  I earnestly hope that they will lead to an early improvement.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended that the Department of Education, through their vocational committees, should continue to have primary responsibility for education and training.  I do not necessarily disagree with that point of view.  I should like to compliment the various vocational schools and regional technical colleges on the wonderful contribution they made to the promotion of vocational education in general.  Many young people are in rewarding employment today which they would not be in but for the very sound educational base which was laid for them by the instruction and tuition they received in our vocational schools and colleges of technology.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Education are to continue in this area, the bureaucratic barriers and the inflexibility of the Department will have to be broken down if they are to be as successful as we would wish them to be in the future training of our young people.  We have a good example of how the flexibility of AnCO management has led to the provision of some of the most successful and relevant training <Col N="1030" /> courses in the country.  Their record of job placement deserves further consideration.  At the end of the day, that is what really matters.</P>
    <P>Whether or not the training and educational facilities provided by all of these State agencies lead to employment and job placement for young students is the final testing point.  AnCO have displayed tremendous flexibility and have had tremendous success in the placement of many students who went through their various courses.  The committee should take a serious look at how they have achieved such a degree of success in job placement.  I hope it will receive the attention of the committee in the future.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems is to forecast the kind of job opportunites that will be available in the future.  With good planning it should be possible to forecast in advance areas of employment potential and to advise students at an early stage regarding the training courses they should pursue.  Such forecasting should be possible if undertaken in conjunction with medium- and long-term economic planning.  We have not yet clearly identified where this form of development will take place.</P>
    <P>I pose a few questions in relation to development.  Are we going to develop agriculture and food processing?  Are we going to develop training programmes within each of the State agencies to ensure that if employment is created through the development of agriculture our young labour force in the future will be scientifically educated to cash in on this development?  Are we going to develop forestry and our coal resources? In that area there is tremendous scope for future employment.  Finally, are we going to create an industrial climate where existing industries can expand and in which new industry will be encouraged to come here?</P>
    <P>It is important that we identify the development areas that in future will be the basis for the creation of new jobs and having identified them in advance we should be able to advise workers of the future regarding the most suitable courses for them.  The report made the following comment:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> The Minister for the Public Service should report back to the Committee at an early date on progress made and on savings, projected or effected, following the rationalisation of services and programmes for employment and training.</P>
    <P>I have been greatly encouraged by the commitment shown by members of the committee.  The committee will be of tremendous benefit to this Government and future Governments in relation to the avoidance of unnecessary public spending and the duplication of services.  However, if the committee are to have credibility and public confidence the paragraph which I quoted from the report must get an early response from the Minister concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, the question of the co-ordination of education and manpower activities has been a major concern of Government.  In December 1983, I was appointed as Minister of State at both the Departments of Labour and Education with specific responsibility for the co-ordination and training activities.  In discharging this brief I have had detailed discussions with all interested parties including the educational, <Col N="1032" /> training and manpower agencies, teacher trade unions, employer bodies, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other professional bodies.  On the basis of those discussions I have formulated proposals for the more effective and efficient delivery of services.  These proposals are now the subject of discussions with Deputy Hussey, Minister for Education and Deputy Quinn, Minister for Labour.  Members will appreciate that while these discussions continue I am, of necessity, somewhat constrained in what I can say, and I should explain that where I have expressed views these are my own personal attitudes and may be influenced by the continuing discussions.</P>
      <P>Secondly, wearing my Department of Labour hat, we are at present preparing a White Paper on Manpower Policy which will be ready for submission to Government later this year.  This White Paper will set out our manpower policies for the remainder of the eighties and will provide the backdrop for deciding upon the administrative arrangements necessary for the implementation of our policies.  In the course of this review, all institutional and administrative options including the radical suggestion proposed by the committee of the establishment of a central agency for recruitment will be examined and considered.  A forthcoming NESC Report on Manpower Policy, the Proposals for Plan 1984-87 and the plan itself will also be given full weight in finalising our manpower policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on my very extensive examination I can readily accept that the institutional arrangements need improvement.  I cannot, however, accept the suggestion that there is a substantial waste of public funds.  I must state clearly my own view, which is that the extent of duplication and overlap is generally overstated.  In terms of numbers it is estimated that, in May 1984, there were just over 2,000 15-17 year olds in AnCO training, excluding apprenticeships. Over 60 per cent of these were in three programmes &mdash; CYTP, Community Training Workshops and Travellers Workshops &mdash; where either there is no potential for overlap as in the case of CYTP, or there is extensive VEC <Col N="1033" /> involvement.  The figure of 2,000 and the potential for overlap must be seen in the context of up to 150,000 enrolments in the 15-17 age group in full-time education. In addition, duplication of itself does not necessarily mean waste.  Indeed in a situation of high unemployment it will be acceptable to have a number of similar courses run by different organisations to provide opportunities for as wide a range as possible of unemployed persons.  The target groups vary between programme sponsors.  I would be more concerned that there are gaps which make it difficult to cater for all categories of unemployed who need assistance.</P>
    <P>While the committee state that they found evidence of duplication and waste of public funds, very little is given in the way of specific examples.  This mirrors the approach of some of those to whom I turned for assistance whose ability to criticise trenchantly other participants was matched only by their shyness when asked to produce specifics.  The House can be assured that I would be most anxious to eliminate any waste of public funds, and the examination of particular areas of programmes would be assisted if the committee identified the areas of duplication they have in mind.</P>
    <P>Extensive co-operation already exists between the various manpower, education and training agencies, and this has been recently improved in a number of areas.  For example, educational interests are represented on the Council of AnCO and also on AnCO's industrial training committees, working parties and so on. A liaison committee was established some months ago between the Department of Education and AnCO and has been meeting regularly.  The Minister for Education is represented on the Board of the Youth Employment Agency.  Recent discussions between AnCO and the VECs have led to arrangements whereby the VECs are invited to tender for courses organised by AnCO's External Training Division, and it is hoped to move to a situation where the educational system will enjoy a first option.  Again, this closely reflects my own thinking.  In addition, the Community Youth Training Programme run by AnCO and the Grant <Col N="1034" /> Scheme for Youth Employment administered by the Department of Labour have been streamlined so that they complement each other and overlapping is avoided.</P>
    <P>The committee also concludes that the Department of Labour should have assumed a much more dominant role due to their overall remit in the field of manpower services.  I accept that the Department of Labour as well as Government Departments generally, have, for a number of reasons, been unable to pay sufficient attention to the formulation of policy. The relationship between non-commercial semi-State bodies and their parent Departments is covered in detail in the National Planning Board's &ldquo;Proposal for Plan&rdquo; which specifically recommends that policy must be the responsibility of the sponsoring Minister and his Department.  The proposals of the Planning Board and the views of the Public Expenditure Committee have already been taken on board in the Department of Labour's preparation of the White Paper on Manpower Policy.  Deputy Quinn and I are intent on strengthening the role of the Department to ensure that they will be in a position to formulate, monitor and evaluate the policies which will be put forward in the White Paper. The relationship between semi-State bodies and their parent Department must, of course, ensure that the initiative and drive of the semi-State bodies remains and that the many imaginative and successful activities of the past are not compromised.  The capacity and willingness must exist to mount the programmes necessary to assist the unemployed and the less advantaged.</P>
    <P>I would now like to comment on a number of the recommendations of the Committee.  In relation to the National Manpower Service, the committee make a number of recommendations principally that the NMS should become the single user point of contact for all services available and that there should be an urgent independent review of the service. This corresponds closely with my own thinking.</P>
    <P>As regards an independent review of the National Manpower Service, which <Col N="1035" /> would be costly and time-consuming, I have doubts as to its necessity.  Decisions here are for Government.  In addition, the service is at present preparing a medium-term plan and this will form an input to manpower policy.</P>
    <P>The comments made by the committee in relation to the Department of Social Welfare are appropriate.  We all accept that action must be taken at some time because of the complexity of the task and we are anxious that this should happen as quickly as possible.  In the light of the committee's views and concerns, the Department of the Public Service will co-operate with the Department of Social Welfare and the National Manpower Service to establish whether the facility envisaged by the committee can be achieved in advance of the full computerisation of employment exchanges as currently planned.</P>
    <P>In regard to the recommendation that the Department of Education through the VECs should have primary responsibility for education and training programmes for young people and that AnCO should not, in principle, duplicate such courses, the committee recognised that the educational structure and the curriculum are not attuned to those who leave the educational system at an early age at this stage and that compulsory education courses are still required in many cases.</P>

    <Title>Irish Steel Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Col N="1036" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the authorised share capital of Irish Steel Limited from £50,000,000 to £120,000,000 and to provide, as a consequence, a similar increase in the value of shares which the Minister for Finance may take up.  This will enable debts owed by Irish Steel and guaranteed by Exchequer to be repaid by means of an injection of equity.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel owe £99 million.  All of this is guaranteed by the State under guarantees extended by various Ministers.  It has also received a grant of £25 million in 1981-82 and equity of £5 million in 1982-83 from the taxpayer, all of which has been expended.</P>
      <P>These debts (net borrowings) increased in the following way &mdash; 1979, £13.5 million; 1980, £28.6 million; 1981, £52.5 million; 1982, £62.1 million; 1983, £77.2 million; 1984, £99 million.  The cost overrun for the new plant which was completed in mid-1981 was £26.5 million, above an estimated £38 million, and this amount is included in the above figures.</P>
      <P>All of this money is already owed.  In converting some of the £99 million in guaranteed debt into equity we are not increasing the capital liability of the taxpayer. These debts are already guaranteed by the taxpayer, and most of the debts, 53 per cent, were incurred prior to 1982.  We are simply relieving the State owned company of the need to meet the interest payments out of trading profits and transferring the liability for these interest payments to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this equity injection were not made Irish Steel would close straight away. Then the entire debt would fall to be met by the taxpayer anyway.  The decision the House is being asked to take in approving this Bill, is whether Irish Steel plant should not be closed without being given a last chance to prove itself.  The key factor here is whether continued operation will add to, or reduce, existing losses. <Col N="1037" /> In assessing this question, the Government availed of the assistance of the consultancy firm SOFRESID of Paris.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel Limited is a wholly State owned company with fully paid up shares amounting to £30 million held by the Minister for Finance.  The company's accumulated losses at 30 June 1983 were of the order of £43 million.  While it is expected that the loss for the year to 30 June 1984 will be in the region of £21 million, it is clear that the level of borrowings is far too high and that a significant injection of equity is necessary in order to correct the major imbalance in the company's financial structure if the company is to continue in operation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that no financial aid may be provided by a member state to a steel undertaking without the prior approval of the European Commission and aid for the continued operation of a steel undertaking may not be paid after 1984.  A notification of the maximum level of aid which the Government might provide to Irish Steel was sent to the Commission in September 1982 to meet the deadline set by the Commission for the receipt of such notifications.  The maximum aid envisaged in that notification was the guaranteeing of further borrowings of £25 million and the provision of share capital of £89 million.</P>
    <P>While it is expected that the loss for the year ending June 1984 will be £21 million, this will be made up as to £12 million by interest, £4.1 million depreciation and £4.9 million in operating losses. This equity injection will enable much of the debt on which the interest arises to be repaid.  The depreciation is relevant only in so far as the eventual replacement of the mill at the end of its useful life is envisaged.  The operating results are the most immediately relevant factor in deciding on the continuance, or otherwise, of the mill.  The projected losses on operation this year of £4.9 million represent an improvement on past performance. The operating losses in 1980-1981 were £8.2 million, in 1981-1982 £6.4 million and in 1982-1983 £5.7 million.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether this downward movement in operating losses would continue and whether the company <Col N="1038" /> would get into an operating profit situation has been the subject of deep study both at national and EEC level. Obviously if the company were able to get into a permanently profitable situation it would be able to make some contribution towards the redemption of the debts incurred in the past.  If it were closed straight away all the debts would fall due and no contribution would be made.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that the consultants, SOFRESID, were jointly appointed by the Government and the Commission in July 1982 to carry out a major assessment of Irish Steel's viability prospects.  They concluded in September 1982 that the company's costs were not competitive.  Nevertheless, on the basis of certain assumptions in relation to prices, reductions in production costs, including a £15 per tonne of steel produced reduction in the cost of electricity, growth in sales and revenue and the provision of additional State funds of up to £89 million, the company could, in the consultants' opinion, be viable in the long term and should be allowed to continue in operation.  The consultants warned, nevertheless, that if it were decided to keep the company in operation and to provide the additional funds, there remained the risk of failure due to the extreme difficulty of breaking into the export markets.</P>
    <P>On 29 June 1983 the Commission gave its decision on the application of the Government for approval to invest up to £89 million in Irish Steel in 1984.  The main provision of the Commission decision was that the proposed aid was not compatible with orderly functioning of the common market and might not be paid to the company unless the Commission was satisfied, on the basis of information to be supplied to it by 31 January 1984, that the company could be financially viable by the end of 1985 without any further aid.</P>
    <P>The Commission decision of 29 June 1983 also stated that the aid necessary for the continued operation of Irish Steel up to 31 January 1984 could be paid as long as the company was not in breach of the rules of the European Coal and Steel <Col N="1039" /> Community, particularly those relating to quotas and pricing.  The Commission subsequently approved the giving of Government guarantees in respect of an additional £14 million which was necessary for the continued operation of the company and recently approved the giving of Government guarantees for a further £3.5 million.</P>
    <P>In September 1983 the Government again engaged the consultants to reassess Irish Steel's viability prospects in the light of the company's performance since their report in September 1982.  The consultants in their report of December 1983 commented very favourably on the results achieved by Irish Steel since their earlier report and indicated that the company had set up a distribution network, diversified its product range, kept to its rolling production programmes and placed its customer relationship on a sound basis.  The consultants expressed the belief that from a marketing point of view, Irish Steel has overcome the most difficult hurdle: a significant breakthrough into the European market.</P>
    <P>Information to enable the Commission to decide whether in its opinion Irish Steel would be financially viable after the end of 1985 without further State aid, given a conversion as of that time of £89 million of debt to equity, was forwarded to the Commission in January 1984.  Arising from that information discussions with the appropriate Commissioners and with Commission officials have continued since then.  Resulting from them the Government and the Commission decided in May 1984 to jointly re-engage for a third time the consultants to undertake a further investigation in order to reconcile the varying views and to indicate whether Irish Steel could meet the Commission's requirements for financial viability after 1985.  The indications in the consultants third and most recent report are that Irish Steel can meet the Commission's requirements for financial viability after the end of 1985 provided the company is given the quota upon which the report is based.  I understand that the Commission took an interim decision yesterday which allows £36 million to be <Col N="1040" /> provided to Irish Steel pending a decision on the quota question.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the market in which Irish Steel must sell its products. The company has made considerable strides in the past year or so but the situation in the overall market remains depressed.</P>
    <P>However, the Commission's forecast for 1984 does envisage a slight improvement. Community production of crude steel in recent months has shown an increase over corresponding months in 1983.  Overall the state of the Community steel industry is better in 1984 than it was in 1983 but recovery remains fragile. Because of the major overcapacity which has existed in the Community steel industry for some years, there has been a tendency for supply to exceed demand.  This has meant a consequent downward pressure on prices, a deterioration of the financial position of producing enterprises and a consequent restriction on the creation of resources enabling them to finance plant modernisation.  The Commission are trying to remove this excess capacity through the implementation of the &ldquo;Aids Code&rdquo; which restricts aid by Governments to steel undertakings. Present indications are that capacity reductions are likely to go beyond the targets set by the Commission and could be of the order of 30 million tonnes by 1986.</P>
    <P>Among other measures currently being operated by the Commission are a system of production and delivery quotas, minimum prices for certain steel products, and more stringent measures to prevent infringement of the quota and price rules.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Commission have since 1980 operated a system of production and delivery quotas which is due to terminate at the end of 1985.  The main objective of the system is to control the supply of steel products coming on the market so as to prevent prices from collapsing and thereby allow the steel industry to restructure within a stable context.</P>
    <P>To date the quota system has not created major problems for Irish Steel. This is because so far, Irish Steel has been operating well below its technical capacity <Col N="1041" /> because the mill is only recently commissioned. From now on, however, it will need additional quotas, as the present system is unduly restrictive in its case.</P>
    <P>Indeed the basis on which SOFRESID has expressed confidence that Irish Steel Limited can reach profitability is that it has so far been working well below capacity. If it could approach its capacity output and sell that output at reasonable prices, it has excellent prospects of making operating profits.  At the moment it is only producing at little over 40 per cent of its capacity.  That is to say that unless appropriate increased quotas are granted to Irish Steel it will not be able to become viable and will have to close very quickly. I raised this problem at the Steel Council meeting on 26 January, 1984.  The Commission at that time declared their readiness to submit a proposal to the Council for alleviating these problems.  This was on condition that the restructuring programme had enabled it to acknowledge the viability of the undertaking after 1985.  While it is not certain that the Council of Ministers would agree to such a proposal from the Commission, I would hope that, in view of the relative insignificance of the capacity of Irish Steel's plant in the total European context, the Council would agree.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the quota system, the price of certain steel products deteriorated considerably in the second half of 1983.  The Commission therefore felt it necessary to introduce minimum prices for these products with effect from 1 January, 1984.  The Commission also introduced tougher measures to prevent infringement of the quota and price rules. Under these measures each steel producer of the products covered by minimum prices is obliged to lodge with the Commission a security deposit, based on his quarterly quota for delivery on the Community market, which will be refunded to the producer the following quarter provided he has not been found to have infringed the quota or price rules during the quarter question.  If, however, the Commission finds that a producer has infringed the rules it may require heavy fines to be deducted from the security deposit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> A favourable decision by the Commission on the viability question, a suitable adjustment of quotas and the investment of £89 million by the State will not of themselves ensure the future of Irish Steel.  The company must continue to increase the volume of its sales, reduce production costs and obtain realistic prices for its products at a time when the international steel market is still very depressed.</P>
    <P>As far as production costs are concerned, it must be stated that one of the disadvantages facing Irish Steel is the high price it pays for its electricity supply compared to the prices prevailing in other member states.  The SOFRESID consultants state that the ESB tariffs represent a disadvantage to Irish Steel of £15 per tonne of steel produced compared with a reference plant in France.  This was a feature of their 1982 and 1983 reports and they recommended in their first report that if this disadvantage could not be eliminated by a reduction in electricity tariffs or other cuts in costs, Irish Steel should be closed.  In their 1983 report they regard the total cost disadvantage as having been reduced to £12 per tonne but the electricity component of that still remains at £15 per tonne which is compensated as to £3 by other reductions.</P>
    <P>A comparison of domestic and industrial electricity tariffs, exclusive of tax, in Ireland with those in seven other member states of the Community indicates that the tariff structure in Ireland is substantially less favourable to industry than is the case in all of the other seven member states.  An indication of this disadvantage is that at given levels of consumption Irish industry pays over 93 per cent of the domestic rate per kilowatt hour compared with an average of less than 72 per cent of the domestic rate for the other seven.  The consultants concluded that electricity tariffs in Ireland, unlike those in the other countries, provided no incentive to industrial development.  Because of the importance of electricity charges to heavy industrial consumers, such as Irish Steel, the Government have decided that the Minister for Energy should bring <Col N="1043" /> before it within a month an assessment on energy pricing policy.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to Deputies from what I have said that the difficulties facing Irish Steel are considerable.  The company must achieve an increasing level of sales at a time when the steel market continues very depressed and when many producers in the Community are being compelled to reduce their production capacity because of the imbalance between supply and demand.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel has a modern, flexible plant which can adjust to changing patterns of demand and which, according to the consultants, is one of the most technically advanced plants in Europe.  As far as sales are concerned, the company have made considerable progress in the past year in that the volume of sales for the year to 30 June 1984 is expected to be some 40 per cent higher than that achieved in the year to 30 June 1983, which was more than double that achieved in the previous year.  While this performance is encouraging, much more remains to be accomplished in relation to costs, prices and sales if the company are to have a secure viable future.  The task facing the company should not be underestimated, and a dramatic improvement in the steel market simply cannot be expected or assumed.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the company have State-guaranteed borrowings amounting to £99 million and this Bill allows for the redemption of debt.  It is our hope that after this conversion of debt into equity the company will become viable.  If it does it will be able to service and repay all the remaining Government-guaranteed loans and make a return to the State on its investment. There is, of course, the risk that the company might fail to make the necessary progress towards viability.  The additional risk to the Government between the cost of closing Irish Steel now and its closing at a later date if not viable, is in the region of £5 million.  This limit arises from the fact that, if the trading position deteriorated to that extent, the company would have to be closed because the <Col N="1044" /> Commission will not permit the State after the end of 1984 to assist the company any further by way of investment, grant or guarantee.  Therefore the additional risk capital represented in the decision to introduce this Bill and allow Irish Steel a last chance is £5 million in current money terms.</P>
    <P>From the end of this year the company will have to finance their operations in a normal commercial manner without any recourse to the Government.</P>
    <P>I repeat that much remains to be done before the company's future is secure.  It will be up to all who work in the organisation to co-operate in ensuring the efficiency necessary to safeguard the future of the company.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I hope that, in spite of the many difficulties facing Irish Steel, the future of the company can be assured. I am confident that the Bill will commend itself to the Dáil and I recommend it for approval.</P>

      <P>I will try to be brief because I understand a number of Deputies from the Cork region are anxious to contribute.  This industry is very important to that area and I will try to be as accommodating as I can.  Perhaps Deputies opposite would also bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>This is yet another Bill in the history of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd.  I will deal first with the manner in which this decision has been reached and the regrettable treatment it has been getting in the House.  I will then deal with the basis on which the decision was made and the judgment which was exercised.  Thirdly there is the future prospect for Irish Steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the House that some three or four weeks ago I asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business if the Government intended to introduce legislation in this Dáil term to take additional equity in Irish Steel.  My purpose was to elicit from the Government the position of Irish Steel, realising that a decision would have to be made in June or July.  The Taoiseach's reply was totally non-committal.  The only interpretation I could make was that it was not before the Government.  If it were I would have <Col N="1045" /> expected to be told that legislation would be before the House during this session. The Minister will recall that I have tried at Question Time to find out the position of Irish Steel.  I was fully familiar with the position in 1982 when I was for a short time Minister for Industry and Energy, but I was not familiar with what had happened since.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about £90 million of taxpayers' money.  The least the people are entitled to expect is that we will show responsibility in the way we deal with it, yet we are to spend only two hours debating this matter on the second last day of the Dáil term.  This is not in keeping with the stated policy of the Government, who have made a virtue of financial management and fiscal rectitude.  The manner in which this matter is being handled is not in keeping with this policy.  When he was Minister for Finance Deputy Bruton expressed very strong views and produced a booklet entitled <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances.</i> I agree totally with him that the public are becoming cynical about the manner in which we handle large sums of their money.  We are rushing through this Bill and we are not in a position to make a realistic assessment of the possibilities of future repayment.</P>
    <P>I asked yesterday on the Order of Business if the three reports from SOFRESID, the French consultants, would be made available to me so that I could make a realistic assessment and give an objective view on the decisions which have been made.  This is the responsibility of an Opposition spokesman.  I do not think anybody would expect a spokesman to listen to the Minister's speech and then reply in an objective fashion.  The Government have the three reports.  The first one was in late 1982.  I was very familiar with the initial briefing in September 1982, but there was a general election shortly afterwards followed by a change of Government.  I am not familiar with what has happened since, except from reading in the Library the annual report of Irish Steel for 1982-83.  I compliment them on being one of the semi-State bodies who produced their annual reports on time.  However, 12 months is <Col N="1046" /> a long time and I can only base my judgment on the trends.</P>
    <P>From the very difficult situation in which Irish Steel found themselves in 1982 they appear to have come a long way in many respects.  I should like to have had the projections contained in the consultants' report in order to make a commercial judgment.  If I were making a decision on £9,000 in business &mdash; never mind £90 million &mdash; I would look at the performance of the management, the projections made in the past and the subsequent performance, as well as projections for the future.  Only in that way could one made a realistic judgment.  I did not have the opportunity of looking at the reports but I thank the Minister for sending a civil servant to give me a briefing. I understand quite clearly the Civil Service position in this respect.</P>
    <P>To make a commercial judgment one needs to have all the facts.  The vital words in the Minister's statement are that the indications in the consultants' report are that Irish Steel can meet the Commission's requirements of financial viability at the end of 1985 provided the company is given the quota on which the report is based.  We all know the industry took a decision last night, and quite obviously the Commission was satisfied, on the basis of all the information submitted to them, that Irish Steel can become viable.  Obviously the Government are also quite happy that it can become viable.  They are the people who have all the relevant facts and all the reports in front of them, all the projections and all the financial analysis available to them, and they have taken their decision.  I accept that decision.  I support it and I am delighted to learn from the Minister that such improvement has taken place.  Nevertheless I have some questions to put to the Minister and some comments to make.</P>
    <P>The first question is: can Irish Steel become viable?  The criteria in regard to Irish Steel and all other semi-State bodies when Fianna Fáil were in Government was viability, and I when I was Minister applied that criteria.  Now I accept the Government's bona fides in this.  We can <Col N="1047" /> look hopefully to the future.  That goes for one part of the Minister's speech. Reading other parts of the speech one begins to wonder how convinced the Government are.  Nobody can be a prophet about the future, but from past experience in Government I am sure the Minister is quite good at making a commercial judgment.  What criteria did he apply to his decision?  I have heard the Minister from time to time enunciate the parameters of a decision.  What criteria have been applied here?  Is part of the argument a strategic argument?  The Minister shakes his head.  We have to import 70 per cent of the raw material on which Irish Steel operates, and for a successful future we will have to export two-thirds. There are no social implications and no political implications.  That is fine.  We are talking here about a straightforward commercial situation.</P>
    <P>From the taxpayers' point of view, I said here on 29 June 1982 that the situation at that time in relation to Government bonds was £6 million.  That is on the record.  It is now £99 million.  The money has already been paid.  What worries me is the proliferation of Government guarantees. I recall the Minister on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; being asked a specific question and his reply was that they were finished.  Three days later a Minister of State in the same Department on a radio programme said they were not finished. Perhaps the Minister will tell me now who is right and who is wrong.  It is quite true a proliferation has taken place.</P>
    <P>I recall in 1982 looking at the projections for 1981-1982 period and only 40 per cent of those projections were met. I do not know what the projections for 1982-1983 were.  I was asking for that information yesterday morning.  What percentage of those projections were met?  What were the projections for 1983-1984 and what percentage of those projections are being met?  I extracted some figures in the Library.  In the year 1981-1982 Irish Steel had a turnover of £13,018,000.  In that year it had a loss of £21,013,000.  The financial charge was £21,713,000.  I looked at 1982-1983.  The turnover was £23,691,000 and the loss <Col N="1048" /> was £20,291,000.  The financial charges in that year included £10,403,000.  I do not have any information after that.  There was not a great deal of improvement in the situation in those two periods.  I would love to have the third period for purposes of comparison to see what the trend is and what level of improvement there has been.  That would give a better idea as to how we should judge the management of Irish Steel.  I should like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    <P>We are all happy to learn that exports are up from £5.8 million in the 1981-1982 period to £14.1 million in the 1982-1983 period.  I do not have the figures for 1983-1984 but judging by the figures I have the improvement is in the right direction.  Recently I asked the Minister if the projections for Irish Steel were being met this year and his answer was they were being met in quantity but not in price.  That would indicate to me that they still have not reached the price which would enable them to penetrate the market. What is his view as to when the discount for penetrating the market will cease?  There are Community prices which would enable them to penetrate the market.  Following on that what is the projection for the future in regard to prices?  Will they have to sell below cost which they had to do in order to get their share of the market?  I thought there would be more detail available.  I know the Minister is not an expert but he has experts available to him and the Minister should be in a position to give us the figures.  The Minister has made his decision based on all the information available. The Commission have made their decision and we have to accept that.  All I am trying to do is extract information for the benefit of the House and the benefit of the taxpayers.  We should be seen to be responsible in the way we approach the spending of this money.  ESB costs are an additional production cost in relation to Irish Steel.  The figure is something like £15 per tonne.  I am glad to learn that Irish Steel has reduced production costs by £3 a tonne, which reduces the differential to £12 a tonne.</P>
    <P>But we would be living in fairyland if we thought somebody would not have to <Col N="1049" /> pay if the cost of electricity is reduced to Irish Steel.  If we are to give a reduction of £12 per ton to Irish Steel &mdash; and they are big users of electricity &mdash; then may I ask the Minister what is his and the Government's position as to who will pay?  Will it be an additional cost to the consumer in order to recoup it for the ESB?  I am quite sure the ESB will not be very happy to have to reduce the cost to any particular consumer.  If so they would also find themselves in the position &mdash; if the Government decide to reduce the price to Irish Steel &mdash; that they would have Alcan and all the other large users knocking at their door the following morning.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on the electricity situation.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that because of their placement away from the centre of the market place Irish Steel have a transport disadvantage.  As far as I am aware from my experience, way back in 1982, it is a very modern mill, probably the most modern of its kind in Europe.  Probably whatever production advantages they would have would be offset by transport disadvantages.  On the face of it there would not appear to be that much room for further reducing their cost factors.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel are a big employer in the Cork region.  We have all been very concerned about recent happenings in the Cork region.  I understand they would have a workforce of 630.  I do not know whether that size of manning compares favourably with similar manning in mini-mills in, say, France and Italy.  Perhaps one would not be comparing like with like; perhaps the present range of products in Irish Steel, something like 84, demands this type of manning.  I would agree also that the flexibility of a small plant operating in difficult market conditions should give them some advantage.</P>
    <P>I would be somewhat worried about Irish Steel's marketing policy, I may be wrong here and, if so, the Minister can correct me on this, but they seem to be over-reliant on price only.  Irish Steel has been in existence now since 1946 and should have established a brand name for themselves in the market place.  But the situation still obtains that Irish Steel sell <Col N="1050" /> steel at whatever price they can get.  For example, is there no acceptance in the market that Irish Steel produces good quality products and that they do not have to continue to take the bottom range of the market with regard to price.  Without a brand name that is what happens in any market place and certainly in the steel market which is a rough game at the best of times.  If they do not have any customer loyalty built up, if they must continue with cheap prices in steel to penetrate the market fully over the next couple of years then we must see matters in a realistic way.  Perhaps I am wrong in my interpretation but it appears that the Minister is saying that after the end of this year there will be no more State aid to Irish Steel.  Yet there is provision there somewhere for £5 million which I cannot quantify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a bit of fancy accountancy work being portrayed in the Minister's script, as I see the position, because the Minister seems to totally disregard depreciation, and operating profit is really what the Minister is interested in and nothing else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;then I suggest that the Minister is not applying the commercial criteria to this decision and he said he was at the outset.  Anybody in business who disregards depreciation and all the other accompanying factors &mdash; and let us be blunt about it, many semi-State bodies like to do so &mdash; are in for a shock.  It must be remembered that Irish Steel will be operating in a commercial situation from 1 January 1985 when, I suggest to the Minister they can no longer regard operating profit as the be-all and end-all.  They would then not be able to finance their projects and find themselves in deeper trouble.  I know the type of accountancy in which they like to engage in semi-State bodies but if Irish Steel find themselves operating in the real world &mdash; as the Minister says they will be from 1 January next &mdash; I suggest that they will have to look at other things than operating profit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1982 when I had first sight of the initial report from SOFRESID, <Col N="1052" /> one of the great weaknesses they spelled out in Irish Steel was their product mix.  I do not know to what extent that has been corrected in the meantime in relation to, say, successful French or Italian mills of similar size.  They were producing the products more difficult to sell.  Their view at that time was that it was essential for Irish Steel to increase their concentration on the production of sections, which was 90 per cent in a similar mill in France, both because the contributions from sections would be higher and they are much easier to market. Therefore, Irish Steel's product mix is an essential element in getting the whole of their future right but it was badly out of line in 1982.  It was pointed out to them in September or October 1982.  I hope they have corrected it but it is not easy to do so overnight.  In the meantime I hope they have moved in the right direction.</P>
      <P>In relation to quotas we received partial approval last evening in relation to the EEC.  I know the Minister has had many meetings in Brussels with the EEC Steel Commissioner, Vicomte Davignon. I had similar meetings with him in September 1982.  I think my judgment was fairly accurate at that time.  Having first reminded me that he made a very strong recommendation when Irish Steel was being built that it should not be built, he recognised that Irish Governments can take their own decisions.  When the important question of steel quotas arose he indicated to me that he could not foresee it being a problem because we represented only .2 per cent of the total Community market.  Indeed he described it as a drop in the ocean and I see that some press correspondent in recent days described it as a pimple on an elephant's back.  I should like to hear how the Minister views the situation with regard to quotas.  I do not foresee them being a problem, especially now that the Minister prides himself on being an excellent negotiator.  I am sure he will be able to deliver that for Irish Steel.  The Minister is half way home and I believe he will come back with that deal.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows the game in Brussels just as everybody else. Those are the questions I should like answered.  I do not want to delay my colleagues on both sides of the House who have a direct interest in this.  But, unfortunately, in Irish Steel they are lumbered &mdash; as are many other State agencies &mdash; with the cost of overruns on projects. The initial budget for this one was approximately £28 million and £12 million of working capital requirements.  It ended up somewhere in the region of £80 million.</P>
      <P>I have spoken at other times in this House about better project management in the public service.  The situation at the end of the day, the bottom line, is that the taxpayer must bear the cost.  With scarce resources we cannot allow this practice to continue &mdash; we had other examples recently &mdash; it is a subject for a different debate.  What is important here is to ascertain whether all of Irish Steel's components are right for the future.  The consultants have said that they will be viable and the Commission and the Government accept they are viable.  We have always supported State enterprise where viability could be established because we believe it is the right thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This company have been lumbered with the excessive costs they have incurred.  There were serious deficiencies in the design of Irish Steel on the part of the designers.  I understand that it was not on a strict contract basis that they were set up in the first instance, and such situations are always a blank cheque for people to spend more and more taxpayers' money.  Obviously, that has happened again here.  In discussions with the chairman and the chief executive I pointed out that if there were such serious deficiencies in their design they had the legal responsibility to make them good. The figure, as I recall it, put on the deficiencies in the design and the delay those deficiencies caused to the company is in the region of £12.5 million which should be recoverable by legal action if necessary. I asked about this 12 months ago in the House.  I want to know the result of <Col N="1054" /> the legal actions then being considered, if they have been taken, because that is a considerable amount of taxpayers' money which should not be in the pockets of people who do such a bad job on a large project such as this.  The Minister can ponder those questions and give me the answers in his reply.</P>
    <P>I am glad so much has been achieved in Irish Steel.  It is our hope that the decision taken here is the right one and that the future for Irish Steel will be that they will have a chance to get round the corner.  They have come a long way and we all hope to see them make it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Having tried to get in on the previous debate on public expenditure, I say that it is unfortunate that we are confined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds has attempted to take a very balanced approach to the problem of Irish Steel and has raised serious questions about the wisdom of further investment in the industry.  That must be balanced against the situation in which we in the Cork region find ourselves. Unemployment has increased there dramatically over the last couple of years, and any consideration of financial aid for any industry in the Cork region must be with this fact in mind.  Some people who criticised the Bill when it was published and the decision to make a further investment of £89 million have ignored the major problem in the Cork region of unemployment.  The Minister in his speech said, &ldquo;The additional risk capital represented in the decision to introduce this Bill and allow Irish Steel a last chance is £5 million in current money terms.&rdquo; It is a small investment to help out a region that is in serious trouble.  It is an act of faith in Irish Steel who by any <Col N="1055" /> standards have a remarkable plant that has met all its projections and all the targets set for them in recent years.  This year again they will reach their own targets. It has been confirmed in the consultants' reports which the Minister and Deputy Reynolds referred to that the plant is the most efficient and modern of its type in the world.</P>
    <P>Despite meeting all their projections, the company have one major drawback in their inability to sell what they produce because of the restrictive EEC quota system. At the present stage the mill could have customers but would be unable to provide their requirements because of the restrictive quota system.  I will deal with that later.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a Cork Deputy, I can say that the mill now has a third generation of families working in it.  The decision made by the Government is an investment of confidence in the technical ability of the people in the mill.  The mill should be profitable by 1986 at the latest.  Critics of Irish Steel and of the Government's decision to make a further investment in them should bear in mind that the steel industry is in a difficult situation at present and it is a most complex industry to deal with.  On reading the reports of successive chairpersons in recent years I was impressed by the reference to the high motivation of the staff working in Irish Steel.  I know on a personal level the technical and administrative expertise in the plant at present and I admire the way in which the staff, especially the sales staff, have searched for markets in a very difficult situation in Europe.  Critics of the Government's most recent decision in this matter should remember the spin-off effects for the Cork region.  Irish Steel must be one of the major customers of the ESB.  The steel plant has a major spin-off beneficial effect for companies such as CIE and also the port of Cork which has been experiencing hard times in recent years.  The importation of scrap and the export of finished products has a most beneficial effect for the port of Cork.  The export of finished products has a most beneficial effect on the economy in that it attracts a certain <Col N="1056" /> amount of foreign currency.  I have commented already on the highly motivated work force in the plant, and I can only hope that the present investment will mean that the staff will work in as dedicated a way as they have in recent years and that this investment will not bring about a more complacent or lethargic attitude on the part of the workforce.</P>
    <P>One expression of concern I have is contained in the chairman's most recent report concerning personnel.  He says that the average level of absenteeism has increased from 6.9 in 1981-82 to 8.4 in 1982-83.  I hope that that trend is reversed in the present year.  In the last financial year the company because of their performance recovered much of the market here in Ireland and had a significant increase in their level of exports.  In 1982 the workforce were forced to go on a three-day week.  I am glad to say that that did not last too long and the company resumed normal working in late 1982 and had to introduce a third shift in 1983 to keep up with the demand for their products.</P>
    <P>As I said, Deputy Reynolds has commented on the successive SOFRESID reports.  The second and third reports quoted by the Minister outlined the basic underlying challenges facing the steel plant in the coming year.  I will not quote them, but they are on record in the Minister's speech.  One pleasant factor is that one of those SOFRESID reports says that the plant has a future.  The second report has been vindicated by the company surpassing even the market projections made by the consultants for the year 1982-83.  The company have, through expanding sales and increased productivity, managed to perform efficiently and have reduced the factors which were creating the losses that they experienced in recent years.  The losses have been reduced dramatically over the last two to three years, as the Minister indicated in his speech.  However, the company are faced with a major problem, that is the cost of energy.  I will not deal with it at length because of the time factor.</P>

Time will tell whether this will improve matters to any appreciable extent but there has been some improvement. Two to three months elapse between the time of the admission of claims to the EEC Commission and the transfer of payments to the beneficiary's account.  Once payment has been cleared and notification issued to that effect, the beneficiary's account is credited immediately with the amount of the grant.  It is expected that matters will improve from now on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a definitive answer to the first part of the question because this will depend on the speed with which consultations will be concluded by the different parties. Regarding the second part of the question, money has not been made available specifically for development of Clogherhead for the simple reason that the documentation has not been finalised nor final decisions reached on the plan to be adopted in relation to Clogherhead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>More than a year ago the Minister told me that consideration would be given to the provision of moneys for this purpose in the 1984 Estimate. Considering the fact that even the limited facilities available at the harbour are in danger of being destroyed in the next storm, perhaps the Minister would ensure that the money is made available as soon as the discussions have concluded.</P>

      <P>The decision to transfer the headquarters staff of the Central Fisheries Board from Dublin to Galway still stands.  Implementation of the decision is, primarily, a matter for the board. I understand that the delay to date has been caused mainly by the reluctance of <Col N="1070" /> the staff to transfer to Galway.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

The Deputy will realise that following on reluctance to transfer in general, demands made by the Central Fisheries Board staff in their headquarters office for sums of money for disturbance and other reasons are not acceptable to the board.  Let me emphasise that it is a matter for the board primarily to proceed with the effecting of this transfer.  I would prefer to see the transfer take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that people who have not been elected to govern this country should not be allowed to frustrate the implementation of a Government decision?  Surely after nearly two years in office and being a West of Ireland man, the Minister should be taking steps to bring about a solution of whatever problems or difficulties have arisen?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not.  The fact is that under present Government policy disturbance money is not payable in any event, as the Deputy is aware, since 1 January last.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.  An independent consultant's report has not been commissioned by my Department to examine the cause of the collapse of the pier head at Moville.  The matter has, however, been examined by the Office of Public works and I do not regard the employment of a consultant as necessary.</P>
      <P>The Derry Harbour Commissioners, on acceptance of a grant from my Department for the construction of the pier, agreed to maintain the completed structure and are, therefore, responsible for carrying out the necessary repairs to the pier.  My Department are pursuing the question of the repairs with the Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, as a result of the collapse of the pier head there are no real berthing facilities available at Moville?  The few berths which were available there were extremely important during the mackerel season.  When all the boats are in they move to Moville from Rossmullen.  The other obvious port is Greencastle and there are no facilities there either.  This <Col N="1074" /> means all of our boats have to go into the city of Derry to discharge their fish.  Even temporary repairs to this pier are absolutely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the present state of the pier, which I would say is dangerous.  There is no berthage there. We asked the Office of Public Works to have a look at the state of the pier and, in their opinion, the dredging which took place in 1979 caused the subsequent collapse of part of the head of the pier. Donegal County Council have been offered a pier by the Derry Harbour Commissioners.  Our advice to them is that they should not contemplate purchasing the pier, or taking it over, until the Harbour Commissioners carry out their obligation to repair the damaged section.  That is the current position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that this might be putting the cart before the horse?  If the Derry Harbour Commissioners carry out the repairs we might find we have to throw good money after bad, and that it is necessary to have the pier reconstructed.  At a time when the Minister continues to tell us there are financial difficulties, we should seriously consider forgetting about the repairs, if the independent consultant advises Donegal County Council, or the Derry Harbour Commissioners, or ultimately the Minister, that a major job should be done rather than a minor one if the pier is dangerous as a result of the dredging in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Derry Harbour Commissioners have accepted responsibility for the present state of the pier, but they add that they cannot be compelled to carry out the repairs.  They accept responsibility in law, but say they cannot be compelled to carry out the repairs. That is a matter for another forum.  As things stand, Donegal County Council would be ill-advised to take on this responsibility until the people legally responsible live up to their responsibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The intake of land for the State afforestation programme is an on-going process and is influenced each year by such factors as the level of funds provided for the purpose, the area of land on offer to the Forest and Wildlife Service, the stage reached in the various purchase negotiations and the extent to which the legal aspects of individual transactions are completed.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that this year the funds available for land acquisition for forestry, amounting to some £4½ million, will permit the intake of about 16,000 acres out of the aggregate area of 23,000 acres for which, at a recent date, price agreement with landowners had been reached and for which title clearance is pending.  In addition, the processing of all fresh offers of land will continue as part of the on-going programme.</P>
      <P>As regards the forest employment situation, every effort is being made to ensure adequate work for the current labour force numbering over 2,500 in 246 State forests throughout the country, each with its own individual labour requirements.  If, in the light of the work programme in any particular forest, a reduction in the number on the payroll becomes unavoidable, this will be achieved, as far as practicable, through natural wastage and redundancies will be kept on a minimum.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="1076" /> agree that there is a 30 per cent shortfall in the 1958 forestry programme of 10,000 hectares per year?  Would he agree that it is serious, at a time when a considerable amount of suitable land is available, that we are not meeting that low target?</P>

      <P>There is a reduction, as the Deputy said.  It has been accepted by successive Governments since that time &mdash; and I emphasise successive Governments &mdash; that we had to cut back on that target.

      <P>In the review on forestry in Ireland recently it is stated that there is an immediate danger of redundancies amongst forest workers and that there is an under-utilisation of plant and machinery.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had notices of four redundancies this year.  There are difficulties in acquiring land.  The four redundancies were caused by the non-availability of suitable land in the vicinity of the forest in which these people work. There are social problems and traditional, attitudinal problems in relation to the sale of land by farmers, even marginal land which they know, and everybody knows, is not suitable for agricultural purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>My Department operate two planting grant schemes aimed at encouraging private forestry.  Under one of these schemes, directed specifically towards western areas, grants of up to £800 per hectare are available to landowners who devote some or all of their lands to forestry, and under the other scheme, which applies to the remainder of the country, the grant amounts to £309 per hectare. For participants in both schemes a technical advisory service is available free of charge from my Department.</P>
      <P>At present some new initiatives with a view to increasing private sector involvement in afforestation are under active consideration.  Publicity for private planting is an on-going process involving such features as advertisements, media articles, brochures and leaflets, exhibits at shows, contacts with various rural organisations, and so on.  This process will be maintained and, if necessary, intensified, as the occasion offers.  Indeed I may say that within the past few weeks there have been two important developments under the auspices of my Department: (a) the holding of a very successful workshop on the theme &ldquo;Investment in Forestry &mdash; New Horizons&rdquo; at which the factors inhibiting the expansion of private forestry were examined; and (b) the launching of a booklet, entitled &ldquo;Investing in Forestry&rdquo;, containing basic information to assist people who are interested in becoming involved in private forestry.</P>

I have no doubt that my Department's timber marketing operation, which is entrusted to experienced administrative and technical staff, is being carried out efficiently and responsibly with due regard to the interests of the Exchequer and the needs of the industry.</P>
      <P>In the light of on-going developments in the forest products sector, the principal methods of selling sawlog, namely, the tender and quota systems, are currently under examination by an inter-departmental committee whose findings are expected shortly.  I will be reviewing the matter in the light of the committee's report, but meanwhile any variation in the existing sale arrangements would be inappropriate.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that a review is going on.  Will the Minister not accept that the growing and selling of timber is a commercial operation that needs to be carried out on sound commercial principles if it is to be successful? Further, will he not agree that within the Irish timber industry and the Forest and Wildlife Service of his Department there is widespread dissatisfaction with the way matters are handled, with the antiquated methods, the obsession with Civil Service <Col N="1079" /> routine and the absence of specialist marketing ability?  Can the Minister give an indication as to whether the review will be carried out with a sense of urgency?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>I accept that dissatisfaction has been expressed.  In many cases allegations made in relation to this area of activity are unfounded.  I accept that any system can be improved, and I hope the recommendations from the interdepartmental committee will result in improvements.  No matter what we do in relation to large saw logs in particular where we can supply only 60 per cent of demand, and no matter what sales approach we adopt, we will not increase the ratio of supply and demand.  At the moment there is a 40 per cent shortfall and until the end of this decade we will not have equilibrium in this area.  I hope we can improve some of the methods we have adopted in the past but it will not improve the overall position of a shortage of timber, particularly in the large saw log area.  In relation to small saw logs, there is the capacity to supply existing demand.</P>

Will he tell the House what qualities that system has and what justification exists for it to continue in any form?  Widespread dissatisfaction has been expressed about it, and it is beyond me to understand what is attractive about it or why the Department maintain it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Traditionally in this House and under financial regulations, a strict formula applied in relation to the disposal of natural and national assets. The Deputy will know that there is a committee of this House which deals in depth with public expenditure and the expenditure of all Departments.  Heretofore regulations have insisted that the disposal of such assets be done in a fair way.  Secondly, they are expected to realise the highest return possible to the Exchequer.  Coupled with that we have to ensure in so far as we can in the Department and the FWS that because we have not the supply to meet the demand any system we apply will be a fair system and will give everyone a share of what is there.  It is not adequate to meet the needs, but we have to try to spread the gravy as evenly as possible. Problems arise from that.  Criticisms are voiced because people who are seeking timber cannot get adequate supplies. That is not my fault.  We are talking of trees coming onstream and large saw logs; we are talking of trees that were planted 35 or 40 years ago.  I was not around here at that time.</P>

Will he undertake to examine the specific complaints that were made which are undermining confidence in the working of this service?  Specifically, will he consider the matter of the absence of specialist training for staff and management, the high harvesting costs because of faulty practices, the lack of policy to improve timber quality by culling, and the absence of any proper marketing strategy?  All of these factors are undermining confidence in that section of the Department.  Will the Minister have these points examined, and, if necessary, take action?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard what the Deputy has said, and particularly the last part of his statement, as the function of the Minister. It is my job to look into these matters and see where improvements can be carried out.  In relation to the first part of his question, I accept that many of the complaints are made in good faith.  In my day-to-day work I take on board many complaints made by individuals in the industry and I try to resolve the situation satisfactorily.  The problem is that we have an expanding capacity.  Despite the fact that the people in the industry know that the capacity to produce 100 per cent is not there, they still expand their operations. People go from one shift-working to two shift-working and so on and that aggravates the position, which leads to further complaints.  While improvements can be carried out in handling what we have, the basic complaint is that the people involved cannot get sufficient supplies of timber.  Deputies may blame whom they like for that but I do not take responsibility for it at the moment.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that there are a number of matters with which he can deal in this situation? The Irish Timber Council have spoken about the continuing unreliability of raw materials.  The Department should indicate at regular intervals when they have quantities of timber and there is the problem of location.  People in the industry have to make long hauls while, on the <Col N="1082" /> other hand, timber is readily available to other purchasers within easy reach.  The tendering system and the sales system are completely disorganised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions have been about the tendering system and I am not altogether happy that the Minister has approached this with certainty.  I know he is expecting a report but I would ask him to bear in mind that the Irish Timber Council and people involved in the business are complaining bitterly about the amount of management time which is wasted examining timber which they may never have an opportunity of buying <Col N="1083" /> because of the tendering system.  Could the Minister devise a system whereby the price of timber acceptable to the State would be published and sold on the open market without involving a tendering system? I urge that point of view on the Minister.  He may get a few extra pounds for the Exchequer through the present system but the amount of time wasted is enormous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The cause of the delay is that the committee went outside their terms of reference to embrace a much larger area of the industry so that they could make a more comprehensive report.  It proved to be very complicated and I accept that it is taking some time. However, the committee are trying to do a good job and I expect this report very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major problems facing the Irish Steel plant is the high cost of energy and for that reason I welcome the statement by the Minister that the Minister for Industry will be bringing forward some proposals on this within a short period.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that in spite of the economic climate in recent years the plant has managed to increase its market.  The future of the plant depends on a continuing economic recovery in Europe.  A demand for steel goes hand in hand with a healthy economy.  It also depends on a favourable outcome in Europe to the question of quotas.  I assume that the future of Irish Steel will be considered by the Council of Ministers in the near future.  It must be brought to the attention of the members of that Council that Irish Steel is a small mill by European standards creating 0.2 per cent of the overall EEC capacity.  The Bill, and the proposals put forward by the Minister, represent further positive steps <Col N="1270" /> by the Government to get the economy of the greater Cork area back on its feet. The Minister's announcements, in conjunction with those in response to the task force, indicate that the Government are giving every encouragement to the people of the area.  I welcome the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comply with the Chair's request.  It is an indication of the interest and concern of the representatives of the region that so many Cork Members are anxious to contribute to this debate.  I was surprised at the concluding remarks of Deputy Allen.  There is no doubt that he was trying to gain some kudos for the harassed and beleagured Government.  For any person to suggest that Cork could continue without the 600 jobs in Irish Steel is stretching the matter a long way.  The area has been devastated by unemployment in recent times.  The elimination of the huge financial burden caused by the loan charges on the company represents a financial gain and will improve the presentation of accounts.  I appreciate the comments by the Minister that he expects plans from his colleague on ESB charges but as far as I can see the Government spend all their time talking about plans, proposals, white papers and reports of task forces but do not take any positive action. Before we left Government in October 1982 we had taken a decision to carry out an investigation into the excessive cost of ESB charges to industry.  Irish Steel is a glaring example of excessive ESB charges being a major factor militating against the company being competitive in the world market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a special interest in the company. Long before my political involvement in the area I was engaged in the <Col N="1271" /> development work that took place there in the mid-sixties.  This was followed by the erection of a bridge linking the island to the mainland in the late sixties.  I support the future of the company.  The 600 jobs are vital to the life of the Cork region.  The management of Irish Steel have faced up to the challenge in a positive way.  It is true that there has been over-expenditure on development but many factors were involved.  One of the factors was the confined nature of the location of the company.  It is tragic that there has been over-expenditure of the magnitude outlined but it is a tribute to the management that they faced up to the challenge.  I was impressed when I went on a tour of the plant recently by the high technological development that has taken place there in the last five years. All concerned are deserving of a tribute.</P>
    <P>I wish the management success and I have no doubt that this allocation will be a further spur to them to ensure that this strategic industry will not be lost.  The Minister should tell his colleagues how important a stimulus to the building industry would be for a concern like Irish Steel.  I would make the criticism that it was he who, while Minister for Finance, put an added burden on State companies, even those desperately trying to be viable.  He seemed to convey a message that all State industries were bad news, were not good ventures, were not being successful and should not be supported.  He initiated a campaign along these lines which made it more difficult for management like that of Irish Steel to continue.</P>
    <P>I wish the company every success.  I have no doubt that they will accept the challenge and face up to it successfully. I would ask the Minister to tell us the results of the investigation into the excessively high rate of electricity charges since a huge amount of electricity is used in the firing process in the steel industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to set this debate in the context of the real arena which is in Europe and throughout the world.  I have to hand the Seventeenth General Report on the Activities of the European Communities, 1983, and it <Col N="1272" /> contains some sobering thoughts.  It spells out clearly that the whole steel industry is in &ldquo;crisis&rdquo;, a term used more by politicians than by bureaucrats.  This document spells out the catastrophic drop in demand for steel throughout the world. It states that there was no sign of a recovery in the world steel market in 1983, although I am glad to hear the Minister say that there has been a fragile improvement in 1984.  That is a message of hope. In 1983, 33,000 jobs were lost in the steel industry in Europe, following an equal loss the previous year.  That is the climate in which our small steel industry has to survive.  On the plus side it can be said that Irish Steel have a first-class, modern, automated mill.  Tragically it cost £26.5 million more than estimated and that scale of over-run is part of the problem. We are speaking here about taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>The Minister has faced a very difficult dilemma.  On the one hand, if he were not to bring in this legislation he would have to come up with that kind of money anyway because of the guarantees.  The alternative is to keep Irish Steel in business. He has made that decision on a fine balance and it is correct.  It is not a &ldquo;seat of a pants&rdquo; judgment but is based on three serious studies by world renowned consultants.  In so far as any man could equip himself with what is necessary to make the correct decision the Minister has done it.  I congratulate him.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged everywhere, particularly in Cork, that Irish Steel have a first-class mill.  Most of us from Cork have been there and it is a revelation to see it. It is well managed, with the question mark that some of the people managing it had something to do with that extraordinary over-run of £26.5 million.  The workforce have rowed in well, productivity has been increased and there seem to be good industrial relations.  It is heartening to read the consultants' comments in one of the latest reports that they see improvements on virtually all fronts in relation to what Irish Steel set out to do the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the negative side, Irish Steel have to contend with energy costs which are roughly 30 per cent in excess of the average <Col N="1273" /> among their competitors.  One of the most depressing statements in the Minister's speech is the reference to electricity and the fact that these international consultants, who must be advising many major investors throughout the world, say that electricity charges in Ireland, unlike those in other countries, provide no incentive to industrial development here.  I look forward to seeing how the Minister addresses that problem in his new industrial policy.  Other Ministers will be involved in that problem.  For consultants of this eminence to say that there is no incentive here because of the energy cost problem is a serious indictment of our industrial strategy and it needs further attention.</P>
    <P>It is true that a mill in an island country labours under the disadvantage transport costs and they will have to find other efficiencies to counter that.  They are doing so.  Let us hope the EEC will grant us the extra quotas to which we are entitled. This is a fledgling industry entitled to come closer to its full capacity.  I rely on the Minister's bargaining ability to secure that because it is essential for the future of the mill.  The Minister has said that this is virtually the last chance.  The situation is unusual because the time may come next year when the question of the viability of Irish Steel raises its head again.  At that point we will not be talking about twisting the arm of the Government or this Minister; we will be talking about twisting the arm of the EEC Commission and that cannot be done any more in relation to steel.  This is a last chance for Irish Steel and I hope it succeeds.</P>
    <P>We must ask where the taxpayer comes into this matter.  What does this £90 million mean?  It is equivalent to 4 per cent of the entire PAYE take for one year.  It would build 4,000 houses or three million square feet of factory space.  It would give between £400 and £500 to every unemployed person.  That is the scale of it. That is why so many people are taking an interest in it.  It is not the Government who are making this sacrifice for the future of Irish Steel, the jobs there and the industry in Cork Harbour.  It is the taxpayer who is overtaxed.  I know that <Col N="1274" /> sacrifice is meeting a ready response in Irish Steel.  Let us hope it is a well-placed act of faith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I have agreed to facilitate other Deputies who wish to contribute to this debate.  I welcome the Government's decision to make a further investment in Irish Steel.  I have been advocating for some time that during a time of recession industry should receive financial aid from the Government to assist them through a difficult period, especially industries which have proved themselves viable and efficient.</P>
      <P>The recent consultants' report on Irish Steel was very satisfactory and the prospects for the future are good if the progress of the industry is carefully monitored. It is one of the most modern of its kind in the world.  It is mainly geared for the export trade and 65 to 70 per cent of its product is exported.  These are the kinds of things we need and must encourage. It is important that the industry should be competitive and anything which hinders this competitiveness should be investigated and removed.  To attain its full potential two problems must have the Minister's attention.  First there is the problem of having to work to an EEC quota.  This is a crucial factor and everything possible must be done to get agreement on a larger quota.  Secondly, there is the problem of the high cost of electricity to Irish Steel which is 30 per cent above the European average.  I understand that they paid £7 million to the ESB in the year 1983-84 and a further increase in energy costs must be expected next year.</P>
      <P>Since the foundation of Irish Steel there is now the third generation working there contributing to the welfare of the industry.  There have been excellent labour relations all down the years.  It is our duty to build up confidence in Irish Steel and all the necessary co-operation must be given to both management and workforce to ensure the viability and efficiency of this great industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I do so because I believe here we are doing the right thing.  Here we are taking the right step.  It is imperative that we should <Col N="1275" /> do so.  I am fully aware of the seriousness of the decision we are taking.  We are allocating approximately £90 million of taxpayer's money to Irish Steel.  We are supposed to be the custodians of that money, the custodians of the public purse as it is called.  We have not always made the best and wisest expenditure of these moneys in the past.  Let us hope this expenditure is wise.  Let us hope it will return a dividend.</P>
      <P>Looking at Irish Steel in perspective and in context the industry has been there before I came into existence.  Hopefully it will still be there long after I have ceased to exist.  The industry has met with misfortune down through the years.  Its base is Cobh and Cobh has now become the biggest town in East Cork.  That has been the evolution as a result of the introduction of the Irish Steel industry to that area.  The town has developed as a consequence.</P>
      <P>Now Irish Steel has its problems as well as its successes.  The worst problems came in the 1970s as a result of our entry into the EEC when access to free trade had to be taken into account.  It also became apparent in the seventies that the plant was obsolete.  In the late seventies it became abundantly clear that if the plant were to survive, given the huge losses it had suffered to date in 1978, there would have to be a complete restructuring of the plant.  New plans were drawn up.  We are now trying to come to terms with that restructured plant.  There were serious errors in the original plan.  When the new plan was finalised in mid-1981 the overall cost was in the region of £23 million.  That was a costly mistake.  Indeed there were many costly mistakes made in regard to Irish Steel.  That being so we are in a situation now where Irish Steel owes a huge sum of money, namely, £99 million, a sum guaranteed by the State.  Were Irish Steel to close in the morning the bill would have to be picked up by the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe Irish Steel should not be closed in the morning because of its past. Its recent past has been very successful. That has been abundantly proved by reports.  Its operation record over the <Col N="1276" /> past four years has been very good and to date losses have been going down consistently over the years.  In 1980-81 Irish Steel lost approximately £8.2 million.  In 1981-82 it lost £6.4 million.  In 1982-83 it lost £5.7 million and this year the projected loss will be £4.9 million.  Given the much improved operations in recent years there is more evidence still to show that Irish Steel can become viable.  Its marketing over the last few years has been highly successful.  It has entered many new markets in Europe and there is still room for expansion in that area.</P>
    <P>I am glad the question of electricity has arisen in relation to Irish Steel because this is a problem which does not affect only Irish Steel.  It affects every industry throughout the country.  It is impossible to expect industry to make healthy profits when one remembers the kind of electricity bill with which industry finds itself faced.  I know the Minister has made several efforts in this regard and I know he will continue to do his utmost to ensure that cheaper electricity can be made available to our important industrial base, thereby ensuring the profitability of that all-important base.</P>
    <P>In recent years the world market for steel has been very depressed.  It is still depressed but there are small indications now of an eventual upturn.  That should give hope to Irish Steel.  The industry employs a workforce of 660.  This workforce can in no way be blamed for the problems of the industry.  Everyone in Irish Steel does an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.  The problems are not problems on the floor of the plant. They are not current.  It is past problems with which Irish Steel are endeavouring to cope.  That is why it is in the national interest that the Government provide the necessary finance to clear that debt.  It is adding smoke to the fire.  Year after year the interest rates have been increasing, and this is the only way in which that burning fire can be quenched.  It is the last chance the Government have of placing Irish Steel in a viable position because after the end of this year the Government can no longer make any financial contribution to them.  However, I feel it will not be necessary for them to do so. <Col N="1277" /> The risk element involved in this Bill today is of the order of £5 million, one well worth taking, in the light of evidence from Europe, from the Commission's report, the annual reports of Irish Steel itself, indeed all of the evidence available to us.  Therefore, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief because I am aware that other Deputies wish to speak.</P>
      <P>I hope the Government are not saving Irish Steel only because of the danger of having to pay £99 million in guarantees.  I would hope their commitment is greater than that.  Probably it is under the present Minister.</P>
      <P>If Irish Steel should close there will be no hope of a private company, national or international, taking it over and keeping it viable.  If an international company did take it over it would be for the purpose of closure in order to allow them use their full capacity.  Therefore, if it is not kept open by the State then it will close.  It is of great importance to the Cork area, particularly after the major closures of Fords and Dunlops, that Irish Steel with their workforce of 630 be kept viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One basic point I want to make is that Irish Steel are now at their most efficient and modern juncture and, if allowed work to full capacity, can be viable.  If they are not allowed work at full capacity then they will not be viable, when we will be in the very difficult position outlined by the Minister of being at the mercy of market forces.  It is vital that the Minister negotiate so that the quota system be removed and they be allowed operate at full capacity.  I do think that can be achieved.  Sometimes, perhaps, we underestimate what we can achieve in Europe.  Some time ago, when capacity was increased from 135,000 to 350,000 tonnes a year, the Government of the time succeeded in negotiating so that Irish Steel could take over the capacity usurped by an old French steel mill that had been closed down.  Therefore, Irish <Col N="1278" /> Steel was allowed to continue at full capacity.</P>
    <P>We are the most depressed region in the EEC.  Cork is our most industrialised area and, at the same time, our most depressed industrial area.  Therefore, there are strong arguments for allowing Irish Steel, now that they are efficient, to work at maximum capacity.  If the Minister just sits back and allows them merely to tick over, they will go to the wall; I do not see how they can remain in business. But if the Minister has the commitment to negotiate for the removal of quotas, allowing Irish Steel to demonstrate their efficiency and operate at maximum capacity, then they can remain in business, particularly if the Government allow an upturn in our construction industry which will also be of assistance to them.  I would advocate that some of our major construction companies, like McInerneys and the Rohan Group, who are operating abroad should be asked to negotiate with Irish Steel so that those companies would use their steel for their construction work abroad.</P>
    <P>I do not think the provisions of this Bill will ensure that Irish Steel remain in business. It will help them at present, but if the Minister negotiates for maximum capacity, with removal of the quota and also for an upturn in the construction industry, then they can continue viable for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in supporting this Bill.  It would be a disaster had Irish Steel to close.  But we must view the situation in the light of these £99 million already having been guaranteed which will have to be paid at some stage. No doubt the restructuring of the company will be of some benefit to them in achieving progress.  The major question that must be posed is: what will happen to them next year or the year after?  I believe the company will still make a loss &mdash; the latest figure was £4.9 million plus depreciation.  It must be remembered that in any commercial concern depreciation is a normal constituent of a profit and loss account which cannot be discounted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important question is: what will <Col N="1279" /> happen from January next when the Government will no longer be allowed by the EEC to give assistance to the company? I do not foresee Irish Steel getting into a profitable situation in the short-term, so there will be tremendous pressure on them in ensuing years and it is vitally important that the Government prepare for those years.  If Irish Steel cannot survive alone it is essential that the Government plan for their replacement by other industries in the area.  Perhaps it is not good to be talking like this, but we must view the real situation.  It must be remembered that there have been many closures already in the Cobh and Cork areas.  We must realise that if Irish Steel cannot make their mark on European markets or make profits then the position will not be as bright as the Minister endeavoured to portray in the course of his remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  Despite this massive investment by the State Irish Steel's viability cannot be guaranteed in that we are dependent on our EEC quota and are subject to energy costs which are beyond the control of the company.  These matters will have to be tackled on both fronts by our MEPs and the State itself.  The Department of Energy will have to endeavour to reduce energy costs to vital industries such as Irish Steel.  Deputy Mac Giolla said, and I agree with him, that Irish construction firms working abroad should be encouraged to use Irish steel.  But there is an inherent problem in that suggestion in that in some of the countries in which those companies operate there is a closed-door attitude toward imports of steel.  In fact, the United States is the greatest offender in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate effect of this injection into Irish Steel has been on the morale of the workforce who have been most concerned about their future in recent years, the future of the industry, and which has affected their performance in recent times.  Indeed, the chairman of the company referred to the increase in the rate of absenteeism from 6.7 per cent in 1981-82 to 8.4 per cent in 1982-83.  We <Col N="1280" /> should see a turn-around in that situation as a result of this vote of confidence on the part of the Government because nothing undermines the confidence of a workforce more than the threat of unemployment. I would hope that we are moving away from that situation.  This is borne out by the fact that in the course of recent years, since the consultants first moved in and came forward with three different reports, there has been a gradual but significant improvement in the company situation.  On each of the three occasions confidence was growing.  The final report leaves us in no doubt that the company can be viable if the quota is increased.  Despite the overall cost of £26 million, this mini-mill, as it is called, at Haulbowline has definite advantages over a larger type of mill in that it can be adapted to the production of various types of bars, 90 in all I believe, in a very short time.  That can reduce costs significantly and lead to better customer service. It also has the capacity to provide the bars in lengths which up to now have posed a few technical problems.</P>
    <P>I join with the other Members in welcoming this Bill and I give it my hearty support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the funding of Irish Steel.  I am glad that at last the Minister has seen fit to come to the aid of the Cork area and that we are moving away from the austerity of this time of recession.  If we have not confidence to build up industry at such a time we will not have the base when brighter times come.  As a Deputy from the Cork constituency I can say that the Seán Lemass era was the period when the industrial base for our constituency and county was built up.  He was a great believer in Irish Steel.  In relation to the 1960 Bill introduced by Deputy Jack Lynch when Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Official Report records a fine contribution by the late Deputy Martin Corry who had worked late and early to salvage that mill from closure and private enterprise and brought it into the State enterprise sector.  I am glad that it still survives.  As Deputy Myra Barry has said, it gives an industrial base to the <Col N="1281" /> town of Cobh and provides 650 jobs and many jobs in the service area also.  It is an industry we can ill afford to lose and for that reason we can only welcome this measure.</P>
      <P>Have we gone far enough in the development of that industry?  We are only paying the debt and we should be providing for further expansion in that type of industry.  We are shortsighted.  Perhaps the Minister should have a further look, as he is becoming more magnanimous in his approach to the industrial scene in Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The overrun in capital expenditure cannot be tolerated in the semi-State or any sector in the public area.  We must have corrective action and even legislation to protect us and our taxpayers from this type of thing.  I have said that this is a model plant with a very good workforce and it has a good product.  Many of us have experience of using Irish Steel's products and they have done an excellent job for the agricultural community as well as for industry.  They provide a very essential service in that they take up all the scrap from all our scrap merchants who would have no outlet if the worst came to the worst for Irish Steel.  In that way they give another important service which provides many jobs.  They are the biggest user of energy in the country and in recent times have taken some natural gas.  I believe that with a mix of both, this industry will be saved and will be very successful in the future.</P>

      <P>I will give the information to the Deputy directly and correctly.  Many questions have been asked of the Minister on Second Stage, many from your side of the House, and I am anxious to get the Minister in to enable him to reply to the questions raised.  I was hoping, with the co-operation of all here, to allow him in for ten minutes to answer the questions to conclude Second Stage, to deal with the amendments on Committee Stage and finalise the Bill at 4.30 p.m.  That is on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill for a number of reasons.  This is a commitment to the Cork region.  We are aware of the difficult position in Cork, but this is a further commitment of this Government allied to that of the task force who reported recently and some of whose recommendations have already been acted upon.  This is the kind of commitment the people are looking for in the Cork area. One would like to say a number of things at considerable length.  One thing that has been mentioned in connection with Irish Steel is the cost of the ESB etc.  I understand that the Minister for Energy will be making recommendations to the Government very soon with a view to at least giving an indication of providing a formula by which the prices of the ESB will be reduced.  This will make Irish steel more competitive.  The other area that would need some attention is the quota system.  The quota should be increased and if the Minister can use his good offices to ensure that that will be done then the workforce and management of Irish Steel will get the kind of help they require to make sure that they will not alone survive but prosper again.  The commitment of the Minister here today to the workforce, the management of Irish Steel and the whole area of east Cork can do nothing but good and as a result one can visualise Irish Steel going from strength to strength.  I will give the remainder of my time to Deputy Lyons as he is from the Cork area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us, including my colleague, Deputy Wallace, from the constituency of Cork North-Central, have waited all day and I would appreciate if he could be accommodated for even one minute.  In that respect I cut out much of what I intended to say.  I will be briefer than brief, níos gairide ná gairid.  All of this money is already committed.  This money is relieving this State-owned company of <Col N="1284" /> the need to meet interest payments out of trading.  If I have any condemnation it is of the way that interest has accumulated to such an extent that much of this money is being paid in interest.  Who is making money out of Irish Steel?  The figures projected for 1983-84 show a total loss of £21 million &mdash; £4.1 million for depreciation, £4.9 million for operating loss and the remaining £12 million on interest.  If this Bill serves no other purpose than the elimination of that stranglehold of interest, it will be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The EEC has been referred to a number of times in the context of this Bill. The staff of Irish Steel and myself have received a commitment from our European member, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, that he will ensure in every way possible in the European Parliament the continuance of Irish Steel.  The workforce at the plant know that its continuance is without question both in the national and local interest and that, as the consultants' report indicates, the company can be a viable institution.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Crowley for accommodating me.  Perhaps the Minister would give the same consideration to Deputy Wallace so that he might make a short contribution to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions have been asked about performance in the 1983-84 marketing year both in regard to the volume of sales and the revenue.  The performance in the first nine months of that marketing year have been up to projection in terms both of volume and of revenue.  A report on the last three months of the year is not yet available.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies asked about the overrun and about the causes for it. There is a significant variety of causes contributing to the overrun which unfortunately time does not permit me to deal with.  I was asked about the obtaining of compensation.  Compensatión was obtained under the insurance provisions in respect of certain of the design faults and that compensation amounted to £1.5 million.  However, I understand it is not possible to obtain compensation in respect of what are described as general design shortcomings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen and others referred to absenteeism in the company.  In this respect the workforce must improve their record.  We are talking of jobs which historically have been bought at a very high price and a good attendance record is the best available measure of a worker's appreciation of his employment.  The record at Irish Steel in this respect has not been perfect.  During recent discussions with the chairman of the company I have asked him to ascertain what he can do to improve performance in this area. <Col N="1286" /> I will do everything possible to obtain the additional quotas for this company which are essential to its survival and to its reaching the viability that is necessary. This is something that will have to be negotiated not only with the Commission but also with the Governments of each of the other member states whose decision will be conveyed at the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern asked what the situation will be if the loss is continued beyond the period covered by the present injection of funds.  Clearly, the answer is that in that situation the company would close.  That is why it is so important for everyone concerned to use this last opportunity to the full to ensure that the company do not close.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the industry being strategic and said we should maintain it on strategic grounds. I do not accept that argument.  I do not believe any industry of this kind is justified solely on strategic grounds.  The decision I took was a commercial one.  It was not influenced by social or political considerations.  It was a commercial decision on the basis of our owing this money and, in the light of the various reports available to us, it looked more likely that if the company continued they would make some contribution towards paying back the money given to them in the past whereas in the event of closure all that money would fall due to be paid without there being any contribution from the company.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this Bill is not providing for £89 million of taxpayer's money to be given to Irish Steel.  By this Bill we are converting into equity debts the company already owe and which are entirely guaranteed by the taxpayer anyway.  They will have to be paid for by the taxpayer. Unfortunately that is what is happening in this case.</P>

It would have been eminently desirable that <Col N="1287" /> they had not been incurred, but they are guaranteed by the taxpayer and we must make a commercial decision on the situation as we find it.</P>
      <P>I thank all those Deputies who have contributed in such a constructive manner to the debate.  I have not been able to answer all the questions asked, but if any Deputy particularly wants a response on any matter I shall accommodate him, on his indicating that wish, either immediately or in writing.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £280,516,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1984, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, including certain services administered by that Office, <Col N="1289" /> and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>This revised Estimate provides for gross expenditure of £284,817,030 for the year 1984 as compared with a provisional out-turn of £289,113,000 for corresponding services in 1983, an overall decrease of £4.296 million or 1.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Appropriations-in-Aid are estimated at £4.301 million compared to a corresponding 1983 outturn of £4.377 million. These figures take account, of course, of the transfer of the Industry function from the Department of Industry and Energy in December 1983.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be interested to know how the gross estimate of £284.817 million is made up.  The sum of £139.203 million represents capital expenditure, with the balance of £145.614 million going on current expenditure.  On an expenses classification basis, £9.52 million is for departmental administration and salaries or 3.3 per cent; £1.905 million for other departmental operating expenses, or 0.7 per cent; grants-in-aid to State Bodies £216.943 million, or 76.2 per cent; and services administered by my Department, including subsidies, £56.449 million, or 19.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>I intend to publish a White Paper on Industrial Policy on 12 July.  The White Paper is a statement of industrial policy for the decade ahead and represents the Government's response to the Telesis and NESC Report on Industrial Policy, published in October, 1982.  It also reflects the subsequent detailed analysis carried out on these reports and some of the major elements in the IDA's strategic plan.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress most strongly that the time taken in the preparation of the White Paper did not delay in any way the implementation of a number of major initiatives in industrial development over the last 18 months.  I will refer to some of them later on in my speech.</P>
    <P>The White Paper deals with the following matters.  It defines the scope, objectives and future directions of industrial policy.  Programmes and strategies are proposed not alone for manufacturing but also for internationally traded <Col N="1290" /> services.  These services provide quality employment and produce wealth and valuable export earnings.</P>
    <P>The primary objectives of industrial policy are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to create and maintain the maximum number of sustainable jobs;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to maximise the value added by industry and to retain this wealth for further investment and employment creation within the country;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to develop an internationally competitive industrial base, made up of both Irish and foreign owned firms, with priority being given to the promotion of indigenous and natural resource based industries;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to improve significantly the rate of return on the massive Exchequer investment to the commercial State companies.</P>
    <P>The future directions of our industrial policy are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Industrial incentives and State advisory services will be applied more selectively than in the past and resources will be concentrated on internationally traded manufacturing and service industries, particularly Irish owned firms.</P>
    <P>(2) There will be a switch in State resources from fixed asset investment to technology acquisition and export marketing development.</P>
    <P>(3)  Priority will be given to the attraction of overseas projects which will perform their strategic business functions in their Irish factories.</P>
    <P>(4) Through the tax incentives announced in this year's Finance Act, a risk capital market for investment in internationally traded manufacturing and service industries is being developed.</P>
    <P>(5) The Government will take all the measures within their powers to improve the business environment with the aim of increasing the competitiveness and profitability of industry and other productive sectors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> (6) They will promote effective education, training and worker mobility measures in the economy.</P>
    <P>(7) Other appropriate policies to capture the gains of industrial development will be devised.</P>
    <P>In setting out the policy framework, the White Paper charts our industrial performance in the past ten years when the rate of the average annual increases were 4.1 per cent in manufacturing output; 10.7 per cent in manufacturing exports; and 4.5 per cent in productivity.  Unfortunately manufacturing employment is at its lowest level for many years as job losses continue to exceed the rate of new jobs created.  It must be emphasised, however, that industrial employment has declined much more significantly in virtually all industrialised countries between 1970 and 1980 than it has in Ireland.  It is interesting that manufacturing employment reached its peak in Ireland in 1979 whereas it reached its peak in the US in 1950 and in Japan in 1970.  We continued to have growth in manufacturing employment longer than most other countries experienced.  This is probably a feature of the relative lateness of our industrialisation relative to other countries.  One should not necessarily see it as an indication of failure that the trends which applied in other countries are also having an effect here.</P>
    <P>The international environment affecting industrial development in Ireland over the next decade will be a difficult one.  World trade is forecast to grow at a slower rate than in the seventies.  Competition on international markets will increase as some of the newly industrialised countries enhance their infrastructure, skill and education levels.  Increasing unemployment and the rapid rundown of some of the traditional industries in Europe will intensify the bidding among member states for a shrinking pool of mobile international investment. Technological change and advances in productivity will be even more rapid than in recent years.</P>
    <P>We do have many advantages for industrial development.  Our incentive <Col N="1292" /> package is still the most generous and comprehensive available anywhere in the world.  We now have an adequate supply of skilled and semi-skilled labour.  This is in contrast to the position 15 years ago. On quite a number of occasions in the past 18 months, I have heard overseas companies speak very highly on the quality and commitment of the Irish workforce. Already the major investment programme in telecommunications in recent years is bearing fruit.  There has always been and there will continue to be a favourable attitude by the Irish Government towards inward investment by foreign industry.</P>
    <P>The White Paper will also outline the action being taken and planned to improve the business environment.  A favourable environment is necessary if existing firms are to develop and expand and it is essential to the continued attraction of investment from overseas.  The extent to which the Government can give relief to industry from cost pressures has been seriously inhibited by our straitened Exchequer circumstances which in turn are the sad legacy of the spendthrift policies of the 1977-81 period.  An important initiative has been the establishment in 1983 of the Industrial Costs Monitoring Group which is a permanent body and includes an independent industrialist among its members as well as representatives of various State agencies and Government Departments.  The first report by the group, which will be available soon, will set down a quantitative framework within which changes in costs and prices affecting industry can be assessed in a systematic way.</P>
    <P>New and improved incentives are proposed in the Paper to tackle the deep seated weaknesses of Irish industry in product and technology development and export marketing.</P>
    <P>Clear and unambiguous criteria are being laid down for grant assistance which require that a firm is either engaged primarily in exporting, supplying skilled parts and components to industry or are subject to import competition on the Irish market.  The IDA is now, as part of its new strategy, adopting a company development approach rather <Col N="1293" /> than a narrow individual project focus. This is a pilot scheme aimed at directing State assistance, both financial and non-financial, to the key areas of the company and key industries with potential for development.</P>

CTT estimate that there may be up to 200 <Col N="1294" /> indigenous firms which have the potential of achieving a significant growth in their exports, but who are constrained by shortage of finance to cover the expenses associated with entering or developing new markets.  It is widely recognised that financial institutions are reluctant to make funds available for marketing activities which have no means to meet the usual banking demands as regards collateral or security.  There will be specific programmes in the White Paper to address this problem.</P>
    <P>CTT will also initiate an expanded market research programme.  The need for this arises from a lack of commitment by many indigenous firms to export market research.  The capacity of such firms to compete in export markets depends on their ability to monitor and respond to the ever changing pattern of market demand.  Failure to do this in the past has resulted in product obsolescence and lack of product adaptation and development. The CTT scheme is being designed to overcome this.</P>
    <P>Many small firms, because of their size and limited production runs, are unable to sustain export marketing progress, even with the help of CTT grants. Accordingly, I am formulating proposals in conjuction with CTT to increase group marketing programmes for small firms exporting complementary but non-competing products, so as to enable them to establish a foothold in export markets and to gain experience.</P>
    <P>Finally, I believe there are enormous possibilities for developing exports of goods and services.  As the House is aware the IDA have been engaged for some time now in activities designed to attract services firms to Ireland.  In addition, legislation was enacted in 1983 to enable CTT to give assistance to exporting firms in the services sector.</P>
    <P>This legislation broadens the range of Córas Tráchtála's existing activity, which was mainly concerned with merchandise goods, by enabling them to promote and develop the export of service activities. The Oireachtas also enacted the Insurance Act, 1983, which extends to services activities the existing export insurance facilities for merchandise goods.  The <Col N="1295" /> range of services which CTT may now promote are designated by ministerial order and include such areas as medical and computer services and various forms of consultancy.  The response from firms in the export of services sector has been good and CTT currently have 250 firms on their books.  While it is difficult to measure exports in the services area the opportunities are very good and CTT expect exports to rise by 50 per cent this year over the 1983 figure of £144 million.</P>
    <P>I also propose to establish a foreign services committee.  The need for this committee arises directly from the Export Promotion Amendment Act, 1983, which extends Coras Tráchtála's role in this area and the Insurance Act of the same year which enables the provision of export credit insurance facilities in support of service exports.  The whole purpose of the legislation is to capitalise on the many opportunities for export of services, and the objective of the foreign services committee will be to ensure that this potential is realised as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Our natural resources, particularly food and timber, remain under-utilised. If we are to gain maximum national benefit from the development of these resources, a system of long-term contracts needs to be devised between the producer and the processor.  It is only in this way that both partners can expect a reasonable return on their investments and guarantee regularity and quality of supplies.  Mechanisms to overcome these problems are contained in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>It is true that everyone talks about the potential of the food industry but there has been a noticeable shortage of ideas as to how this potential can be realised. Some people seem to think that all that is required is increased output at farm level, and, while increased farm production is, of course, highly desirable, the fact is that we are often unable to sell at reasonable prices what we are already producing.</P>
    <P>Huge amounts of Irish beef and dairy produce now go into intervention. Obviously, something is wrong when we <Col N="1296" /> become so dependent on sales into intervention. The problem is that we have not been producing food products that the consumer wants.  That is why the long-term contracts idea is quite important, because it will enable the processor who is more closely in touch with the consumer, to have a mechanism of ensuring that his needs are taken properly into account by the producer from the very earliest stage of production on the farm.</P>
    <P>The food business has become very sophisciated in recent years, and today's consumer demands more than just basic products such as beef, bacon, butter and cheese.  Whether we like it or not, the demands of the market-place have been changing, with increased emphasis on processed products and frozen foods. Meanwhile, we have been producing surpluses of beef and basic dairy products, such as butter and skim milk powder.  In other words, we have been going the wrong way about marketing our food &mdash; producing first and then endeavouring to sell our produce as a sort of by-product of production.  Clearly, what is needed instead is a market-led approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Food processing firms must develop products to meet the change in demand; they must produce them to the highest standards and they must adopt a more professional approach to marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One may ask what is the Government doing to encourage this activity. Obviously there is a limit to what any Government can do to stimulate activity in a particular industrial sector where, in fact, the actors are in the private sector. A very wide range of incentives and support services is provided by the State to firms in the food business.  In relation to product development, for example, R and D and feasibility study grants are available from the IDA and technical advice and support is directly and readily available from the IIRS Food Technology Division.  Capital grants are, of course, available for new projects and marketing assistance is provided by several agencies.  May I just interpolate there <Col N="1297" /> that part of the problem is that although there are many State agencies assisting the food business, many are under different Ministers and do not always pursue the same lines of policy.  In many ways, the problems which exist between producer and processor are mirrored by the same problems between the agencies and Ministers responsible for producers, processors and other sectors of the food industry.  It is to find a practical solution to this problem that the Committee of Ministers of State on the food industry have been established.  They have a number of useful recommendations already, one of which was acted upon almost immediately.  I expect that they will do a lot of valuable work in the future, bringing a political impetus to an area where decision-making of the detailed kind is very necessary.</P>
    <P>Something further which the Government can do is to ensure that all of this support and assistance is provided in the most advantageous manner possible by the various Departments and agencies involved.  It is for this purpose that I have, as I said, with the approval of my colleagues, the Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries and Forestry, established a high level group, comprising the Ministers of State at the relevant Departments, to co-ordinate and maximise the activities of the various Departments and State agencies involved with the food industry. They have had a number of meetings and I am hopeful that they will be in a position to put forward quickly some positive proposals which will strengthen the Government's contribution to the industry.</P>
    <P>I now turn to foreign industry.  Foreign industry has brought many benefits.  At present overseas firms employ over 80,000 people and have increased their share of total employment in manufacturing from 27 per cent to 36 per cent in the last ten years; they produce over £5,000 million worth of goods a year; they buy goods and services in Ireland of £1,600 million per annum and export goods to the value of £3,500 million.</P>
    <P>There has been much public debate in recent months on the level of repatriation of profits by overseas companies.  Repatriated profits of overseas companies in <Col N="1298" /> Ireland amount to approximately 13 per cent of the sales revenue of these firms. They amount to 55 per cent of the profits earned by these companies in Ireland. The balance, 45 per cent, is reinvested here.  It must be remembered that the &ldquo;profits&rdquo; earned in Ireland by an affiliate of an overseas company are not necessarily profits earned by the Irish company.</P>
    <P>Thus, for example, if a US drugs manufacturer spends several hundred million pounds developing a new product which he subsequently decides to manufacture in Ireland, the Irish operation will be required to recoup the development moneys already spent before the company even come to Ireland.  Thus, the so-called profits to the Irish subsidiary will not necessarily be profit to the owners, but rather will be used to cover costs already incurred in facilitating the establishment of the Irish operation in the first place.</P>
    <P>The fact that Ireland is a profitable location for overseas companies is a major element in the IDA's overseas promotion programme.  If this were not generally the case, we would not attract these companies to Ireland in the first instance.</P>
    <P>There are several reasons why profit repatriation has grown in recent years, first, the growth in recent years of the turnover of these firms, secondly, the slow down in reinvestment anywhere by firms associated with the recession, thirdly, US tax breaks associated with purchase of parent company debt by overseas affiliates.</P>
    <P>The policy of attracting investment from abroad will continue.  The White Paper strongly reaffirms this, and there will be no sudden withdrawal of incentives. The emphasis from now on will be to award higher levels of grants to projects which incorporate key business functions and lower grants for mere production units.</P>
    <P>The importance of the development of internationally traded services and making Ireland an attractive location for such services is also stressed in the White Paper.  I have already referred to the new powers for the promotion of services given to CTT in 1983.  Despite a promising <Col N="1299" /> start in 1982 the rate of job creation and projects approved under the IDA's new International Services Programme last year were less than expected.</P>
    <P>One area in which there is forecast to be tremendous growth worldwide till the end of the decade is computer services. The Finance Act, 1984, extended the 10 per cent manufacturing tax to computer services which were previously liable at 45 per cent.  This will give Ireland a major advantage in attracting computer services from abroad and ensure the expansion by existing companies here.  Already the IDA have undertaken a major programme overseas promoting this new 10 per cent incentive.</P>
    <P>The IDA have also recently established a National Software Centre.  It has an initial capital of £1 million.  It is the first time that the authority have set up an independent subsidiary.  The main functions of the centre will be: (i) to provide technical assistance to Irish companies so as to ensure that they have the skills to compete on export markets; (ii) to give advanced training in software techniques, and (iii) to develop contract software to enable Ireland to compete for the development of sophisticated software for EEC and other international organisations.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming White Paper on Industrial Policy will incorporate details of the Government's proposals for the National Development Corporation.  The principal functions which the corporation will perform are as follows: (a) acting as a State investment company in new or existing ventures in the private sector; (b) assisting in the development of structurally strong Irish firms; (c) investing in projects in natural resources &mdash; related sectors such as food and timber processing and mariculture; (d) launching new projects and stimulating initiatives in the existing State industries; (e) assisting in the establishment of development companies to provide services for small firms on a commercial basis.  Legislation will now be drafted to establish the NDC.</P>
    <P>The Government see the NDC as a body which will complement existing industrial policy instruments and generate both jobs and wealth in the economy, <Col N="1300" /> as well as direct financial profit for the State, the taxpayer and the community. It will not be a grant-giving body or a home for &ldquo;lame ducks&rdquo;, but will operate under rigorously commercial criteria which will be fully debated here in the House.</P>
    <P>The National Enterprise Agency, which I reactivated in mid-1983, will continue to actively progress its work on hand pending the formal establishment of the NDC which will take over its work. The NEA has already made a small number of investments and has been allocated a capital budget of £3 million for this purpose in 1984.  The establishment of the NDC, as an equity investment body, will complement the new venture capital tax incentive announced in the budget and outlined in detail in this year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides income tax relief for qualifying investors of equity in unquoted manufacturing and certain service companies.  It allows an investor to write-off annually up to £25,000 against taxable income in new ordinary shares on condition that the investment is retained for five years.  This is an important new scheme, and I am confident that it will attract a significant amount of external funding to developing enterprises, thereby strengthening their equity base.</P>
    <P>There is clear evidence that too many Irish firms are over-dependent on bank borrowings, which curtails their development potential at times of recession and high interest rates.  These measures to provide a source of extra equity should help to rectify this deficiency.  The White Paper also deals with the promotion of small industries and the plans for providing a one-stop-shop service to these industries in the regions.  This was referred to in the report by the Committee on Small Business.  They referred to the confusion which exists amongst small business people in getting the type of assistance they need.  I hope the reorganisation measures contained in the White Paper will provide a more comprehensible as well as comprehensive service to small businesses, particularly at local and regional level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> To improve the opportunities for small industries to gain an increasing share of the skilled supply business of foreign companies here, the IDA launched a major National Linkage Programme last November.  Initially this programme is being concentrated on the electronics sector.  This sector has an annual raw material-components requirements of over £400 million, of which less than 20 per cent is now being met by Irish firms. This is an important programme.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance, I was instrumental in having tax concessions introduced in the 1982 Finance Act designed to promote the concepts of profit sharing or worker shareholding in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The reaction of the business community and the trade unions in this area until relatively recently has been disappointing. The adoption of profit sharing schemes, and employee shareholding in particular, on a wide scale in Ireland would represent a radical change from our traditional thinking in the area of industrial relations.  In my opinion such a radical change is now a necessity if our industry is to continue to compete successfully on world markets.</P>
    <P>To promote greater interest in worker shareholding, the Government decided to improve the tax incentives for approved profit sharing schemes in this year's Finance Act.  The limit on the percentage of company profits distributed under such schemes which may be exempted from tax has now been removed.  In addition, the value of shares which may be allocated tax free to an employee in any one year has been raised to £5,000 from £1,000.</P>
    <P>I believe the spread of more information and discussion on profit sharing and worker shareholding is essential to the successful development of these concepts in Ireland, and I have recently requested the NESC to undertake a study in this area.  Also, I look forward to discussing these issues with the employers' organisations and trade unions shortly as I believe that progress on these matters will be an effective step to ensure the success and efficiency of Irish industry <Col N="1302" /> and the prosperity and security of Irish workers for the future.</P>
    <P>The Government are very conscious of the distress and despondency being experienced by those who, through no fault of their own, have been made redundant, and are anxious that such people should be given every opportunity and encouragement to set up in business themselves.  At the end of last year, the Government introduced a new Enterprise Allowance Scheme designed to assist those unemployed people who wish to set up their own business.  The scheme, by providing the initial financial incentive which can be vitally important during the early stages of establishing a new business, has proved a very successful means of encouraging enterprise by the unemployed. By the end of last year some 1,700 people were benefiting under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Enterprise Allowance Scheme together with the services operated by State agencies such as the IDA, AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the Irish Goods Council now provide a comprehensive range of practical advice and assistance to redundant workers who are considering starting a new business.  At my suggestion the IDA are currently finalising a leaflet for redundant workers incorporating details of the various services available from all State agencies in this area and have already published a comprehensive series of booklets on how to set up and run a small firm.</P>
    <P>It is very important that people who are becoming redundant should be given an opportunity to consider the possibility of using their redundancy money to set up a small business of their own before they commit it to some other purpose.  I hope this leaflet, when it is completed, will be issued to all workers who are becoming redundant, so that they can consider it in time rather than commit themselves to other expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Government, through the Employment Task Force, are also considering ways in which encouragement and assistance can best be provided to promote a community-based response to unemployment.  A number of community groups are currently engaged in initiatives <Col N="1303" /> to tackle unemployment in their own areas.</P>
    <P>Co-ordinated community action, in consultation with the relevant State agencies, offers exciting potential for local interests to participate in identifying community needs and productively employing local manpower resources.  In my own constituency of Meath, for example, the Navan Chamber of Commerce has established an Industrial Development Trust to promote new industry in the Navan area.  In addition, self-help groups for the unemployed have been established in a number of areas.  Under the new Voluntary Work Scheme for the unemployed, which is operated by the Department of Social Welfare, groups such as these can now undertake valuable community work with the asssistance of the unemployed people who will continue to receive their unemployment benefits. They will not be ruled out as they would have been hitherto under the pre-existing rules.</P>
    <P>Other issues dealt with in the White Paper include: measures for improving the performance of the commercial State companies; the new institutional arrangements for industrial development and the steps being taken to eliminate the duplication of State services to industry and sectoral strategies.</P>
    <P>When moving the Estimate for 1983, I referred to the work being carried out by the Sectoral Development Committee. The objectives of this work is the identification on a joint co-operative basis by representatives of workers, employers and Government bodies of how the efficiency and competitiveness of sectors and their sub-sectors can be improved in order to maximise their development potential in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sectoral studies on the textiles, clothing and mechanical engineering industries were published last November.  The strategies which have been proposed by the Sectoral Development Committee for these sectors accords with the company development approach now being pursued by the IDA and the other State agencies.</P>
    <P>Other sectors or studies which are <Col N="1304" /> being carried out or planned by the committee are: electronics and information technology; beef; construction and related manufacturing industry; chemicals and pharmaceuticals; plastics; dairy products; and fishing.  In addition to these, a horizontal type of study on marketing is also in progress.</P>
    <P>While in overall economic terms 1983 was another bleak year a review of the year indicates that a number of positive features emerged.  During 1983 the rate of inflation continued to decline and the balance of payments deficit continued to be reduced.  Perhaps the most significant development in 1983 occurred in manufacturing industry.  Output from the Irish manufacturing sector grew by 7 per cent in volume terms.  The gross value of goods produced by the country's industries exceeded £12,000 million, over £9,000 million of which represented value added to the Irish economy &mdash; an increase of £870 million in 1983 alone.  This growth was a welcome change from the previous year when no growth whatever was recorded.  In addition, the 1983 performance was the highest growth rate in manufacturing output of any EEC country.</P>
    <P>The entire growth in industrial output in 1983 was attributable to the 14 per cent rise in the volume of industrial export whereas world trade in manufactured goods grew by a mere 1 per cent.  This outturn represents our greatest increase in market share over the past ten years. This growth was spurred mainly by the extra output from companies with substantial IDA investment producing office and data processing machinery, chemicals and consumer goods.  The increase in output and exports was also undoubtedly helped by the increase in production per worker in industry of the order of 12 per cent during the year.</P>
    <P>During the year also the IDA actively continued the on-going task of industrial development, and over 800 investment projects involving a planned capital investment in fixed assets of over £500 million were negotiated by IDA staff. About 500 of these agreements were with small firms.</P>
    <P>Entrepreneurs and small businesses <Col N="1305" /> continued to show high interest in setting up new ventures or expanding existing ones.  In particular, the number of executives leaving secure employment to &ldquo;go out on their own&rdquo; was very encouraging. In all, 60 senior executives agreed to establish their own new projects under the IDA's Enterprise Development Programme in 1983, compared with 35 in 1982.</P>
    <P>One hundred and ten overseas projects, including 30 small industries were approved during 1983 &mdash; similar to the level of activity in 1982.  There was a relatively more rapid rate of growth in domestically-generated projects during the year.  These have a planned investment in fixed assets of £300 million.  They include over 30 new projects and 40 expansions being undertaken by companies already based in Ireland.  In the light of the fall-off in the overall volume of international mobile industrial investment, this represents a strong performance.</P>
    <P>A tangible result of this investment activity is the rate of take-up of IDA advance factories which improved considerably during the year when 101 units at 32 locations throughout the country were occupied by Irish and overseas companies. This represents one million sq. ft. of IDA advance factory space.</P>
    <P>The IDA estimate that Irish and overseas firms bringing IDA-backed investment on-stream recruited 11,000 Irish people to new jobs during 1983 &mdash; a significant achievement against the backdrop of the continuing recession in Europe.  This is in line with the IDA's target set at the outset of 1983.  Irish firms, mainly small firms, contributed just half, some 5,500 of these jobs, with US firms accounting for 3,000 of these. Almost 1,500 of these jobs were created in firms producing computer and office machinery, almost 1,500 jobs arose in the food sector and 1,300 in clothing.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead to 1984 the IDA estimate that output should grow again by 6-7 per cent and industrial exports by 15 per cent and, for the first time in four years, private consumer spending is set to show an increase.  Investment activity is also expected to show an increase in <Col N="1306" /> 1984 and various measures taken by the Government will give further impetus to such investment.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company plans to continue their job creation drive in 1984.  As part of a major review of all of the company's main activities, new directions and strategies are being formulated by the company which will chart the course of development of the estate for the next couple of years.  In the current year, however, the company will be concentrating a significant part of their resources on the conversion into actual jobs on the ground of projects which were approved in 1982 and 1983 and which are now at a start-up stage.  The company see as one of their major objectives in 1984 the creation of a net growth in actual jobs on the Shannon industrial estate.</P>
    <P>Under the company's small indigenous industry programme which has been running successfully now since 1978, the company have two key objectives.  One is the creation of jobs and the encouragement of existing small industries to expand and create new job opportunities. The second key objective is to increase the number of exporting firms in the small industry area, thus ensuring that any expansion in these industries will be based on high quality export-oriented products which have the capacity to sustain jobs in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Development Company's Innovation Centre has increased its capacity to house nursery industries which are in the course of developing new products, and this additional space will ensure a larger output of new high quality export oriented firms from the centre in the current and future years. The services and advice available in the innovation centre are now available throughout the country through IDA offices and other national agencies.</P>
    <P>I will now deal in more detail with export promotion.  If Ireland is to take advantage of the open international trading system we must have faith in our ability to compete with what is best from other countries not just on price but also on quality, design, delivery dates and after-sales service.  It is clear that there is <Col N="1307" /> no turning back to the protectionist policies of the past.  The increased volume of our output, which far exceeds the capacity of the home market to absorb it, the growing size of our labour force and the need to find new outlets to absorb increases in our output, rules out a policy of protection.  Our future clearly lies in having equality of access to the shop shelves of the world where the world consumer, who is always right in this case, can choose for himself what is best.</P>
    <P>Having successfully contributed to keeping the channels of world trade relatively free of restrictive and protectionist tendencies over the past year, I am pleased to say that Irish exporters have been equally successful in exploiting the opportunities for exporting their goods and services to the markets of the world. They were, of course, assisted by a number of factors in 1983.</P>
    <P>Possibly the most encouraging was the continued economic recovery in North America, Japan and to a lesser extent in the United Kingdom, and the way in which this recovery has been maintained and is now spreading to continental Europe.  Consumer demand is now beginning to rise and world output is expected to grow in 1984.  Despite this, 1983 was still a difficult year for Irish firms striving to retain competitiveness.  In spite of these difficulties, total exports rose by an impressive 22 per cent to produce a new record for exports.  This was a truly creditable performance and outstrips the showing of many other industralised countries.  The performance gives us confidence for the future and shows what management and workers in exporting firms can achieve.  Manufacturing industry accounted for 62.5 per cent of our exports in 1983 and within this sector the main impetus came from machinery, transport equipment and chemicals. Exports of live animals and food, drink and tobacco accounted for the 13 per cent increase over 1982.</P>
    <P>Exports have contributed enormously to reducing our balance of trade in 1983. The Government through their financial policies have brought inflation under control and interest rates have been pulled <Col N="1308" /> down from the high peaks of a few years ago.  Many reputable commentators are now saying that we have reached the turning point and that the stage is being set for a period of recovery with exports leading the way.  Whichever view one may take of the short to medium term economic prospects, there is no doubt but that our export growth is still developing at an impressive rate.  At the end of 1983, CTT forecast an increase of 11 per cent by volume for exports in 1984. CTT, on the basis of the latest trade statistics, now estimate that total exports will increase in value by 23 per cent with a volume increase of 13.5 per cent.  This is an improvement on their prediction at the end of 1983.</P>
    <P>While the White Paper will reflect the new dimension and direction which the Government propose to give to exports, there will, of course, continue to be an ongoing need for the present range of advice, support and services offered by CTT and adapted as appropriate to changing circumstances.  We are thus in a somewhat transitional state at present. This year the Government have allocated some £17.96 million to CTT.  In keeping with the new thrust of policy, there will be a need for greater selectivity to ensure that these scarce funds are being spent to maximum advantage.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, an ongoing need in all areas of Exchequer spending to ensure that the range of programmes fully reflects the priority needs, and nowhere is this more important than in the exports area.  Last year, my predecessor established a high level group comprising representatives of my Department and CTT to review policy and programmes.  This group have been working on the critical question of targeting and measurement, establishing criteria for measuring the effectiveness of the board's various schemes and programmes and generally measuring the contribution which CTT make to the national export drive.  To assist it in its work the high level group recently decided to acquire the services of an analyst.  I believe it is indispensable that all our State agencies periodically stand back from the fray and that there is a critical review of what they are about <Col N="1309" /> and the means by which they set about implementing policy and achieving objectives.  Meanwhile the main goal of CTT's export promotion programme for 1984 is order winning promotions that will generate immediate or medium term business for Irish companies.  To achieve this Córas Tráchtála will provide national stands at 19 trade fairs across the world. CTT trade missions will go to South East Asia including Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore and also to Australia, Japan and the Far East, while store promotions will take place in many cities around the world from Macys in New York to Meyers in Berlin.</P>
    <P>CTT with my full encouragement will also continue their employment support schemes in 1984.  Started back in 1981, this scheme involves the training of specialist export marketing personnel, and it has been applied to selected companies for which it is envisaged that the sales executives will make a significant contribution to increase exports.</P>
    <P>This employment support scheme is very important because it has enabled a number of companies who normally could not afford the services of a sales representative to acquire one initially at a relatively modest cost.  The problem with smaller companies is that, very often, one person is responsible for production and sales and usually sales suffer because the person in charge is skilled in the production area.  This scheme enables that deficiency in smaller firms to be remedied.</P>
    <P>This year CTT have earmarked £400,000 for the employment support scheme and it is envisaged that this will result in an additional 38 marketing executives being placed in overseas markets. I sincerely hope I will be able to obtain more money for this next year.</P>
    <P>The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards will be required to play a major role in helping firms to upgrade their product and production processes and thereby compete effectively on international markets.  A major review of the role and functions of the institute has been carried out by the National Board for Science and Technology.</P>
    <P>This review has helped in the process <Col N="1310" /> of identifying the strategies needed to be adopted by the institute to meet the difficult market conditions for indigenous firms.  Heretofore, the institute have tended to provide a relatively passive service to industry providing, on request, testing, analysis and technical information. In future, the institute will be expected to assume a much more active developmental role.  They will work closely with the other State development agencies &mdash; most notably IDA and CTT. Emphasis will be placed on seeking out those companies and industry sectors where product and process improvements will help significantly in competing internationally.</P>
    <P>I envisage IIRS staff being located in some of the foreign offices of bodies like the IDA and CTT where their technical expertise could be used to assist in the importation of technology from abroad which they will be qualified to recognise as valuable.  The institute will need to ensure that all opportunities for technology transfer through licensing arrangements with foreign firms are fully availed of.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the major cost overrun which took place in the construction of the administration-information technology building in Ballymun for the IIRS.  I have already made a detailed statement on this matter to the House.  It is an unfortunate occurrence and does not reflect well on our foremost technical services institute.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation of £1.71 million to the institute for 1984 includes £1.474 million which is necessary to complete the building.  Without this allocation, the second phase of the building would have remained unusable.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware of the strenuous efforts made by the Government and the IDA to find a viable industrial project for Clondalkin Paper Mills.  The agreement between myself, IDA and Freedman McCormack Investments International (FMI) providing for a paper-conversion project at the mills, was concluded in November 1983, following a great deal of intensive negotiation and evaluation. The company also intends to progress to paper-making and they have been given <Col N="1311" /> an option on the mills for this purpose, on condition that they satisfy the IDA on the viability of the undertaking.  I have had carried out the renovation of the part of the premises which is being leased to the promoters of the new project and operations have now commenced at the mills.</P>
    <P>The provision in my Department's 1984 Estimates in respect of Clondalkin is £190,000.  However, significant additional expenditure was required following the Government's decision in respect of FMI.  Total expenditure in 1984 is now estimated at £498,000.</P>
    <P>This expenditure relates to my commitment, as part of the agreement, to meet the cost of the necessary renovations to the leased area of the mills as well as other substantial expenditure on the care, maintenance and security of the plant.</P>
    <P>The Irish Film Board have been in operation for just two and a half years now and in that short time have made quite a significant contribution to the development of an Irish film industry. Since their inception in August 1981, the Film Board have financially assisted the production of some 14 films, all of which have now been completed and released. Some of these films (for example, &ldquo;Angel&rdquo;, &ldquo;Attracta&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Country Girls&rdquo;) have received considerable acclaim in Ireland and in other countries. I am hopeful that this can be followed up with commercial success in the coming years and that there can be a positive return on the State's investment in the industry.  Critical acclaim will not satisfy me, we must also have profits from these films.</P>
    <P>The original motivation for setting up the National Board for Science and Technology was the fragmentation of the national effort in science and technology and the realisation that, if there were to be an effective contribution to national development from this quarter, a more structured and better organised system was necessary.  Toward this end, and in addition to their co-ordination and promotional functions, the NBST were particularly given the role of advising <Col N="1312" /> Government and of being a source of detached and informed technical advice, which would not otherwise be available.</P>
    <P>I appointed a new board of directors to the NBST last December.  The aim of the board which is representative of industry, higher education and the public sector has the mandate to give new impetus to the activities of the NBST and to ensure that they contribute to our industrial development drive.  The new board are working very effectively and the increased emphasis which was placed on having industrialists on the board has been a success.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the science budget.  The science budget mechanism derived from an original proposal to have a central body with the responsibility for allocating all resources for science and technology in the public sector.  Because this concept did not receive general acceptance, it was decided, and this was endorsed in this House in the NBST Statute, that there should be a science budget mechanism which would comprise a technical-based input of recommendations into the consideration and approval of the annual Estimates.  In practice, this mechanism has not, so far, achieved the result expected of it.  This has happened for several reasons, particularly because of the constriction of the time now available in each financial year for the detailed consideration of Estimates.  I have, therefore, directed the NBST to adopt a new approach to this mechanism under which they will make broader based recommendations in advance of detailed Estimate proposals.</P>
    <P>The basic problem with the NBST's science budget process in the past was that it consisted of saying what should be done after the event.  It is an entirely fruitless exercise to tell people where they were wrong.  I have changed the science budget process now so that they will be making suggestions in advance to the Government before Estimates are finalised about what might be done in the future rather than what should have been done in the past.  This is a logical change in the science budget process and will mean that what has hitherto been largely <Col N="1313" /> a waste of time will now be worth while.</P>
    <P>The old scientific research grant scheme of the NBST has now been split into two new elements.  The first of these is a scientific research programme intended to promote excellence in scientific research and to promote the retention and attraction of high quality personnel and to enable Ireland to be involved in the forefront of scientific research in a limited number of areas. The second element is now the strategic research programme.  The object of this programme is to promote the development of a competitive advantage for our industry in the medium term.  Projects under this programme are intended to cover pre-competitive research or the development of a particular technology relevant to a group of companies or sector or the further understanding and development of a national resource. Scientific and technological infrastructure is a basic essential element in industrial development.  It is in consequence of the determination of the Government to provide this infrastructure that a major effort was initiated to develop the National Microelectronics Research Centre.</P>
    <P>In this short period since the centre's establishment in Cork it has attracted substantial business in the form of contract research work, not only from Irish based firms and research organisations but also from abroad.</P>
    <P>In insurance, the significant event of the past year was the enactment of the Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1983 in October, 1983.  The main purpose of that Act was to amend existing insurance legislation by adding to the range of actions which can be taken by the Minister to deal with situations arising in the event of uncertain solvency of non-life insurance undertakings. In particular, it provides an option which avoids the automatic and disastrous consequences of winding-up and creates an environment which can allow an insurer to be restored to a sound financial position.  The High Court subsequently appointed an administrator to the PMPA Insurance Company Limited on the application of the then Minister. I think it appropriate to recall the insurance <Col N="1314" /> industry's comment at the time, that the action taken contributed to the security of policyholders and insurers.  While the administration is proceeding satisfactorily, it is obvious that it will be quite some time before the PMPA's business is placed on a secure financial footing.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the concern being expressed regarding motor insurance and young drivers.  Young drivers are, as evidenced by their extremely high accident and claims rate <i>vis-à-vis</i> older drivers, a greater risk and the premium charged must reflect that factor.  The Motor Premiums Advisory Committee &mdash; a committee set up some years ago to examine such matters as loadings on age or other grounds &mdash; have indicated in their reports that the loadings applied to young drivers broadly reflect the additional risk young drivers represent.  The question of loadings will, however, be further examined by a new representative board to be set up on motor insurance, which will take account of the valuable work of the earlier committee.</P>
    <P>Another area which I will be addressing during this year is that of the regulation of the activities of insurance intermediaries.  My Department recently re-examined the question of the regulation of insurance brokers, and the general outlines of four possible methods of regulation were given recently by the Minister of State and the various interested parties were asked for comments. I am accordingly awaiting the response of the bodies involved.  I believe that insurance companies which accept business from intermediaries also have a role to play.  Insurers should, at the very least, satisfy themselves as to the financial security and the professionalism of intermediaries with whom they do business.</P>
    <P>On the question of legislative changes generally, in March of this year I made regulations to give effect to the 1979 EEC First Life Directive.  These regulations will, I have no doubt, lead to increasing participation in the life insurance markets by new entrants, a situation which has already occurred in the non-life insurance market.  Since the implementation into Irish law of the First EEC Non-Life Directive, some 18 additional <Col N="1315" /> companies have been authorised to transact non-life business.  In fact in anticipation of the Life Regulations some five companies have already applied for, and received, licences to transact life assurance business.</P>
    <P>I intend to introduce, later in the year, a general insurance Bill.  This Bill is designed to consolidate my powers generally and will put at my disposal the legislative powers necessary to exercise the supervision required in today's insurance market.</P>
    <P>There have already been indications of the intention to continue with the business of the amendment of company law particularly in relation to the management and direction of limited liability companies.  The circumstances surrounding many corporate insolvencies in recent years have led to demands for restricting or abolishing limited liability status.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the abolition of the concept of limited liability would be in the best interest of our continuing industrial development.  Business development in the Western world generally has taken place on the basis of limited liability companies.  Moreover to expose every entrepreneur to the risk of losing all his personal assets in the event of the failure of his company for reasons outside his own control would certainly deter, or have an inhibiting effect, on business initiative.  Any measure which would produce such an effect would be highly undesirable particularly at this time in my view.</P>
    <P>At the same time, there can be no doubt that the privilege of limited liability has been abused by unscrupulous directors and managers, and this has led to widespread financial loss to creditors and employees who are thrown out of work. The Government are committed in their joint programme to curbing such abuses. That is the objective of a substantial Bill which I am now examining carefully.  I am having full regard to the many submissions which have been made to me by the various interested parties.  This is a measure of major importance which will, I believe, improve the business environment generally, control in a practical way <Col N="1316" /> the conduct of the affairs of companies, and help towards the elimination of malpractice in the management and direction of companies.</P>
    <P>I see the promotion of this legislation as an integral part of the programme for future economic development.  I will, shortly, be seeking Government approval for the formal drafting of these proposals.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other important issues in the company law area which are receiving my attention.  One such is the Fourth EEC Company Law Directive which is to harmonise the rules in all member states in relation to the preparation, publication and auditing of the individual accounts of public and private limited companies.  Implementation of this very technical measure will have a major impact both by significantly increasing the level of detailed disclosure required in accounts and particularly because it will remove the present exemption whereby private limited companies are not required to publish their accounts.  There are however, a number of optional provisions contained in the Directive which would allow individual member states to vary its full impact.  I am hopeful that I will be able to bring forward the necessary implementing legislation early in the autumn session of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>My Department are also preparing a measure to give effect to three EEC Directives relating to the Stock Exchange.  These deal with admission of securities to official listing, prospectuses for listed securities and interim reports furnished by listed companies.  I expect to sign shortly a statutory instrument giving effect to these EEC Directives.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the area of Company Law, I would like to refer briefly to the Companies Registration Office.  The changes which have occurred in company law legislation and those measures which I have outlined as being in the pipeline have a dramatic impact on the workload of the office.  This is particularly evidenced by the fact that there are now well in excess of 70,000 companies on the register compared with approximately 30,000 ten years ago.  I am aware of and <Col N="1317" /> can appreciate the frustrations experienced by members of the public at the delays which have occurred in their dealings with the Companies Registration Office.  However, I am pleased to state that steps to resolve these problems are well under way.</P>
    <P>A mechanisation strategy has been decided on which is a combination of computerisation, micro-film techniques and other ancillary office equipment. Some of the ancillary equipment has already been installed and a contract for the supply of computer equipment has been signed.  The installation of the computer is scheduled to take place in July. While the process of conversion to a computerised system will hardly be concluded before the end of 1985, it is expected that significant improvements in the level of service to the public and in the enforcement of the Acts will be achieved much sooner.</P>
    <P>In the area of competition policy I have arranged for the Restrictive Practices Commission to carry out a series of studies under section 12 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 into the professions with special reference to entry barriers and other practices operated by them. The main object of this exercise is to tackle undesirable practices which give rise to increased costs to consumers of the different services.  The Restrictive Practices Commission has in the past from my experience working with it as a Minister of State, and now as a Minister, tended to have peaks and valleys in its work, and in the valleys its resources were not being used to a great extent. Since 1977 I have felt that the Commission should be given a general mandate to pursue a particular area of activity on an ongoing basis, and that would more than fill any time it would have available to it between specific studies that might be referred to it by the Examiner.  I have felt that the most appropriate area it should have such a general mandate on is that of the professions.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that professional charges are very high, that the professions themselves largely control the entry of people to their professions and hence can indirectly have an influence on the <Col N="1318" /> likely level of incomes and charges operating within the professions and on costs in the economy generally.  This is in a sense inherent to the nature of a profession. It is very important that there should be a means of guaranteeing the public interest in regard to the activities of the professions, and this is precisely the role which the Restrictive Practices Commission can effectively discharge.  That is why I have given this general mandate to inquire into the professions.</P>
    <P>The choice of profession for first study will be a matter for the commission.  I do not propose to direct them to deal with lawyers or any particular group.  Naturally the commission will be prepared to take account of representations, and if Deputies have any views about professional practices which ought to be examined I would advise them to write to the Restrictive Practices Commission, who will now be in a position to respond.</P>
    <P>I have already announced publicly my intention to strengthen the Restrictive Practices Commission and to merge the activities of the Examiner and those of the Commission.  I hope to bring forward legislation to this end early in the next session.</P>
    <P>The other major area of competition legislation for which I have responsibility is the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  I will shortly be presenting to the Oireachtas the annual report under this legislation which will contain information on the number of cases examined under the legislation during 1983.  I understand that the report will show an increase in the number of cases notified to my Department.  However, the number of cases where the Act applied showed a reduction, which I believe reflects the continuing difficult trading conditions under which businesses have to operate at present.  Also the number of merger proposals which could be broadly described as rescue cases continues to be a large proportion of the total figure.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1984, which is before the Oireachtas provides for increased penalties for breaches of copyright. The increased penalties, coupled <Col N="1319" /> with the existing provisions in copyright legislation for search and seizure of infringing articles, will go a long way to meet the problems being caused, particularly for cinemas, film distributors and legitimate video dealers by the operations of video pirates.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to consumer protection.  One of the proposals which was discussed at all three consumer Councils was the draft Directive on Product Liability.  This directive would impose strict liability irrespective of fault on a producer of a product in respect of injury caused by a defect in the product.  In general, the injured party would simply have to prove the defect, the damage and the casual relationship between the two. The directive would give an important and additional form of protection to consumers as liability would be created whether or not the manufacturer was negligent, though some defences would be available to the manufacturer.  The directive has important ramifications for manufacturers and for the insurance industry, and partly as a result of this progress has been slow and there is still some way to go before the draft directive is finally agreed.  However considerable progress has been made.  All member states accept the principle of strict liability on which the directive would be founded and I believe that the directive will be agreed within the not-too-distant future.</P>
    <P>The proposal for a directive on doorstep sales was also considered by the consumer council, but there continues to be opposition to this from one member state.</P>
    <P>An important proposal on which discussion is likely to resume during our Presidency is that for a directive on consumer credit.  The Commission have now drawn up a revised proposal on this issue, in the light of the opinion of the European Parliament which was issued last July.  In times of recession, there is, understandably, strong opposition from industry to having additional burdens placed upon them.</P>
    <P>In 1983 regulations were made bringing the remaining elements of the EEC <Col N="1320" /> Food Labelling Directive into force with effect from 1 December 1983.  The effect of the regulations has been to provide consumers with a considerable amount of important information about the food they buy &mdash; ingredient lists, date-marks and quantity declarations must, among other details, now be given on most foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>I would also mention here the regulations which were made on 1 December 1983 and which give effect to an EEC directive relating to the indication of the prices on foodstuffs.  These regulations, which came into effect on 1 June 1984, require, in broad terms, that the selling price and, in certain instances, the unit price, that is the price per unit of weight or measure, of all foodstuffs be displayed.</P>
    <P>This information allied to the reduction in the number of sizes of various prepackaged products, including foodstuffs, should make it easier for an intending purchaser to compare the value of various products on a comparative price/weight/volume basis.  Indeed these developments, together with the requirements under the previously mentioned food labelling regulations to disclose the pertinent characteristics of foodstuffs, mark a major step forward in protecting the consumer's economic interests.</P>
    <P>Finally, on 8 November 1983 Ireland acceded to the Convention on the Control and Marking of Articles of Precious Metals.  The Hallmarking Act, 1981 was introduced to enable this to be done and was brought into effect on the same day in November 1983.  The advantage of accession is that Irish traders in precious metals will be able to compete favourably in the markets of other contracting states, including the UK which is the most important market for Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>Plans to make certain regulations and orders under domestic consumer protection legislation have been mentioned before so I will only refer to them briefly here.  In the near future I plan to make regulations under the Prices Act which will require comprehensive price displays to be shown by catering establishments.</P>
    <P>The Dáil today approved a draft order under the Consumer Information Act <Col N="1321" /> which will require those who sell in the course of a business, trade or profession to disclose their legal status in advertisements. The aim of this is to ensure that business sellers do not attempt to avoid their legal liabilities by posing as private sellers.</P>
    <P>The Dáil also approved today a further draft order under the Consumer Information Act relating to the marking of certain goods.</P>
    <P>As indicated to the House previously, certain aspects of consumer credit are under examination within my Department. I am particularly concerned about the practice of showing flat-rate interest levels in advertisements, and it is my intention to have measures taken to deal with the question at an early date.  Preliminary discussion has already taken place between my Department and a number of interested parties.</P>
    <P>On the subject of prices, the downward trend in the rate of inflation was maintained over the past year.  In 1983, the rate of increase in Irish consumer prices averaged 10.4 per cent compared with 17.1 per cent during 1982.  Indeed, the underlying rate of inflation, which excludes the effects of indirect tax increases, was around 7 per cent, despite the effective devaluation of the Irish punt in March 1983.  Indications for the coming year are for a continuation of this downward trend, and since the indirect tax increases in the January 1984 budget has added less than 1 per cent to the annual rate of inflation, there are very real possibilities for reducing our rate of inflation to EEC average levels, provided that every effort is made to reduce costs and improve efficiency.</P>
    <P>To achieve this, the NPC will continue to apply strict criteria in relation to the level of materials, overheads and labour costs that can be allowed to firms seeking price increases.  In the case of labour costs it has been evident that some firms in the sheltered sector settled for wage increases that were excessive.  While market forces in the case of these goods and services may not have been a sufficiently inhibiting factor for them, the exercise of price control ensured that these excessive wage costs were not reflected in consumer <Col N="1322" /> prices and these excess costs had to be absorbed out of profit, increased productivity or by other cost-cutting measures.</P>
    <P>It is an essential element of our future cost competitiveness that the level of price increases in Ireland should be maintained at or below the levels experienced by our competitors.  The impact of price increases is felt not only by the ordinary consumer but also by industry.  Inordinate price increases could not only lead to greater wage demands but could also affect industrial costs directly through excessive service charges, energy and raw material costs.  If Irish industry is to maintain and develop its markets at home and abroad the greatest moderation in domestic cost increases is essential.  The level of domestically generated costs for materials and services will be given full attention to ensure that the traded sectors of industry are not hindered by excessive costs.</P>
    <P>The level of oil prices here has for some time been the subject of critical comment. In the past week, on the advice of the National Prices Commission, I have introduced changes in the price control system applied to oil products which are designed to create a more flexible and transparent system, assist consumer awareness and encourage competition. The main effect of the changes introduced is that the maximum prices fixed by Order now reflect more closely international market prices and will in the future move more closely in line with prices in other EEC markets.  This will avoid situations which occurred at times in the more recent past when Irish prices remained excessively above those prevailing elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the subject of tourism. The Government this year in recognition of the importance it attaches to tourism and, in particular, to the primary and essential promotional role of Bord Fáilte have allocated the sum of £22.45 million for tourism promotion.  This allocation represents the highest amount ever provided for this purpose and is an increase of over £1.5 million on the corresponding provision for 1983.  The figure I mention includes the additional <Col N="1323" /> £300,000 specially provided in the budget for marketing in the United States which was seen to offer the prospect of very real growth in the current year.  I am very pleased to inform the House that the Government's decision to put greater emphasis on promotion is proving to have been well founded; early indications would suggest that the Bord Fáilte target of a 3-5 per cent increase in export tourism business will be achieved and, perhaps, exceeded this year.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead, I will be anxious to see still more resources in real terms being channelled into export tourism promotion. This, in my view, should be the priority area for expenditure in so far as future Government spending on tourism is concerned.  Minister of State Moynihan will be speaking later and will deal further with this matter.</P>
    <P>While I have attempted to cover as extensively as time permits most of the principal activities within my remit, there may be some matters on which Deputies would wish to ask for further information. I will be glad to deal with these during the course of the debate.  I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I must compliment the Minister on his stamina in getting through 76 pages before the break.  Certainly it was not all that inspiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage of their being mid-term in Government the Estimate for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism affords me and my colleagues an opportunity of examining the record of Government action, or perhaps it should be said, Government inaction.  Indeed I do not think the Minister himself had the appetite for much of the 76 pages he delivered because it clearly indicated exactly what I have been saying on many occasions, that this is a Government of all talk and no action.  Today we had 76 pages of that with very little content of any news in relation to the economy, the unemployed or indeed in relation to the overall economic activity for which this Minister is responsible.  My colleague, Deputy <Col N="1324" /> Flynn, will be dealing with the trade, commerce and tourism aspects of this Estimate.  Therefore I shall confine myself to the industrial aspect and all that that entails.</P>
    <P>This is an appropriate opportunity for us to examine the record of the present Minister, of the Government, in the very significant area of industrial employment and job creation.</P>
    <P>The starting point must be to examine what this Government said in their <i>Programme for Government</i> when they came in about this vital area which they recognised as one of the major problems facing the new Government, and what they have done about it since then.  It is all summed up in one sentence in the <i>Programme for Government</i> in which they stated clearly and unequivocally that they would halt and reverse the growth of unemployment.  I do not have to go into the statistics of what has happened about unemployment since this Government came into power.  Roughly 50,000 more people are unemployed since then.  Without being facetious, it is true to say that the only answer that the present Government have to offer in this area is a return to emigration.</P>
    <P>It is not possible with statistics as they are put together to quantify exactly how many people have left this country recently, in the last six or nine months, but there has been a very considerable outflow of young people who see no hope of a future for themselves or their families here.  That is the greatest indictment of Government policy since they came to power and now they are nearly in mid-term.  Some commentators would say at this stage that it could be different from mid-term, it could be nearing an end, and with the stresses and strains that have been appearing in Government recently that is not an unfair comment.  I heard one observer saying recently that for the first 18 months <i>rigor mortis</i> had set in but now decomposition is beginning to take place.</P>
    <P>Action is what Government is all about.  Governments are elected to govern the country, to take necessary and harsh decisions if they must be taken to <Col N="1325" /> arrest the problems and produce the policies that will solve them.  We have heard plenty of talk from them here today but we have not seen any action.  In this second last day of another Dáil term we still have not an industrial policy.  We have heard that we will get it next month. Maybe we will and I hope we will.  I am now going to go into my contribution on industrial policy.  A year ago the Minister when presenting his Estimate to this House asked for a constructive contribution towards the formation of industrial policy which, as we all know, began over two years ago and still has not seen the light of day.  We had a first leaked version, then that was withdrawn.  Then we had a second leaked version which was withdrawn.  The Sunday after the result of the European elections were coming on stream we had a third leaked version.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not try to cod anybody in this House by saying that there have not been leaks of industrial policy by this Government, There have been three leaks from the present Government.  It appears that when a problem arises on a different front we get a leak of industrial policy on it. The Minister should talk to his handlers about this, because they handle media management for him.  In three different national newspapers on that Sunday we had three different leaks to cover the problems that existed that weekend, and understandably so, but for Heaven's sake do not make a virtue out of trying to convince the people that that was not so. This has been the Government of more leaks than I ever remember.  I am not pointing the finger at the Minister, but out of this Government collectively many leaks have come and three of them have been on industrial policy.  We are into the second last day of this Dáil session and we have not got an industrial policy.  We have not a strategy for job creation or an IDA strategic policy, yet when I was leaving the Department a strategic plan by the IDA had already been completed in the offices of the IDA ready to be submitted to the Department in November 1982.  This is the middle of 1984 and we have no strategic plan for the IDA.  On the Minister's own admission at Question Time recently the IDA have not got a regional development policy.  In their last regional development policy their targets for each region were set out for 1978 to 1982.  We are going into the second half of 1984 and we have not an IDA regional policy for that period.  I put it to the Minister that this is clear evidence of the inactivity, the paralysis of thought and action in this Government.  That is the record of their performance that I have to point to here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That <i>Programme for Government</i> made great fanfare about the National Development Corporation.  It was to be the answer to all our ills.  All we have heard about the National Development Corporation since then was a double announcement of it.  We had an announcement of it from the Minister himself on the eve of the address of the <Col N="1327" /> Minister for Energy to the Labour Party and the following morning we had the same announcement again.  That is the politics of Coalition Governments, and that is their business.  However, there is no sign of this National Development Corporation.  We had a resume today of what might be involved in it and if I can find it I will read it out.  I can remember it clearly anyhow.  For every item on that resumé the National Enterprise Agency can do the job.  They have the terms of reference to do the job.  They are doing a good job at the moment, and I thank the Minister for his invitation to go out and visit them, which I did last week.  I must say that I was very impressed at the way they have gone about their business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>However, the Minister will admit that they are strangled.  They do not know what they will be doing next month.  They do not know whether they will be in their jobs next year.  You cannot hope to have any organisation motivated if they do not know where the Government are going in the following month or year.  The acting chief executive is on a year's contract basis and probably his time is nearly up.  How can that man motivate himself into doing a job?  How can anybody else involved in it do so? They do not know where they will fit in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to correct the record in so far as the National Enterprise Agency are concerned. When I was leaving the Department interviewing was in progress for the post of chief executive of the agency.  The list had been narrowed to three.  The Minister must not try to deny that.  I have a good memory and that was in November 1982.  The reason there was no movement on that appointment in the year <Col N="1328" /> before was because the then Coalition said the agency would be replaced with a national development corporation.  It was after our return to office that I, as Minister, reactivated the agency and they were doing well until the Government changed again.  Such organisations are the ones who must pay for quick changes of Government.  The National Enterprise Agency are capable of doing everything the Minister wishes the National Development Corporation to do but they are not being told when the latter are to come into operation.  The agency should not be left to operate in a vacuum.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal about the Cabinet Task Force on Employment.  That was supposed to be another major move forward by the Government but we have not heard of any recommendations from that task force so far.  Are they doing anything?  Is it any wonder that the Coalition are being referred to as a Government of task forces, committees and consultants? These are no substitute for Government policies and decisions but the people realise the position.  They know that the Government are not aware of where they are going and, as is said in my part of the country, when you do not know where you are going, any road will get you there.  That sums up the performance of the Government.  Although the development of our national resources is talked about in a vague way there is no plan in that regard.  That was supposed to form part of the work of the National Development Corporation but we do not know if that corporation will ever see the light of day.  It was mentioned first in the seventies and after so many years later perhaps it is too much to hope that the corporation will come on stream.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the many areas in which no action is being taken. There is no point in the pious aspirations expounded in the 76 page document he has put before us.  The prerequisite for the success of any industrial policy is a proper industrial investment.  The Minister knows that the climate has never been worse than it has been in the year 1983-84.  In all economies the level and pattern of industrial activity in development <Col N="1329" /> is affected in a fundamental way by economic policy and by Government policy as a whole.  Unless the prerequisite exists, no effort the Minister makes will be of any benefit.</P>
    <P>The question of taxation is as vital a component of industrial policy as is anything that may appear in the White Paper we have been hearing about.  Our taxation policy is a complete disincentive to investment.  It is a total disincentive also in terms of employing people.  The level of taxation which has become such an intolerable burden on the work force is making them angry and antagonistic towards the institutions of the State. Workers see no fruits by way of reward for their work.  Too much is being taken from their wage packets.  In the recent election campaign the biggest issue was the intolerable level of taxation and the disincentive effects of that both on investment and on employment.</P>
    <P>The Government must grapple first with the problems they announced as their priority on coming into office. Reducing capital expenditure and increasing current expenditure is to deal with the problem in reverse.  The more difficult decisions have to be taken in the reduction of current expenditure while the Government take the easy way out. The economy is going further down the drain each day.</P>
    <P>We must first create a climate in which those prepared to take risks can flourish, where hard work is rewarded and where profit is not regarded as a dirty word. And profit has become a dirty word as a result of the envy that has built up in society in that regard.  We must restore profit to its rightful place both in the public and private sectors because the public sector, too, are entitled to profits which they can reinvest.  Some of the people in Government are not doing any service to the development of the proper recognition of profit in society when they talk in an ill-informed way about the banks' contribution to the overall development of the economy.  I would go part of the way in saying that we would like to see the banks play a more dynamic role in the development of our economy but <Col N="1330" /> we would not go so far as to create some unease in relation to international investment.</P>
    <P>There are other elements, too, in the overall policy of the Government which are a total disincentive to investment. One can argue the merits or otherwise of the introduction of accelerated corporation tax.  I am not against it in principle.</P>

      <P>I am only setting out what the basic prerequisite is for industrial policy.  I am not trying to move away from the Bill.  I shall conclude on taxation by saying that it has always been my belief that profit is necessary and that today's profit is tomorrow's capital.  People who do not realise that are only fooling themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must have been the overseer of the worst period this country has ever known in terms of job creation. There are now about 11,000 fewer people employed in industry than was the case ten years ago.  Between 60,000 and 70,000 young people are in the process of taking their examinations and they are looking to this House and in particular to those who have taken on the responsibility of Government to get some indication of what their future might be.  Too much time has been spent in this House in trying to lay the blame elsewhere.  That <Col N="1331" /> is very childish behaviour.  We must grow up and realise that problems must be solved.  I am sick and tired listening to that every time there is a debate in the House.  I do not intend to go into the pros and cons because if we examine the record for the last ten years it would properly come out even-steven.</P>
    <P>The people are disillusioned and despairing.  The Government do not give them any direction.  Until we see some action from all the task forces, committees and so on that have been set up, the people will become more cynical about the House and its Members.  We are probably the lowest form of profession in the eyes of the public.  It is time we adopted a realistic approach.</P>
    <P>This time last year I gave the Minister what I thought was an in-depth view of what should be included in industrial policy. I spoke extensively about the idea of venture capital.  I compliment the Government for taking in that measure. It will redirect investment which was going into bricks and mortar and it will better serve the economy by being channelled into the venture capital programme. I hope the terms are not too restrictive.  Sometimes when we bring in such schemes we are inclined to be over-restrictive and close every possible loophole.  We end up killing the scheme before it even starts.  I hope that will not happen in this case.  It is modelled to a large extent on the British system.  The British system was probably too wide in the beginning.  The loopholes were gradually closed and the system was reasonably successful.  I hope this system will be just as successful.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have been criticised many times for not coming forward with constructive ideas which the Government could look at.  Before I left the Department we set up an import substitution unit.  That has good potential.  It is a tough job which will have to be done by a tough man.  I left behind me a monthly reporting system which had been used in British Government circles about purchasing in State and semi-State areas.  In Ireland the amount of purchasing power that rests with State and semi-State agencies <Col N="1332" /> could be legitimately channelled under EEC rules to Irish manufacturers. Many purchasing officers in those agencies are content to do business with the same suppliers.  In many cases the goods do not originate in this country but come in through Irish agents under an Irish agency label.  It is time we all did our bit to ensure that, where the product is as good as what can be imported, it will be used.  We must ensure that every possible supplier in the Irish industrial field is given access to requirements for the public sector.  That is the only way they can gear themselves to supply the goods.  We have been reticent about giving out this information.  An open door policy should be adopted to Irish suppliers to give them every chance to tender for supplies in the State and semi-State areas.  That does not happen.  I do not know if the Minister has the same experience in his clinics as I have in mine.  Small and medium-sized industrialists come to me and say they find it very difficult to get any information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned to hear that and would appreciate it if the Deputy could give me the names of the companies.  I have taken special care to try to solve the problems the Deputy has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to toss company names across the floor of the House but in many hospital developments I have come across in recent times, consultants, engineers and architects specify off-standard equipment, for example, in aluminium windows and ventilating equipment to coincide with the specification of a British product.  Hospitals are notorious for it, why I do not know.  I could instance the contract for the Mater Hospital in Dublin and others. I will give the names of the companies who failed to tender.  I went to the architects and told them that this was not good enough.  I wrote to the Minister for Health but no action was taken.  It is very serious and they have been getting away with it for a long time.  A directive should issue from Government Departments to ensure that a penalty is put on people <Col N="1333" /> who will not recognise that there are good Irish products on the market.  I am not talking about inferior products but comparable products which are manufactured here.</P>
      <P>I met a small supplier in Waterford this week.  He had taken over a company from an international concern.  He successfully marketed a substitute product in hospitals. He gave me a letter yesterday which indicated that the multinational company who supplied the product he had replaced had offered their product free for 12 months to the hospitals in an effort to get rid of this Irish supplier.  That is how ruthless the game is.  I have that letter in my office and will let the Minister see it. That is an example of how far multinationals are prepared to go to hold on to their share of the Irish market.  We better sit up and make sure our people get an equal chance.  The Irish supplier put the product together and displaced the multinational company on quality, price and service.  They do not have the resources to stand up to this kind of tactic.  I never heard of a company offering a product free for 12 months in order to displace an Irish product.  There are many other areas in import substitution.  However, they need the assistance of every sector and every Government Department and must be monitored with regard to progress. In my short experience in the Minister's Department, a programme will work for a while but without monitoring things will break down.  When there are complaints, the penalties will have to be such that people will sit up and look after the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about the upturn in the economy, based on the huge uplift in exports.  He will agree that, basically, this upturn is from two major sectors &mdash; high technology electronics and pharmaceuticals and health care.  To base economic recovery in this economy on their performance is to build a foundation on quicksand.  Many other sectors show no signs of picking up.  We also know that in high technology and health care it is the new industries which are progressing and there is an element of transfer in this.  We must come to grips with the problems of the other sectors of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> The Minister mentioned the sectoral committees, but somebody will have to put a bomb under them.  They are a long time in operation, with all due respects, and only one, as far as I can gather and correct me if I am wrong, has reported anything.  Either they deliver, or disband them.  The Minister must not shelter under the umbrella of those committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked of another task force, that of junior Ministers in the food area and there is no question about it, it is a difficult area.  He asked for ideas on how to come to grips with the difficulties.  As the Minister knows, the development of the food industry and the new products which the marketplace of today requires is a long-term investment, heavily capitalised in many areas and with a slow return.  This is an area for the National Enterprise Agency to examine, although they may be displaced by the National Development Corporation.  There will have to be a joint venture of the private and public sectors where investment is so large and payback fairly slow.  That is one of the major impediments, on the one hand.  On the other hand, I agree with the Minister that we are far too much in the commodity selling business, especially in the beef trade, taking the lazy man's attitude of &ldquo;Put them into intervention and work on the margin&rdquo;.  While intervention served its purpose in the early seventies, it destroyed the initative to set up proper marketing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are good examples of it, but it was a very big barrier in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true also of the dairy sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies to the dairy sector.  That sector should have as good a potential and their set-up is not the same as private sector investment. They are happy to operate on a much lower return or margin on their investment for a long time, because of their co-operative status.  The private sector area must repay to banks and so forth and that return might not be sufficient to finance their investment.  In the co-operative area there is, indeed, great scope for product diversification.</P>
      <P>I have said before and say again that we are production-orientated manufacturers and are not starting from the marketplace. We must realise that the customer, whether he be in Ireland, the UK, the EEC, the US or anywhere else, will not buy exactly what we produce but only what is to his own taste.  That message cannot be driven home often enough and strongly enough.  The opportunities in the convenience food area, because of the change in society and in taste, do not remain static.  There is constant changing in taste in consumer supermarket orientation and the sooner we realise that the better.</P>
      <P>It is not easy for certain industries here to take the jump from being suppliers to the home market trade into being suppliers to the export market.  I have thought about this over the last few months and believe there is a direct functional involvement for Irish Industrial Research and Standards in their Product Food Division &mdash; and for some other agencies, perhaps NBST, in the processing area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not expect them and the State to pay for the development of a product to be handed over to the private sector, an entrepreneur or an existing manufacturer. If the product is already developed, the research having been done whether by CTT or anyone else, there should be a share-the-risk and share-the-reward arrangement.  There could be also a contracting out on a royalty basis to an existing manufacturer or entrepreneur. The State agencies have the talent <Col N="1336" /> to do this research.  Small and medium sized companies, the backbone of our industries, do not have the resources. Very little research and development are going on in the country.  The agencies can play a very positive role in product and process development and should be repaid.  Banks will not give out money to market a new product, as the Minister rightly said.  The universities and schools of technology could also be brought into this area to share their resources in product research and development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Let them continue what they are doing and let the National Development Corporation, whenever they come along, do theirs.  Even if the legislation were passed at the next session, the corporation would have to be set up, a board appointed, which would have to look for a chief executive; then the chief executive has to put his organisation together.  One cannot expect results from the NDC or anybody else for the next couple of years and meanwhile unemployment figures will mount and we will not be seen to be doing anything positive about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our traditional areas have been hit very hard by the recession, in particular the clothing and footwear industries.  The only way they can survive is by adopting the new technologies in their own trade, to be seen in Italy, France, or anywhere on the Continent.  I recently bought a pair of shoes in Switzers manufactured by an Irish firm, Padmore and Barnes of Kilkenny, who had the same <Col N="1337" /> problems as anyone else but did not sit and worry over them.  Then went to Italy, got designers there, made a licensing arrangement with them and now they cannot produce enough of these excellent shoes.  We want more of that enterprise and the same goes for the clothing area. We can be as good as anybody else.  It is time the defeatist attitude was thrown aside.  Get the right person with the right flair, give him the proper backing and he can do the job.  Too many ask who is going to do the job for them.  The public must see that the money which is there to be spent is spent to the benefit of development of industry, of products and of markets.  That is our role.  I agree with the Minister's remarks about marketing executives.  They are very successful in the foreign markets and that is the right approach.  I only hope it will continue and be intensified.  We will never get some of the small firms to put a man in the market place.  They could not afford it anyway.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the enterprise scheme.  I had occasion to tell the Minister for Labour in this House that there are bureaucratic blockages in the scheme where people come off the dole and set up their own business.  To my knowledge they have not been removed. Three girls wanted to start a business and they could not get any help because one of them was not on the dole.  Two of them were on the dole and one was not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That sort of nitty-gritty <Col N="1338" /> bureaucratic nonsense is written into those schemes when we are trying to get people to do something.  The Minister talked about a list of agencies.  They mesmerise small people and small industries. They do not know where they are going. We must be more forthcoming and straightforward with people if we want them to do something, and not put bureaucratic blockages in their way.  I know that when the Minister provides a scheme he has to look at how it is operating. When he finds there are blockages he should have them removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy give me details of that enterprise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be delighted to.  I sent them to the Minister for Labour and I will send them to the Minister as well. I recall in September 1982 arriving at an arrangement with the Nixdorf computer people in Germany to set up a training unit on the industrial campus in Bray to train approximately 300 young people in a real work environment.  I asked a few times in this House if that would be followed up, and I was assured that it would. Can the Minister tell me did it come to anything?  If not, the blame lies with the bureaucratic nonsense which exists between one Department and another with people trying to guard their own little republican domains in the Departments while the national interest suffers.</P>
      <P>There is too much of that around and it will have to be dealt with.  The same goes for the semi-State bodies.  The Minister referred to them and we had a debate on one earlier on.  People are becoming extremely worried about the drain on revenue of the tax they pay. They are not convinced that they are getting value for money.  It is up to us as managers and custodians of the taxpayers' money to see that they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the White Paper comes out I will make a constructive contribution.  I do not believe in destructive contributions. I hope there is vision in it.  I hope there are new approaches in it.  I hope the Minister is not shying away from the decisions which are so necessary for the development of industry and our whole <Col N="1339" /> economic development.  I hope we will see more action before the next Estimate for the Department and that we will not have to listen again to 76 pages of nothing at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take the opportunity of this Estimates debate to say a few words about the tourism industry and its prospects for future development.</P>
      <P>Before coming into the House this evening, I had a look at the latest indications from Bord Fáilte as to how the present tourist season is going.  While obviously, at this stage, the estimates of tourist traffic can only be taken as broad indications of this year's season as a whole, and extreme caution must be exercised in drawing conclusions, nevertheless, I must say that the overall picture is very, very encouraging.</P>
      <P>From January to May, for example, there was an estimated increase of more than 4 per cent in overseas tourist numbers over the same period last year.  At this stage, therefore, I am very confident that the Bord Fáilte target of an increase for the year of between 3 per cent and 5 per cent will be achieved.  Individual market estimates for period January to May 1984 show &mdash; North America up 14 per cent, UK up 3 per cent, and Europe up 5 per cent &mdash; on the same period for 1983.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I have been impressed in recent weeks, in talking to people in the industry around the country, by the general air of confidence which seems to be running through the industry.  Hoteliers, restauranteurs, carriers, tour operators are all optimistic that 1984 will be a very good year for tourism and that the industry has well and truly turned the corner and can look forward to a bright future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This air of optimism in Irish tourism is clearly reflected in the increased demand from the industry for trained staff.  It is indeed encouraging to note that CERT has been able, without any difficulty, to find suitable employment for over 1,100 trainees leaving hotel and catering schools this year.  This substantially <Col N="1340" /> increased demand for trained staff underlines, in my view, the growing air of confidence in tourism and the favourable visitor pattern emerging in the current season.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this is the case, because tourism needs to operate in a positive atmosphere.  It is that type of industry. Visitors to Ireland need to be greeted with a welcome and a smile and not with a frown.  There is no place in tourism for the prophets of gloom and despondency. Some of the utterances of the so-called tourism experts, mostly ill-informed and in search of cheap sensational headlines, do little to further the cause of the industry they purport to represent and, in many cases, are the source of untold damage. The atmosphere that the industry itself creates is crucial to the image Ireland projects as a destination. Informed, constructive criticism is what is needed to create the right tourism product and the right atmosphere in which to market it.</P>
    <P>This Government are very much aware of the economic importance of the tourism industry.  Their policy is to assist in the development of the industry so that tourism increases its capability: to earn the foreign currency the country so badly needs, to provide and sustain much needed employment for our young population, and to contribute to regional development by stimulating commercial activity in the more remote areas.</P>
    <P>The extent to which any Government can assist the tourism industry depends on the economic circumstances at any given time.  A sound, healthy domestic economy is a vital necessity for all our export industries, including tourism, and this is something which the Government, in their relatively short period in office, have taken giant strides towards establishing.</P>
    <P>Competitiveness is, and has been for a number of years, the major problem facing Irish tourism.  Tourism operates in a highly competitive market and we must offer as good, if not better, value for money as other rival destinations.  The general stabilisation in prices which has occurred over the last 12 months is an important step towards achieving this <Col N="1341" /> end.  The taxation concessions on tourism products granted in successive budgets have resulted in a significant improvement in Irish tourism's competitive position. These developments will, I am sure, lead to increased tourism business.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed, I think, that taxation levels at the present time are, of necessity, at a very high level because of our extremely difficult economic circumstances. This is certainly true in so far as tourism is concerned.  I am hopeful that as the economic situation improves it will be possible for the Government to introduce further taxation concessions for tourism.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the way in which the tourism industry has managed to weather the storms of the continuing recession and to continue to contribute positively to economic development, there can be no doubt that any concessions would be used positively by the industry to further enhance its overall contribution to the economy.</P>
    <P>It is my firm belief that, in the past, tourism has not been accorded the attention it deserved as one of this country's most important industries.  Perhaps this is because the industry is so disparate, made up of many thousands of small, widely spread, operators.  Yet it cannot be denied that tourism supports a very large number of jobs and that, this year, its earnings overall will be touching the £1 billion mark for the first time.</P>
    <P>It is true to say also, I think, that there is much more which can be achieved through the proper development of the industry.  In this increasingly technological age, it is in the service industries, such as tourism, that more and more of our future job opportunities will arise.  The Government are fully aware of this potential and will continue to afford tourism every possible consideration in their economic development plans.</P>
    <P>It is not just the Government alone who have a role to play in assisting the development of Irish tourism.  Every man, woman and child in this country is a vital element in this effort.  In the coming years, this country will be judged increasingly, in tourism terms, against the high, and in most cases meticulous, <Col N="1342" /> standards of other competing international destinations.  It is essential, therefore, that the standard of our infrastructure and of our environment be maintained at the highest possible level.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte tell me that the country and the people are the major selling points for Ireland as a tourist location, and that, generally, there is a high level of satisfaction among our visitors.  All of us must strive to ensure that this remains so.  We must take pride in, and preserve the unique quality of our environment, our homes, villages, towns, cities and rural surroundings.  There are so many aspects of our environment that are coming under increasing threat in this modern age that it is only by continuous vigilance that we can continue to have a countryside to be enjoyed both by ourselves and our visitors.</P>
    <P>The continuation of the good work of Bord Fáilte is one of the major factors in the development of the industry, both in its promotional role and its developmental role.  Effective marketing of the product is probably more important in tourism than in any other export sector. In my period of office I have had the opportunity to view at first hand the board's marketing activities in the home and overseas markets and I have been impressed by the effectiveness and professionalism of their appraoch.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years the Government have provided the board with a significant level of promotional funds to use in the various markets.  This year, for example, the Bord Fáilte allocation of £22.45 million is the highest provision ever made for promoting Irish tourism. I am confident that this money will be very well spent and that the country will benefit from the increased tourism spending which will be generated.  It is my hope that in the future the Government will be able to provide increased funds for this purpose as it is, I believe, an area here Exchequer spending can reap a worthwhile return to the economy.</P>
    <P>I think we are very lucky in Irish tourism to have such a wide range of tourist accommodation available, and this is in no small way due to the various accommodation grant schemes designed to <Col N="1343" /> stimulate investment in this sector over the years.  From the top Grade A-star hotels through the family-type tourist hotels, town and country homes, farmhouses, self-catering, caravan and camping sites to hostels &mdash; they all have a part to play in the tourist effort.  We can offer accommodation to suit almost every conceivable taste and pocket.</P>
    <P>It is highly important, therefore, that Government policy in relation to tourism accommodation ensures that supply as far as possible is consistent with demand. It would be very wrong, for example, to initiate schemes to stimulate development of a particular type of accommodation if, by so doing, we were to put in jeopardy the continued viability of accommodation providers already operating in the particular sector.</P>
    <P>This is a point that can sometimes be forgotten by people who clamour for Government assistance for particular sectors which are experiencing difficulties. However well-intentioned they may be, they might not realise that sufficient demand may not exist for the particular service they wish to offer.  If one does not have regard to the level of demand for a particular type of accommodation before deciding to stimulate supply, one is creating future problems rather than solving existing ones.  It is for this reason that detailed consideration is necessary before deciding where, and for what purpose, scarce Exchequer resources should be used and, of course, in all such cases the State should have the clear prospect of getting a real return on its investment.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte and the tourist industry in general can, I think, pride themselves on what has been achieved over the years in the development of tourism-related facilities and amenities.  Since 1979, the Government have provided, through the board, up to £8 million in grant assistance for this development.  This money has stimulated the development of a wide range of projects including Shannon cruisers, recreational facilities in major holiday resort areas, angling developments, water sports, equestrian centres and so on, developments which have played a major part in sustaining the <Col N="1344" /> growth of the industry.  The amenity development scheme has been, and I am sure will continue to be, responsible for stimulating very desirable amenity development throughout the country which might otherwise not take place.</P>
    <P>I am told by the board that the numbers of applications for assistance under the scheme annually far outnumber the projects which can be assisted within the limits of the funds available.  This is another clear indication that we have, within the industry, innovative people with plenty of bright ideas for development. I hope that the Government can continue to devote the resources necessary to assist these people to bring their ideas to fruition to the benefit of Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>There is, however, an absolute necessity to ensure that the funds expended in this area are used to the best possible advantage.  Our primary objective is the promotion and generation of tourism traffic in order to maximise tourism revenue. The projects to be assisted under the scheme must, therefore, be projects which are likely to show an identifiable return to the economy in the form of additional tourism revenue generated.</P>
    <P>Promoting and marketing the product effectively, providing the highest possible standard of accommodation, meals, drink and amenities are all, as I have said, vital to our tourism development. Another vital element in attracting tourists to our shores is to provide them with the most economic and comfortable means of getting here.  For an island tourist destination like Ireland, access transport and facilities are of the utmost importance.  The access transport area is a highly complex and difficult one, with staggeringly high costs of development, many conflicting interests to be considered and a very fine line between success and failure.</P>
    <P>I have had the opportunity over the past few months to see at first hand the operations of the main sea carriers serving our ports.  I was very impressed by what I saw &mdash; the quality of the ships, the professionalism and dedication of the people involved, left little to be desired.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of my travels with <Col N="1345" /> the sea carriers was to look at the facilities available to tourists at our main sea ports on the east coast and at the departure ports in the UK and France and to compare them.  Port facilities, in my view, are a very important aspect as, for the sea traveller, his first impression of the country is the one he gets on arrival at a port. If that impression is not a good one, it can spoil all that comes after, no matter how good it is.</P>
    <P>Having looked at the various ports, I am of the view that there are improvements which need to be carried out at some of them to bring them up to acceptable international standards.  I am happy to see that money has been provided for port improvements work this year and that the Minister for Communications has initiated an overall review of policy in so far as the ports are concerned.  For my part, I will be reporting on the results of my examination of port facilities and suggesting action which I see as necessary to improve the tourist facilities available at the ports.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by restating my conviction that Ireland has, in tourism, an industry which can, and will, play a major role in this country's future economic development.  To all of those people involved in the industry I would stress the three main requirements as I see them: maintain your product at the highest possible standard, offer the best value for money possible and get out into the market and promote the product as effectively as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the time available for this debate is somewhat restricted now I will have to forego certain elements of my contibution but I presume there will be another opportunity, perhaps in the next day or two, to put the economic side of my submission.  The contribution of the Minister of State is a great disappointment to us all.  He may have spent some time inspecting sea carriers and seaports but I put it to him that he is totally at sea in so far as the development of tourism <Col N="1346" /> is concerned.  I should like to remind the Minister of State of his own speeches in the House last November and December when he promised that certain things would be done to support Irish tourism.</P>
      <P>A list of commitments was given by him but they have not been fulfilled.  He indicated that he was developing a major economic tourism plan.  Six months later it is reasonable to expect that he would give us a similar commitment at the half-year mark.  There was reference to it, and it is the same speech on tourism that we have come to expect over the past number of years.  It reinforces my view that until such time as there is a Minister attached to the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, tourism will never develop here and take its rightful place as an economic force.  There is no acceptance by any Minister or the Department that tourism can play a major economic role in the resurgence of the economy.  Until such time as the Minister gets around to impressing on the Cabinet the need to provide the wherewithal to develop a proper strategy in dealing with tourism we will have the same old speech every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that even at this late stage the Minister did not take the initiative concerning a matter which I raised with him some time ago concerning the VAT rebate deal that was announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech.  It was not mentioned because it has proved to be an embarrassment for the Minister, the Department and Bord Fáilte.  It is impossible to implement and has been a major failure as far as tourism promotion is concerned.  I have asked the Minister if he would make certain changes which would simplify the method of implementation and I thought I was getting somewhere.  Unfortunately, there has been no change of heart, and obviously it was only a sop at budget time which held out a promise to the tourist industry but is now a flop.  Tourists were supposed to be able to shop here and claim back VAT in line with the practice which is authorised in other EEC countries. We expected that at least the implementation would make some sense to tourists, but the EEC tourist has to pay <Col N="1347" /> a minimum of £152 for a product before he can qualify for a rebate.  He then has to have his invoice stamped by his own customs, return the invoice suitably stamped and then he will get his VAT back from the retail outlet in which he purchased the goods.  Nobody paid any attention to the exchange difficulties which would arise when the invoices came back or bothered to realise that the people, if they ever did get their VAT returned, would have considerable difficulty in making the exchange in their own jurisdiction.  They would perhaps have to pay their own country's tax on the goods again.  It is a farce, and anybody who has sought to implement it will tell you that invoices are returned badly and wrongly marked and with comments to the effect that the rebate should be given to charity because it is insulting to have to pay $5 or $8 to have it exchanged into their own currency, especially when the total VAT rebate was less than the original sum they paid.</P>
    <P>The non-EEC tourist did not fare much better.  I agree that there is no minimum limit but the invoices have to be stamped by the Irish customs.  There was a simple, way out of all this which I recommended to the Minister some time ago.  Aer Rianta were willing to accommodate the Minister by installing a VAT refund desk at the point of exit and, if that had been located beside the duty free shop, the Exchequer would have benefited once the cash repayments were made.  It is typical of the attitude of the Minister and the Department that they failed to do anything positive in that regard.  This was a voluntary scheme and the people in the retail trade are not volunteering.  It is as simple as that.  It has left a sour taste not just among tourists but in the promoters of Irish tourism abroad.  They are not indicating that this facility is available in Ireland because it is an embarrassment to them and, if the Minister is not going to change its implementation, it should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>In 1961 the United Kingdom benefited by 8 per cent in transatlantic tourists.  At that time Ireland got 6 per cent in that area.  In 1983, Ireland got 8 per cent of <Col N="1348" /> transatlantic tourists but the United Kingdom got 30 per cent.  What new foreign marketing promotional strategy does the Minister intend to implement to attract people here from America?  There is no use telling me that we give them a few extra hundred thousand pounds and send them on their way.  That is not the way to give a direction and lead to Bord Fáilte, and I suggest that there is a surplus of duplication in so far as promotional agencies are concerned in tourism. I have already asked the Minister to bring them all together under an umbrella organisation so that we could get the maximum benefit for the amount of promotion and money that we had.  I also asked if the Minister would consider including the Irish Embassies in that promotional drive.  There has not been a word from him since.  I do not know whether the Minister intends taking his holidays in the Embassies abroad as well as the seaports but, if he does, he should put it to them that there is an industry that could be of tremendous potential to the economic drive and regrowth here if they would take the initiative.</P>
    <P>The Irish flour milling industry is under great threat from the dumping of imported flour from the United Kingdom and nothing is being done to save it.  After the closure of Ranks all the major British milling industries tried to capture the total Irish industry, which is their stated aim.  To do so, they are selling below the price obtainable in the United Kingdom. They have already captured a sizeable proportion of the Irish market and they are selling their product for less than the Irish milling industry can sell it.  There is a differential of £40.  The consequences are catastrophic for what is an essential industry.  We have lost jobs and increased imports.  Our capacity to produce what must be regarded as a strategic raw material is being impaired and we are going to end up depending on a foreign source for a basic foodstuff and raw material.  This is not good enough, and there is legislative power to stop this illegal dumping. The same flour that is being sold here and dumped on the Irish market is being used by the bakery industry here and is attracting a subsidy of 15p for the 800 gramme <Col N="1349" /> loaf.  The Irish taxpayers are paying the subsidy to keep people in jobs in Great Britain.  Bakers should be encouraged to use Irish flour and to show a special symbol which would indicate that the bread is baked from home flour.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about changes he proposes introducing in relation to company law, but of course every Ministerial speech has included that since the Minister came to office and during the time of his predecessor.  We have been promised all kinds of legislation but, despite continuous prodding here on the Order of Business, we are still no nearer to that legislation except a general promise from the Minister this evening that he is going to burden himself and the House in the next session with a list of legislative proposals. He is going to introduce a general insurance Bill, he is going to do something about limited liability, he is going to implement the Fourth Directive, he is going to have at least two stock exchange directives implemented and he is going to do something about restrictive practices in so far as the professions are concerned. If the Minister lives up to his promises in his 76 page speech he and I are going to be pretty busy here next term.  I look forward to the Minister fulfilling his list of promises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the stock exchange directives will be done by order.  I take it that the restrictive practices will require legislation, as will the Fourth Directive, limited liability and the general insurance.  Even if they do not require legislation, they will have to be debated in the House as statutory orders.</P>
      <P>The Minister devoted a portion of his speech to insurance.  It was the disappointing part of his speech.  I had expected something different from him on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to motor insurance, the Minister did not make any reference to what he might do in regard to the excessive cost of insurance for young drivers. He did not tell us what he intends doing <Col N="1350" /> in spite of the fact that his predecessor gave a commitment here, and outside, to take immediate steps as far as uninsured motorists were concerned.  However, the Minister tells us this evening that he will establish a new representative board to deal with this matter.  I should like to remind the Minister that this area was dealt with in detail on a number of occasions before.  In regard to that I should like to refer him to the report of the inquiry into the cost and methods of providing motor insurance issued in 1982.  I do not know why the Minister considers it necessary to set up another board to investigate the cost and provision of motor insurance.  There is in the Department a detailed document setting out what should be done and the Minister's predecessor gave a commitment to implement the recommendations in that report but nothing has been done.  The minimum the Minister might do &mdash; he can do it without having the matter investigated by his new representative board &mdash; is to synchronise insurance and licences.  The Minister could make a name for himself by introducing windscreen discs, something that was promised by his predecessor but not mentioned by him.  It is a realistic approach.  I accept that something is being done about introducing realistic penalties for driving without insurance cover, but there is a need for greater Garda surveillance.</P>
    <P>A whole range of recommendations were made in the report of the inquiry of 1982.  The Minister should cut out the waffle and be what he likes people to think he is, a reformer.  In some instances the Minister has been a reformer but he could do something in this area without setting up another board.  There was little talk until recently about the question of insurance intermediaries.  The Minister's predecessor said he was not going to do anything about them, that perhaps they should self-regulate.  However, we are aware, following a recent speech by the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, and the speech by the Minister this evening, that it is intended to have another close look at this problem.  I thank the Minister for his move in regard to this.  In the last 18 months I have made many speeches <Col N="1351" /> about this matter and I am glad that at last the light is beginning to dawn.  It is not too much to expect, at a time when so many institutions are going to the wall, that brokers and agents be brought under some type of regulations.  While there was no great enthusiasm expressed by the Minister of State when he set out four options at a recent function I recommended that as far as brokers are concerned the minimum requirement should be that they be of good financial standing and have some technical experience.  The Minister may have to consider bonding. I accept that the latter is the sticking point but in view of the collapses that occurred in recent years in this area of activity it may be necessary for the Minister to consider bonding also.  Agents should have a fixed relationship with the companies they work for.  It should be recognised once and for all that money paid to an agent is money paid to the company.  It should be treated as such.  That would give a certain element of security to those buying insurance.</P>
    <P>House insurance is of particular interest to me.  The cost of it has increased by 48 per cent in the first six months of this year.  The Minister will have to take due notice of that area in the short-term. There are 26 general companies writing insurance here and half of them have increased their rates in recent months. They have also increased the optional cover to a very significant degree.  Those companies have also increased the risk portion paid by the insured in the event of a claim.  It is almost as dear now to insure one's house as it is to insure one's car.  In fact, some companies who possess licences from the Minister's Department are not prepared to quote insurance at all for certain areas in Dublin.  Their underwriting losses have escalated enormously from about £700,000 two years ago to almost £5 million this year.  The time is right for the Minister to step in and regulate the position.</P>
    <P>It is said that the rise in crime has resulted in a big increase in house insurance. In the last three years reported burglaries increased by 150 per cent.  If that is the case and if quite a lot of them <Col N="1352" /> had violence related to them then it is time something positive was done to deal with the problem.  Dublin is the key area, as is suggested in all reports concerning crime-related burglaries.  I understand that in Dublin one burglary is committed every 20 minutes.  Some of the areas where burglaries are at their highest level are avoided by insurance companies. Quite a number of householders are finding it impossible to get any quotation for the contents or the building.  Other areas are being subjected to very stringent security measures before being quoted for.</P>
    <P>I accept that the general public can do more and should be more security consious. Some action by the general public would bring a reduction in the number of burglaries.  However, the Minister, in order to get an overall view of the problem and understanding of how desperate the situation is for insurance companies and those who must pay the increased premiums should call the insurance associations together with representitives of the building industry, the Garda, the Departments of Justice and the Environment to a round table conference to devise new strategies for dealing with this problem.  They could consider new concessions in premiums to apply if certain action is taken by consumers and consider recommending new regulations to the Department of the Environment as far as new buildings are concerned.  I am satisfied that if a broad look was taken at this there would be a reduction in the number of burglaries and, consequently, a reduction in premiums.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to make a personal plea to the Minister about the two independent cinemas left in Dublin, the Cameo and the Curzon.  It has to be stated in all fairness that the London-based renters of films are putting the independent cinemas out of business. Quite a few of them have gone to the wall already.  It is all a question of the exclusivity of the major operators and the monopoly that is enjoyed by the big operators.  It is not too much to expect that the Minister should see to it that the last remaining independent cinema-owners in Dublin should at least enjoy <Col N="1353" /> second-run status.  The spirit of the Restrictive Practices Commission report of 1978 is not being complied with.  It recommended that there should be a change of heart and that independent cinemas should at least get the same facility as the suburban screens.  Controls were introduced in the United Kingdom but to save the independent owners and relieve us of a monopoly here the Minister should take a personal interest in this matter.  If he does I am confident he will bring about a satisfactory conclusion to this.  The matter can be dealt with across the board in a short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the way he has faced up to his responsibility.  We are all aware that he encountered many difficulties that were handed down to him by the last administration.  He has risen to the occasion handsomely.  His speech this evening of 76 pages is a revelation for any person anxious to learn the facts facing industry here.  It is accepted that many jobs could be created here if we could instil in our people, particularly housewives, the necessity to buy Irish products at all times.  I listened to previous speakers saying that industry should be put on a pedestal. We all believe that, but we must realise that there will be serious consequences for industry if we do not get a home market for our products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year Ireland, a food producing country, imported over £800 million worth of food.  The total value of horticultural imports amounted to £27 million, plus £12 million for potatoes, bringing the figure to almost £40 million.  We also imported £14 million worth of apples, £2 million worth of carrots, £6 million worth of tomatoes and £0.5 million worth of celery.  Iceberg lettuce from Holland retails here at about 70p per head.  Fresh podded peas and French beans sell at approximately £1 per pound and are imported from France in the months of April, May and June.  Lettuce seed costs £35 per ounce and this is also imported from Holland.  Surely we could meet the requirements of our own people.  Why must we import lettuce seed from Holland as well as daffodils, rose <Col N="1354" /> buds and flowers of all descriptions?  They could be grown locally, giving much employment.  It is shocking that this situation has continued over many years. The sooner the better we realise the necessity of being self-sufficient in food.</P>
    <P>We have the finest climate in western Europe, possibly in the world, for growing these types of commodities, but we do not avail of the opportunity.  There is an opening for a huge number of jobs in the food processing sector in marinating, canning and smoking fish.  When one goes into a supermarket one sees the shelves adorned with tins of smoked fish, herrings in wine, herrings in beer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>All of these are imported from West Germany, Denmark and Norway. We seem bent on buying these imported products.  We have the finest fishing waters in the world but when the fish are landed in Castletownbere, Killybegs or Howth they are put into articulated trucks and transported to the continent for processing.  They are then imported back here.  If we were sensible we would cut out the bickering and get down to business.  It is time the Irish people took a stand.  I have seen fish being put into containers in Castletownbere and whisked across the Irish Sea, in spite of the fact that we have a fish factory there which is completely under-utilised, employing only 17 or 18 people until recently when the number was increased to 36.  This enterprise is threatened by the entry of Spain to the EEC.  We must be seen to make a start in making this country self-sufficient in food.</P>
      <P>The enterprise allowance scheme has been very valuable.  Over 1,700 people had benefited under the scheme by the end of last month and set up their own businesses.  This is not to be scoffed at.  It is a step in the right direction, and I would expect this success to continue under the leadership of our esteemed Minister, Deputy John Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More jobs could be created in industries such as forestry.  We have the best climate in the world for growing trees but we are only skimming the surface in <Col N="1355" /> regard to afforestation.  After 50 years of native government it is still in the doldrums but it could give an immense amount of employment.</P>
    <P>In spite of the difficulties encountered by exporting firms, it is very encouraging to note that exports rose by 22 per cent or £1,245 million last year, making a new record of £6,936 million.  This is very encouraging, but a lot more could be achieved if we tackled problems in a realistic manner.  I have no doubt that this will now be done.</P>
    <P>It is very gratifying that tourism figures are up this year by 4 or 5 per cent.  If the ferry service were operating into Cork there would be a further increase of at least 3 per cent.  Such a ferry service is very important to the south-west region, and it is gratifying to know that by 1985 it will again be in operation.  We must be more competitive in regard to attracting tourists and we must give proper package deals.  Other countries fly in tourists by the thousand in jumbo jets.  We could do likewise.  We have a very good climate and some of the finest scenery in the world, beautiful mountains, lakes, rivers and inlets.  All this should be capitalised. It could be of immense benefit where tourism is concerned.</P>
    <P>Finally, the time has come when we must reappraise the whole situation where job creation is concerned.  We have the youngest population in western Europe and as a nation we must set a headline as regards employment of our young people.  I will conclude by complimenting the Minister for the magnificent report he gave the House.  His address was a most invigorating one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to facilitate Deputy Kirk.  He has been here since the debate started.  We had an unexpected <Col N="1356" /> sos for half an hour and so I will be as brief as possible in order to facilitate Deputy Kirk.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's 76-page brief.  The Minister went through the various functions in his Department, outlining the various committees and so forth set up in his Department.  Apart from that there was very little of an instructive nature in the Minister's speech.  There was little or no reference to unemployment and it was very obvious that his commitment towards solving the problem of unemployment, which I would have expected now that he has spent 18 months in the Department, is one that has so far not been met.  He may have his own opinions on matters but, having listened to his speech, I have a feeling he is now presenting the House with something for which he is not fully responsible. I think the Minister, like many of his colleagues, is paying the penalty of so-called coalition Government.</P>
      <P>Earlier today we had £90 million voted for Irish Steel.  Now I have no objection whatsoever to the workers in Cork getting this subvention of £90 million but it surprised me that this should come from Deputy John Bruton.  To me it appeared to be a very hasty decision and I somehow doubt that it was the wish of the Minister. We in Fianna Fáil have always been glad to put money into viable industry and I am glad that the Minister has now come around to our way of thinking.  However, I was more than surprised remembering the financial policy adumbrated by the Government.  I am thinking of Knock Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the IDA, this body have done a wonderful job down through the years.  They have been responsible for attracting industry and in that way creating jobs but there seems to be no really constructive plan for the future. The IDA still have difficulty &mdash; this was referred to by other speakers &mdash; in associating with small industries.  Every public representative has occasion every day of the week to discuss with that body proposals in regard to a particular area but I am disappointed, I must admit, at the lack of consideration shown for small industries, industries capable of employing <Col N="1357" /> 20 or 30 people.  Even employment for four or five would be of immense benefit in rural areas.  Would the Minister take note of that?  I can give the Minister examples of the kind of industries I have in mind, industries which find it very difficult to get the kind of assistance which should be forthcoming from the IDA.</P>
    <P>I am glad that at long last the White Paper on industrial policy will be published round about 12 July.  It has been promised for so long but now that a date has been mentioned I am satisfied it will be forthcoming at last.  I look forward to studying that policy and debating it here.</P>
    <P>We have a great many groups like the IDA, CTT, AnCO and so on which co-operate with the Minister's Department but it is impossible when one is seeking advice to know to which particular Department one should go.  In the White Paper I hope all these bodies will be brought together under the one umbrella so that people will know exactly to what they are entitled and where they should go for that entitlement.  We have too many agencies.  There is too much bureaucracy.  There is a lack of contact. There is too little understanding.  Training, grants, business development and so on and so forth should all be linked together to facilitate people.  That sort of facility would encourage people.</P>
    <P>I referred to the lack of reference to unemployment in the Minister's opening statement.  As Deputy Reynolds pointed out, there are very serious problems facing the country.  There is first of all the problem of taxation.  The system is crippling progress.  We have huge PAYE and PRSI burdens to meet.  We have VAT increases.  There is absolutely no tax incentive.  There are no opportunities. There is no hope of getting work as a result of investment.  I do not know what plans the Minister has but he should confer with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, in an effort to evolve some fairer system of taxation than the one with which we are burdened at present.  The system is forcing more and more people into the black economy which has reached huge proportions.  It is high time positive steps were taken to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> Reference has been made to the National Development Corporation.  We have been waiting for this National Development Corporation for so long that I do not now remember when it was first mooted.  I do not think there is any need for this National Development Corporation and, if we are depending on this National Development Corporation to provide jobs for our unemployed, I think we can just forget about it.  I wonder why there was such a delay in setting up this corporation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds referred to the enterprise allowance scheme.  The Minister said the scheme had been successful and has been expanded.  I agree that that scheme was successful and facilitated many people wanting to set up their own businesses.  But, as Deputy Reynolds said, there is too much bureaucracy in its administration with too many obstacles being placed in people's way rendering it impossible for them to avail of its provisions. I too can give the Minister practical examples in support of that claim.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the food processing industry, discussed in every debate that has taken place here with regard to industrial policy.  In this respect I believe a task force of junior Ministers has been established in regard to the food processing industry but there have been no developments in relation to its expansion since this Government came into office.  We were promised that a marketing board would be established to ensure proper marketing, presentation, delivery, supplies &mdash; we have it all off by heart &mdash; and to control vegetable imports.  An IDA statutory report was presented which has been totally ignored by the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a debate here last week or the week before about the building and construction industry which has always been the barometer of industrial activity over the years.  This industry is suffering a deep depression and has been run into the ground because of inactivity on the part of this Government.  The industry has been deliberately starved of funds, the Public Capital Programme has been cut back, local authority funds have been slashed and, as a result of a 13 per cent reduction in building and construction activity in the current year there are now 45,000 out of a total of 125,000 unemployed. There are skilled men, apprentices and many other young people who have completed courses and who are <Col N="1360" /> unable to get any positions or are without hope of doing so in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Government National Planning Board, in their plan for 1984 to 1987, recommended increased capital investment in the construction industry to stimulate private and public sector involvement in the building trade but, unfortunately, the Government have chosen to ignore that.  The industry needs a large capital injection because at least 10,000 jobs could be created within the industry tomorrow morning.  In fact probably it would not be as costly as people might think because the yield in PAYE and the elimination of the people from the dole would more than compensate. However the Government do not see their way to investing money in the building trade at present.  They have buried their heads in the sands in regard to this industry.  Furthermore, private investment has been given nothing but disincentives. For example, VAT increases have more than offset any initiative taken.  Then there are the planning charges and increased employer PRSI contributions all of which militate against the building trade.  I do not think any Member of the House would deny that that industry is on its knees at present. We need to create a climate in which people will be encouraged, will be prepared to invest, but that sort of lead is not being given by the Government at present.  Instead there is total indifference being shown to the building and construction industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan referred to the timber and forestry industry, an industry which has been neglected by consecutive Governments over the years.  The authors of the afforestation programmes of the fifties and sixties did not envisage the present use to which our timber is being put.  I should imagine that they intended that it would show a large return in years to come.  But consecutive Governments have made a mess of that industry and it is high time something was done about it.  The right conditions should be created.  I understand that a report published today states that £100 million worth of imported soft wood could be substituted by domestic timber <Col N="1361" /> which would have beneficial effects on our economy.  But there is no proper planning on the part of the industry, no organisation.  Rather there is wastefulness, with no co-ordinated plan.  It is high time some Minister took this issue by the scruff of the neck ensuring that there is a proper yield from our timber and forests. We often ask: where can jobs be created?  There are plenty of areas in which this could be done had we but the will and determination to do so.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to my own area, the south-east region, the Kilkenny area in particular where there is at present record unemployment.  Indeed it can be said that the Kilkenny area is a disaster area at present.  The number of people currently engaged in industrial employment is probably the lowest in the south-east area.  Indeed a member of the Minister's party asked today in the House that the Minister would make available special increased industrial grants to the Kilkenny area to ensure that jobs are created there.  There have been closures one after another in the course of the past 12 months.  All of the small engineering works which had existed in an agricultural rural area have closed down. There are no jobs available in the engineering sector in the area at present. These were industries in which two or three people were involved and where they made a big difference in each parochial area.</P>
    <P>I could give a litany of companies that have closed down such as Southern Steel in Ballyhale, Roadmaster Caravans in Castlecomer, Kilkenny Engineering Products in Kilkenny, a loss of 70 jobs in Albatross in New Ross, Kilkenny Standard in Kilkenny city, Kelly's in Laois, Keenan's in Bagenalstown.  There are vacant IDA factories in Freshford in County Kilkenny where no clients can be found to take up the factory space, also in New Ross.  Of course there is the huge Fieldcrest factory where thousands of square feet of factory space is lying idle without any effort having been made to find a suitable occupant.  I cannot let this opportunity go without reminding the House that a couple of years ago when <Col N="1362" /> Deputy Reynolds was the Minister for Industry, my colleagues and friends including the Minister present, walked through the lobbies in support of a motion to nationalise Fieldcrest; I emphasise that, to nationalise Fieldcrest. The Government party were defeated on that motion.  My constituency colleagues had insisted that that motion be tabled.</P>
    <P>As a result of the efforts of the Minister at that time a small industry was sought &mdash; Santens were found and they occupied a small portion of that factory.  I am sad, particularly in view of the interest shown then by present members of the Government, that they have made no effort whatsoever since to put one extra job into that factory.  It is hypocrisy at its worst and I hope due notice will be taken of that fact.  I never lose an opportunity of reminding the Government side of the manner in which that motion was passed in the House at that time.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned insurance for young drivers in the course of his remarks.  I am particularly pleased to note that he has established a new representative board.  I hope it will not prove to be like other boards, committees and task forces that he has established.  I hope it will prove to be a genuine effort to facilitate young people in getting insurance. I believe there is a deliberate attempt on the part of insurance companies to prevent young people from getting proper car insurance cover, to drive the premium so high that it is totally out of their reach.  I hope that when the representative body report back in the near future, not in two or three years' time, some way will be found for young people at least to get insurance so that they can afford to drive to and from work.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen, and he must conclude at 8.15 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments, as did Deputy Aylward, on the question of insurance.  I would like the Minister to look at the way in which insurance companies operate selectively in giving insurance, especially house insurance.  In the Cork region they have refused to cover certain types of dwellings <Col N="1363" /> for fire and theft.  The Minister said that he hoped to get the Restrictive Practices Commission to carry out a series of studies under section 12.</P>
      <P>I came in here this evening to ask the Minister to act on the report that has been with his Department for two years and which relates to legal conveyancing and the monopoly that the legal profession enjoy in that area.  I am convinced that the type of activity carried on in this regard is adding between 10 and 15 per cent to the price of purchasing a house. The report was submitted in April 1982. It went out to a number of Departments and it was accompanied by a report from An Foras Forbartha which dealt with the way in which building societies operated in house purchases.  I hope that the Minister will introduce legislation to eliminate confusion and to eliminate also the maze created by professionals and non-professionals such as estate agents, solicitors, surveyors, valuers, building societies, banks and local authorities who each have their own defined area of work with little competition.  The whole area of house purchase is stifled by the solicitors' monoply of conveyancing which effectively blocks any competition in the house transfer system and stifles any real attempt to update the system.  A huge vested interest is involved here, and unfortunately a huge power block within the political system will oppose and attempt to stifle any move made towards a change.  The monopoly kills any incentive to modernise the system and make it more efficient.  The Minister should draft legislation (1) to remove the monopoly on conveyancing (2) to allow building societies and banks to do conveyancing work in competition with solicitors and (3) to allow non-solicitors to do conveyancing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is a broad subject, and to cover the whole spectrum in a mere five minutes would be difficult.  I would like to refer to a few aspects of the Minister's speech and I hope that when he replies he will deal with them.</P>
      <P>Of interest in the north-east of the country, particularly Louth, is the advent of natural gas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the industries located in that part of the country are awaiting impatiently the arrival of natural gas but unfortunately the agreement seems to have become unstuck.  Any breakdown in the agreement between the Government here and the Government north of the Border would endanger the opportunities that the advent of natural gas to that area would open up for the industries existing there and the possibility of new industries.  The horticultural industry with its base on the eastern seaboard has great potential for job creation, and 3,000 to 4,000 job opportunities <Col N="1365" /> have been created as a result of the impetus resulting from the availability of gas and also of input substitution for which there is great scope in the horticultural industry generally.</P>
      <P>The towns of Dundalk, Drogheda and Ardee have a very serious unemployment problem.  The 18 per cent increase in the number of unemployed in the last 12 months gives us a total of 7,565 people unemployed in County Louth at present. The population of that county has grown tremendously.  Many family units have been set up there and the children of those families will be joining the dole queue or the job-seeking queue, and unless the industries are created and the job opportunities emerge we will have a very serious problem.  Only recently in the House the Minister indicated that he intended to encourage the promotion and development of small industries, particularly in Dundalk which has been very badly hit.  I asked him if after a certain time he has ascertained that things are not progressing as he would wish, whether he would declare that part of the country a disadvantaged area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Border counties we are at a positive disadvantage.  That has been outlined clearly in many documents that have been discussed here and in many debates that we have had in this House in recent years in regard to counties such as Louth, Monaghan and Cavan, Deputy Wilson's constituency which has had a progressive decrease in population because job opportunities have not been created there.  The opportunities are not being created either in my county of Louth and I know the Minister from the neighbouring constituency of Meath is very familiar with the scene on the ground and with the difficulties.  I hope he will apply himself to and declare Louth a disadvantaged county.</P>

      <P>I thank all those Deputies who have participated in what has been a very constructive debate.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that recently the IDA reported to me that their pipeline of projects is in a better state than has been the case for the past three years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the size of the unemployment problem, this improvement does not give us grounds for complacency. I have never held the view that industry on its own can solve the unemployment problem but there is evidence on the ground that the number of industrial projects coming through is improving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> As I have indicated there has been a considerable improvement in the rate at which advance factories are being filled. Deputy Reynolds correctly made a good deal of reference to import substitution and to the question of what we might do to build a strong industrial base without recourse to foreign investment by substituting imports where appropriate.  I have indicated some of the steps we are taking in this direction.  The IDA have launched the national linkage programme and I will be looking for a report from them on a three-monthly basis as to the success of the programme.  In addition, I have undertaken a series of meetings with all the supermarkets.  I have met them as a group.  I have met two of them already in their own offices in an effort to find out what they are doing by way of stocking more Irish goods and also by way of encouraging more Irish manufacturers to start producing for the supermarkets' own brands.  The own-brand concept offers an opportunity to people who are fairly new to the manufacturing process, because the supermarket takes over the marketing and to a certain extent the packaging costs of the business and provides a manufacturer with an initial block of work which can provide a platform on which he can do more.  Rather than complain about own brands or about the level of imports we should regard own brands as an opportunity in the food area in particular.  The two major groups I have met have indicated their willingness to co-operate in this way.  I would say to anyone who has any influence with small business particularly in the food area to get in touch with their supermarkets so as to ensure that they live up to what they are saying to me.  If anyone finds that the supermarkets are not performing in accordance with their indications to me, I should like to hear about them.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what Deputy Reynolds had to say about some hospital contracts.  I will be following that matter up with the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds referred also to the Nixdorf Training Centre at Bray in which he was involved.  The problem in this <Col N="1368" /> regard has not been one of bureaucratic delays on the part of agencies but that there were not sufficient numbers of partners other than Nixdorf available in Ireland to get the project going.  If the Deputy wishes to have more information on this I can supply him with it.  I understand that Nixdorf are prepared to go ahead with a lesser product than the one originally envisaged in view of the lack of available partners.  This matter is the subject of correspondence between them and my Department.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flynn referred to motor insurance. While I agree with all the Deputies who have spoken on the problem of motor insurance for young drivers, we must recognise that there are three separate and justifiable reasons for premia tending to be very high for young drivers. First, there is an age loading, and that is justified on the basis of statistics.  Secondly, there is a loading in respect of inexperience, and most young drivers are inexperienced drivers.  Thirdly, there is the question of the no-claims bonus. Most young drivers will not be likely to be able to avail of a no-claims bonus. These three factors combine to bring about the high premia for these young drivers, and all of them are justifiable on the basis of claim experience though they also represent a significant barrier for the young people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution to the problem is to be found perhaps in reducing the overall <Col N="1369" /> cost of insurance which is the result of the high level of payments that have to be made by the insurance companies. That may have to be tackled both by reforming the court system and also by bringing about a reduction in the number of accidents as well as by way of improved compliance with the legal requirement to be insured.  In this connection Deputy Flynn referred to the introduction of a windscreen disc.  The Department of the Environment are pursuing this matter actively.  It has been a Government decision that the disc system is to be introduced. My Department will be pressing the Department of the Environment to have the decision implemented.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Flynn has acknowledged, the Road Traffic Bill has been introduced. Other measures in the report are being pursued as indicated in the original announcement by the Government, so there is no slackening in that area.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Flynn's concern about the increasing burden both of household insurance and of employers' liability insurance.  There is a case for considering why employers' liability insurance has increased.  The reason for increased household insurance is clear.  It is because of crime, so the crime problem must be tackled if we are to reduce insurance premia in this area.  There are suggestions that people may have difficulty in obtaining household insurance, but if any Deputy has details of any such case I should be glad if he would bring them to my attention so that I might pursue them.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions in the area of motor insurance that young drivers are not able to get cover.  There have been some reports of people approaching up to ten or twelve companies but not being successful in this regard.  We have an arrangement whereby if one is refused by more than five companies, my Department will intervene, under the declined cases agreement, with the companies to get cover for those people.  It has been our experience that where people came to us in time and where we put all our resources into their cases, cover was obtained.  That may seem contrary to the general discussion in public.  If we could hear of the cases people are talking about <Col N="1370" /> perhaps we could do more about this problem than we are doing.</P>

      <P>I will take a note of what Deputy Allen has said about getting the conveyancing report on restrictive practices dealt with.  We are working on this with the Department of Justice who have responsibility for a number of the measures that would need to be implemented to ensure that this is done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn referred also to the flour industry and to the problem of imports in that respect.  This is essentially a matter for the Department of Agriculture, but I have interested myself in it and I have had some discussions with Commissioner Davignon and with other members of the Commission about the possibility of these imports being construed as dumping.</P>
      <P>I was impressed by what Deputy Sheehan had to say regarding the opportunities in the area of import substitution in the food area.  It is a matter for commercial companies to exploit the opportunities the Deputy identified, but I hope the new industrial policy with its greater emphasis on providing assistance for marketing and for the acquisition of foreign technology will provide the opportunity for using some of the openings to which Deputy Sheehan referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £14,274,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1984, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, and of certain other services administered by that Office, and of the Public Record Office, and of the Keeper of State Papers and for the purchase of historical documents, etc., and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should mention that responsibility for the Public Record Office was transferred from me to An Taoiseach by Government order dated 27 January 1984.  Arrangements have been made between officials of the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department concerning the mechanics of the transfer.  In any event, my reference just now and the reference in the heading to the Justice Vote, to that office and to the purchase of historical documents is the last such reference.  In 1985 and subsequent years these items will be carried in the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose that all the Votes for which I am responsible be taken together but I shall endeavour to answer any questions on any particular Vote.</P>
      <P>The total Estimate for all the Votes for which I am responsible is £296,054,000, an increase of 8.5 per cent over the expenditure of £272,845,700 for these Votes in 1983, exclusive in each year of expenditure on the Public Record Office from 27 January to 31 December.  The 1984 Estimate is made up as follows: Vote 22, Office of the Minister for Justice, £14,274,000; Vote 23, Garda Síochána, £220,988,000; Vote 24, Prisons, £46,168,000; Vote 25, Courts, £8,769,000; Vote 26, Land Registry and Registry of Deeds £5,745,000; Vote 27, Charitable Donations and Bequests, £110,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> The element of expenditure which is greatest is pay and allowances etc., which account for 74 per cent of the total estimates and show an increase of 13 per cent compared with 1983.</P>
    <P>The recently published 1983 Report on Crime of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána shows that 102,387 indictable offences were recorded.  Of this figure of indictable offences, 2,306 were in respect of offences against the person, 41,364 were in respect of offences against property with violence, 58,283 were in respect of larcenies etc,, and the remaining 434 were in the miscellaneous category.  The largest increase was in the category of offences against property with violence where 4,904 extra offences were recorded &mdash; an increase of 13.5 per cent.  Offences against the person increased by 31 &mdash; a 1.4 per cent increase.  Overall there was a 4.9 per cent increase in reported indictable crimes.  The rate of increase, however, continues to show a reduction.  The figure of 4.9 per cent for 1983 compares with 9.2 per cent in 1982 and 22.8 per cent in 1981.  This is a very welcome trend and is an encouragement both to the Garda and to the general public alike to strive towards an even greater improvement in the future.</P>
    <P>I emphasised during my contribution to the budget debate earlier this year that the need for most of the money provided in my area in the Estimates for 1984 arises from the existence of crime.  At a time when scarce resources are needed for the health and welfare of our people, and for the provision of much-needed jobs, it is disheartening to have to say that the cost to the Exchequer of the various State services involved in the crime area is continuing to increase.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember at the same time that it is only a minority that is contributing to crime and vandalism. The vast majority of our people are decent, law-abiding citizens who want to be able to live and work in peace free from any threats of violence to themselves, their families or their homes. Their basic right to do so has been increasingly challenged by criminal elements in recent years.  I want to say very firmly, however, that this Government <Col N="1373" /> have a positive commitment to ensuring that everything necessary is done to maintain standards of law and order and that those who disregard the law will not be allowed to have their way.</P>
    <P>The Government consider it a top priority that people should be able to go about their everyday business safe and secure in the knowledge that they and their property are protected in their homes and in the streets.  We should remember, of course, that the protection of the public peace is the concern of all citizens and that there is an obligation on each and every person to assist and co-operate with the Garda in their efforts to prevent crime and vandalism.  It is up to us all to take reasonable and sensible precautions to protect our property.  The Garda are doing all they can in the fight against crime and lawlessness but they need the help and continuing support of the general public.  I am quite satisfied that an increased awareness by the public of their duty to uphold the law and to protect themselves and their property would make a valuable contribution to tackling the crime situation.  Needless to say, however, the first requirement is a well-manned, well-trained and well-equipped police force and it is my firm determination and that of the Government to ensure that the Garda Síochána have all the resources they need to uphold the law and to protect the citizens from those who continue to commit crimes and inflict injury.</P>
    <P>The overall provision for the Garda Síochána in 1984 is £220,988,000.  The major items included in this figure are £170.65 million for salaries and allowances, including overtime; almost £28 million for the pensions of former members and widows of former members of the Garda Síochána; £8.1 million for travelling and subsistence expenses, training, compensation and a range of miscellaneous expenses; almost £6 million for Garda transport; and a total of almost £3 million for radio, computer and office equipment.</P>
    <P>The sum of £11.1 million provided for overtime compares with expenditure of £10.9 million in 1983.  The amount for salaries and allowances provides for the <Col N="1374" /> continuation of the Garda recruitment programme to bring the strength of the force up to 11,400 and maintain it at that level.  Additional manpower is one of the measures necessary to deal with the crime situation and, in the light of the continuing need to bring about a substantial reduction in the incidence of crime, the current restrictions on recruitment to the public service generally are not being applied to the Garda Síochána.  So far this year, 270 gardaí have been recruited and, having regard to the present level of wastage, I expect that total recruitment in 1984 will be of the order of 350.  The actual strength of the force on 31 May 1984 was 11,374 including 226 members in training.  Of course, the provision of extra gardaí is not the only measure necessary to combat crime.  We have had a very substantial increase in Garda strength over a short period and the time is opportune to stand back and review the utilisation of resources to see where improvements can be made.  We have a duty to see that the resources of the community are used as effectively as possible in dealing with the crime problem and providing an environment in which the public can go about their daily business without fear of attack on their person or their property.</P>
    <P>Measures to deal with the criminal aspects of drug abuse are being kept under continuing review by the Garda authorities.  There are permanent units of the Drug Squad in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and special emphasis is being placed on the role of all members of the force in the prevention and control of drug abuse.  Apart from the training given to new recruits in anti-drugs work, about 1,600 members of the force, representative of all Garda divisions, have so far completed a special training course, which has been operating for over three years, and which is designed to ensure that participants are fully informed on various aspects of drug abuse, preventive measures and the special skills needed in investigations.  Also, the use of dogs in drug detection work has been the subject of further examination by the Garda authorities.  As present, there is only one dog in the Garda dog unit trained in drug <Col N="1375" /> detection work but three additional dogs have recently been acquired for such work.  Three members of the force have been selected for training as dog handlers and the necessary training is under way. It is envisaged that these extra dogs will be used in Dublin and it is also proposed to acquire a dog for drug detection work in Cork.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my contribution to the budget debate on 2 February, there are two very important areas covered by the Garda Vote which show reduced allocations for 1984 as compared with expenditure in 1983 &mdash; transport and equipment.  This situation does not reflect any decision to reduce expenditure on these items.  The main reasons for the reduced provision in respect of transport are the advance purchase in December 1983 of cars planned for purchase in 1984 and the purchase in 1983 of Garda cars from funds originally earmarked for ministerial cars.  The reduction under the heading of equipment arises because of the substantial investment of about £3.2 million in radio equipment towards the end of 1983 which enabled some equipment to be purchased outright rather than leased, as had originally been intended.</P>
    <P>The increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána and the consequent increase in the cost of Garda manpower to the State make it all the more essential that we ensure that the Garda are organised and deployed in such a way as to provide the most effective police service possible.  A new system of policing has been tried out on a pilot basis with a good deal of success for some time in two rural Garda Districts and the desirability of extending this system to other rural areas is being considered.  No decision has yet been made to do so.</P>
    <P>Approximately £6 million has already been spent on the new Garda communications network.  It is expected to have the network operational in all Garda Divisions outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area within the coming months.  The network for the Dublin area will include a computer-aided system to direct and control the most efficient use of all gardaí <Col N="1376" /> and patrol cars on operational duty. Tenders for the supply of the network for Dublin are being evaluated at present and the placing of a contract should be possible in the very near future.  I have already drawn attention to the fact that the Estimate provision for radio equipment in 1984 is less than the expenditure last year.  The reason for this, as I said, is that towards the end of 1983 it was possible to make funds available which enabled about £3.2 million worth of radio equipment to be purchased outright.  This in turn meant that a reduction could be made in the amount required to finance the project during 1984, without in any way affecting the rate of progress on the network or slowing down momentum in any way.</P>
    <P>The provision for Garda computer equipment for 1984 is also sufficient to permit a significant expansion in the computer network available to the force. Tenders for the supply of equipment to link a further number of stations to the Garda computer are under consideration at present and it is intended to place a contract shortly.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer briefly to the system of promotion within the Garda Síochána. Sound personnel policies are essential for the success of any organisation.  Having regard to the size of the Garda Síochána, its complexity as an organisation, the vital nature of the duties entrusted to it and the ways in which these can impinge on each and every one of us, it is of particular importance that the Garda Síochána should have an enlightened and effective promotion policy and system.  It is essential that the system should succeed in selecting the most able officers to provide first class leadership and that it should enjoy the confidence and support of the general membership who will be aspiring to promotion.  I am very pleased, therefore, to have been able to approve of the introduction of a new promotion scheme for the Garda Síochána, which is designed to achieve these twin aims and which has the full backing of the Garda Commissioner and of all the Garda Staff Associations.  The operation of the scheme is being monitored by a Promotions Advisory Council, which includes <Col N="1377" /> suitably qualified persons from outside the force, and I am confident that under its general direction the new scheme will contribute in a very real way to the general well-being and efficiency of the force.</P>
    <P>Training is another area of vital importance to the success of the Garda Síochána.  Certain proposals relating to the review and improvement of Garda training generally are at present under discussion, but I do not propose to make any public statement about the matter at this stage.  I can say, however, that the financial resources provided for Garda training are adequate to meet all present requirements.</P>
    <P>I propose now to make some comments on prisons.  The total net allocation on the Prisons Vote is £46,168,000, an increase of almost 10 per cent on the 1983 net outturn of £41,973,000.  The main portions of this allocation are devoted to expenditure on salaries, wages and allowances and to capital expenditure on the Department's building programme for new prisons and places of detention &mdash; 55 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on prisons overtime in 1983 was £7,305,000.  The provision for prisons overtime in 1984 is £6.5 million. This represents an 11 per cent reduction on the overtime outturn for 1983.  Measures have been taken recently which will lead to a reduction in overtime working in the prison service.  Further measures which will have to be taken if expenditure is to be kept within the £6.5 million allocated will require careful consideration.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £11.490 million made to prisons capital programme for 1984 is the same amount as was allocated in 1983.  The main thrust of the programme will be directed towards a place of detention and a prison planned for Wheatfield, Clondalkin, County Dublin, where, to cope with the need for additional custodial accommodation, places are being provided for over 450 offenders.  It is hoped to commence building the larger of the two very shortly and to make a start on the second later this year. Consideration is also being given to whether it may be possible, within the <Col N="1378" /> confines of the programme, to bring design work to completion this year on new custodial accommodation in Cork for about 200.  Actual construction work would take about three years to complete and would have to be staged to correspond with the availability of finance for the total capital programme over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Work will continue in 1984 on the provision of facilities for work, work training, education and recreation for offenders at Limerick Prison and on consolidating the perimeter wall of Mountjoy prison.  Work will commence soon on the extension of the women's prison in Mountjoy and I hope that similar work on the women's prison in Limerick will be feasible later in the year. These extensions will provide much needed extra recreational and occupational facilities for women prisoners, as well as extra custodial capacity.</P>
    <P>On 1 June there were two fillable vacancies for prison service grade staff on an authorised establishment of 1,562. Thus, 1,560 staff were supervising 1,643 offenders, a ratio of 0.95 staff to one offender.  The ratio of staff to offender varies from institution to institution and is determined by the needs of the individual institutions having regard to security, services, regimes, etc.  The staffing needs of a high security prison are obviously much greater than those of, say, the open institution.</P>
    <P>The Estimates also make provision on the non-pay, non-capital side for a daily average of 1,578 prisoners in custody. This projection represents an increase of 11 per cent on the 1983 daily average of 1,418.  In fact, it appears that it will be very much on the low side as the number in custody at present is regularly well over 1,600.  The higher numbers in custody obviously add to expenditure as prisoners must be clothed and fed and provided with various services.  The estimates on the non-pay non-capital side show an increase of 16 per cent on the 1983 provision and I am satisfied that this is as small an increase as can be achieved taking into account increases in the cost of living and the increased numbers being accommodated in the prisons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> The continued pressure on accommodation shows no signs of easing.  I am constantly looking at ways of further increasing the available accommodation in the prisons and places of detention. Despite the considerable increase in the daily average being catered for, there is unfortunately a continuing need to &ldquo;shed&rdquo; prisoners in advance of their normal release date.  I dealt with this matter in my contribution to the budget debate and all I can do now is repeat that everything possible is being done to minimise the practice.  Towards this end a re-organisation of some probation and welfare officers' case-loads took place towards the end of last year and this has enabled a significantly greater number of prisoners to be released under supervision.  This is a practice which benefits both the prisoner and society and at present the number under such supervision in the community is 339.</P>
    <P>In the long term I believe that only the wider use of alternatives to imprisonment will stem the flow of committals to custody. The Criminal Justice (Community Service Order) Act, 1983, which gives the courts power to make community service orders will be brought into operation as soon as the necessary probation and welfare service staff are recruited and trained.  Regulations under the Act and Rules of Court are currently being prepared.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the probation and welfare service I should point out that at present about 2,200 offenders are on probation and under other supervision from the courts.  This is a significant number of offenders and it is the policy of my Department to develop probation as a viable alternative to imprisonment. Towards this end my Department, through the service, is actively encouraging the establishment in various parts of the country by voluntary community groups of hostels, day-centres and workshops to which offenders, especially young offenders, can be referred. Already several such centres have been established and more are planned.  The total provision in the Estimates for probation hostels and workshops is almost £1 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> The Estimates also make provision for education and work training programmes in the prisons.  I attach great importance to these programmes as it is through them that efforts are made to improve the prisoner as a person and give him skills which he did not have before.  On the education side over 80 teachers, mainly from local vocational education committees, provide tuition for offenders in all the institutions. General school subjects are taught but the more typical subject areas are literacy, social education, art, physical education, languages, woodwork, drama and music.  It is interesting to note that the prisons education programme is the largest single adult education sector in the country and I am anxious to see it continuing to develop so that it can adequately respond to the educational needs of prisoners.</P>
    <P>Improvements are planned for this year, and this applies particularly to library facilities and the continued improvement of library stock.  I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the co-operation my Department have received over the years from the various vocational education committees, who pay the teachers' salaries, the local library authorities in the development of the education and library services in the prisons, and the many other individuals and organisations involved in the education programme.</P>
    <P>On the work-training side, the programme consists of intensive industrial training on AnCO lines at the Training Unit, Glengarriff Parade, and occupational work at all institutions to meet the needs of offenders for occupation and training.  There are plans to develop this programme by expanding industrial training in engineering and electronics and by introducing construction and catering training.  This development is being helped by support being obtained from the European Social Fund.  Workshop activities are also being developed to provide occupation for offenders, and emphasis is being placed on using workshop resources to help disadvantaged persons in the community.  I would like to place on record my appreciation of the <Col N="1381" /> help secured from AnCO in the development of the work-training programme in the prisons and places of detention.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that I have recently established a Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System under the chairmanship of Dr. T.K. Whitaker.  The committee's terms of reference are such that the committee will be able to carry out a thorough investigation into the penal system.  I am sure that Deputies will join with me in wishing this committee well.  I can tell the House that the committee have already made considerable progress with their formidable task. Their report is likely to be a blue print for policy in the penal area up to the end of the century and beyond.</P>
    <P>I come now to the area of my Department's responsibilities relating to the courts, the overall provision for which is £8,769,000 in 1984, an increase of 14 per cent on the 1983 provision.  Broadly outlined these responsibilities range from the preparation and promotion of any necessary legislation governing the establishment, constitution, jurisdictions, and functioning of our courts to ensuring that, as far as practicable, all courts and court offices are enabled to function effectively. A matter of particular concern to me at present is the delays which in recent years have developed in relation to the hearing of High Court jury actions and criminal and civil business at a number of Circuit Court venues.</P>
    <P>In relation to the High Court in Dublin, the problem of delay can best be dealt with by having a sufficient number of jury courtrooms at the Four Courts to deal with the volume of cases being entered, and I am hopeful that this situation will shortly come about.  Work has recently commenced on the provision of two extra courtrooms for the High Court in accommodation which was freed by moving some High Court Offices out of the Four Courts Building to an office block at Dolphin House, the former Dolphin Hotel, in Essex Street.  One of these courtrooms will have jury facilities, and I expect that they will both be ready for use in the near future.</P>
    <P>A further encouraging factor is that the <Col N="1382" /> statistics for the 1983 legal year, that is, the year ended 31 July 1983, show some significant improvements in the state of High Court business.  The main features are: (a) an increase of 33 per cent in the number of jury actions disposed of during the year &mdash; 3,107 as compared with 2,328 in the previous year, (b) an increase of 61 per cent in the number of non-jury common law actions disposed of &mdash; 503 as compared with 312 in the previous year, (c) a reduction from 22 months to 20 months in the average delay from the date of setting down to the date of hearing in the case of jury actions and from 15 months to 13 months in the case of non-jury actions.</P>
    <P>While these improvements can be attributed to several factors I think it appropriate to pay tribute to the President of the High Court for his special efforts, and also to the judges and court officers concerned, whose co-operative approach in this matter has been very significant.</P>
    <P>In Cork the delay in hearing High Court jury actions has, in recent times, become somewhat more serious than elsewhere and, as a result, the President of the High Court has increased the number of sitting days in Cork by some 50 per cent during the present legal year, which commenced on 3 October last.  It is my earnest hope that the extra sitting days will reduce the arrears to a more acceptable level, and in this connection I would appeal to the local practitioners to give some consideration to the views expressed at a symposium held by the Law Society on &ldquo;Courts and Courts Administration&rdquo; at which more than one speaker attributed the delays in the High Court in Cork to the unwillingness of practitioners there to settle cases.  While there are some delays in hearing cases at other major centres at which High Court jury actions are held they are not as serious as the delays in Dublin and in Cork.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Circuit Court I am aware that there are serious delays in some circuits, and the Government recently appointed an additional circuit judge whose services will be available where necessary.  At present he is sitting in Cork, where the arrears are heaviest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> As far as the District Court is concerned considerable progress has been made in clearing the backlog of civil and family business which had accumulated during the District Court clerks dispute.</P>
    <P>A computer system in the Dublin Metropolitan District which has been issuing Garda summonses for the city Garda stations has been extended so that Garda summonses and court lists for all of Dublin city and county are now computerised. This has led to a substantial saving in time both for the courts staff and for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>As regards the operation of the courts, one of the greatest problems continues to be accommodation.  Responsibility for the provision and maintenance of court accommodation, with certain exceptions in the Dublin area, is vested by law in local authorities.  This has given rise to particular problems in a number of areas, and most Deputies will be familiar with problems of this kind in their own areas. However, there have been improvements in a number of cases.  The reinstatement of Waterford courthouse was completed in autumn 1982 and the new courthouse which Wicklow County Council is providing in Bray is expected to be ready for use very shortly.</P>
    <P>Carlow and Laois County Councils have carried out quite extensive repairs and improvements to Carlow and Portlaoise courthouses.  Other local authorities are dealing with less extensive works on an ongoing basis, but naturally progress in this area is affected by the current financial situation.  Restoration of the fire-damaged courthouse in Monaghan is expected to begin this year, and I am hopeful that Cavan County Council will be able to make a start this year on the major works required in Cavan courthouse.</P>
    <P>In Dublin work has started on the development of the Four Courts Hotel site as an office block to accommodate the various court offices at present housed in the Four Courts building, thus freeing further areas there for development as additional courtrooms and ancillary accommodation.  The office block project should be completed within three <Col N="1384" /> years, and conversion of the office space in the Four Courts will be put in hands as soon as possible after that.</P>
    <P>The situation of the Children's Court in Dublin is a matter of some concern. The accommodation available to the court has been unsatisfactory for some years now, and the position deteriorated in November 1981 when the Dublin Castle premises were declared unsafe. The court is at present accommodated on a temporary basis in the Morgan Place wing of the Four Courts, but this is proving unsatisfactory for a number of reasons.  The Office of Public Works explored the suitability of a number of premises as permanent accommodation for the Children's Court without success. They now propose to adapt two houses at Smithfield to provide temporary accommodation for the court pending the provision of a purpose-built courthouse on an immediately adjoining site.  I expect the temporary accommodation to be ready for use later this year and the purpose-built accommodation to be available by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the money necessary to build the permanent Children's Court is being provided from the dormant funds of suitors in the High Court under a Bill &mdash; the Funds of Suitors Bill, 1984 &mdash; which recently passed all stages in this House.  The new Children's Court complex will provide generous waiting and consultation facilities, with conference and duty rooms for probation and welfare officers.  This will ensure that all who are concerned with the welfare of children appearing before the courts will be adequately facilitated.  The plans will include separate waiting areas for gardaí, witnesses and for members of the public.  There will be two courtrooms and judges' rooms.  In addition to two consultation and welfare officers' rooms, a retiring room for solicitors will be provided.</P>
    <P>The 1984 provision for civil legal aid is £1.34 million which represents a small increase of £40,000 on the total grant paid to the Legal Aid Board in 1983.  This increase, however, will not allow for any significant expansion of the board's services and I do not expect that the <Col N="1385" /> board will be in a position to open any new law centres during 1984 from this allocation.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the difficulties which face the board at the present time arising from the current staffing embargo in the public service, which is having a serious effect on the level of service which the board can offer to the public.  As a result of recent discussions which I have had with the Minister for the Public Service, the Legal Aid Board are proceeding to fill some solicitor vacancies which are currently embargoed, and I hope this will effect some improvement in the overall situation.</P>
    <P>The 1984 provision for criminal legal aid shows no increase on last year's allocation of £1.85 million. Included in this amount is the cost of paying value-added tax, currently at 23 per cent on legal fees payable under the scheme, which is ultimately recouped to the Exchequer.  I might add that my Department are proceeding with an examination of the scheme to see what changes may be needed in the present arrangements for providing criminal legal aid, including changes needed to eliminate possible abuses of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Justice has a special position in relation to the law and its reform, more so perhaps than any other Minister of the Government, since I have responsibility for a fairly wide area of the law.  However, as I explained on this occasion last year, a particular difficulty presents itself here, one to which my predecessors have drawn attention before.  As the Ceann Comhairle will confirm, it is not in order for a Deputy to advocate legislation in an Estimates debate.  Accordingly, even if it were within the rules of this House for me to make a statement in relation to any particular item of legislation for which I have responsibility, it would be inappropriate since Deputies would not have the opportunity to deal with the matter.  I will, therefore, say no more on the subject of law reform other than that legislative proposals which I have under consideration will be brought to the notice of the House in the usual way <Col N="1386" /> when I am in a position to announce them.</P>
    <P>Another area for which I have responsibility is the work of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.  The main bulk of the 1984 provision of £5,745,000 for the registries &mdash; over 87 per cent &mdash; is in respect of salaries.  The provision for overtime in 1984 is £100,000, or 1.9 per cent of the total pay provision.  This represents a further step in a pattern of diminishing overtime in recent years.  For example, expenditure on overtime accounted for 8.8 per cent of the total expenditure on pay in 1978.  The corresponding figures for 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983 were 4.6 per cent, 4.1 per cent, 3.5 per cent, 2.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively.  Most of the expenditure on overtime is incurred in the Land Registry.  The total number of applications in the main categories of work lodged in the Land Registry in 1978 was approximately 185,000.  The average lodgment during the years 1979 to 1983 was just over 212,000 with the lodgment for 1983 being 232,000 &mdash; an increase of 25 per cent compared with 1978.  On the other hand, the staffing in 1983 for the same categories of work showed an increase of only 3 per cent over the 1978 establishment.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry is required to be self-supporting under section 14 subsection (2) of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, which came into operation on 1 January 1967.  Regular analyses of income and expenditure and adjustments of fees are carried out to ensure that this legal requirement is fulfilled.  The most recent change in the fees structure became operative on 1 March 1984.  In my contribution to the budget debate in February I gave details of the fees and how they compared with the fees operative in 1967.  The comparison showed that the 1984 fees would have been significantly higher had the 1967 fees been used as a base and the fees been adjusted regularly in the meantime in accordance with the rate of inflation.  I also provided details of delays in the main categories of work which showed that the registry was continuing to provide a reasonable public service in most areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> It is fair, I think, to conclude that the Land Registry is giving its fee-paying public good value for money.  That is not to say that there is not room for improvement; I am well aware that there is, particularly in the areas of first registration and cases involving extensive examination of title such as applications for the registration of title acquired by possession, in which there are long delays at present.  Proposals have been prepared for some time which would involve a rearrangement and speeding up of the way these cases are processed in the Land Registry but as the implementation of the proposals would require a certain amount of staff restructuring it has not been possible to proceed with them because of the general Civil Service staffing embargo. However, even if there were no staffing restrictions and no matter what rearrangement or restructuring is carried out there are unavoidable delays built into the processing of these applications; for example, notice has to be served on possible interested parties in many cases and the notices may occasion objections or replies which can lead to time-consuming correspondence.</P>
    <P>I have to say, also, that delays are often caused by the manner in which applications are presented to the Land Registry. Here I must give credit to the Incorporated Law Society for having organised during 1983, with the co-operation of the Land Registry, a series of seminars for solicitors which were addressed by Land Registry officials with the aim of minimising the need for queries on applications, thus reducing the time taken in dealing with them.  Seminars were held in Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo and Sligo during 1983 and I am sure that further seminars will be organised if there is perceived to be a need for them.</P>
    <P>The central office of the Land Registry is at present located in three buildings &mdash; in Chancery Street, in the Setanta Centre and in Bow Street.  Efficiency would be improved if all the staff could be accommodated in one building.  However, unfortunately this is a long-term prospect.</P>
    <P>The computerisation of the Land <Col N="1388" /> Registry folios which commenced in December 1982 is proceeding although at a slower pace than I would wish because of losses of staff under the embargo on the filling of vacancies.  Nonetheless, it is now expected that all the Dublin folios will be computerised in less than a year's time.  It was decided to start with the Dublin folios because there are no duplicate folios available for Dublin as there are in the local offices of the other counties. A decision will be taken in the next few months as to the manner in which the programme will be extended into the rest of the country.  The computerisation of the folios is a very big step forward for the Land Registry in this age of rapidly-developing technology.  When the through-put of over a quarter of a million applications a year is taken into account, the retrieval of documents has been a huge and ever-increasing problem for the registry &mdash; and, of course, its customers &mdash; over the years.  The significance of the fact that a document will be available for inspection, or as a copy, at literally the push of a button cannot be over-rated.</P>
    <P>While proposals for major improvements in both the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds are at present in abeyance because of the embargo, the organisation and procedures in both offices are being examined on a continuing basis and every effort is being made to increase efficiency within the existing constraints. One particular initiative which I think worthy of mention is the setting up of an Image Committee in the Land Registry in July 1982.  The membership of the committee is representative of most sections of the staff and its terms of reference were to activate and promote interest among the members of the staff in the improvement of the overall image presented by the registry in its daily dealings with the public and the service it offers them.  Several recommendations have been made by the committee some of which it has already been possible to implement.  The committee will be a continuing feature of the Land Registry operation in its efforts to provide as participative and effective an answer as possible to the challenge of public service.</P>
    <P>The remarks which I have made in the <Col N="1389" /> course of this address do not, of course, constitute an exhaustive description of all the work and services provided for in Votes 22 to 27, inclusive.  I welcome Deputies to comment on any aspects of the Votes, however, and, as I said at the start of my remarks, I shall endeavour to answer any questions raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Estimate and I wish to offer our praise to the Garda for the work they are doing in difficult circumstances, to the members of the Judiciary and the courts and to members of the prison service.  Each of these groups has a vital and important part to play in the life of the community and sometimes it is forgotten that their work is so essential.  I have pleasure in stating here the total support of my party for the Garda, the courts and for members of the prison service who carry out perhaps the most difficult job in that they have to hold on to prisoners for long periods and in fairly difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the crime report for 1983.  Fortunately that report is available to us at this stage.  I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on having it available a little earlier this year and in time for discussion of this Estimate because it is very helpful to us in considering the position in relation to crime.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the rate of increase in crime is dropping and we welcome that.  He pointed out that it is down to 4.9 per cent for 1983.  In 1981 fairly drastic action was taken to deal with crime which continued in 1982 and 1983 and there has been a reduction in the rate of increase.  That would be fine if the debate were confined to us in this House but, unfortunately, on the streets the reality is that the overall level of crime is increasing.  As the Minister said, crimes connected with housebreaking, burglary and larceny are increasing at an enormous rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The citizens find the present position totally unacceptable.  Housebreaking is now virtually out of control and citizens are fed up with the repeated break-ins.  I was talking to a man today who said they did not break into his house any more because there is nothing left for them to <Col N="1390" /> take.  The rate is still rising and is far too high.  To the man in the street the remedies are not working although we know, from overall statistics, there is a drop in the rate of increase.</P>
    <P>We must consider the steps we are taking and how strong they are in relation to the problem.  The Minister must take very urgent action to deal with the continuing rise in crime and vandalism.  I was interested to note that the Minister took this aspect as his first topic and that he then mentioned the drug problem.  That is the way I would have approached the Estimate, putting these as the two foremost problems.  The report for 1983 shows that the number of indictable crimes recorded has, for the first time, passed 100,000.  Even more frightening is the fact that by far the greatest increase was in burglary and larceny.  The Minister referred to the number of indictable crimes, but if you look at the value of stolen property, you will find that it has increased from £29 million in 1982 to a staggering £43.7 million in 1983, an increase of 50 per cent.  This must make 1983 the year of the burglar, when the security of people's homes, cars and other possessions was at an all time low. Notwithstanding the gains made in other areas, we must address ourselves to this problem very urgently.</P>
    <P>We are now facing into another summer of rampant vandalism in city areas, of robberies, housebreaking and car stealing.  I feel very strongly about this because in the last couple of weeks several people have mentioned their worries with regard to what will happen during the summer in certain city areas.  I was speaking to a garda the other night who has hit by a joy-rider, but, fortunately, he was not seriously injured.  Already, communities in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford are crying out for protection as the summer epidemic of urban crime and vandalism hits our homes and streets.  Children's lives are at risk in certain well known urban areas.  Free from school they are particularly vulnerable to joy-riders, and I am fearful for their safety as summer approaches.</P>
    <P>Elderly people are in danger all the time, and the Minister has often referred <Col N="1391" /> to that problem.  There is a solution to this frightening rise in crime.  The 1983 crime report recognises what we all know &mdash; that increased patrolling by uniformed members of the Garda in the more densely populated areas has led to a reduction in crime.  That is brought out very clearly in the report.  The garda on the beat with knowledge of his area is contributing to peace, security and safety in the community.  We can see the measures which are having an effect, we should recognise this and take action accordingly.  I call on the Government to stop the penny-pinching policy of gradualism where crime is concerned, to put the extra men on the streets where they are needed, to appoint the extra 600 men and women who have been authorised and bring the Garda strength up to the 12,000 level which was set by Fianna Fáil. They should set aside the limitation in the Estimate of 11,400 by the end of 1984. The candidates have been examined and are ready for call-up.  Do not leave them standing idly by drawing the dole.  Put them to work now as they are badly needed on the streets of our major cities. Indeed the Minister has very clearly stated the figures, of which I was aware. He said that the strength of the force will be brought up to 11,400 and maintained at that level until the end of the year.  He also said, in answer to a parliamentary question, that it is the intention to have the number at 11,400 at the end of 1984 and to work on that basis.  He has said that again quite clearly here.  He pointed out that at 31 May 1984 the number was 11,374 with more members in training. There are also gardaí leaving continuously because of retirement or other reasons.</P>
    <P>There is a firm decision here to maintain the level at 11,400.  If we look back at the figures we find that on 31 December 1981 the number was 9,943.  There was a positive decision taken at that stage to increase the strength by 2,000.  That was continued by the incoming Minister and he attempted to bring it up to the level which was intended to be 12,000 but stopped short at 11,400.  That is a serious mistake.  I know the Minister will say he <Col N="1392" /> is redeploying gardaí and trying to spread people around.  However, I believe that would be needed in addition to the 12,000 who were authorised in the first instance to make any impact.  We still have an emergency notwithstanding the excellent progress which has been made in certain areas over the last few years.  In 1982 we authorised the appointment of the extra 2,000 gardaí above the then approved strength of 10,000 gardaí.  It was in response to an urgent problem.  Few will disagree that where these extra gardaí have appeared on the beat the effect has been dramatic.  In the Coolock area the level of crime was reduced by 25 per cent in 1983.  I am very familiar with that area and I know there is a high rate of crime there.</P>
    <P>One of the effects starting late in 1982 was for more gardaí to appear on the beat in those districts and to continue to appear since that date.  It does not matter who sent them there, they are very effective in protecting the community and in getting results.  I should like to pay tribute to the gardaí in the different areas who have been doing this work happily and cheerfully.  The Government continued this policy with further beneficial effects, but the heavy hand of the Minister for Finance has stopped this progress by cutting the Estimates for 1984 and leaving 600 potential recruits idle on a frozen panel.  The key to the problem lies in the Estimates.  Give the Garda the men and resources and they will reverse the rise in crime and vandalism.  They have shown that they can do so and there is a duty on us to give them the manpower to do so. It is a matter of great urgency now.</P>
    <P>With regard to community policing, while the Garda need the extra numbers promised, they also need a fundamental reorganisation of their methods of operation, their deployment and relationship with the community.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors made their proposals for community policing at the end of 1982.  The Joint Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism have already produced an initial report on the neighbourhood watch system and on the operation of community based crime prevention committees, a report which the <Col N="1393" /> Minister welcomed in the House.  They will shortly furnish a further report on other aspects of community policing.  The Commissioner has begun pilot studies on neighbourhood watch.  However, all these desirable developments will be of little value if we do not have a community policing budget.  We want to see specialised gardaí operating on the same beat within a community and integrating with the community in its life and activities. The Estimates should clearly cover an allocation for this purpose.  The Minister when in preparing next year's Estimates should consider having a clear allocation for community policing.  Dramatic results have been obtained in other countries where community policing methods have been introduced.  We cannot afford to delay in our approach to these new methods of deployment, which in many respects are a return to the wiser methods of days gone by where the local garda knew his beat and his community.</P>
    <P>The residents of our vast new urban and suburban areas are crying out for this support.  If the Garda are to continue to be relevant to them then they must be heavily deployed in these communities. An important aspect in regard to the Estimate concerns the Garda, their deployment and the contribution they can make.  There is an onus on us to ensure that the numbers provided are adequate and that the members of the force are given the training and support they require.  If they get that I believe we can curtail the problem.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of drug abuse.  The time for dealing leniently with those involved in the sale and distribution of illicit drugs is long gone.  We in Ireland have for the last few years been viciously exploited by hardened criminals involved in international drug trafficking.  These criminals have found willing accomplices in the Irish market who are prepared to profit unscrupulously on the vulnerability of our youth.  The Minister will have our full support in any measures he takes to deal with the problem.  Any doubts which Irish society may have had about the seriousness and extent of the hard drug problem were dispelled by the results of the survey <Col N="1394" /> carried out in Dublin's north inner city at the end of 1982.  This showed that 12 per cent of young people between the ages of 15 and 19 were addicted to heroin.  Since then it has become clear that many other communities have been afflicted by this scourge.</P>
    <P>As an island community we have a special opportunity and a duty to put an end to this menace.  While the work of education in relation to the dangers of drug abuse and the rehabilitation of abusers is of prime importance, we also need to crack down on the pushers and dealers and cut off their supplies.  We must commit ourselves to root out the drug pushers and to deal harshly with them.  If the courts do not impose proper sentences then we will have to make them do so by introducing minimum sentences for pushers and distributors as is the case in some other crimes.</P>
    <P>Early last year I called for a crack down on the traffic in drugs and the treatment of those who supply hard drugs as subversives, because they are subverting the very life blood of our nation&mdash;our youth. I said that those who deal in heroin should be dealt with by the Special Criminal Court under the Offences Against the State Act.  I am now again calling on the Government to take this effective step for a three-year period as part of a crash programme on drug abuse.  So far the Government's proposals do not go far enough.  The following are some of the further measures which should be taken urgently:</P>
    <P>1.  Make the trafficking and dealing in heroin and other hard drugs a scheduled offence under the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>2.  Do not allow alleged distributors of illicit drugs to be granted bail except by permission of the High Court.</P>
    <P>3.  Introduce a mandatory minimum sentence for drug pushing of three years.  The present maximum is 14-years, and the Government propose to change this to &ldquo;life&rdquo; which to date has meant eight to ten years.  The Government have refused to introduce mandatory minimum sentences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> 4.  Provide for the confiscation of the property of distributors of hard drugs, other than the family home as defined in the Family Home Protection Act.</P>
    <P>5.  Provide for supervised compulsory treatment and rehabilitation of drug abusers who appear before the courts.</P>
    <P>6.  Provide emergency police support and civilian patrols in conjunction with the Garda in communities where drug abuse and pushing is a major problem.  Finance, Garda manpower or overtime should not be spared in such communities to stamp out the pushers.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to criticise, howevery rightly, some of those, for example, Sinn Féin groups, who become involved in such communities.  He must provide the manpower and facilities to tackle the problems whatever the cost.</P>
    <P>7.  Ensure that the drugs squad have the necessary manpower, mobility and resources.</P>
    <P>8.  Tighten security against the import of drugs through harbours, airports and Border posts by extending the powers which the Garda have under the Misuse of Drugs Act to the 700 customs officers.  Sections 23, 26, 27 (1) and (3), 28 and 29 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, should be extended to officers of the Customs and Excise Service &mdash; the powers relate to searching, the issue of warrants and the adequacy of penalties.</P>
    <P>9.  Establish a customs drugs squad of specialised members and provide intensive training and action programmes for the detection of drug imports.  Supply detection and other equipment to enable the whole customs' staff to play a more effective role in combating the import of drugs.  They work closely with the Garda but the measures suggested would improve their efficiency.</P>
    <P>10.  Develop teams of drug sniffing dogs to help Garda and customs officers in detecting hidden supplies of <Col N="1396" /> drugs especially at customs points and in parcel post.  The first dog is now in training.</P>
    <P>That was mentioned by the Minister and I am glad to hear he is getting on well.  I believe the decision to develop such teams arose from calls in the House.</P>
    <P>The battle against drug abuse is one which is shared by Irishmen and women on both sides of the Border.  It is in our mutual interest to crackdown on trafficking through all ports and airports, North and South.  Close co-operation between police authorities and customs agents on both sides of the Border in drug surveillance should be encouraged.  The aim should be to rid the whole island of imported illicit drugs by smashing the supply lines.  In the interests of our youth we should try to make all the island of Ireland a drug free zone.</P>
    <P>There are many facets to the whole problem of drug abuse which are in need of urgent attention and action.  Some of these have been highlighted over the last few years, but, there is one aspect which so far has received little attention.  It is well established that a high percentage of crime, especially in Dublin city and its suburbs, is drug-related.  Suggestions have been made that the drug network and supply has moved to the suburbs.  It is possible that that is a result of the crack down in the centre of the city.  The Minister, and the Garda Commissioner, will have to keep that under surveillance. Drug abusers need money to feed their habit.  A recent survey of drug abusers in Dublin committal prisons carried out in September 1981 showed that of 22 drug abusers committed to Mountjoy Prison only two had served any sentence prior to taking drugs.  The majority, 70 per cent, were convicted of larceny from houses, persons or cars to provide money for drugs.  It is significant that there has been such a big increase in larcenies and burglaries.</P>
    <P>The scale of this problem can be measured by the fact that by September 1982, over 8,000 people had come to the notice of the Garda because of their involvement in the misuse of drugs.</P>
    <P>During the month of September 1982, <Col N="1397" /> prison based probation officers identified 92 drug abuser inmates of Mountjoy and St. Patrick's Institution, with 54 of these residing in St. Patrick's.  The trend is clearly towards an increase in these numbers. It is worth noting that in New York, 68 per cent or two-thirds of all inmates of correctional facilities in 1983 has a history of substance abuse.  That is an indication that there is an onus on us to look closer at the relationship between drugs and crime and those committed to prisons.</P>
    <P>Closer examination of the position here may well reveal that a very high proportion of our crime is also related to substance abuse.  If we want to reduce crime, we will have to deal with the causes.  This we are not doing at present. In the 1981 survey of drug abusers in Dublin prisons it was shown that:</P>
    <P>1.  The majority of drug abusers were sentenced in the District Court and will serve only a maximum of nine months.</P>
    <P>2.  Coolmine, with its 12-month intensive recovery programme, is not an attractive alternative to prison.</P>
    <P>3.  Prison sentences, as served at present by drug addicts do nothing for their problem except to keep the abuser alive a little longer.</P>
    <P>4.  It was considered unlikely that enclosed exposure to treatment would be provided in the foreseeable future by any agency outside the prison system.</P>
    <P>The Minister should concentrate more resources to this area.  I accept that there is a greater awareness of the problem.</P>
    <P>A study by Fr. Brian Power in Dún Laoghaire in 1983 has shown that in a sample of 75 heroin users, 59 had served sentences in prisons or juvenile institutions, while 13 others had appeared in court on charges.  In total, 72 out of 75 had come before the courts.  This further emphasises the need for separate treatment centres for drug addicts who are serving sentences.  This treatment must be provided in separate facilities within the prison system.</P>
    <P>Stopping crime means stopping drug abuse, and this demands that we provide <Col N="1398" /> treatment and rehabilitation for inmates with a history of drug abuse while they are still in our prisons.  We can break the cycle for many abusers if we provide treatment programmes in our prisons to which the courts may refer abusers who have become involved in crime.  It is never too late to start.  A high proportion of city and suburban crime is drug-related. Many of these abusers end up in prison where present treatment facilities and programmes are totally inadequate. Drug addiction can be broken during a period of imprisonment, certainly for a percentage of those imprisoned, and a subsequent life of crime averted.  This can be done by providing separate confinement and a recovery programme for substance abusers.  We owe it to those afflicted by drug abuse to help them to rescue their lives.  We owe it to the community to break the cycle of drug-related crime.  The Government should now make arrangements to provide recovery programmes for abusers, especially those young people in St. Patrick's Institution, to help them stay out once released.</P>
    <P>There are international aspects to this problem.  Drug trafficking and drug abuse are problems which span international and inter-continental boundaries.  We must give our total support to international efforts to stem the supply and traffic in illicit drugs.  Our voices must be to the forefront in international fora in promoting and assisting such international co-operation.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has a special responsibility for this co-operation.  On a visit to Garda headquarters we saw that they keep a very close eye on the international movements of people involved in the drug trade.</P>
    <P>Our recently elected members of the European Parliament have an opportunity to make the Community's social programme more effective and relevant to our drug problems.  Measures which should be pursued include the establishment of a European network to exchange information on the supply and availability of illicit drugs and the extent of racketeering, as well as information about what is being done in each country by way of education and treatment.  There <Col N="1399" /> should also be a tightening of controls at Community frontiers where drug trafficking is known to take place.  We must promote close customs controls and checking of goods and persons travelling into and within the EEC to reduce the availability of illicit drugs.  There could be European sponsorship of education programmes on drug abuse in schools and youth clubs and assistance from the European Social Fund for the development of rehabilitation clinics and pilot projects in areas of special need such as Dublin City.</P>
    <P>The whole question of drug-related crime is one to which we need to give a great deal more attention.  It became obvious in discussions on crime in the city centre that the level of drug-related crime was quite a high percentage of the total.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the question of security and the task forces.  As part of the savings in Garda pay and overtime the Minister set about systematically disestablishing the security and intelligence networks which had been established by his predecessors. They had proved to be highly effective in dealing with serious crime and subversion.  In our view the Minister for Justice made a serious mistake when he totally disbanded or disestablished the Divisional Task Force and greatly restricted the activities of the Special Task Force based in Dublin.  There was a clear need for re-organisation of the Divisional Task Force, but to disband the 45 units comprising 300 members strategically placed was to incur an unacceptable level of risk, especially along the Border.</P>
    <P>It has now become clear that outside Dublin the Special Branch and Divisional Task Force have been amalgamated into the &ldquo;Detective Branch Country Division.&rdquo; It is probably an apt name.  Is the Minister aware of what is happening on the ground?  These specially trained, armed and specialised men are being returned to ordinary detective duties. They operate even in Border areas only from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m., except in emergency situations when overtime is worked.  This leaves a yawning gap in Border security between <Col N="1400" /> 1 a.m. and 9 a.m.  It is my duty as Opposition spokesman to point out that these men are now spread too thinly in Border areas, especially at this time when there are increased movements of subversives due to conditions in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to re-examine his policy in this respect.  There is a need for a regional task force which could evolve from the former divisional force. I understand that their high-powered vehicles are not being replaced.  This is an unwise economy.  I also understand that post office robberies are starting to increase again.  I would appeal to the Minister not to take risks with security and intelligence gathering, and also to go ahead with the plans to purchase two helicopters.  These should be deployed mainly at the Border and in the Dublin region.  Prevention and intelligence are the first steps in providing security.  The economies being made at present in this area may be counter-productive and dangerous. The Minister would be well advised to review his strategy in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the rural policing system, and I would ask him not to reduce manpower.  In some rural areas we have a very low level of crime, and this may be due to the presence of the gardaí and their involvement in the local community.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the communications network.  I will not repeat some of the things which can be heard on the radio in the Dublin area about the activities going on.  Those who are skilled in crime hear them long before we do.</P>
    <P>I welcome the system of promotion which I understand has been planned for some time.  I hope it is successful.</P>
    <P>Regarding the prison programme, the 1983 Estimate provided £17.6 million but that was reduced last year by the Minister for Finance to £11.498 million and the allocation for 1984 is the same.  It is still £6 million below the amount we had planned to provide.  The £6 million last year and the further £6 million this year would have enabled work at Clondalkin to proceed much more rapidly.  We welcome the move towards completion.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the probation <Col N="1401" /> and welfare services.  It looks as if there is a 49 per cent increase in the Estimate as against the outturn for last year which was £685,000, but my recollection is that the figure originally allocated was £960,000.  This means that there was a very substantial cutback last year and there were complaints about the operation of the service.  It is now back up to £1.024 million, which is slightly above the level we had intended originally last year.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the establishment of the committee of inquiry into the penal system and we look forward to their findings. I welcome the steps being taken to remove delays in court hearings.  The Minister has gone very comprehensively into the work being done there.  The Funds of Suitors Bill came in nice time for the Estimates and enabled the Minister to provide extra finance for the Children's Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the computer system in the Dublin Metropolitan District. When dealing with Garda summonses I have always found the staff there particularly helpful.  We public representatives have to approach them from time to time about people who may have become somewhat confused about fines or who have sold a car and start receiving fines on a car they thought they had finished with.  It crossed my mind to suggest that the Minister might look at the situation in which people do not respond.  If they respond in time with regard to fines then they will be cleared up without going near the courts.  That is a big help in alleviating the burden on the courts.  But there is a fixed date and once that is passed one is into court and that is it. That is something that should be examined. Perhaps there should be some nominal late entry fee in respect of the time lapse between the levying of the fine and the court hearing which would obviate the necessity of people having to go to court.  In many cases I have come across people who have not been available to deal with it, perhaps being absent on holiday or for some other reason.  The people in the fines office are exceptionally helpful and courteous, but once the date is passed it is then into the courts system.  It might be possible to devise a <Col N="1402" /> system in which a nominal late fee would be applicable in such cases and which would save the time of the courts.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious problem obtaining at present in relation to civil legal aid. We public representatives come across many cases now where there is hardship entailed, where the lists have been closed and, although people are seen to be eligible, legal aid cannot handle their poblems. I had a tragic example recently of a man whose wife had gone to England with some of their children.  There was not much more than a row involved.  He needed somebody here to take action on his behalf &mdash; he was eligible &mdash; but they could not do anything for him.  He was told he could go to the English courts and defend his case over there.  But he felt he would have been at a great disadvantage in so doing because his rights were here. He felt he should be able to have a <i>habeas corpus</i> application here demanding that his wife produce the children and have it dealt with in court here.  In fact he did not get the necessary legal assistance, which is very serious when one finds oneself in such a situation.  I was able to manage to get somebody to advise him. But there are real problems like that being encountered.  Certainly the Minister will have our full support in endeavouring to meet that situation.  I welcome his negotiations in getting some extra staff &mdash; I notice that there was a reduction of staff there &mdash; and it is quite obvious he is doing his best to improve the situation. It is clear that there is a serious problem obtaining, one to which more resources will have to be allocated.  It is unlikely that any such resources would be wasted because they are so scarce in any event.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas which the Minister said he would like to cover and I feel similarly.  I should particularly like to say something about the juvenile liaison system which is a very valuable scheme and worthy of greater support. The Minister mentioned the Community Service Orders Act and the fact that he hoped shortly to bring its provision into operation.  This is one of the problems of our parliamentary system that frustrates people outside &mdash; the time lag between passage of the legislation and its implementation <Col N="1403" /> on the ground, which in most cases is far too long.  I am not blaming the Minister for that.  The time taken for the legislation to work its way through is unduly long.  Certainly the Community Service Orders Act is an example of this because its provisions are urgently needed in relation to pressure on the prisons, the handling of offenders and so on, which the Minister fully recognises.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most urgent matter facing public representatives, now that we are into summer, is the problem presented by vandalism and crime, with considerable risk to children and young people on our streets.  I would ask the Minister to go back to the Cabinet in this respect in relation to this Estimate and say that we need the 600 extra Garda personnel approved, that we need the strength of 12,000.  I believe that is the problem which needs to be tackled most urgently and I would ask the Minister to do that following on this debate.</P>
    <P>We are happy to support him in the work he is doing and in the Estimates he has presented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sad that Ireland has to spend approximately £300 million on the enforcement of law and order in one year, particularly when one remembers that we are small country with a population of less than four million.  It will be realised then that there must be something radically wrong and it is about time we took an honest look at ourselves.</P>
      <P>Looking at the criminal or vandal in isolation will not solve the problem.  We must take collective responsibility and blame for the situation obtaining.  The Minister for Justice alone cannot, nor can the Garda alone, nor any other body of people alone, solve this problem.  It needs the collective will and determination of all our people if we are to find solutions, which are not easy, but this should not deter us from endeavouring to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most shocking reflections of our society in recent times was revealed in last Sunday's <i>Independent</i> where it was reported that the Lansdowne Market Research Unit had carried out a survey in which 50 per cent of the people surveyed <Col N="1404" /> considered the Taoiseach to be an honest man and 13 per cent of those surveyed considered the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party an honest man, yet the conclusion of the survey was that the Leader of the Opposition was four points ahead.  This is a sad indictment of public morality.  I only hope that it is not representative of public morality as a whole.</P>
    <P>This country has strayed far from being the island of saints and scholars to one in which ruthlessness is seen to prosper and honesty to be wrong.  To the ordinary man in the street honesty appears no longer to matter.  It has appeared to me that in many instances in recent times the ways of the ruthless seem to succeed over those of the just and honest.  This situation will have to be corrected.  The fact that everybody does it, or that everybody is seeking a scapegoat, is not good enough.  We, as politicians, owe it to the people to stand up and be counted. Unfortunately, we all operate double standards; politicians operate double standards as do the rest of our people. We will have to take a clear look at ourselves, examine what we are at and where we are going.  On the one hand we want peace and justice, law and order, while, on the other, we have not got the guts or determination to see that justice and peace prevail.</P>
    <P>Take a look at our taxation system.  It does not encourage a man to operate in an honest fashion.  It has encouraged many men and women who were once honest workers to opt out into the black economy where they can attain a higher standard of living without fear of detection to the detriment of the Fxchequer and other taxpayers.  When such injustices are seen to exist we cannot hope for a peaceful, law-abiding people.</P>
    <P>All of these problems must be tackled courageously if we are to decrease the Estimate of £300 million for the Department of Justice.  Tonight I am not going to suggest solutions to all those problems, I am going to suggest just one solution. The Minister in his speech extended an invitation to us all when he said:</P>
    <P>Of course, the provision of extra gardaí is not the only measure necessary <Col N="1405" /> to combat crime.  We have had a very substantial increase in Garda strength over a short period and the time is opportune to stand back and review the utilisation of resources to see where improvements can be made.</P>
    <P>I am taking up this invitation now.  It is a pity that the Opposition spokesman has gone, because I got the impression when he was talking that Dublin was Ireland, that crime was synonymous with Dublin and that there was no crime elsewhere in the country.  I tell him that we have crime all over this country in 1984. The lack of security is affecting not just Dublin and the cities, it is affecting the villages and every mile of roadway in this whole nation.  The lack of security in rural Ireland could be overcome if the Minister would open up again the small rural Garda stations.  Years ago when they were being closed down people objected but little notice was taken because the trend was towards centralisation in all spheres, in the Department of Health, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice.  Everything could be done bigger and better from a central unit.  We have learned to our cost not only in the Department of Justice but also in the Department of Health, the Department of Social Welfare etc. that centralisation is not the ideal solution that we all thought it would be.  We need to decentralise our form of Government and all our Departments once more.  The Minister for Justice should consider decentralising the Department of Justice to every village in this country.  The many gardaí who have been recruited over the years have been deployed largely to the cities, particularly to Dublin, although Cork and Limerick have a few of them, but no gardaí have been deployed to rural Ireland.  For three and a half years I have continually made representations to three Ministers for Justice for an extra garda in Carrigtwohill Garda Station. Carrigtwohill, once a village now a satellite of Cork, has a Garda station and two gardaí.  My representations were without success.  When Dominic McGlinchey was in Carrigtwohill the two gardaí in the barracks there went on the search <Col N="1406" /> for him and were caught for that night.  If a third garda had been in the station he would have known that the other two were missing and he could have sent somebody in search of them and perhaps McGlinchey would have been apprehended on the way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>He would have got a fresh pair of pants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we had to wait until 17 March before McGlinchey was caught.  How much taxpayers' money had to be spent during that few months to ensure that he was caught?  We would have been better off with a third garda in Carrigtwohill and perhaps we would have saved a great deal of money as well as alleviating fear of that man when he was on the run.  In another instance the need for a rural Garda station was underlined by a recent murder in my constituency in Dungourney.  The nearest Garda station to that village is 13 miles away in Fermoy and there are two small Garda stations in the eastern part of east Cork.  While I must say in all fairness that the gardaí did an excellent job in apprehending the criminals it would have meant a great deal to the people of that area if they had had their own garda there at the time. There is no centre of security in the locality and the people there are in tremendous fear.</P>
      <P>The gardaí in the local stations would serve many functions, not least the presence of security in the area.  One garda living in the community, interacting with the people and getting to know them, would boost morale and confidence.  The people of rural Ireland are entitled to Garda representation as well as are the people in the cities.  I am not for a moment trying to underestimate in any way the grave problems in the cities, but I suggest to the Minister that, due to lack of security in rural Ireland and the problems that have emerged in recent times, he should take crime in rural Ireland seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole area of traffic should be taken out of the hands of gardaí because they have more important and pressing <Col N="1407" /> work to do.  Many traffic wardens are doing their job very successfully but much of the time of the gardaí is spent on traffic duty and they have no option but to do it.  The hours and days of many gardaí are taken up in giving people &ldquo;fivers&rdquo; as they say.  Not alone is their time wasted but the gardaí are antagonising people, and often they have antagonised me.  For parking outside one's own door on some days &mdash; on other days you are all right &mdash; you get a £5 fine.  People in general tell me that if they go into the city for a day and get a parking fine and are law-abiding apart from that, if they meet a garda he usually succeeds in antagonising them.  In other words, the gardaí are losing the goodwill of the ordinary, decent citizen for having to impose these £5 parking fines.  That traffic work would be best met by a broadening of our network of traffic wardens, and more important work should be left to the gardaí</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say is more in the nature of an intervention than a contribution.  I appreciate that there are other speakers anxious to at least ask questions.  I am glad to note that the Minister and our spokesman, a future Minister, notwithstanding the severe demands on them in the past week or so, have remained in such good form and have been doing such good work in the matter of the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of points I wish to make.  I have referred the Minister already to a situation in my constituency where his powers and the powers of the Garda are being challenged, where CIE have not been running the normal bus service after 7 p.m. for more than three years.  The reason they give is that the service cannot be provided in the absence of Garda protection or interest.  There is an obligation on the Minister to challenge the veracity of that claim.  If it is true he must do something about it but if not he must ask CIE on what basis they make that charge.  The Minister will appreciate the psychological effect of this position. It is well known in that area of Finglas that people have challenged the right of <Col N="1408" /> the buses to run, call these people subversives or whatever, and that the Garda are not co-operating with CIE in the matter of the provision of a bus service.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is some influence in CIE which is responsible for the charge being made, but can the charge be substantiated? The situation is appalling.  If the powers of the Government and of the Garda are being challenged on this issue, one is entitled to ask what they will be challenged on next.  The Minister is aware of the different parts of this city in which certain elements are involved in challenging the lawful powers of the State.  The problem in Finglas is a manifestation of that challenge.  It must be attended to immediately.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to an entirely different matter.  The Minister referred to payment of £11.1 million in respect of overtime.  Last year the corresponding figure was £10.9 million.  When we were in Government various substantial amounts were also provided under this heading.  I appreciate that at times it is necessary that the Garda perform overtime duties, but this is not desirable because any member of the force who has been on duty for eight hours would not be likely to be in very good form for another eight-hour stint.  It would be far better to have a man going on duty who is refreshed physically and mentally.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes to recruit 350 new members to the Garda.  Throughout the country there are the finest of young men and women who are anxious to join the force.  Let us consider the economics of recruiting twice the number proposed. Taking an average salary of £7,500, which is fair enough in the initial years, the recruitment of yet a further 350 people would cost only £2,500,000.  The Minister would still have £8,500,000 for overtime. That is a very fair proposition and one to which the Minister might ask his officers to apply themselves.  Apart from the fact of absorbing these 350 people, there would not be such collossal amounts needed to pay for overtime.</P>
    <P>I trust the lady present will not consider me condescending when I draw attention, on humane grounds, to something I have noticed within the precints of this <Col N="1409" /> House.  From time to time I see five or six big able-bodied gardaí reclining on a couch while at the same point there is one young ban garda who, according to regulations, is obliged to remain standing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time at my disposal there are just a few comments I wish to make, and the first is that in a country of fewer than four million people we must spend almost £300 million in attempting to restore law and order.  It is a damning indictment of the country which used to rejoice in the title of the land of saints and scholars that this should be necessary.  Apparently the scholars have all gone and many of the saints have turned to crime.  Undoubtedly crime is one of the few growth businesses in the country.  The only way we can keep crime within reasonable balance is by the creation of deterrents, and in that respect I consider the moneys being sought in this Estimate to be justified.  In the coming years I expect that it will be necessary to make even further moneys available to help in the fight against crime.</P>
      <P>I welcome particularly the additional moneys being spent on drug units in the Garda.  The drug scene has reached horrific proportions.  In recent weeks a certain air of satisfaction has been expressed in the House during the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill in that the level of crime has decreased, but I would warn against complacency in that respect because I consider the fall-off to be only temporary.  However, it is very welcome.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the recently published crime statistics, the Commissioner of the Garda indicated that there is only a 30 per cent detection rate.  That is a statistic we must seek to improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another welcome step is the provision of sniffer dogs for the Drugs Squad.  One might ask how much of the drugs brought in illegally through Dublin Airport or through any port in the country could <Col N="1410" /> have been detected if sniffer dogs had been available.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider, too, the setting up of a Customs drug unit that would augment and complement the work of the Garda.  Knowing the Border area well I am confident that a considerable amount of drugs are coming into the country by that route.  The Customs men have the expertise and the knowledge in the area of dealing with smugglers to enable them to help curtail this horrific trade.</P>
    <P>I welcome the 25 per cent increase in the building programme for prisons.  We will need a continuous prison building programme in the years to come, but we ought to think in terms of making economies in respect of such items as snooker tables and colour TV sets.  I wonder how much of the budget is expended in this manner.  I echo Deputy Barry's remarks.  While we accept that urban areas have more serious crime, rural areas also need increased surveillance. I ask the Minister to look at the possibility of reopening rural stations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Time is against me for the second time today.  The public believe we are failing in our duty to tackle crime and that criminals are now deciding how the majority live in our community.  This is a sad state of affairs.  The battle against crime is being lost.</P>
      <P>We referred to the cost of crime.  There are many factors which contribute to this. It appears clearly to the criminal that it pays to commit crime.  Last week in Cork a young person who caused £1,100 worth of damage to cars was fined £50 and let go free.  Another week a man was sent to prison because he did not pay parking fines.  I am not saying that he should not pay them but justice must be seen to be done in the courts.  The courts are bringing the laws into disrepute through lack of consistency.  This is of major concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the training of gardaí.  I hope this will be dealt with as quickly as possible.  Some duties the gardaí are performing are not really their duties.  Deputy Barry referred to the matter of parking fines.  This creates a barrier with the community.  Gardaí are seen as <Col N="1411" /> people who cannot be approached and there is a barrier between them and the community.  This problem must be tackled. Mention was made of drugs.  I am glad the numbers in the drug unit were increased.  The airports and sea ports are not properly controlled.  Customs officers must be brought into this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to court delays. The Circuit Criminal Court in Cork has a huge backlog of work.  I know a second judge was appointed recently but there is a need for another one.  People are let out on bail and they continue to commit crime in the full knowledge that they will not be brought before the court until their case comes up.  Unless we tackle the areas where the law is being brought into disrepute the money allocated to the Minister will go down the drain.  There are many social and economic contributory factors.  The Minister is responsible for ensuring that people can walk the streets in safety.  They cannot do that at present. We must face reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Just three specifics: Cavan courthouse, the Land Registry and a sergeant for Finnea.  The Cavan courthouse is an old castle building which was built at the beginning of the 19th century and is in a very bad state of repair.  The court is being held in Bailieborough.  Jurors and litigants have to come from as far west as Blacklion and Belcoo through the Cuilcagh Mountains.  This is a severe hardship on them.  An order <i>mandamus</i> is being sought to get the Minister to direct OPW to provide Cavan town with a courthouse.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to recruit more civil servants to the Land Registry.  It is self-financing. There is no reason why the Minister for Finance should not sanction the appointment of more civil servants. There is a big backlog of work there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry asked for a boy in blue for Carrigtwohill.  I want one with white stripes on his arm for Finnea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank all Deputies who contributed.  I should have liked more time to deal with the specific points made. <Col N="1412" /> I thank Deputy Woods for his constructive speech, most of which I agree with. As regards increasing the full establishment of the force to 12,000 two issues arise.  One is whether we should not be talking about the manner in which gardaí are deployed and the way they interact with the community rather than looking at an overall figure.  There are almost 11,400 members in the force now and that number will be kept up for the remainder of the year.  That represents a lot of gardaí <i>per capita.</i> It is up to the level of policing in other European countries and probably ahead of most of them. Whether 12,000 or 20,000 would do the job more effectively is debatable.  We tend to think that if the numbers are increased it will have a major effect.  It might.  If there was extra money available 12,000 might not be a bad figure to settle on.  But if we brought the force to 12,000 would there not be an argument to increase it to 13,000?</P>
      <P>As regards having a separate subhead for community policing, I do not believe that would be a help.  If I got an overall increase under the existing subheads there would be more flexibility as regards the spending of it.  A separate subhead for community policing would put a restriction on the spending of the money. However, I take the point.  I would like more movement towards community policing and an expansion of neighbourhood watch pilot schemes.  I understand they are proving effective.</P>
      <P>As regards drug abuse, Deputy Woods read out a number of specific recommendations. Some of them I agree with and others I have dealt with before.  I am not convinced that scheduling drug related offences and trying them in the Special Criminal Court would be correct.  I am not arguing its efficacy but there could be a constitutional problem.  While drug abuse subverts youth it is not necessarily a subversive crime in the way we speak of subversive crime in this country and in the way the Offences Against the State Act was enacted to deal with subversive crime.  Everyone knows what was meant by subversive crime in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think minimum sentences are a good idea.  In the Department if one <Col N="1413" /> envisages a situation, it usually happens sooner rather than later.  If I moved towards minimum sentences I am sure that one of the first cases would be a hard case and there would be appeals and petitions on my desk to let the poor unfortunate off.  The court would not have any discretion to deal with him leniently.  I do not like the idea of mandatory minimum sentences.  However, I will keep the point in mind.</P>
    <P>The House is aware, of course, that the drugs legislation is being amended at present and has passed through Second Stage in the House.  I welcome the appreciation of sniffer dogs as a solution to the drug problem.  However, with the use of these dogs there are certain difficulties of which Deputies may or may not be aware.  It is not simply a matter of a dog being able to identify every substance that comes through the port.  It does not work that way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the relationship between drugs and crime, and there seems to be a direct link.  He was designating 1983 as the Year of the Burglar on the basis that the value of property stolen that year came to £43,800,000 as against £29 million in 1982.  However, that statistic conceals something.  The kidnapping of Shergar accounts for £10 million of that increase.  If we leave Shergar out of it, we are talking about £29 million increasing to £33.8 million, which is a more realistic increase.  That is how it should be looked at.  There has been no dramatic jump in the value of property taken from cars and houses, although the raw statistic would suggest otherwise.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East</i>): Those that walk and those that are helped to walk.  Regarding the security task force, I have the old quarrel with Deputy Woods.  There was no question of cutbacks there at all.  I refer the House to a statement which I made in the House on 24 January 1984 as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already informed the House <Col N="1414" /> in response to parliamentary questions, the Garda authorities decided last year on certain organisational changes under which the members of the divisional task forces were integrated with the detective units in the various Garda divisions in which they had been operating.  I would once again like to stress that these changes were made by the Garda Commissioner solely in the interests of better Garda organisation and efficiency.  The moves were in no way made necessary because of any financial restraints. There was also no question of reducing the detective strength.  The members of the divisional task forces were already of detective rank and remaind so.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are also satisfied that the service provided by the Garda Síochána is more effective as a result of the changes.</P>
    <P>There is not much point in going over the old arguments again.  Task forces down the country were supposed to combat armed crime.  Whatever form of words they used, the change in the way in which they have been organised took place very early in 1983.  In the commissioner's Report on Crime for 1983, at the fourth paragraph it is stated:</P>
    <P>Firearms were used in the commission of 84 robberies and 341 aggravated burglaries, showing an increase of 35 armed crimes over the combined figures of 390 for the previous year.  Outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area there was a decrease in this type of armed crime from 119 in the previous year to 102.  There was a decrease in armed bank robberies from 21 in the previous year to seven and in post office robberies from 56 in the previous year to 36.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the way in which the task forces have been organised has resulted in that drop, but certainly the argument that the change in their organisation has led to an increase in armed crime in the country and to bank and post office robberies is not correct.  Bank robberies <Col N="1415" /> went down from 21 to seven and post office robberies from 56 to 36.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East</i>): The Deputy put it very well.  However, the facts are as I have stated.  I know that there is a very strong lobby from the members who were on the task force previously for a change back, and I am sure that Deputy Woods has been getting fairly strong representations.</P>
      <P>The argument that there is no allocation in the Estimates for the purchase of helicopters has been going on since Deputy Collins' time, and nothing more than a notional amount has ever been supplied under this subhead.  As I said previously, when there is a need for helicopters, the Army are very effective in providing them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods welcomed the introduction of radio equipment.  He talked about cutbacks in the probation and welfare service.  There are no cutbacks and there will be a fairly large extension as a result of recruitment for the community service order scheme.  He also welcomed the inquiry into the penal system.  He made a suggestion, on the subject of the fines office, that there might be a late payment fee in the case of a genuine lapse of memory with regard to payment of a fine.  That sounds like a helpful suggestion and I shall consider it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Myra Barry says that we are all responsible in the community and should help the Garda.  Certainly I would endorse that.  On the question of closure of small rural stations, none has been closed in my ministry and the closures to which the Deputy referred took place about 30 years ago.  If there is an increase in population in an area, I shall be prepared to have the matter examined to see if a Garda station should be reopened, but, in general, this is not justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument has been made by Deputies Barry and McGahon that only Dublin has had an increase in Garda <Col N="1416" /> numbers.  East Cork division got 24 of an increase and Louth-Meath 38.  Clearly, there is a fair spread of extra gardaí around the country.  On the two specific crimes to which Deputy Barry referred, these incidents were not related to local activity.  The people involved lived far from the two areas mentioned.</P>
    <P>Certainly there are problems with regard to the safety and security of old people living alone.  On the idea of taking traffic out of the hands of the Garda, I wonder if Deputy Barry means traffic in general.  The number of murders last year was 26 or 28, but the number who died on the roads was very high indeed &mdash; of the order of 530 or 540.  Many deaths on the road are due to speeding, drink and carelessness.  Every accident has a cause. There would be a great increase in accidents and death on the road if the gardaí did not pay the attention which they pay to matters of speed, drunken driving and so on.  Whether the Garda should deal with parking offences is another matter. They must in small towns, because there are just no traffic wardens.  A whole street can become blocked up and stop the commercial life of the town.  It can be aggravating and can put up a barrier between the law abiding motorist and the Garda Síochána if it happens to be a garda who issues the parking ticket.  I do not know if I can do anything about this point.  It is the local authorities that should provide the traffic wardens to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>A couple of points were made by other Deputies with which I should like to deal in the limited time available.  Deputy Tunney talked about the Fingals bus service, and I shall again have that examined. On the payment of overtime as against recruitment and trading one off against the other, that is not as simple as it looks.  There is built-in overtime in the Garda job which accounts for £8 million approximately.  Beyond that, there are emergency situations such as the Tidey kidnap which figured for payment in the first month of January although it occurred in December, the Reagan visit, the election.  An election costs about £500,000 in Garda overtime.  When a garda is following up a case and his eight <Col N="1417" /> hour roster of duty is finished, obviously if he is on to something he keeps going and must have that kind of discretion. We have got overtime down to a very low figure and do not think there is much room for further cutbacks.  It is not possible to make a trade and take out £2.5 million for, say, 400 extra recruits, cutting back the overtime by that amount.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, thank you for allowing me to raise this matter.  I should like to share the time available to me with Deputy Barnes who took a great deal of interest in the affair at the time, which I cannot claim for myself.  She knows a great deal more than I about the actual conditions of the episode. I want to confine my contribution to one single aspect, namely, our general procedures in regard to custody and the relationship which custody bears to the offence which is being charged against the persons held.  Before I do that, I should like to begin by saying in the Minister's hearing that he can be proud of the conduct of the Garda Síochána for which he is responsible for their successful management of a very tricky three or four days from a security point of view.  Probably I speak for everybody in the country when I say their conduct was admirable. It is also fair to say for the Garda &mdash; and I should like the Minister to hear this &mdash; that many people would regard their experience in those days as a very trying one for an unusual reason, namely, that what appeared to be a large portion of their normal peace-keeping and security enforcing duties were appropriated, by what authority I am not clear, by a police force or a security force for which no one in this country was responsible.</P>

      <P>I merely want to respectfully offer the police force my compliments, through the Minister, on their conduct under, from the morale point of view, what must have been trying conditions during those three or four days. Moving away from the Department of Justice, I should like to say very briefly that I sympathise and very strongly agree with the point of view expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other members of the Government in regard to the unacceptability of offensive forms of protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly, the matter you got permission to raise concerns a number of women who were apparently arrested and held for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, Sir, and I am grateful to you for letting me raise it.  I want to clear the ground by saying I am shoulder high with the Government in their security efforts and in their concern about the country's standing abroad, and their impatience with forms of protest which exceed the legitimate limit by their offensiveness.  I wanted to say that to lay the ground and perhaps make harmless for some people what I want to say about this episode.  Having said all that and having established my bona fides, the Minister ought to be given an opportunity to explain to the House the circumstances in which it was possible for a large group of women so far as press reports go &mdash; and I have no other information than press reports &mdash; to be taken into custody in the Phoenix Park early on Sunday morning apparently and to remain in custody in the Bridewell until some time on Monday afternoon.  If I am wrong in any of these details the Minister has a chance to put me right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest principle of criminal procedure here is that when someone is arrested and he or she cannot be tried at once &mdash; and that is the rule &mdash; the person arrested must at least be brought at once, <Col N="1421" /> or as immediately as is possible, before a judicial or semi-judicial authority who can decide whether to admit the person to bail or remand the person in custody until some further occasion.  The question of bail and custody is not one on which I intend to embark now but I would imagine discretions of this kind would be related in some way to the relative seriousness of the offence.  I may be wrong here and I am not trying to lay down the law in either the practical or the academic sense because I do not know what the police side of the story is.  As far as is evident, the only thing against these women was that they had breached a provision of the Phoenix Park Act for which the penalty appears to be a fine of £5, and again I speak subject to correction.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, you or I would be very glad to pay £5 to avoid being confined in a police cell in the Bridewell or elsewhere for five minutes, or half an hour, let alone for 30 hours.  There is some explaining to be done, and I do not mean on the part of the police, but more generally on the part of the State if we have a legal system which makes it possible for people to be held in custody for so long when the maximum charge on which they can be convicted is such a trivial one carrying such a trivial fine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must tell the Deputy that in an Adjournment Debate one may not criticise existing legislation. One may not advocate the amendment of legislation or new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit I did not know that.  Naturally I accept your ruling.  By mentioning legislation I am merely trying to make as general a point as possible and to express in as general a way as possible the concern this episode must cause to people.  It may be &mdash; although I would be surprised if it is so &mdash; that the legislation applicable here actually makes possible the detention of people from very early on Sunday morning until Monday afternoon.  I do not want to adjudge that here.  To me it seems unlikely that it would not have been possible to bring <Col N="1422" /> these women before a district justice, or a peace commissioner, or in some way to achieve an admission to bail or a remand in custody if the authority wished &mdash; although such a thing seems to me to be unthinkable in connection with so trivial an offence &mdash; before the expiration of 30 hours.</P>
      <P>These crude facts which I have stated as generally as I can without committing myself to them, because they may not be correct in the form in which I have stated, lend substance and colour to the suspicion which has been expressed in the papers that the object of the exercise &mdash; and I hope I have disarmed any idea that I am trying to criticise the Garda by the tribute which I began by paying them &mdash; was to keep these women on ice until such time as the President of America should have left this country.  I tried to disarm the idea that I was indifferent to the national interest by saying I agree offensive forms of protest should not take place in the national interest.  It is not correct to use or to stretch a procedure with the laudable objective of protecting the national interest and of keeping people physically away from the possiblility of committing offensive forms of protest in such a way that they are literally put out of circulation behind bars for that length of time.</P>
      <P>In order to put this into perspective I want to say that, over the past couple of months, we have been discussing the Criminal Justice Bill, one provision of which is that in a case where somebody is suspected of a serious crime he may be held for six hours.  I have heard Deputies agonising over the infringement of civil liberties which this may represent.  Six golden hours of somebody's life spent behind bars is a serious matter and I do not mean to trivialise it.  If that is a serious matter even in a case where somebody is reasonably suspected of having been concerned in a serious offence, I should like to know in what measure we are weighing our priorities when it is possible for somebody, who at worst can be convicted of a very trivial offence carrying a penalty of £5, to spend 30 hours in custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat I know nothing about this case except what I have seen in the newspapers. <Col N="1423" /> I may have got my facts wrong and I will be very glad if the Minister can contradict the facts which I have outlined roughly.  The matter calls for an explanation. The Minister would be doing himself and the Government which he represents so excellently a service if he were to disarm any suspicion that the law has been used here in order to keep out of sight some awkward people, people who are a pain in the neck in ordinary people's parlance.  In many ways they are a pain in the neck to me too but next time, Sir, it could be you or me.  Unless we stand up for the people who are a nuisance it could be our turn next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Kelly for giving me the opportunity to share his time with him and also I wish to thank the Chair for allowing this Adjournment Debate and for giving the Minister an opportunity to respond.  I would like to think that the Minister would welcome the opportunity to explain what appears to be inexplicable and which has led to a tremendous amount of concern not alone for the people who found themselves imprisoned for 30 hours but for the public generally. As Deputy Kelly said, this is particularly so in the context of the climate of opinion being created and the deep and concerned discussions here on the Criminal Justice Bill with regard to the powers of detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited the women on the Sunday night.  It appears that 34 women were imprisoned for 30 hours for an offence where the maximum fine was £5.  The conditions under which the women were held were horrifying and led to a tremendous amount of insecurity and fear on the part of the women.  It is implied by the women that they did not have an opportunity to make a phone call which would seem to be a basic requirement of justice. Thus, not alone had they a feeling of insecurity because they did not know when they would be released or what would be their fate but they were worried because some of them could not inform their relations of the position.  These women were not aliens who were brought <Col N="1424" /> in over the weekend as a kind of disruptive force.  They were ordinary women engaged in what they considered a peaceful protest and non-violent action and they came from all parts of the country. It is important that we keep that in mind. The conditions in which they were housed were quite appalling.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to Deputy Barnes that the question concerns the length of time they were detained.  There was nothing in it about the conditions under which they were held.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point.  I put it to you that the conditions under which they were held are relevant considering the length of time they were held in prison.  I consider that relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be relevant. However, Deputy Kelly gave notice that he wanted to raise the matter of the length of time a group of women were held in custody during the visit of President Reagan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair but I still insist that the conditions under which people are held are relevant considering the length of time they are held.  It led to an increased anxiety.  The conditions were unacceptable and, therefore, that exacerbated a situation which it would seem should never have arisen in the first place.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I sat in on a Seanad debate concerning the problem of itinerants in Tallaght.  The reason I bring this up is to say that I listened carefully to the response of the Minister for Defence who was speaking on behalf of the Minister for the Environment.  Quite rightly he said with regard to that situation that legislation in particular had to accept that people had a constitutional right to demonstrate in a peaceful and orderly way.  I appreciate and am aware of the pressures under which the Garda have to operate with regard to protests.  What we are raising here tonight is that there seems to have been a totally unacceptable and unjust situation where the offence merited a fine of only £5.  The case was later <Col N="1425" /> dropped and, therefore, it is obvious that a greater crime was not involved.  However, 34 women were held for 30 hours in incredibly bad conditions without even what would seem to be the basic rights of prisoners held for a serious crime.  This has led many of us to worry that, given a certain situation, on that weekend democracy was suspended and in the case of those 34 women justice was seen to have been suspended also.  The women had to endure appalling conditions and were subjected to psychological pressure. There is anxiety among people both inside and outside this House that such an outrageous situation could have arisen in the first place.  We ask the Minister not only for an explanation but also for reassurance that this will never happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): It has been reported in the newspapers that the women concerned, or some of them, intend to take legal proceedings in connection with their detention.  The fact that they may intend to take legal proceedings does not, of course, mean that the issues involved are <i>sub judice</i> and I should like to make it quite clear that I am not suggesting otherwise. However, it means it would be highly undesirable, and on a practical level impossible, for me as Minister for Justice to comment publicly on those issues at this stage, bearing in mind particularly that the State may be a defendant in those proceedings.</P>
      <P>I am sure I need not labour the fact that this constraint arises only because of the office I hold and that there is no question of my making any criticism of Deputy Kelly or Deputy Barnes for anything they have said.  For my part I would have been quite willing to state my own attitude if this possibility of legal action had not arisen.  However, I think I can make a few brief observations as long as it is understood they are not intended to have anything to do with the legal rights or wrongs of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I understand that one of the factors that contributed to the length of time for which the women were in detention <Col N="1426" /> was that the arrests were on a Sunday and that the following day was a public holiday so that the usual morning sitting of the court did not take place.  I hope it will be possible to have that situation looked at.  One aspect is that there may be some problems arising from the fact that there are certain restrictions on what legal processes may take place on a Sunday but I hope that aspect, as well as others, can be gone into without too much delay.</P>
    <P>The second point I would make is that whatever view one might take of the protest action which the women concerned had in mind, it is a matter for regret that things should have developed as they did. We are a small country with serious economic and social problems.  We should try to avoid unnecessary confrontation &mdash; there are enough situations where conflict seems to be unavoidable.  It is certainly a matter for regret that there was such a long detention, 30 hours or so, and I hope such circumstances will not recur. Without taking from what I have just said, I would also put it to the people concerned that, by mounting a protest so close to the residence of the American Ambassador in circumstances where it is obvious that the Garda Síochána could not be sure that there would be no danger to the President of the United States, they were causing great difficulty for the Garda.  I am not saying this in any condemnatory sense.  I am simply making an appeal for the maximum possible degree of consideration for the Garda, especially in a situation where they are clearly under pressure.  I would hope and indeed expect that such an approach would be reciprocated.</P>
    <P>I would have said more but, as I have explained, I am speaking in the shadow of a legal action and it is very difficult to be more expansive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the sawmill industry's own assessment of its sawing capacity its sawlog requirements are about 40-50 per cent greater than total national supplies. Much of the excess capacity has been unavoidably generated through necessary re-equipment of mills in recent years.  In qualifying for grant aid for such re-equipping projects the industry accepted that it could not expect to operate at the resultant increased capacity until such time &mdash; understood to be around the end of this decade &mdash; as there would be a balance between timber supply and demand.  I might add that the situation is exacerbated by some firms seeking to operate beyond the one shift basis which the majority of the mills <Col N="1090" /> regard as their most realistic expectation under present conditions.</P>

    <P>The survey of grey seals undertaken by my Department in 1983 covered the coastline from Slyne Head to Lambay Island and included the Iniskea Islands. The findings indicate that the total population of grey seals around our coastline numbers between 2,000 and 2,500.  As the status of the species is not threatened, either nationally or internationally, there would be no ecological justification for <Col N="1093" /> creating a single species reserve or refuge on the Iniskea or any other islands.</P>
    <P>The survey report also suggests that culling of the breeding population is not an effective way of preventing damage to salmon catches and that the measures most likely to afford protection to catches would be those aimed specifically at seals at the nets.

      <P>Anseo sa Dáil ar an 15 Márta ghabh mé buíochas ó chroí leis na daoine díográiseachta ar éirigh leo an nuachtán <i>Inniu</i> a fhoilsiú go rialta le breis agus dhá scór bliain anuas agus chuir mé in iúl go mbeinn ag iarraidh a shocrú nach mbeidh daoine a chaith cuid mhór dá saol i mbun an nuachtáin fágtha ar an gcaolchuid. Tig liom a rá go leanfaidh an gnáthdheontas do <i>Inniu</i> gach seachtain go dtí an 24 Lúnasa seo chugainn.  Nuair a thugtar deontas mar sin ní fostaíocht amháin a bhíonn i gceist agus is oth liomsa nár éirigh le lucht <i>Inniu</i> i bhfad níos mó cóipeanna a dhíol in aghaidh na seachtaine.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 81 together.  It is established Government policy that Shannon Airport is Ireland's sole transatlantic gateway and will remain so.  I am informed that since January 1984, Aer Lingus aircraft operating transatlantic services overflew Shannon Airport on 16 occasions. The overwhelming majority of these overflights was caused by prevailing weather conditions at the airport, due to either heavy cross-winds or fog.  In all cases, the decision to overfly was taken by the captain of the aircraft in the interests of the safety of the passengers and crew and only after detailed consultations had taken place, where appropriate, with the meteorological service.  I also can confirm that Aer Lingus are fully aware of Government policy in relation to Shannon Airport and that I as Minister responsible for the execution of this policy would not be prepared to countenance any change involving a downgrading of Shannon.</P>

      <P>In the case of the three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork, the fire fighting equipment comprises foam crash trucks, rapid intervention vehicles and special purpose fire trucks. In the case of aerodromes licensed for public use there is a variety of types of fire fighting equipment including portable fire extinguishers, pressurised foam units, fire tenders and engine-driven foam units.  In all cases the equipment is located at the aerodrome while public transport operations are taking place; at other times, in the case of a small number of licensed aerodromes, the equipment is located at a separate premises.  In certain cases arrangements exist for supplementing aerodrome fire fighting services by units from local fire services.</P>
      <P>At the State airports a total of 33 staff are employed exclusively on fire fighting duties.  In addition, there are 272 staff who are trained in both airport security and fire fighting duties.  At licensed aerodromes no staff are employed exclusively on fire fighting duties but staff at those aerodromes undertake a variety of duties among which fire fighting takes priority when the occasion demands.  I am satisfied that there is sufficient fire fighting equipment available for emergency purposes at the State airports and aerodromes licensed for public use.</P>

This is unlikely to happen &mdash; at least in the immediate future.

    <P>In addition, a proposal by RTE to establish a fourth radio service on long wave was discussed and RTE are conducting further research on the proposal. RTE estimate the capital cost of establishing such a service at £5.7 million with annual running costs of approximately £5 million.</P>

      <P>To date only one of the reported incidents involving fishing vessels in the Irish Sea has been proven to have been caused by a submarine.  In that <Col N="1109" /> instance &mdash; the loss of the <i>Sharelga</i> in April 1982 &mdash; my predecessor ordered a preliminary inquiry under section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  Before that inquiry had been completed by a marine surveyor from my Department, the United Kingdon admitted that one of its submarines had been responsible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 106 and 107 together.  In early May I conveyed to CIE my agreement to chartering by that company of the m.v. <i>Galway Bay</i> to provide supplementary passenger services for this summer on the Galway-Aran route.</P>
      <P>An alternative proposal involving a high-speed passenger vessel would have necessitated an operational test for that vessel in Galway during the month of May, before a decision on its suitability could have been taken.  With the approach of the summer season, I considered that an urgent decision on the 1984 summer chartering arrangements was the paramount requirement, and a test of the alternative vessel would in my view have delayed that decision unduly.  Financial projections for the 1984 summer operations, which favoured the <i>Galway Bay</i> as against the alternative vessel, also influenced my decision.</P>
      <P>I am expecting shortly from CIE a report on the evaluation, which that company has arranged for at my request of all the various options for meeting the passenger and freight requirements of the islands in future years.</P>
      <P>As regards the request of the island co-operatives for a meeting, I have agreed to make available senior officials of my Department to meet with the cooperatives if they so wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that all proposals for future expenditure are carefully scrutinised as a matter of course before a decision is made.  My views on the need for critical evaluation of public expenditure were outlined recently in a paper which I presented to a seminar on &ldquo;Value for Money&rdquo; organised by the Institution of Engineers in Ireland.  In order to facilitate in-depth examination of expenditure programmes, both existing and proposed, my Department has since the seventies operated for the Civil Service as a whole a scheme to select suitable officers for this type of work and train them in appropriate modern skills and techniques.  The officers trained in analysis participate in the normal process by which advice is given to Ministers on expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The involvement of Oireachtas committees in analysis of expenditure programmes will be determined by their terms of reference.  One committee in particular &mdash; the Public Expenditure Committee &mdash; is specifically charged with the review of selected areas of public expenditure.  How this is done is a matter for the committee itself and I will be happy to support their efforts aimed at greater cost-effectiveness of public expenditure.  Officers of my Department recently briefed the Public Expenditure Committee on the role of analysis in support <Col N="1113" /> of public expenditure decision-making.</P>

      <P>Government policy for the development <Col N="1115" /> of inhabited islands is reflected in the policies of the various Departments and State agencies concerned with development nationally.  In addition, my Department has through the Central Development Committee a particular responsibility for promoting the development of inhabited non-Gaeltacht islands off the west coast.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the Government, on foot of a report from the Central Development Committee, decided in 1979 on a number of measures aimed at improving the living conditions of these islands.  The measures included the provision of electricity on certain islands, improvements in assistance for housing, improvements to water supply, sanitary services and communications, general economic development and community development.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the various measures is a matter for the appropriate Departments and agencies and is being proceeded with.  A number of the proposals have been implemented in full; for example, new house loans and grants have been increased, house improvement grants have been retained for the islands and increased; Bord Fáilte have increased the grants available on the islands under the supplementary holiday accommodation scheme and proposals have been issued to local authorities regarding water and sewerage works on the islands.  Substantial progress has also been made by the ESB in providing electricity on certain islands.  In addition, the county development teams, in conjunction with the Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Agriculture, are investigating means of increasing the level of economic activity on the islands.</P>
      <P>Progress on the implementation of the Government decision has been monitored by a permanent sub-committee of the Central Development Committee established for that purpose.  The Committee now meet when issues requiring inter-agency examination arise.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>Live register figures which have become available since February indicate a considerable improvement in the numbers registered as out of work.  At end-May 1984, the live register total stood at 207,804, having fallen from 215,981 at end-February 1984.  More significantly, the live register, which on a deseasonalised basis had increased continuously since the end of 1979, showed a slight seasonally adjusted decrease in March and a substantial seasonally adjusted fall of 2,500 in May.</P>
      <P>The `Programme for Government' of December 1982 recognised that the unemployment problem could be solved only through the restoration of stability to the public finances and an improvement of our competitive position.  The Government have already adopted policies which have resulted in a steady reduction in both the current budget deficit and Exchequer borrowing as a percentage of GNP.  As regards competitiveness the Government statement on pay policy set out a number of criteria which should be taken into account by parties to pay negotiations this year and indicated the Government's view that giving priority to employment requires a long pay pause followed by a pay increase of not more than a few percentage points.</P>
      <P>Apart from substantial expenditure on on-going programmes to generate employment the Government have introduced a number of innovative employment creation schemes including the enterprise allowance scheme, and pilot job sharing and career break schemes in the civil service.  Further employment measures will be set out in the forthcoming national plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Three separate types of charge, namely, customs duty, excise duty and VAT, arise in relation to the importation of motor vehicles.</P>
      <P>Customs duty is chargeable on motor vehicles imported from certain non-EEC countries.  Because of the considerable variation in the rates of duty applicable, depending on factors such as the purposes for which the vehicles are designed or the engine capacity, it would be impracticable to specify the rates in detail.  However, the various rates applicable in respect of the year 1984 are set out in chapter 87 of the <i>Customs and Excise Tariff of Ireland,</i> a copy of which is available in the Dáil Library.  Customs duty is not chargeable on motor vehicles which are imported either from an EEC country or from a country (other than Spain) with which the EEC has a preferential trading agreement.  Motor vehicles imported from Spain are liable to a reduced rate of duty calculated at 40 per cent of the appropriate rate shown in the tariff.</P>
      <P>The current rates of excise duty on imported motor vehicles are as follows:</P>
      <P>Motor Cycles, 50 per cent; Other Category A motor vehicles not exceeding 16 horse power, 54.5 per cent; Category A motor vehicles exceeding 16 horse power, 64.5 per cent; Category B motor vehicles, 11.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Category A motor vehicles consist mainly of motor cars, motor cycles and minibuses. The term &ldquo;Category B&rdquo; covers all other motor vehicles.  The rate of VAT chargeable on imported motor vehicles is 23 per cent of the value at importation increased by the amount of any customs and/or excise duties payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) Act, 1968, certain types of motor vehicles may not be imported except by a registered importer or on production of an <Col N="1119" /> import authorisation granted by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  These restrictions are due to expire on 1 January 1985 under the terms of Protocol No. 7 to the EEC Accession Treaty.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the interest of the Irish Customs and Excise Union in combatting the illegal importation of drugs, an interest which has been communicated to me and to the Revenue Commissioners and which has frequently been expressed through various media outlets.</P>
      <P>The prevention and detection of drug smuggling is of major concern to the Revenue Commissioners, who have ensured that trained customs staff are deployed in the most effective manner possible in order to control such smuggling.  In addition, customs investigation branch officers who specialise in the drugs problem maintain close liaison with enforcement agencies in many other countries.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of all officers of customs and excise employed at points of entry to the State to be on the alert to detect drug smuggling and consequently all such officers receive training in the identification and detection of drugs.  In addition, customs staff at entry points have been issued with the most modern identification equipment available.  Close liaison is also maintained with the Garda and with enforcement agencies in other countries to pool and develop intelligence concerning the movement of drugs and to co-ordinate joint actions on a national and international basis.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are at present reviewing all aspects of customs' control of drug importations, including the development of customs staff, in conjunction with recent recommendations of the special Governmental Task Force on drug abuse with a view to possible improvement in the overall effectiveness of customs and excise measures in this area.</P>

      <P>Since form C.2 (certificate authorising a sub-contractor to receive payments from a principal contractor without deduction of income tax) is retained by the sub-contractor the question of posting it does not arise.  Accordingly, it is assumed that the question is concerned mainly with the procedures in relation to form C.46 (application by a principal contractor for a construction payments card in respect of a sub-contractor).  It is the normal practice for forms C.46 to be posted to the inspector of taxes and the applicant is not required to attend in person at the tax office.  The form C.46 must in all cases be signed by the principal contractor and by the sub-contractor.  In a case where the sub-contractor is a limited company or partnership it is desirable, as a safeguard against fraudulent practices, that the person who signs the form C.2 should also sign the form C.46.  The use of photocopies of forms C.2 is not permissible for security reasons but inspectors are prepared to consider issuing a limited number of extra original forms C.2 without delay in cases when this can be justified.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that, having regard to the fact that the present system is functioning satisfactorily, they are of opinion that a change in the existing regulations is not warranted.</P>

    <P>NOTE: The figures for 1979 to 1983 consist of actual excise duty receipts and estimated VAT receipts.  The VAT receipts are estimated because VAT returns are not required to be completed in a manner which would enable the yield from particular items to be identified.

The total amount of this apparent magnitude is largely due to the liability being estimated in the absence of periodical returns in the case of PAYE-PRSI and VAT, and of accounts and other information in the case of income tax and corporation tax.  These factors also account for the large number of certificates withdrawn and for the face value of those withdrawn, being respectively 41,190 and £248,446,000.  Payments were made on foot of 8,791 certificates amounting to £32,168,000.</P>

      <P>Expenditure incurred by a farmer on the acquisition of land and expenditure incurred by him for the purpose of enhancing the value of the land, whether or not such expenditures are financed from borrowed moneys, are allowable as deductions from the proceeds of sale of the land in calculating, for capital gains tax purposes, any gain arising on the disposal of the land.  If the land is not development land, the deductions mentioned are increased by reference to the consumer price index to take account of inflation.  Furthermore if the aggregate of the sum originally paid (market value in the case of a gift) and the amount expended on improving the land exceeds the sale proceeds, the excess can be set against other gains of the year in question or carried forward indefinitely for set off against any future gains of the vendor.  It will, therefore, be apparent that any amounts received on disposal of the land which can in effect be regarded as having been generated by the expenditure of borrowed moneys on the purchase or improvement of that land are not within the ambit of capital gains tax.  Accordingly, the element in the sale proceeds represented by such borrowings is not diminished by capital gains tax and is available in full to extinguish borrowings.</P>

      <Col N="1131" /> The Erne is No. 10 on the priority list of major catchments in the arterial drainage programme.  The listed position of the catchment has not been altered but a scheme for that part of the catchment lying in the State prepared in 1970 was not proceeded with for economic reasons.  However, a study of the entire Erne catchment area was commissioned jointly in 1979, under EEC auspices, by the Irish and British Governments, to examine proposals for development of the economy of the region.  The study recommended that a drainage scheme for the southern reaches of the catchment be designed to accommodate all the relevant considerations, namely, agricultural, environmental, tourism, electricity generation and economic.  At this stage I cannot say when a scheme for the catchment might be undertaken.</P>

    <P>A large proportion of the trees in the Phoenix Park are now mature but there are no grounds for believing that most of the tree population will have to be replaced in ten to 15 years.  In the past five years about 700 trees have had to be <Col N="1133" /> felled due mainly to the incidence of Dutch elm disease.</P>
    <P>In the same period a tree planting programme has been put in hands and over 700 trees have been planted.  I hope to increase the rate of planting in the coming years.  There is a staff of six in the arboricultural unit in the park, three of whom are skilled in tree surgery techniques.</P>

      <P>Arising out of events that took place on 24 and 25 February 1984 which I outlined to the House on 1 March 1984, I made a statement on radio on Sunday 26 February 1984.  In it I referred to the interpretation of the Health Services (No. 3) Regulations, 1983, which I had agreed with the President of the Union of Students in Ireland.</P>
      <P>This interpretation included the following elements:&mdash; 1. Students do not have automatic entitlement to medical cards.  2. Students whose parents hold medical cards or who are EEC nationals or who hold disabled persons maintenance allowance are entitled to free medical services.  3. Other students may be assessed for eligibility, using the same criteria as other applicants, including their family circumstances where appropriate.  4.  In order to avoid hardship, students medical cards were not withdrawn while reapplications were being processed.  This was done in accordance with normal health board procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168, 169 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The Special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse made a number of recommendations last September concerning treatment facilities for young people with drug related problems.  The task force recommended that a new purpose-built, walk-in facility be provided for drug abusers on the Jervis Street site when the general hospital is transferred to Beaumont.  The new general hospital at Beaumont is scheduled to open in July 1985.  Discussions are being arranged between my Department and the Jervis Street authority on the question of the disposal of a greater part of the existing hospital site and the provision of a purpose-built, out-patient drug centre.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I have made a capital grant available to the Jervis Street authority which is to be used to modify existing accommodation arrangements at the drug unit.  This will make more space available for patient care at the unit.</P>
      <P>The task force also recommended that a bed facility with the necessary back-up services &mdash; including detoxification &mdash; should be provided at St. James's Hospital. Discussions have taken place between representatives of my Department, the Eastern Health Board and St. James's Hospital Board and a joint project team representative of the Department and St. James's Hospital has been established to plan the proposed service.</P>
      <P>Further recommendations were made by the task force concerning the provision of a therapeutic community regimen, on a pilot basis, which would be relevant to the requirements of young drug abusers from socially and educationally deprived backgrounds particularly those in the 12-16 year age group.  I have made a sum of £35,000 available to the Eastern Health Board to provide larger alternative accommodation for the Talbot Day Centre, currently situated in Sherrard Street.  The enlarged accommodation will enable the centre to provide for drug abusers in the following categories: (a), 12-16 year olds; (b), unmarried mothers; (c), unmarried pregnant girls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health board has also been considering <Col N="1136" /> the need for additional facilities for the group referred to by the task force and has made some recommendations to me in this regard which I am examining and would hope to be in a position to respond to shortly.</P>
    <P>Finally, the task force recommended that my Department enter into discussions with the Coolemine Therapeutic Community to identify the additional resources which the community would need to enable it to meet the demands for services which are made upon it. These discussions have taken place and I have made additional funds available to the Eastern Health Board to meet the community's additional requirements this year.</P>

My Department is making every effort to ensure that the development of services for drug abusers will keep apace with the demand for these services particularly in the greater Dublin area, where the problem of serious drug abuse is largely concentrated.</P>

They have, however, recently recruited a further speech therapist who took up duty on 18 June which should improve the services on the ground there and consequently <Col N="1139" /> improve the level of speech therapy services available for the handicapped. While the mental handicap services are likely to be affected to some extent by the current economic difficulties, it is my intention, nevertheless, to ensure that they are protected insofar as it is possible from cutbacks in expenditure in the health services.</P>

      <P>The precise practice in regard to BCG vaccination in each area is a matter for determination by the director of community care and medical officer of health having regard to the local epidemiological situation.</P>
      <P>A research project to evaluate the effectiveness of the current BCG programme in operation throughout the country is currently being undertaken by the Faculty of Community Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians with the support of the Department of Health. This project will provide information on the relationship between the BCG vaccination programmes as applied in specific areas, and the morbidity of, and mortality from, tuberculosis and the incidence of TB meningitis in those areas. Based on the information obtained from the project, decisions may be taken as to how BCG vaccination policy should be conducted in the future.</P>

The amount was calculated on the basis of the income earned by him from farming less the amount of expenses incurred as supplied by him to the social welfare officer.  He appealed against the amount of the means assessed against him and the contentions made by him in support of his appeal, were referred to an appeals officer for consideration.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment under the general scheme of children's allowances is not made beyond the age of 18.  An increase of pension, benefit or allowance, in respect of a child between the ages of 18 and 21 who is in full-time education is however payable where the parent is in receipt of any of the following from my Department&mdash;</P>
      <P>Widow's Contributory or Non-Contributory Pension, Deserted Wife's Benefit or Allowance, Unmarried Mother's Allowance and Prisoner's Wife's Allowance,</P>
      <P>or where the parent is a widow and in receipt of Invalidity, Retirement or Old Age Pension.</P>
      <P>Recognition has been given to the special needs of widows who have lost their husbands who would normally be the breadwinner in the family and this has been reflected in the social welfare code by special provisions for widows.  Indeed in the Constitution the widow is mentioned as deserving of special care from the State and the inclusion of other women in the list I mentioned earlier in my reply is an extension of the provision for widows to cover other women who find themselves in somewhat similar situations.</P>
      <P>The number of men in this situation would be much smaller and if in need they would be able to apply for assistance under the scheme of supplementary welfare allowances.  I am satisfied, therefore, that overall there is provision for assistance to cover all the contingencies that may arise.</P>

The scheme applies to persons who are in receipt of a social welfare type pension or allowance, <Col N="1152" /><Col N="1153" /> including widow's pension, provided they are aged 66 or over.  If under that age, however, the person must be in receipt of an invalidity or blind pension or a disabled person's maintenance allowance.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a person (details supplied) in County Donegal who is in part-time employment and paying income tax and pay-related social insurance, both in the full-time and part-time employment cannot be paid pay-related benefit on his part-time employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit under the occupational injuries scheme in respect of an incapacity which he attributed to an accident on 1 February 1984 in connection with his part-time employment as a fireman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the completion of investigations arising from the accident he was allowed disability benefit on an interim basis from 6 February 1984, the fourth <Col N="1154" /> day of certified incapacity.  Benefit was paid in respect of the period to 18 February, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  Following the completion of investigations, injury benefit was awarded from 1 February and injury benefit over and above the disability benefit already paid has been issued.</P>
    <P>Pay-related benefit is not payable in respect of the first 18 days of incapacity in a period of interruption of employment. The period of incapacity was for 15 days only and accordingly pay-related benefit was not payable.  Had the claim been for over three weeks he would have qualified for pay-related benefit based on his earnings from the full-time employment.</P>
    <P>His employment contributions in respect of his part-time employment (Class J) are reckonable only for occupational injuries benefits.  The contributions contain no element in respect of disability benefit and accordingly the part-time earnings do not reckon for determining pay-related benefit entitlement. His entitlement to pay-related benefit on his claim would accordingly have been determined on his reckonable earnings <Col N="1155" /> in respect of his main employment which was insured at Class A.1.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim of the person concerned to unemployment assistance was disallowed by a deciding officer.  He appealed against the decision and an appeals officer also rejected his claim assessing him with means derived from farming of £48 a week or approximately £2,500 a year.  This amount exceeded the maximum rate of assistance appropriate to the case of the person concerned and he was not, therefore, entitled to unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The circumstances of this applicant's case were unusual in so far as his cattle herd became infected by tuberculosis and in consequence it was necessary for him to dispose of all of the herd.  He received £12,000 from the disposal of the herd and this included £7,435 given by the Department of Agriculture by way of compensation. He also received £2,700 from the Department of Agriculture by way of a hardship grant to meet normal living expenses while he was restocking his farm.  Furthermore the applicant at the time of the investigation had £3,850 cash in bank.  The restocking of the farm commenced in October 1983 when 14 cattle were bought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At all times, therefore, substantial amounts of cash were available to the person concerned from his own resources, from the sale of cattle and from the compensation provided by the Department of Agriculture.  The assessment of £2,500 for the year allowed a very significant margin for expenses having <Col N="1156" /> regard to the size of the enterprise involved.</P>
    <P>Every effort is made to process appeals as quickly as possible.  In many cases, however, numerous inquiries are necessary before decisions can be given.  This was the position in the present case and inquiries were not in fact completed until the end of January 1984.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will change the situation where a living alone allowance will not be paid to a widow over 66 years of age, because she has a four year old grandson living in the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The living alone allowance is payable to a qualified pensioner only where the living alone condition is satisfied. Where a child is living with a pensioner she would normally be entitled to an increase in pension for the child or, if the child's parents are dead, an orphan's pension if she is the guardian.  Children's allowance would also be payable in respect of the child.  She could on the other hand be in receipt of payment towards the child's maintenance from the parents or guardian.  In one way or another the total amount received by the pensioner for the child should normally be greater than the current living alone allowance of £3 per week.</P>
      <P>In general, therefore, no good reason is seen why there should be a change in the living alone condition which is the fundamental criterion for payment of the allowance.  If, however, the Deputy has a particular case in mind which is a cause of difficulty I will be glad to have it looked into on receiving the details from him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the way social security is organised and financed throughout the European Community the comparison of the contribution rates requested in the Deputy's question would not be possible.  In some countries varying contribution rates and ceilings are applied even within the same scheme, in other cases flat-rate contributions may be levied in addition to percentage contributions and in the case of some occupational injuries schemes the contribution rates can be related to the degree of risk in an occupation.</P>
      <P>Information on the rates of social security contributions payable in EEC member states is contained in the Commission publication &ldquo;Comparative Tables of the Social Security Schemes in the Member States of the European Communities, Twelfth Edition&rdquo; which relates to the situation at 1 July 1982, the most recent date for which the information is available.  Table II on Financing gives a breakdown of the contributions payable by employers and employees in respect of the various branches of social security in all the member states, including Ireland.  A copy of this publication is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The free television licence scheme provides for payment by the Department of the full cost of television licences in respect of monochrome television sets.  Pensioners with colour sets receive credit for the full cost of a monochrome set licence and are only required to pay the difference of £18 a year in licence fees.  Extension of the free televison licence scheme to cover the full cost of colour television licences would have significant cost implications and would not be a priority matter in present economic circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The unemployment benefit and assistance schemes are designed to provide income maintenance for people who are involuntarily unemployed and it is a statutory condition for entitlement that the person concerned must be available for work.  This is a fundamental criterion which must be applied and determined in the particular circumstances of each case.  In the normal course students, including mature students, following full-time education courses could not be considered to be available for employment and accordingly would not satisfy the qualifying conditions for entitlement to benefit.</P>

      <P>Payment of children's allowance in respect of the child in question, who reached aged 16 in March 1983, was disallowed from 1 June 1983 after she left school.</P>
      <P>In September 1983, continuation of children's allowance was claimed in respect of the child on the grounds that she was incapable of self-support and likely to remain so for a prolonged period.  The claim was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that the incapacity was not likely to be prolonged and this decision was upheld by an appeals officer on 27 March 1984.</P>
      <P>Childen's allowance in respect of the child in question was cashed subsequent to her leaving school and the resulting overpayment is being recovered by deduction from the allowance currently due.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board's estimate, prepared towards the end of last year, of gross expenditure on supplementary welfare allowances in 1984 is £20.34 million.  This figure represents an increase of approximately £3 million over actual expenditure in 1983 due partly to the full year cost of the 1983 budget increases but also to the increased level of demand for assistance under the scheme.  The budget increases effective from July 1984 will add a further £0.545 million to this estimated expenditure.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides an essential income maintenance for people who are not catered for under other social welfare schemes or who need special payments in addition to social welfare payments or other income.  It is therefore a scheme of fundamental importance and expenditure on it is inevitably reflected by prevailing economic circumstances.</P>

      <P>In dealing with hauliers who transport livestock in dirty vehicles, veterinary officers of my Department have been taking on-the-spot action to enforce the relevant regulations.  Depending on circumstances, such action ranges from verbal admonishment to rejection of consignments of animals presented in dirty vehicles. The latter, in particular, has been found in practice to be quite effective. My Department also periodically draw the attention of the livestock trade and the hauliers to the necessity at all times for maintaining proper standards of <Col N="1164" /> hygiene and cleanliness in the transport of animals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its introduction in 1978 pre-movement testing of cattle for bovine TB and brucellosis has disclosed more than <Col N="1165" /> 10,000 reactors.  A breakdown on a county basis is not readily available.</P>
    <P>Epidemiological surveys carried out by my Department in 1982 and 1983 into the causes of Bovine TB breakdowns suggest that in about 14 per cent of cases the infection may have been attributable to bought-in animals.  It is not possible to say what proportion of these herds had a completely clear TB history before the breakdown.  Experience prior to 1978 when the statutory pre-movement test was introduced was that a majority of disease breakdowns could be traced back to infected cattle bought into a herd.</P>
    <P>The value of the pre-movement test is that it offers protection to the purchaser against buying-in diseased animals, and enables infection in the herds of origin to be detected and tackled much earlier than would be possible by the annual rounds of testing alone.  Because of the enormous volume of cattle movement, it plays a vital role in the disease eradication programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 240 to 243, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particulars requested are set out in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  Applications received up to 30 September 1981 are being dealt with strictly in order of receipt.  Consideration is being given to how best outstanding applications <Col N="1171" /> received after that date can be catered for taking account of the limits specified in the relevant EEC Directives.  Any further measures to promote drainage in the <Col N="1172" /> western region will also have to be examined against the background of the present budgetary situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 and 264 together.</P>
      <P>Because of the enormous volume of cattle movement in this country, pre-movement testing plays a vital role in the disease eradication programme.  Since its introduction in 1978, pre-movement testing has led to the disclosure of over 10,000 reactors; it also enables infection in the herds of origin to be detected and tackled much earlier than would otherwise be the case.  In the case of cattle going to other member states, the 30 day test is mandatory under EEC law.</P>
      <P>The possible extension of the 30 day test period is one of the many aspects of the disease eradication programme at present undergoing a comprehensive review.  I shall be making a statement when that review is completed.</P>

      <P>Except in the case of suckler herds, calves are normally isolated from adult cattle shortly after birth.  However, where there is disease already in the environment, this isolation does not rule out the possibility of the calves becoming infected.  In the circumstances, there can be no question of such calves being automatically granted disease-free status.</P>

      <P>Applicants in the development or other category may remain in their respective categories for a maximum of six years (eight years in the case of development farmers in the disadvantaged areas).</P>

      <P>I understand that the Agricultural Institute has not made any precise prediction as to the outcome for farm income in 1984.  In a recent report, however, it estimates that there could be a small rise in farm incomes in nominal terms.  While farm input costs will increase, the report suggests that the upward trend should moderate as the year progresses.  I would point out that a major factor contributing to farm costs is the level of inflation.  The control of inflation is a prime objective of Government policy and the latest figures show that success is being achieved with inflation now at its lowest level since 1978.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I take it that this question relates to the new radio communications system which is being provided for the Garda Síochána and that it is not intended to cover expenditure on postal, telephone, telegram and teleprinter services.  The allocation made in respect of these services is published in the 1984 Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>As regards the new Garda radio system, the allocation made in the 1984 Estimates for expenditure on the purchase and leasing of the required equipment is £1,024,000.  This figure however does not reflect the cost of all the equipment that is being installed this year as over £4.7 million was spent on equipment delivered just before the end of 1983.</P>
      <P>At present radio communications equipment, which forms part of the new national radio network being provided for the Garda Síochána, is being installed in all stations in the 18 Garda Divisions outside the Dublin area.  The amount and cost of equipment depends on whether a station is a divisional headquarters, a district headquarters or a sub-district station. In round figures, the average cost in the different types of stations is as follows:&mdash; Divisional H.Q.: £54,000; District H.Q.: £9,500; Sub-District: £5,500.</P>
      <P>It is intended to place a contract shortly in relation to the separate radio system which will serve the Garda Dublin Metropolitan area but it is not possible at this stage to say to what extent this system may be installed in 1984.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

The usual suggestion is that legislation should, in respect of certain offences, provide either for minimum or fixed prison sentences as opposed to providing for maximum ones.  As a general proposition, I would not favour such legislation. I would not, however, think it appropriate to comment one way or the other on penalties for drug pushing which is specifically referred to in the question. The reason is that any question of legislation <Col N="1188" /> to amend the law relating to the misuse of drugs, including the provisions relating to penalties for drug pushing, would be a matter primarily for the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 307 and 308 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The higher education grants scheme applicable to any candidate for a grant is the scheme of the year he/she qualified academically for a grant by virtue of successes in the leaving certificate examination. In order to be eligible for a grant the candidate would have to satisfy the other provisions, including the means test, of the scheme applicable to him/her. Under the schemes from 1975 to 1982, inclusive, a person who qualified for a grant could, subject to certain conditions, have the grant deferred for a period of up to two years and, in exceptional circumstance, for a period in excess of two years.  My Department are prepared to consider as sympathetically as possible any proposals from the local authorities administering the scheme concerning the question of the deferment of grant under <Col N="1195" /> the schemes for those years in the case of any person who qualified fully for grant under the relevant scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme for 1983 and subsequent years there is no limit on the period which may elapse between the year in which the student qualifies academically for a grant in the leaving certificate examination and the year of entry on an approved course of third level education subject to compliance with the other relevant conditions of the appropriate scheme.</P>

      <P>I was very pleased to accept the report from the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland on 20 February 1984.  It is a very comprehensive and useful document in that it summarises existing policies in relation to the education of mentally handicapped children and suggests some lines of development. The Programme for Action in Education 1984-87 sets out the Government priorities over the next four years. Reference is made in the programme to a considerable number of the issues raised in the NAMHI report.</P>
      <P>Chapter four (Special Education) of the Programme for Action outlines the Government's intentions regarding the development of education services for the mentally handicapped for the four-year period 1984-87.</P>
      <P>The Report on the Education and Training of Severely and Profoundly Mentally Handicapped Children was published at the beginning of April.  As outlined in the Programme for Action, I propose during the period of the plan to appoint and train a cadre of teachers each year, starting in 1985, to cater for these children.</P>
      <P>Special schools will be encouraged to become resource centres for the teachers and pupils in special classes throughout their area.  The educational provision in special classes will be closely monitored to achieve the maximum possible benefit by way of integration.</P>
      <P>Work is continuing on the completion of the special curriculum which is being prepared for moderately handicapped children.</P>
      <P>My Department have made a commitment to a general policy of giving priority to the handicapped.  A practical expression of this commitment is the arrangement under which pupils in special classes now attract the enhanced level of capitation grant that obtained for similar pupils in special schools.  This arrangement is operative from the current school year.</P>

    <P>As regards the allocation of the proceeds of the levy, the present practice corresponds with the intentions my predecessor stated when introducing the Second Stage of the Youth Employment Agency Bill in Dáil Éireann in November 1981. My predecessor indicated that the funds would be used for the employment and training of young people and this is being done.  The Youth Employment Agency advises me on the schemes to be assisted and the level of assistance.  The money, however, goes direct to the large programme sponsors rather than through the agency's grant-in-aid.  My predecessor also indicated that the proceeds of the levy would be used to finance both existing and new schemes &mdash; the alternative of using levy proceeds to finance only additions to existing schemes and new schemes was specifically ruled out.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will give a breakdown of the 2,886 jobs which have been lost in Limerick since 1982 when the unemployment level was 4,699; the number of young people under the age of 25, both male and female, affected by the critical unemployment level there; the action the Government has taken to alleviate this situation in Limerick; the extent to which it has used the resources of the European Social Fund and other EEC financial resources to overcome this dramatic rise in unemployment; and how the resources <Col N="1205" /> of the Youth Employment Agency have been deployed in Limerick.</P>

      <P>The figures quoted by the Deputy seem to relate to live register returns for Limerick city at the end of January 1982 and 1984. The attached tabular statements provide a classification by broad industrial group of those on the live register at the Limerick city exchange and a breakdown of the numbers under 25 years of age, both male and female, registering at the exchange, at these dates.</P>
      <P>A major factor influencing the level of employment is the work of the industrial development agencies.  The Industrial Development Authority and SFADCo continue their active promotion of the Limerick area as a centre for industrial development.  In this connection a number of important new electronics firms have located in Limerick including the ELFAB Corporation, Atari, Verbatim and Wang.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards my own area of responsibility, my Department operates directly or through its agencies a number of national schemes which are designed to encourage and assist additional employment. As regards Limerick I would point out that over 200 persons have been recruited by employers under the employment incentive scheme since the beginning of 1983 at a cost of over £200,000.  A further 750 young persons <Col N="1206" /><Col N="1207" /> have benefited under the work experience programme during this same period at an approximate cost of £430,000.  In addition 50 persons have already availed of the recently introduced enterprise allowance scheme to establish their own businesses.  A further £400,000 has been allocated in the period to community projects in the Limerick region, under the grants scheme for youth employment and the Youth Employment Agency have developed four initiatives in Limerick at a cost of £258,000.  Over 2,100 people have received training from AnCO in their Limerick centre and AnCO have assisted 20 separate projects under the community youth training programme. Six additional projects are due to commence shortly.</P>
    <P>Aid from the European Social Fund to such organisations as AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the National Manpower Service is granted on the basis of national programmes, and figures relating to Limerick only are therefore, not available.  However, ESF assistance totalling £940,330 was approved for SFADCo for 1982 and 1983 and a further £427,000 was applied for in 1984.  The region has also substantially benefited from the European Regional Development Fund particularly as regards infrastructural development.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that, in general, the Employment Equality Act is operating fairly. However, while it is the case that many employers have adapted their personnel practices to comply with its provisions, notably in relation to direct discrimination, I believe that we have a long way to go in addressing the more elusive, indirect discrimination practices.  For this reason I have arranged that a review of its provisions should be carried out and this review is proceeding.  I have no evidence to suggest that the Act is militating against employment.</P>

      <P>No distinction is drawn between full- and part-time workers in several Acts including all occupational safety and health legislation, the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 to 1944, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the Payment of Wages Act, 1979.</P>
      <P>Other Acts apply to those who work for periods beyond a defined threshold or minimum.  Because of a lack of uniformity in worker protection statutes I propose, by way of a provision in the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Bill, to extend the Redundancy Acts, Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, and Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, to employees who work for 18 hours a week or more, bringing those Acts into line with legislation on holidays and maternity protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to keeping the legislation <Col N="1209" /> under review I will also be looking towards the creation of other mechanisms to protect part time workers.  For example, the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee for Contract Cleaners is a response to some of the employment problems of one important category of part time workers.</P>

      <P>Section 11 (1) (a) and (b) of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, provides that a candidate for election as an employee director must be an employee of the designated body to which the election relates and be between 18 and 65 years of age.  Section 10 (2) (a) and (b) of the Act also provides that the right to vote at such elections applies only to employees of the body concerned who are over 18 years and have had continuous employment with that body for not less than one year.</P>

      <P>I have noted the article on worker co-operatives to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The Government have recognised the important contribution that new local initiatives can make both in the creation of economically sustainable employment and as a means of regenerating the spirit of enterprise within communities faced with high levels of unemployment.  As a result the focus of Government employment creation policy has become more centred on the development and nurturing of small indigeneous enterprises involving community and worker co-operatives. Government policy in favour of such co-operatives is being actively pursued by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
      <P>My Department and agencies are also actively encouraging and supporting the development of worker co-operatives through a number of measures such as: the enterprise allowance and employment incentive schemes run by my Department; several initiatives by AnCO's external training division &mdash; most notably the impending establishment of a section assigned to co-operative development through training; and the Youth Employment Agency's community and youth enterprise programme and youth self employment programme which is co-sponsored with the Bank of Ireland.  My Department is also participating in an OECD programme on local employment initiatives, including co-operatives.</P>

      <P>A fund to promote North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation was established in 1982 under the vote of my Department.  This fund was established to assist organisations involved in reconciliation both within Ireland and between Britain and Ireland.  Four organisations have benefited this year.  £40,000 has been allocated to Co-operation North, £20,000 to the Glencree Centre for Reconciliation, £20,000 has been made available to the Irish School of Ecumenics and £10,000 to the Between organisation in Cork.</P>
      <P>In addition, new schemes have been set up under the auspices of other Government Departments and agencies. The Department of Labour in co-operation with the National Youth Council of Ireland administers a north-south youth exchange scheme whereby grants are paid to eligible youth groups which are affiliated to the national governing bodies of youth organisations to help defray the cost of accommodation and travel when visiting their colleagues North or South. The amount spent in 1983 was £20,000. The Youth Employment Agency has approved grant assistance towards the establishment of a trainee exchange programme by the youth and community exchange trust.  In the first year, £55,000 is being made available towards the cost of administering the trust.  Support for the exchange programme will be available from AnCO and from the Department of Economic Development in Belfast through the payment of the operational expenses of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has become increasingly difficult to obtain immigrant status in the <Col N="1212" /> United States of America in recent years. In practice only those with close relatives already there can have any great confidence that they can get such a status.  This situation, however, arises out of general United States policy on immigration. There is no particular quota for Ireland, nor is it possible for any country to negotiate special treatment for its citizens.  At present the US legislation provides annually for 270,000 preference immigration visas, divided into six categories.  The quotas in each category are open world wide to all, on an equal basis.  There are no country quotas, other than a ceiling on immigrants from any one country. This ceiling is not relevant to Ireland where the numbers eligible are much lower.</P>
      <P>Since there is no question of negotiating a special provision for Ireland, the Irish Government has had no discussions with the United States Government to that end.</P>
      <P>However, in contacts with the United States authorities we have indicated that it would be helpful if more Irish people were permitted to go to work in the United States to broaden their experience.  In areas such as student work visas and other areas where it may be relevant, the Government will continue to strive to obtain as full an allocation as possible for Irish citizens.</P>

    <P>Deputy Begley made written representations to me on 12 April last conveying concern about the future of this company and requesting that the IDA should carry out a thorough examination of the <Col N="1214" /> company prior to the payment of any money.  On receipt of these representations, my Department requested the IDA to investigate the matter.</P>
    <P>The IDA has informed me that it had been concerned for some time about the performance of this firm.  In March 1984 the IDA commissioned independent consultants to carry out a detailed study and to report on the company's future viability. The consultant's report, which became available in mid-April 1984 recommended the implementation of a number of measures which were designed to strengthen management financial controls and to improve labour skills.  I understand that early in May the company agreed to implement these recommendations without delay.  However, serious financial and other difficulties resulted in the closure of the factory on 22 May.  I very much regret the loss of employment which has occurred and the lack of notice of closure.</P>
    <P>Grant payments totalling IR£65,396 were made by the IDA to this firm; these comprised £58,196 in grants towards the cost of training workers and a rent subsidy grant of IR£7,200.  All grant payments were made on submission of fully certified and documented expenditure by the company's auditors.</P>
    <P>The IDA has been having discussions with the Dutch promoters of this company with a view to finding a solution to the problems which have arisen in this case but it would be premature for me to comment on the likely outcome.</P>

    <P>Mr. Frank Benson was born in Co. Mayo and received his early education at Mount St. Joseph's CBS, Ennistymon, Co. Clare.  He is a chartered engineer and town planner, holding a BE Degree in Civil Engineering, and Post-Graduate Diplomas in Town Planning and in Management. He is, at present, an executive director of Power Securities Limited, a company which has been engaged in shopping and office development in Cork, Limerick and Dublin (as well as in the UK) and a number of whose projects have involved the refurbishment and adaptation of old buildings for modern reuse, the most notable of which is the Powerscourt Townhouse Centre in Dublin.  Mr. Benson formerly worked as assistant county engineer in Sligo and Clare, (1960-1966), and as planning assistant (and later chief planning assistant) under Cork County Council (1966-1973). He was engaged in the preparation of the development plan for the county, urban districts and towns, and in development control.  During that period, he was seconded for a year to work with a special project team on a UN-sponsored subregional study of Cork city and county and was also closely involved in the early work of the South-West Regional Development Organisation.  In 1973-1974, Mr. Benson was employed by the IDA as regional planning adviser, and was involved in the review of regional industrial plans.  As senior planner in Dublin <Col N="1218" /> (1974-1979), he was involved with the 1976 review of the City Development Plan and with major planning applications and was seconded for six months to work with the Eastern RDO on the preparation of phase one of a regional development strategy for the eastern region. He is a past chairman of the Irish branch of the Regional Studies Association.  He is a founder member and a former vice-president of the Irish Planning Institute. He is also a council member of the Dublin City Centre Business Association.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he noted in the CIF-EEC survey of the Irish building industry report for March 1984 the growing proportion of firms which have been forced to cease building altogether; and if so, the corrective measures he proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The CIF-EEC survey of the construction industry is a relatively new indicator of short-term trends in building and construction.  The survey attempts to measure the opinions of a sample of firms engaged in building and construction on past and future trends in building output, prices, employment and the level of work in progress.  Like all opinion surveys, the results must be treated with caution and are open to a number of interpretations. Subject to these qualifications, it is noteworthy that the results of the March survey are, in general, more optimistic than those of earlier surveys.  In particular, a <Col N="1222" /> higher percentage of respondents in the residential and non-residential sectors reported increased activity compared with the previous quarter and also reported improved prospects for the following quarter.  Among the important information contained in the survey is the average number of months required to finish work in progress and contracts in hand on the survey date.  In the case of the non-residential and civil engineering sectors of the industry the level of work which the firms had in progress and for which contracts were in hand at the end of March was above that at the end of March 1983 while in all sectors the level in March 1984 was above the level in December 1983.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question refers to the proportion of residential building firms reported in the March 1984 survey as having been forced to cease building altogether &mdash; 19 per cent in the March 1984 quarter, compared with 15 per cent in the December 1983 quarter.  In interpreting these figures a number of factors must be borne in mind.  Firstly, it is inherent in the nature of the industry that a number of firms may experience periods of inactivity between the completion of projects and the starting of new ones.  Secondly, ease of entry and exit have always been traditional features of the industry, and thirdly, the fact that the information on the proportion of firms to have ceased building was given for the first time in the March survey suggests that special caution should be exercised in interpreting it until the results of further observations are available.</P>

      <P>Following a thorough review of various proposals put forward since 1977 for the provision of a group water scheme at Gormanstown, County Kildare, officers of my Department recently met the group trustees and informed them that the proposal to blend water for the scheme from the Tober and Woodenboley sources in County Wicklow could not be approved for group scheme grants on technical grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that proposals for a scheme using the Tober source only have been approved by Kildare County Council subject to conditions, and also by my Department.  In addition FEOGA aid has been available since 1979 for a Tober-based scheme, although there is a danger that this may be withdrawn if work does not commence without delay. Furthermore, I am prepared to consider a request from the relevant sanitary authority for approval to payment of a special contribution towards the cost of headworks in a Tober-based scheme, should this arise.  In all the circumstances, I consider that a Tober-based scheme <Col N="1224" /> presents the only prospect of progress at this stage and I would urge the group to concentrate its efforts on financing and providing such a scheme.</P>

      <Col N="1227" /> Since 1981 the IDA has approved over 250 industrial projects for the county with an investment potential of £38 million towards which the IDA has committed over £23 million in grants.</P>
    <P>Major overseas companies and indigenous firms assisted by the IDA include Abbott Laboratories, Donegal Rubber, IMED, Magees of Donegal, McCarters, Buncrana and W. McKinney &amp; Sons, Letterkenny, which between them employ 1,500 people.  Further jobs have yet to come on-stream in these and other IDA assisted projects in the county. Manufacturing employment has in fact increased by 8.5 per cent in County Donegal since 1981.</P>
    <P>The IDA has over 180 acres of land at eight locations and 140,000 sq. ft. of factory space available for industrial development in County Donegal.  A craft centre of 4,000 sq. ft. has been provided at Donegal and small industry factory units are being constructed in Buncrana and Milford.  In addition a 3×3,000 sq. ft. cluster unit is planned for Ballyshannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to State residents buying cars in Northern Ireland and subsequently seeking to import them.  Under the present arrangements for the motor vehicle industry, the permanent importation of fully built-up motor vehicles is confined to persons registered under the Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) Act, 1968, i.e. those firms which have been engaged in the assembly or importation of motor vehicles under a franchise or corresponding arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is provision under the Act for the permanent importation of a motor vehicle by private individuals, in practice the grant of such facilities is confined to <Col N="1228" /> cases involving permanent change of residence to the State where the person has lived outside the State for a continuous period immediately prior to the transfer of residence and provided the vehicle is imported as part of personal possessions at the time the transfer takes place.  Thus it is not possible, in normal circumstances, for an individual who is resident in the State to purchase a car in Northern Ireland and subsequently import it.</P>
    <P>The present arrangements are due to terminate on 1 January 1985 in accordance with Protocol 7 of Ireland's Treaty of Accession to the European Communities. Thus, from that date, the present restriction on the importation of cars from Northern Ireland will end.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise, however, that the ending of import restrictions is not directly related to the question of import duties and internal charges on motor vehicles which are a matter for the Minister for Finance.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by the Minister for Finance to Dáil Question No. 309 on 24 November 1983 and also to the Minister's reference to the matter during the course of his Budget Statement to the House on 25 January 1984.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to suggest that water and sewerage schemes on the scale mentioned by the Deputy are awaiting approval in my Department.  The total value of schemes which are fully planned and could be considered for approval is estimated to be £2.5 million. Approval would depend on the priority given to those schemes at both local and national level and would have to be considered <Col N="1237" /> against the background that schemes which are either in progress or have already been fully approved for commencement in County Galway are valued at £9.5 million.  Other schemes valued at £21 million approximately, which require the submission of additional information and material to my Department, are at various stages of planning.  The amount of capital which any local authority receives under the sanitary services programme in a particular year is determined primarily by the amount of expenditure on schemes in progress and so reflects both the initiatives taken by the local authority in the formulation and planning of schemes and the degree of priority which particular schemes have commanded in the allocation of resources at national level from time to time.  I have no reason to believe that the needs and proposals of local authorities in County Galway have received less than full consideration in this respect and I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to give full consideration to those needs and proposals.  The allocations notified to the local authorities in County Galway in common with other local authorities early in 1984 were initial allocations only.  Consideration will be given to increases in those allocations to the extent that expenditure by the local authorities warrants and the necessary proposals for sanction to the borrowing are submitted by each local authority concerned.  In fact one supplemental allocation has alread been made to Galway County Council since the initial allocations were made.</P>

    <P>Because of particularly severe pressure of frequency management work, there is a four-month backlog in the processing of business radio licence applications.  My Department have been in touch with suppliers of business radio equipment and with their representative organisation in regard to difficulties created by the backlog, and is particularly conscious of the risk that licensing requirements may be ignored by some unscrupulous suppliers. As an interim measure my Department are authorising additional frequencies for experimental community repeater systems which will enable suppliers to meet a considerable part of the demand for <Col N="1250" /> mobile communications systems with the minimum of licensing formalities.  The question of obtaining additional engineer staff is also under consideration, though it can be taken that in view of their present commitments Bord Telecom Éireann are not in a position to second suitable staff.</P>

The sale price indicated that the property was development land and, consequently, the chargeable gain arising from the disposal would attract capital gains tax at a higher rate.  In the absence of a computation of the chargeable gain from the taxpayer or his agent, the inspector made an estimated assessment on the taxpayer on 1 June 1984.  If the taxpayer was dissatisfied with the amount of the tax shown in the assessment, the appeal procedure was, of course, available for him.  He is entitled to lodge an appeal with the inspector within thirty days of the date of the notice <Col N="1252" /> specifying the amount of tax which he considers will be payable on determination of the appeal.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the necessity to clarify the role of the statutory authorities in relation to this group.  Amongst the items being considered in the proposed new Children Bill are a review of the age up to which children in care should be maintained and the provision of after-care services for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health his view on the appropriateness of accommodation for individual infants or children in mother and baby home accommodation, in the light of professional thinking and previous Ministerial circulars favouring foster family care for such children; and the measures he proposes on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main thrust of child care policy in recent years has been to move away from institutional care and to promote and develop fostering, adoption and other community-based services such as family case work and day care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowadays only two mother and baby homes retain babies for any appreciable length of time, St. Patrick's, Navan Road, Dublin 7, and the Sacred Heart Home, Bessborough, Cork.  Policy of both these homes is to care for infants for a short period after birth to give mothers an opportunity to decide on the future course of action which would be in their children's best interests.  The Sacred Heart Home also provides short-term accommodation for older children, of whom there are currently five in residence, whose mothers have just given birth to a second child.  St. Patrick's provide accommodation for seven severely handicapped children who have been resident <Col N="1258" /> there since birth.  These are children for whom care in the community is not possible, so severe are their disabilities, and for whom institutional care is the only option.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that policy will continue to be based on the principle that care in a family setting is the most desirable arrangement for children who, for whatever reason, cannot reside with their natural family.  However, there are obviously cases where fostering is not appropriate either because of the particular needs of the child or unavailability at the time of suitable foster parents.  In such cases the only alternative is some form of residential care.  For this reason health boards while acknowledging fostering as the preferable option, will continue to support residential services, including mother and baby homes, at a level sufficient to ensure availability of care, at all times, even at short notice, for children unable to reside in their own homes.</P>

      <P>Section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, enables health boards to assist voluntary bodies which provide valuable services in certain areas of the health services, largely in the community welfare area. The total grants provided by all health boards in 1983 amounted to about £12 million involving a considerable number of voluntary bodies.</P>

      <P>The claimant in this case received an allowance book at the rate of £45 for July 1984 which is the correct rate payable for four qualified children.  Payment in respect of her daughter was discontinued from 1 July 1984 as the school certificate submitted in support of her claim for continuation of allowance in respect of this child covered her attendance at school to June 1984 only.</P>
      <P>The claimant's allowance is further reduced from August 1984 to £36.15 per month which is the new rate payable in respect of three qualified children.  This reduction is necessary as one of the claimant's sons reaches 16 years of age in July 1984.  The claimant has been invited to claim continuation of allowance in respect of these children if the conditions for payment of the allowance after age 16 are satisfied.

      <P>The person concerned was paid injury benefit from 10 March 1983, the date of his accident at work, to 3 June when he was considered to be capable of work following an examination by a medical referee.  He claimed injury benefit again from 11 July 1983 and was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  The later claim to injury benefit was disallowed on these grounds. The claimant's appeal against the decision has been allowed following an oral hearing and consideration of further submissions.</P>
      <P>As a result of this decision arrears of injury benefit were awarded for the period from 11 July 1983 to 7 September, the end of the injury benefit period.

The sums concerned, however, were withheld and refunded to the South Eastern Health Board on account of supplementary welfare allowance advanced.</P>

    <P>Payment of further disability benefit will be made as medical evidence of continuing incapacity is received.
