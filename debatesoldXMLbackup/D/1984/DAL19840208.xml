May I ask the Taoiseach, in view of the steadily deteriorating situation in the Lebanon and the very dangerous state of affairs that prevails there, if he would avail of some opportunity today to give the House some information about the situation as the Government see it and in particular to give us any assurances that might be required about the position of the Irish UNIFIL contingent there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Pigs and Bacon Commission Ltd., are a private company set up by bacon curers and pig producers to take over the role of centralised marketing of pigmeat handled previously by the semi-State body, the Pigs and Bacon Commission (PBC).  The new company have been trading since 1 August, 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The semi-State Pigs and Bacon Commission were established in their present form in 1961.  However, in May, 1981, the Supreme Court ruled against the PBC in a case where the commission had sued for non-payment of statutory levies.  Following that decision talks were held with the industry which resulted in the Government agreeing to take responsibility for a sizeable deficit which existed in the PBC accounts.  This deficit had been building up for a number of years while the case about the levies was going through the courts.  The industry in turn agreed to pay the running costs of the PBC from 5 April 1982 and to form a new private centralised exporting company financed entirely by the industry. <Col N="2005" /> From 5 April 1982 to August 1983 the PBC continued to operate under this arrangement, with all costs being met by the industry.  The actual transfer of trading operations to PBC Ltd., a private company, took place on 1 August 1983.</P>
    <P>A central marketing agency for pigmeat is indispensable if the industry is to survive on export markets.  Compared to the major pigmeat exporting countries our presence on world markets is small. In such circumstances it would not make any sense for individual exporters in this country to compete against each other on the same markets.  A single marketing organisation can do this job much more economically and more effectively.  It helps to ensure uniform standards of quality and presentation, cuts marketing costs, and provides a single focal point for overseas customers.  A good example of the value of centralised marketing can be illustrated by our success in recent years in selling pigmeat to Japan.  We might never have got into this highly competitive market in the first place but for the fact that we had a centralised agency handling the product.  Pork exports to Japan, inlcuding export refunds, reached a record level of £32 million in 1983.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the new company, who were set up with the close co-operation of both curers and producers, are continuing the work of the old body in our traditional markets and are also determined to maintain our position on the valuable Japanese market.  I have no doubt that PBC Ltd. will also continue where the semi-State PBC left off in seeking out new markets for pigmeat.  I am aware that there has been good liaison and co-operation between the Pigs and Bacon Commission and Córas Tráchtála Teoranta in the past in identifying potential markets.  I am sure that this same spirit of co-operation will continue in the future.</P>
    <P>The pigmeat industry makes a significant contribution to the national economy accounting for 8 per cent of gross agricultural output at a value of around £170 million per year.  Over 4,000 people are employed in the pigmeat processing industry alone and annual exports <Col N="2006" /> are worth around £70 million.  These figures do not take account of other related activities which are strongly supported through pig production, in particular the growing and production of feeding-stuffs.</P>
    <P>But to return to the business in hand. The semi-State PBC had, for some years, enjoyed a letter of sanction under the Pigs and Bacon Acts which enabled them to borrow from the banks for working capital.  In recent times the level of borrowings on foot of this facility had been £500,000.  It would not be open to me under these Acts to give a similar letter of sanction to PBC Ltd. since they are a private company; hence the need for the measure now before the House.  The draft order provides for a guarantee by the Minister for Finance for borrowings of up to £500,000 by PBC Ltd.  It is not the intention that this guarantee should be provided indefinitely.  I would expect the PBC Ltd., within a reasonable period of years, to build up a capital base of their own.</P>
    <P>I commend the draft order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West):</i> We welcome this proposal.  It constitutes a step in the right direction and will ensure a proper approach to the marketing of our pigmeat.  Indeed it is important not only for our pigmeat industry but also for the other marketing and agricultural areas to which we will be coming in the next item on our agenda, so that there will be centralised marketing.  Our approach to marketing should be placed on a proper footing, done in a businesslike fashion.  There are many aspects of the whole of our pigmeat industry at present warranting examination.  As the Minister correctly pointed out, it is indispensable to have this central marketing agency for pigmeat if the industry is to survive on export markets.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat saddened by the following remarks of the Minister:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft order provides for a guarantee by the Minister for Finance for borrowings of up to £500,000 by PBC Limited.  It is not the intention that this guarantee should be provided indefinitely. <Col N="2007" /> I would expect the PBC Limited, within a reasonable period of years to build up a capital base of their own.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify that when replying.  Does this constitute a continuation of the present policy of this Government of downgrading the agricultural industry?  There are many other areas in which funds have been guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  I do not see any reason whatever why there should not be a continuation of this guarantee for our pigmeat industry in so far as this new body are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should bring to the attention of the Minister the disastrous situation obtaining in the whole of our pigmeat industry, particularly for farmers engaged in that industry, who have suffered severe losses in their incomes in recent months.  This is a very serious situation for the future of the whole of the pigmeat industry with regard to exports and our balance of payments. I had been hoping that the Minister would avail of this opportunity to give us some indication of his and the Government's thinking on improving all of the pigmeat industry, placing it on a sound footing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): I was hoping that the Minister would comment on the serious state of our pigmeat and the pig industry.  He says in his speech:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A central marketing agency for pigmeat is indispensable if the industry is <Col N="2008" /> to survive on export markets.  Compared to the major pigmeat exporting countries our presence on world markets is small.  In such circumstances it would not make any sense for individual exporters in this country to compete against each other on the same market.</P>
    <P>As the Minister rightly said:</P>
    <P>A single marketing organisation can do this job much more economically and more effectively.</P>
    <P>In addition to what is being suggested here, the Minister should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to seek ways in which our embassies could play a far greater role in promoting these products in the countries to which we export pigmeat.  In the recent past, our exporting to Japan has been very effective and a far greater emphasis should be placed on these markets.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister consider that the guarantee by the Minister for Finance for borrowings up to £500,000 is adequate to meet the demands of this new body, particularly the demands of more progressive marketing of our bacon products?  It is also important to remember, as the Minister has correctly pointed out, that this industry employs over 4,000 and the annual exports are worth around £70 million.  The Government and the Minister for Agriculture should take a deeper look into this entire industry because here is an area in which we could promote employment and furthermore, increase enormously the value of exports. The openings are there.  A proper and effective marketing approach would increase pigmeat exports twofold over the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the Minister's attention the unlicensed backstreet slaughterhouses which are causing problems in the industry.  I understand that he has promised to examine the position.  A proper approach with regard to slaughterhouses is imperative if we are to put this valuable industry on a proper footing.  The Department must be far more vigilant than at present with regard to the whole area of slaughtering and processing.  The Minister must seek out new export areas <Col N="2009" /> because our pigmeat industry is in a very serious situation.  We must have the correct mentality with regard to breeding, fattening and processing if we are to improve our marketing strategy and increase the number employed.</P>
    <P>I welcome this motion and it will have the full support of my party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the most efficient pigmeat industry in Europe and the Minister must be aware that in his own constituency people have been failing to get pigs killed at the local slaughterhouses because of their numbers and the closures due to the present recession.</P>
      <P>There was a further contradiction in the recent budget in that section 84 money will be restricted.  The Minister must use his good offices with the Minister for Finance to have this proposal rescinded.  We cannot compete in the export market if we do not get finance at a low interest rate under that section. This is one of our most efficient farming commodities, which we have developed over the years to a fine art.  We can compare favourably with any country in the western world on pig production, feed efficiencies and number of piglets born per sow.  We are give a pittance as a guarantee at a crucial time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2010" /> The Minister should be magnanimous enough in his support of the bacon industry to make money from the Exchequer available for promotional purposes to carry us through this very difficult period. He has admitted that 4,000 jobs are concerned, but there is no sincerity on the part of the Government in supporting this fine industry.</P>
    <P>Beef prices have increased by over 40 per cent within one year and bacon prices have dropped by 20 per cent.  These are the statistics to prove my point.  I am totally disillusioned.  All our counterparts in France and the other European countries have been receiving State aid by finding ways and means around the EEC system in promotions and low interest loans and these are the areas which we must examine.  We cannot afford to let this industry go on its knees, otherwise we shall see 50 per cent or more going out of production, if they are not already being forced out by the bank manager or the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>A contribution has been made to the dairy industry by its by-products being taken up.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the debate has been curtailed, because the Minister raised many national issues in his brief speech.  I am also disappointed that when he was speaking about national figures for output he did not give figures for the numbers of people involved in the pig industry.  He gave a figure for those employed in the processing industry but I think that other figures would show that there is a decline in the numbers of producers as well as those employed in the industry.  If this is allowed to continue, the industry will be wiped out.  Incentives must be given to the producers because of the high cost of inputs, otherwise they will not survive because at present they are on the bread-line. I hope that some time in the future we will have more time to debate this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to have an in-depth look at the production and marketing of pigmeat.  Producers are in serious trouble because of changes in the market products abroad.  The Minister said that exports to Japan were valued at £32 million and in a speech on the Estimate for Agriculture in 1983 he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The market for pigmeat has been difficult for some time past and market returns to pigmeat producers have been declining since the latter part of 1982.  Prices have now stabilised but they are still at a low level.  In response to the poor market situation, which was worsened by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Denmark in January, the EEC Commission introduced aids for the private storage of pigmeat with effect from 1 February. As a result of strong pressures from Ireland, export refunds on the &ldquo;Japanese&rdquo; type pork cuts were also increased.  These measures are going <Col N="2012" /> some way towards relieving the present market situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be looking for alternative markets because there have been great changes over the last few years. Traditionally it was the farmyard enterprise which was the most remunerative for small farmers, especially in Cavan, Monaghan, Cork and Kerry who were the biggest pig producers with fairly substantial units.  There are over 4,000 people employed in this industry and these numbers could be increased.</P>
    <P>
      <i>A Strategy for the Development of the Agricultural Processing Industry in Ireland</i> in June 1982 indicated that value-added products in the pigmeat industry could be improved.  Last year we imported 6,400 tons of bacon and pork. It was suggested that we could develop salami, German sausage, patés and other processed pigmeat products.  The Minister should ensure that we stabilise our markets and he must also examine feed prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With such intemperate language it is very difficult to have an organised debate.  I was saying I was disappointed and surprised that so few Deputies took part in this debate because there is and has been a very serious crisis in the pig industry for a considerable time past.  It is a matter of grave concern to my Department and myself and to pig producers everywhere.  Predictions are that there will be an improvement in the next couple of months.  The pig industry, by its very nature, is cyclical and we have ups and downs, year in year out.  However, on this occasion the depression in the industry lasted much longer than usual.</P>
      <P>Having said that, we must recognise that the problem is not confined to Ireland.  The same problem has affected the whole pig industry in Europe. Especially within the EEC the whole pig industry has been in a state of depression over the past nine or ten months.  It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons. Obviously over-supply of bacon and pork has been one of the contributory factors. There has also been consumer resistance to the purchase of bacon and pork.  We have had this resistance more markedly in the beef industry, but we have also had it to a considerable degree in the bacon and pork industry.  There has been a drop in domestic consumption and EEC consumption. That is another major contributory factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of speakers alluded to a <Col N="2014" /> problem which has caused financial difficulty for a number of our pig producers, that is, the high cost of feedingstuffs. Some speakers would like to give the impression that the Government could subsidise the cost of feedingstuffs.  That is not the case.  Under EEC laws we are not allowed to provide national aids. Therefore we are unable to assist in that regard.  The high cost of feedingstuffs is due primarily to a very poor cereal harvest in the USA and also on the mainland of Europe.  Coupled with that we have had the effect of the strong dollar.  This has led to a very steep increase in the cost of feedingstuffs.  We hope this will improve in the next couple of months.</P>
    <P>We got a significant degree of assistance from the EEC at my instigation last month at the council meeting.  We got aid for private storage which certainly helps the pigmeat market and is appreciated by the producers.  It should continue to help in the recovery which we are hoping will come about in the next couple of months. The EEC have been of considerable assistance also in the provision of generous export refunds.  That enables us to export pigmeat to Japan on a substantial scale.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening statement, we exported £32 million worth of pigmeat to Japan in 1983.  That was a significant breakthrough in the market.  There were contributory factors which may not arise this year.  Danish exports of bacon to Japan were affected by outbreaks of disease on the continent and specifically in Denmark.  In normal circumstances the Danes have the lion's share of the Japanese market, which is considerable in size.  We got a significant portion of it last year, and we are trying might and main through the Pigs and Bacon Commission to maintain a significant share of that market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan advocated that the Department of Foreign Affairs and our diplomatic missions abroad should play a more active part in promoting industry in this sector.  I could not agree more with him.  That is something I have been saying for years.  With regard to our pigmeat business our Embassy in Japan have been especially helpful over the past couple of <Col N="2015" /> years.  They realise the significance of this potential market.  They have been very co-operative and a certain amount of credit is due to them as well as to the personnel of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked why we did not give more support to the Pigs and Bacon Commission. We were asked for £500,000. That was granted.  It has taken about four months for this legislation to come before the House, but that money was given expeditiously after a request from the board.  There was no problem at all. There was no hassle over it.  It was given with goodwill and very speedily.  They have expressed their gratitude.  People who have asserted that we delayed this payment are quite incorrect.</P>
    <P>The previous Pigs and Bacon Commission which had to be terminated cost the State a considerable amount of money. When wound up they were in deficit to the tune of £5.6 million.  Some people suggested that £500,000 was a small amount of money, but the deficit of the previous commission was £5.6 million and the taxpayer had to foot the bill.  Let nobody under-estimate the commitment of the Government to the pig industry. That was a sizeable amount of money which the Exchequer had to find.</P>
    <P>Going back to the point Deputy Noonan made about the involvement of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the diplomatic corps, Deputies may have noticed that when we set up a committee consisting of four Ministers of State to help in synchronising and promoting our food industry the chairman of that committee was the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Keeffe.  That is an indication of our thinking on the matter.  In setting up that committee we decided that the Department of Foreign Affairs should be directly involved in promoting our food industry abroad and our food exports. We pinpointed this as a matter of considerable significance by appointing the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs as chairman of that committee.</P>
    <P>We all know that we lag far behind <Col N="2016" /> other countries who engage in agriculture in a big way when it comes to lobbying abroad.  I have first hand evidence of the activities of the New Zealand diplomatic corps and the Danes and the Dutch. Those three countries are probably our primary competitors.  Their diplomatic effort, and especially that of the New Zealanders, is very heavily concentrated on promoting their sales of agricultural commodities abroad.  This is an area where we could learn from the activities of those three countries, and New Zealand in particular.</P>
    <P>In the next few weeks there will be a tour of western European capitals, including Dublin, by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr. Muldoon, to promote his country's sales abroad of butter, lamb, or whatever.  They are at it continuously. We had their Minister for Foreign Affairs here in Dublin about three months ago.  Their diplomatic effort is very heavily geared towards selling agricultural produce.  In setting up this committee we have given recognition to that fact.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a figure of £70 million for our exports of pig meat in 1982.  We estimate that the 1983 figure will be £85 million.  That can be attributed to the Japanese market which, for the reasons outlined, was considerably improved in 1983.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nolan expressed worry about the statement that we will expect the Pigs and Bacon Commission, a limited company, to underwrite their own borrowings eventually.  That is a perfectly normal procedure.  We cannot expect the taxpayer to underwrite everything.  As they say in the west regarding the building sites in England, it will give them a start.  We are giving them a hand and we expect them eventually to be self-sufficient and able to manage their own affairs.  That is what the taxpayer and the Government would expect.  We have a duty to see that people use money wisely. The Board of the Pigs and Bacon Commission were quite delighted to get this money and I believe they will become self-sufficient.  We will keep the matter under review.  Certainly we have no intention of pulling the rug from under <Col N="2017" /> them.  We will watch the rate of progress.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt wanted to know the numbers employed in the bacon industry.  The number is in excess of 4,000 but it is difficult to assess accurately.  Deputy Leonard made the point that we need to diversify.  &ldquo;Diversification&rdquo; has become a bit of a cliché, particularly in relation to the dairying industry.  Of course the Deputy is right and there is a range of products we should be able to produce. Our competitors, particularly the Dutch and the Danes, produce not just a few but hundreds of items from the same commodity.  Their exhibits at international trade fairs are an eye opener. Recently I attended the Berlin Trade Fair, better known as the Green Week, and while the Irish stand was very well set up and popular with the Germans we were confined to about five products.  The Dutch and the Danes had litterally hundreds of products, whole ranges of cheeses, butters, ice creams and yogurts. On the beef, lamb and bacon side they also had a huge range of products.  Our range is far too limited.  It is an area where we have fallen behind very badly and we should have been taking action 20 or 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>We are trying to encourage co-operatives and other business ventures to diversify but the cost of going into new lines of production is immense.  We will have to do it.  There are many bacon products which we should be able to produce. Duffy's of Hacketstown are doing it to a certain degree but I have seen little else in the way of diversification.  There may be others who have products which I have not seen but certainly there are areas where we lag behind our competitors.</P>
    <P>I thank Members who contributed to the debate.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Dairy Produce (Miscellaneous Provisions)" RHead="(Amendment) Bill, 1984: Second Stage">
    <Title>Dairy Produce (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2018" /> This Bill provides for the amendment and extension of the Dairy Produce (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1973.  Essentially, the Bill involves the continuance of the guarantee which, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, I may give in respect of loans obtained by An Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited were established by the Irish dairy industry in 1972 and took over from the semi-State body An Bord Bainne.  The essential purpose of the board is the purchase and centralised marketing of dairy products produced by their members. Due to the seasonality of the production of milk and dairy products in Ireland and the fact that sales by the board are effected on a fairly even pattern throughout the year, they are obliged to borrow heavily to enable them purchase their members production during the peak production period.  The board's assets &mdash; in spite of the fact that they have shown commendable growth in recent years &mdash; are not yet sufficient to enable them to borrow to the very substantial extent necessary and it was to assist the board in borrowing that the State guarantee was provided by the 1973 Act and enlarged and extended in 1976, 1977 and 1979.</P>
    <P>The initial State guarantee in 1973 provided coverage for borrowings by the board up to a maximum at any one time of £20 million.  This figure was increased to £40 million in 1976 and to £90 million in 1979.  The purpose of the Bill before the House is to extend the application of the guarantee, which expired at the end of last year, for a six-year period to 31 December 1989 and to broaden the guarantee's scope to cover a range of borrowings, thereby bringing it more into line with the actual pattern of Bord Bainne's credit needs.  Previously, the guarantee covered only &lsquo;loans&rsquo;, as strictly defined and it is felt that the amendment proposed now will increase the flexibility and usefulness of the guarantee to the board. Also the additional six years will afford the board a reasonable opportunity to accelerate the build-up of their own resources and so become less reliant on State backing for a proportion of their <Col N="2019" /> borrowings.  The maximum amount of the guarantee is to be retained at the level of £90 million.  In essence, we are guaranteeing £90 million up to 1990.</P>
    <P>The dairy industry is the backbone of much of our agricultural industry.  Its continued expansion is of immense importance for the economic and social development of our country, but its continued prosperity is greatly dependent on maximising efficiency in processing and marketing. Centralised marketing of dairy products has a major role to play by enabling us to develop and exploit markets in a planned and economical way and by earning and maintaining an internationally respected position for Irish dairy products.</P>
    <P>Since we joined the Communities Irish milk deliveries have increased by about 72 per cent.  The value of the milk intake of creameries and other processing plants has increased by almost 100 per cent in the same period.  Marketing this extra production has, of course, been a major task and one which has been accomplished with success and, until recently, little reliance on intervention.  That this is so, is an indication of the role played by Bord Bainne who have successfully sold an expanding range of Irish dairy products in an increasing number of international markets.  By 1982 the total value of Irish dairy exports was £710 million per year, or about 12 per cent of the value of all our exports.</P>
    <P>We are at the present time facing an extremely difficult situation both within the EEC and in the international market place.  We face proposals from Brussels aimed at restricting Community milk production to the 1981 levels and at reducing the cost for the Community budget of support for the milk sector.  These proposals will continue to be the subject of negotiation in the Council of Ministers in the coming months, as will the Commission's parallel farm-price proposals for 1984-85.</P>
    <P>As the House probably knows, these talks commenced yesterday.  We are talking about the Commission's original proposals and subsequent progress which was made up to and including the Athens <Col N="2020" /> Summit in tandem with the Commission's price proposals for the 1984-85 marketing year.  When I speak about the difficulty in the international market place I would like to point out that the milk problem is aggravated by production in third countries, that is countries outside the EEC. That is why I make reference to the international market place.  Not alone has the EEC been overproducing milk in recent years but the United States had also been overproducing vast quantities of milk. We have to compete with them on the world markets.  This makes our task of getting rid of our own surpluses all the more difficult.  Bord Bainne have seen a number of their markets disappear because of competition from the USA.</P>
    <P>We had a very good market in Mexico for milk products which we lost because our price was undercut by the Americans. There are also markets in other parts of the world in the Caribbean, South America and North Africa, a portion or all of which we have lost because of price cutting. The Americans have set in motion methods to reduce their milk output with the objective of getting rid of their surplus. The EEC has now in train an endeavour to do likewise.</P>
    <P>We also face competition in the international market place from New Zealand. It is not just to Britain or to the EEC that they sell butter and dairy products.  They sell them throughout the world and we again have difficulty in competing with them in some of the areas which I mentioned, particularly in North Africa and the Middle East.  They have got to sell their agricultural produce because of their small internal domestic market.  The international market place has become vastly overcrowded in recent years with dairy products and is a very large contributory factor to the problems in the EEC in getting rid of its surplus milk and milk products.  While talking about the price proposals from the Commission in 1984-85 for milk, while formally a freeze has been proposed, related technical changes would result in a price reduction.  I will refer to that later on. The Government are not under any illusion that the task facing us will be an easy one but we are fully determined to secure <Col N="2021" /> agreement or arrangements which are fair and balanced and which take due account of our special situation in regard to milk.</P>
    <P>Our primary objective is to ensure that our dairy industry can face the future with confidence.  But it is obvious that now more than ever before, efficiency in production, processing and marketing will be of crucial importance.  If indeed we ever could afford the luxury of running our dairy industry at less than optimum efficiency, we certainly cannot afford it from now on.  The central importance of dairying to the agricultural industry in Ireland and to the national economy as a whole is understood now as never before.  All who work in it must do their utmost to see that we maximise the contribution it can make to our overall prosperity.  Bord Bainne's pivotal role in all this involves an increasing challenge in the future.</P>
    <P>It is now clearly essential that we make an all-out effort to reduce our present heavy dependence upon intervention. Because of the limited size of our domestic market and increasingly difficult trading conditions in our major traditional market, the UK, this means that henceforth, we must make more efforts than we have ever made before to sell competitively on other markets.</P>
    <P>Not alone must we increase sales of existing products in present and new markets, but we must also develop new products and identify new market opportunities. New product development is, however, a slow and expensive process requiring heavy investment over a long number of years.  Yet if we are to market successfully our anticipated increasing milk output in the years ahead, product development and diversification are areas in which we cannot afford not to get involved.  I am greatly heartened that Bord Bainne have definite proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>In extending the State guarantee as now proposed, we shall be giving tangible support to the board and recognition that the board's ability to obtain the finance necessary for their operations, as easily and economically as possible, is clearly of vital importance.  As I have already <Col N="2022" /> stated, the backing of a State guarantee is still necessary for the present if the board are to discharge their essential function in the best and most efficient way.  In providing the guarantee the Government or taxpayer have not had to pay one penny to Bord Bainne.  They have been able to operate on a commercial basis without taking up the guarantee which is an indication of their ability to trade in this area and an indication of their competence.  Hence my proposal to extend the guarantee for six years and to make it more responsive to the board's actual borrowing needs.</P>
    <P>The existence of the State guarantee has up to the present enabled An Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited to obtain adequate borrowing facilities to meet its funding requirements.  No claims have ever been made under the State guarantee and no question of expenditure by the Exchequer has arisen up to now; neither is any such claim likely to arise in the future.  The present Bill, therefore, affords the House a timely opportunity to demonstrate our confidence both in An Bord Bainne and in the future success of Irish dairying.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few further points. There is such a thing as credibility in all these negotiations and that credibility applies in Europe just as it does here at home.  We have been negotiating the milk super-levy proposal together with some dozens of other proposals which were put forward by the Commission last July.  We have been discussing those for about six months now.  It has been tough.  As well as negotiating we have been lobbying our European colleagues, and I am glad to say that they have recognised for the last couple of months, since Athens, that we have a real difficulty in accepting that the milk super-levy proposal should apply to Ireland.  Our negotiating and our lobbying have been extremely effective in getting this recognition.  I heard yesterday that Deputy Noonan raised the matter of my statement on the super-levy.  I do not know why it should be raised.  It was the same as I have said all along, that there is a need for a super-levy within the EEC but we are adamant that we should be exempt from such a levy.  That is what we <Col N="2023" /> said on Monday and yesterday in Brussels and we will continue to say it.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is an acceptance that we have a very special case.  The degree of the acceptance by other countries of our special position varies.  Some countries, while recognising that it would create enormous difficulties for our economy, nevertheless feel that we should share the burden of the cuts which have to be made in the dairying sector, and that if the whole CAP and the price support system are not to collapse these cuts must be made.  The alternative to a milk super-levy would be direct price cuts which would amount to approximately 10p per gallon of milk.  I do not want anybody to go away with the impression that by shooting down the milk super-levy the problem of over-production of milk in Europe will go away.  I do not believe anybody could be so stupid or unrealistic.  The problem will not go away, and the obvious alternative if there is not to be a milk super-levy is a direct cut in price which it is quite clear would be much more detrimental to agriculture and to the economy of this country.  If anybody has any bright ideas as to other alternatives I would be only too delighted to hear from that person.  If anybody is so naive as to think that nothing will happen, that prices will increase or at the very worst remain static if we do not deal with the problem of over-production of milk in Europe, that is just too bad because that is not reality, it is fairy-tale. Nobody could be so naive as to think something need not be done about over-production of milk.  Something must be done but I have yet to hear anybody give me any alternative to the milk super-levy or a direct cut in price.  If somebody has some brilliant scheme which has not been bandied about previously I will be only too delighted to hear about it especially if it would be to our benefit and if it meant that we would not have to take any share of the cuts.</P>
    <P>In the past we have demanded, and we will continue to demand in resumed negotiations, that Ireland be granted a complete exemption from the super-levy on the grounds that its implementation <Col N="2024" /> here would have a most serious and disproportionate effect on not only Irish agriculture but on the economy as a whole.  We require this exemption until at least we reach the level of development which is the norm in the dairy industry elsewhere in the Community.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the Greek Presidency last autumn advocated that the milk super-levy proposal be for a period of four years with a review after three years.  We support that view and feel that such action may well solve the problem created by the over-production of milk within the Community.  In other words, if the super-levy proposal were to come in and to bite &mdash; as I think it will &mdash; it would encourage a great many of the intensive producers in Europe to reduce their production or, better still, to get out of milk production completely and, who knows, at the end of four years we could have a completely new ball game.  I do not want to sound over-optimistic, but it is possible that milk production in Europe at the end of the four-year period would be in deficit.  It could happen.  If we could be exempted from the rigours of the super-levy for that four-year period we might find that come 1988-89 we were in a position to take off and continue to increase production all over again.  It is a very interesting outlook, but of course at this stage it is all just supposition.  However, I am hopeful that the super-levy proposal if implemented for those countries which have caused the problems would reduce milk production immediately and bring us back to where we could continue <i>ad infinitum</i> to increase the milk output.  It is vital that we get rid of the surpluses which are putting a severe strain on the Community's resources and we are insistent that the countries which created the financial difficulties bear the burden of the cost of its elimination, and that is a terribly important aspect.  These are the people who have involved themselves in factory-type farming, who have imported vast quantities of cereal substitutes from third countries in order to boost their production. We do not see why we should have to pay for their indulgence in this regard because we did not benefit from those <Col N="2025" /> cheap imports or massive factory-type farming which has generated huge profits. This is where we take issue with other countries at the negotiations.  We will continue to make that point clearly in the future.</P>
    <P>So far in our negotiations we have made considerable progress although some politicians here maintain we have not.  I can truthfully say that we have not met one farmer who is not pleased with the rate of progress the Government have made to date in the super-levy negotiations.</P>

      <P>The proposal at the Athens Summit was the last positive one put forward. We did not accept it and a number of other countries vehemently opposed getting it.  All agricultural matters, including the milk super-levy, are being discussed at the Council of Ministers of Agriculture.  Deputy O'Keeffe and others referred to changes in intervention payments.  I should like to point out that the Commission decided to increase the minimum period in which payment could be made from 60 to 120 days.  This is a matter for the Commission to decide following consultation with the management committee.  We opposed it strongly and we were able to delay it for a period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not have sufficient support to block that proposal permanently and it came into effect on 27 January.  The result of the change was to reduce intervention prices by about 2p per gallon on milk.  Secondly, the Commission now propose changes in the quality standards for skim milk powder before it can be sold into intervention.  Lower moisture and acidity standards are the main issues involved in this.  The proposal would increase the cost of producing skim milk powder or, more importantly, render the bulk of our powder ineligible for intervention.  Again, this is a matter for the Commission but we are opposing it vehemently and we have the support of a number of other delegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that the Commission are entitled to bring in these proposals without consulting the Council of Ministers.  Already the Commission have amended the proposal to make it less objectionable.  While this is an improvement it is still not to our liking and we remain opposed to it.  I am hopeful that it will be possible to have it further amended to our satisfaction.  I read a <Col N="2028" /> report in a newspaper last week of a person maintaining that this quality control standard would mean that the price of milk could be reduced by as much as 10p per gallon.  That is absolutely untrue. As a result of changes being brought about in these quality control standards at our insistence we are hoping that the reduction in milk prices will be minimal, if anything at all.  I should like to eliminate that fear.  I have just outlined two examples of the adverse consequences of a failure to reach a satisfactory settlement in the discussions on the super-levy and related problems.  I recommend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the views of Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): I welcome the Bill which has our support.  I note that it is proposed to guarantee the borrowings of An Bord Bainne for a further six years.  That is a step in the right direction.  An Bord Bainne are an excellent organisation who are working in a difficult area at present.  They deserve every support possible and, particularly, a positive approach by the Government and the Minister of Agriculture.  I use the word &ldquo;positive&rdquo; in connection with pointing the way forward towards targets we want to reach.  Unfortunately, the Government have no such plan or way forward, no plan for the future, and ultimately the whole dairying industry, already beset with difficulties created by the EEC, will be faced with many more problems.  That is particularly serious when we recognise dairying as the basis of our agricultural economy, particularly beef production.</P>
      <P>The largest single task facing An Bord Bainne and the industry generally is the diversification of production so that we will feed a greater share of our milk into products other than butter and skim milk. The future of our dairying depends on the development of new improved products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): The future of our dairying depends on the development of new, improved products and satisfactory market outlets for them. I spoke earlier about the need to utilise our embassies and our diplomatic corps to improve our market prospects abroad as an adjunct to the Bord Bainne marketing arm, Córas Tráchtála.  Our embassies can play a far greater role in this field.</P>
      <P>Improvements and diversification of our dairy produce call for adequate research investment and market testing. The risk of failure is high but we must take that risk if we are to put dairying on a sound footing.  We must also have radical approaches to marketing and production. I hope the Department and the Minister will give every possible support to An Bord Bainne to plan for such diversification. As I have said, risks are necessary if the industry is to be developed properly.</P>
      <P>Investment is essential.  Ireland is far too small for a fragmented approach.  Our co-operatives, individually, have not got the required scale of risk capital if we are to make the foreign market inroads we need in the future.  It was heartening to see recently An Bord Bainne deciding to set up a national fund for the development of dairying, and I am now calling for full support for that venture from all agencies, State and otherwise.  I ask the Minister to help to promote it in every way he can.  Indeed I urge the Government to supplement this fund which not alone will help the dairying industry but the entire national economy.  First of all, the Department should provide monetary support for the fund, which should be closely co-ordinated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fund will not need any large organisation to administer it and I hope it will <Col N="2030" /> not involve any foreign consultants.  We are very well equipped at home in our excellent food research section in An Foras Talúntais and our equally talented dairy and food faculty in UCC.  The fund will also be helped by the competent staffs in our creameries and co-operatives. It can be a success with the collaboration of all these agencies.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that four Ministers of State have been appointed to co-ordinate the work in food processing and marketing.  This is acceptable, but the announcement was made first by Deputy Bruton and I was surprised and perplexed that it did not come from the Minister for Agriculture because our main food production experts are based in the Department of Agriculture, and improvement in the end products of dairying cannot be achieved without full attention being paid to the raw materials, and this is the job of the Department of Agriculture.  Therefore, I was surprised the Minister for Agriculture did not make that announcement.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): The Minister for Foreign Affairs should be asked to lend his expertise to promote the marketing of our main exports, beef and dairying.  I concur with the Minister when he said that we compared very badly with other exporting nations.  He rightly pointed out that it is only a short time since we had the Prime Minister of New Zealand here promoting his country's dairy products.  Here is a vital role for our Ministers for Agriculture and Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach to play. They could visit the various member states of the EEC and promote our products.  I will reply later to the Minister's statement about the common agricultural policy.  The Government should have a vigorous approach to marketing and support the many marketing agencies that exist at present.  The Government have fallen down on that area.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): The board have enough difficulties in relation to marketing without the Minister adding to them by making erroneous statements. I would refer the Minister to an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on Sunday, 5 February 1984, which refers to Bord Bainne and the co-operatives being hit by the section 84 ban.  It is another instance of one arm of Government being determined to crush our basic industry.  I refer to the Department of Finance.  According to the figures in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> the section 84 ban could have the effect of increasing Bord Bainne's interest charges by between £1,500,000 to £2 million. That is a serious situation.  Surely the Department of Finance realise what the problems are and how this ban will affect the entire dairy industry and render it much more difficult for Bord Bainne to continue with our marketing strategy which is so essential at a time when the entire dairy industry is being attacked both from within and without the country. I hope that in replying the Minister will define what the situation is.  I heard someone say recently that because of the various levies being introduced by the Government the whole agricultural industry is reaching a hurricane situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): The section 84 ban will result in a further half penny per gallon on milk so far as the producer is concerned.  In addition, the delay in the intervention payments by the EEC to a period of 120 days will cost the dairying industry in the region of 2p per gallon at a time when the industry has to meet increased production costs, which this year could be anything up to 5p per gallon because of the levies and of the withdrawing of aid by the Government for the promotion of the whole agricultural industry.  This means that the yield in respect of each cow will have to be increased by 85 gallons if those extra costs are to be covered.  This is the situation that the Government have brought about by their approach to the economy generally and to agriculture in particular by <Col N="2035" /> reason of the downgrading of that industry. If the dairying industry is undermined the whole agricultural industry is undermined also because dairying is the basis of the industry.  There is the question, too, of the distortions in milk prices brought about by the system of MCAs. This is another area that the Minister has not tackled.</P>

If he believes that he is living in cloud cuckooland.  I have not met any member of the farming community who is satisfied with the Government's approach to the question of the reform of the CAP especially in terms of the dairying industry.  Irrespective of what figures the Minister may quote, 1983 was a bad year for the agricultural industry; but, bad as 1983 has been, 1984 will be the worst in living memory for Irish farmers.  We have an uncaring Government, a Government who are not interested in the problems of the industry.  One cannot be happy about their approach, especially at EEC level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If implemented many of the proposals of the Commission on the reform of the CAP would have a disastrous affect, not only for the agricultural sector but for the whole economy.  However, we can have a good deal of success in so far as the proposals are concerned but if we are to be successful there must be present the political will on the part of every member of the Government.  They must all be prepared to support fully the Minister for Agriculture in his negotiations and to support the Taoiseach when the time <Col N="2036" /> comes for him to attend the Paris summit because that is where we hope the decisions will be made.  However, the Minister's approach differs at each meeting of the Council.  He has no consistent approach with regard to the negotiations. One day he says that the Government support in principle the implementation of a super-levy while on other occasions he says that such a levy is totally unacceptable to us.  Our party have made it clear in the past number of months that nothing less than a total exemption for Ireland is acceptable.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): These <Col N="2037" /> proposals will be far-reaching and will extend over quite a number of products. There is a major disappointment because of the weak way some of these proposals are being put forward, especially those that could make a significant contribution to the budgetary problems.  When the Minister was speaking on Second Stage he asked if there were alternative proposals to those already on the table to reduce the budgetary problems of the EEC and also with regard to reform of the CAP.  There are many alternative proposals.  I want the Minister to promote them, to put them forward to the Council of Ministers and also to ensure that they are put forward at the Paris summit meeting in March.  However, I do not think there is the political will to put forward such proposals and to push them.  This was done in the past when another Minister from another party held the post of Minister for Agriculture.  It is a major disappointment that alternative proposals are not being put forward by the Government and by the Minister.  With regard to cereals, there is a rather vague hope of curbing the import of cereal substitutes but the Minister has done nothing about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with sheep meat the Commission rather tamely suggests that there should be an examination of the &ldquo;possibility of negotiation of a reduction in the quantities to be imported.&rdquo;  What has the Minister done with regard to imports from third countries?  The Commission has shelved the question of imports of butter from New Zealand.  I take issue with the Minister on this matter.  He said in this House that he would not allow <Col N="2038" /> further importation of butter from New Zealand in any circumstances until reforms of the CAP were finalised and until there was a finalisation of the super-levy question.  Again, the Minister has gone back on his commitment and he has let the farmers down.

      <P>I am disappointed that the suggestion to abolish calf premiums has been part and parcel of the proposals.  Fianna Fáil Ministers fought long and hard for the introduction of that premium and ultimately they were successful.  Apart from the financial loss, uncertainty and instability of this kind will not allow the farmers to plan efficiently.  Our cattle and beef industry needs a boost, not a blow.  There have been lay-offs in our beef plants in the recent past and this should be considered. I hope the proposals to retain the suckler cow premium will be agreed.</P>
      <P>The proposal that has aroused the strongest resentment is that relating to the super-levy on milk production.  That must be resisted at all costs.  I will give credit where credit is due.  I am glad that at long last the Minister has come around to our way of thinking when he said recently he would be prepared to use the veto or the &ldquo;Luxembourg Compromise&rdquo; to ensure that the super-levy will not see the light of day so far as this country is concerned.

      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): The woolly thinking of the Minister is becoming more apparent all the time.  Are we prepared to use the veto where out vital national interests are at stake or are we not?  There are other questions I shall be putting to the Minister later, such as the proposals put forward by Greece when they held the Presidency of the EEC.  I ask the Minister if they are the proposals from which we start our negotiations. There is no point in talking about proposals in the past that were unacceptable then.  My information is that we are starting from the proposals put forward by the Commission based on 1981 output plus 1 per cent.  I want the Minister to clarify this matter.</P>
      <P>The core of our case must be to demonstrate that the levy would impose an unduly severe and unjust penalty on this country.  The Minister said the dairy industry is of far greater importance to our economy than it is to any other member state.  This must be pointed out at meetings of the Council of Ministers and at Commission level, but I doubt if this is being effectively pointed out by this Government, because this point did not come across loudly and clearly at the meeting of the Council of Ministers held earlier this week.  There is hostility to our proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad to realise that our vital national interests are not being considered by the Commission.  One might even go so far <Col N="2040" /> as to say that their proposals are contrary to the spirit and rules of the Treaty of Rome where our national vital interests are at stake.  Yet, the Minister has a wishy-washy approach, he has woolly and muddled thinking and he changes his stance from one Council meeting to the other.  There is no way we can make progress if we adopt that approach.</P>
    <P>Our cattle industry is heavily dependent on calves from the dairy herd and the fall in dairy cow numbers, which would inevitably result from a penal levy, would hit our beef trade very hard.  This country produces only 4½ per cent of the Community's milk supplies.  Our dairy farmers get a price for their milk which is far below European standards.  Is this fact realised?  We are not creating a butter or skim milk powder mountain.  The milk factories in Denmark, Holland and Germany are causing the real problems. What effect will the proposed super-levy have on their enterprises?  Will it have the desired effect?  I say no, because those countries have reached their maximum output.  The proposals now being put forward by the Commission will not solve the real problems of a glut of dairy products in the EEC.  Our approach is wrong and we must have alternatives and be prepared to push them.  Are we determined to push these alternatives?  The benefits which have accrued to Ireland since 1973 will be null and void if we are not prepared to push our case for fear it offends one member state or another.</P>
    <P>Countries like Denmark, Holland and Germany largely base their milk production on the heavy feeding of cows with concentrate feedstuffs.  These feedstuffs are mainly cereal substitutes imported free of duty from outside the Community. This area should be tackled if we are interested in protecting the small, weaker nations of the Community.  The quantities per cow are large so as to force very high milk yields.  There is nothing wrong with that but these are the areas which should be taxed and that the Commission should be looking at to relieve the problem of over-supply and surpluses.</P>
    <P>The quantities of these imports have trebled over the past decade.  MCAs <Col N="2041" /> result from an artifically high price for the milk available to farmers in Germany and other countries, the Netherlands in particular.  This area too should be tackled but it is not being tackled by the present EEC proposals by the imposition of a super-levy.  This will affect a country like Ireland which is a small producer &mdash; producing only 4½ per cent of the total EEC dairy products &mdash; to the tune of 10 per cent.  Let us tackle the real problems in the member states.</P>
    <P>The super-levy proposals would unfairly penalise the smaller, weaker and less well off Irish industries because of the problems created directly by larger, stronger and better off European industries. The gallonage of milk per cow produced in the milk factories is already very high and their financial returns are so great that the financial losses resulting from the levy would be much lighter than for the Irish supplier.  From the word go the situation is not, and cannot, be acceptable to this country.  We must be completely exempt from all such measures. Here the real negotiating muscle of our Minister, if he has any, should be extended fully.  As I said, those proposals are contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome.  There is still time, provided the political will is there, to influence these proposals.  This Government will have the full support of this party if the proper approach is adopted.</P>
    <P>There is no point criticising unless one suggests alternatives.  The Minister specifically asked for alternatives earlier today and I am putting forward some suggestions which would benefit this country and reduce surpluses in the EEC. First, we should veto any further imports of butter from New Zealand.  That contract came up for renewal last year, but what did the Minister do?  He reneged on his original commitment.  We should seek the elimination of all MCAs because they give an unfair advantage to several member states at the expense of the Community. I have already explained fully how this can be done.  That is another alternative &mdash; seek a ban on cheap feeding-stuffs from third countries; call on the commission to impose a levy on milk factories in Europe.  I know that is <Col N="2042" /> included in the proposals but I doubt that it is sufficiently strong to have the desired effect.  It is in that area the problems arise.  I want to reiterate the importance of diplomatic relations and contacts with the other member states.  These can be established through our embassies, by the Taoiseach visiting other member states, so that we emphasise to our partners the importance of the dairying industry to this country, far more important to us than any other member state.  I want the Minister to state unequivocally that, if necessary, we will use the veto against these proposals because their effect would be so serious.</P>
    <P>There are alternatives to be examined as against those put forward by the Commission. I hope the Minister will apprise himself of these alternatives.  Our position must be clearly and unequivocally stated, that the super-levy on milk production will not be accepted by us in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to support An Bord Bainne and the work they are doing.  At present there are threats in the market place.  For example, the returns from our cheese market are not as great as they had been; one-sixth of all our milk is processed into cheese products.  This is where An Bord Bainne can usefully establish this fund, which I hope will be supported by the Minister, in order that they may diversify their activities into other areas of production.  The variation in milk prices from one member state to another is quite significant.  This is another area the Council of Ministers and the Commission should tackle.  For instance, because of the MCAs about which I spoke earlier, the German producer receives something in the region of 10p per gallon over and above the price we receive for our milk, giving them a tremendous advantage which surely is not fair to us.</P>
    <P>I hope the provisions of this Bill will have the desired effect, ensuring that An Bord Bainne are placed on a sound footing because they have the necessary expertise.  In this respect I hope we can move forward in marketing and on the further diversification of our dairy products.  One might well ask why it took <Col N="2043" /> An Bord Bainne until now to decide on the diversification of such products.  But better late than never and the work they are doing is most acceptable.  We must utilise fully all the expertise available to us.</P>
    <P>I want to take up a few points made by the Minister in his introductory remarks. He spoke about intervention.  I said this would cause a delay in intervention payments of 2p per gallon to our dairy farmers. Bad example was given to the EEC, by the Minister when this Government delayed those payments for up to 90 days. Again, bad example was given when the Minister and his Government suspended the farm modernisation scheme, continuing their downgrading of our agricultural industry.  The Minister's negotiating power at EEC level must have been reduced substantially because of this approach, his muscle at the negotiating table must have been considerably reduced, as also his and our credibility as a nation.  On the one hand the Minister is reducing the support here for our farmers and, on the other hand, he goes to the Council of Ministers seeking aid and support. If the Minister is not prepared to do it at home he cannot depend on the EEC to do it for him.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to state clearly whether the Greek proposals form the base from which we shall now commence. Are those proposals still on the table?  It must be remembered that the large European producers will not necessarily be affected by this super-levy because it will not have the effect on them the Commission thinks.  Already they have reached such a high level of production any imposition will not now reduce their milk production levels.  Therefore, the super-levy does not necessarily constitute the best solution.  There are many alternatives and other areas to be examined which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>There is another area warranting examination when we talk about the provisions of this Bill and Bord Bainne.  We should examine the possibility of increasing the sales of our milk on the home market, an area which should be promoted by <Col N="2044" /> Bord Bainne.  I suppose the National Dairy Council are the appropriate body to initiate such promotion.  I know they are launching a campaign next week to encourage greater consumption of milk in our pubs, bars and lounge bars&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is our idea.  It took them a long time to get it off the ground, did it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): Provided, of course, that the Minister for Finance does not tax that pint as well. There is always the danger that, if this was thought to be lucrative, the Minister for Finance would tax it.  Such a campaign would be an effective way of increasing consumption and the disposal of our dairy products on the home market.  It would have the additional benefit of increasing employment in this industry. We must utilise our natural resources and there is no better way of doing that than by promoting the sale of milk on the home market.  I am sure that the National Dairy Council will have the full support of all the agencies in their task of increasing the sale of milk in lounge bars, public houses and throughout the length and breadth of the country.  The Department should also have a greater commitment to the school milk scheme, as well as being concerned with the export market and seeking further markets.</P>
      <P>When the Bill came before the House some years ago, the guarantee on borrowings was £90 million and I hope that that will be sufficient to meet the needs of Bord Bainne over the period ending 31 December 1989, a period of six years. The Government may be downgrading the agricultural industry in not increasing that amount, but I hope that this is not so and that the £90 million will be ample. I understand that the board have extended the range of their borrowings and rightly so and that some minor details are being cleared up.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise the importance of our dairy industry and commend the role being played by An Bord Bainne who hopefully will have the support, financial and moral, of the Minister and the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>While one could argue with some of the comments made by the Opposition spokesman on agriculture, apart from the odd swipe here and there, basically the same message comes from both sides of the House. That is important, in view of the seriousness of the problem in the context of what our papers publish.  These are read in Bonn, Brussels and elsewhere and we should have this type of obvious cohesion within the House.  One might argue that we are not strong enough on one approach and should be emphasising certain aspects, but the message is loud and clear from both sides of the House in support of the Government's stand on the superlevy.</P>
      <P>The Government accept that there is a serious financial crisis within the EEC but it is true to say, as the Minister and Deputy Noonan have said, that we have not contributed to that problem, so we should not be asked to contribute to its solution.  Our case is clear and unequivocal and we are all adopting the same stance on this.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the Opposition spokesman on the case to be made for diversification and our record in some areas is quite spectacular.  I would just mention cream liqueurs with which we have now taken over the world market, frozen foods, yoghurt and now soft cheeses from our co-operatives and fat-free products.</P>
      <P>A recent campaign was waged against our milk concerning its purity.  As a Government and a Parliament, we have responsibility to point out that the milk is a pure, safe product and nothing but good can be gained from drinking plenty of it.  All the talk about antibiotics and so forth has been very damaging to milk sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before that, there was a campaign against butter.  One would think that by eating a little butter at breakfast or teatime one was automatically endangering one's health and inviting all sorts of cardiac problems.  The latest American scientific evidence has proved these fears to be totally without foundation and that <Col N="2046" /> there are absolutely no benefits to be gained from using any other type of fat as against ordinary butter.  Our forebears proved that, by living to old age on a diet of which butter was a staple item.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to co-ordination of our food industries.  We have had one meeting so far on this subject and the format would be to try to co-ordinate what is happening in fisheries, agriculture, industry and trade, to ensure that all Departments would be working towards a cohesive food policy without duplication.  We must see that the frighteningly large expenditure in the budget on our food industry is used to the best advantage, without duplication in marketing or research.  There are many problems relating to more than one Department. For instance, there is at the moment a bread subsidy, but that benefits imported flour.  The Department of Agriculture think that subsidy should rather relate to Irish wheat.  We are told by another Department that there might not be enough money to go around to give an adequate subsidy.  These difficulties must be ironed out to ensure that, in the context of very high food imports, the Irish housewife will have a continuous supply, in so far as the season allows, of Irish produce at the right price.  Our efforts with regard to exports must be cohesive and to our best advantage.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and give it unqualified support in its passage through the House.  The legislation we are discussing today is important to Bord Bainne for a number of reasons.  These have already been referred to by the Minister in his introduction speech and there is no need to reiterate them.  However, there is one aspect of the Bill which I would like to stress and that is that it represents a formal vote of confidence by the Government in the Irish dairy industry as a whole.  The main function of the Bill is to extend the duration of the State guarantee given to An Bord Bainne for a further six years.  This guarantee has existed since the setting up of An Bord Bainne as a privately owned co-operative society. Prior to that it had been a State-sponsored body, the continued existence of which was incompatible with our EEC <Col N="2047" /> membership.  Now more than ever this vote of confidence is needed and I have no doubt that it will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne is a household name today in Ireland in urban as well as rural areas.  The reasons for this are quite obvious.  As a nation heavily dependent upon agriculture and more particularly on the dairying industry for the creation of wealth, we are all very much aware that when Bord Bainne are doing well, the benefits are shared by all of us.  As the centralised marketing outlets for Irish dairy products, Bord Bainne's performance serves as a barometer for the national dairy industry as a whole.  The readings on this barometer have to date been impressive.  Because we are a net exporter of dairy products, the future of our industry depends on our ability to maintain and to strengthen our hold on the available world market.</P>
    <P>We must realise the importance of the home market, as mentioned by the Minister and reiterated by Deputy Noonan. A vigorous campaign to promote Irish dairy products is very welcome and I do not think we should make any apologies for a deliberate promotion of our products.  We hear a lot about buying Irish; the emphasis should be rather to sell Irish as the British are doing at present with their highly successful Food From Britain campaign.  Some of our cheeses are superior to those of France and Denmark but because they have such a good name we tend to have a hang-up about our products.</P>
    <P>The State guarantee as provided to An Bord Bainne helps them to carry out their task as the centralised exporter of Irish dairy produce.  It helps in a very concrete way by enabling the board bear the very high borrowings necessary to purchase their stock each year, as it is produced mainly during the April-September months, at the same time enabling them to bear the financial costs involved in marketing it evenly throughout the year. The seasonal nature of Irish milk production places great financial strain on the marketing side of the industry and the guarantee given to Bord Bainne helps to bear this strain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2048" /> The dairying industry is today going through an extremely difficult period. This applies to the industry both inside and outside the EEC.  We in Ireland, because of our very high dependence on the dairying industry, are more conscious than most of these difficulties.  We stand to lose at both ends of the industry &mdash; at the production end we would lose substantially if quota based cut-backs and levies were to be applied and at the marketing end if world market outlets continue to contract.  The Government and their Ministers are making every effort at EEC level to ensure that Ireland's dairy industry is allowed to reach its full potential within the terms of the Common Agricultural Policy.  There is need for a certain balance to be restored to the dairy section of the community market.  This is obvious to everybody.  However, we must continue to impress upon our Community partners that this balance cannot be achieved at the expense of Ireland, for whom dairying represents 9 per cent of GNP, provides employment for over 75,000 people and accounted for exports valued at over £725 million last year alone.</P>
    <P>While at EEC level the battle continues we can today on the home front do something very constructive to help our dairy industry.  The continuation of the State Guarantee to An Bord Bainne will contribute to the ongoing successful marketing of our dairy produce on the world market and will at the same time do a great deal to help the industry through this difficult period.  I would, therefore, like to end by once again welcoming this Bill and by urging my fellow Deputies to give it their full support.</P>
    <P>I have agreed with my colleagues that everyone should have an opportunity to speak on this debate and accordingly I have curtailed my time.  I thank the Opposition spokesman for his kind words about the potato co-operative.  In that connection legislation is ready and I will discuss it with Deputies over the next few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate and supporting the extension of the guarantee <Col N="2049" /> to Bord Bainne for another six years.  We have already had a discussion on the pig industry and the Minister said there was a crisis there.  There is also a crisis in the dairy industry; and the problem basically is that we have 1,000 million gallons of milk for manufacture each year which is difficult to utilise.  Our response to the problem has been almost totally negative. We have reacted by converting a higher percentage of that milk into traditional products that nobody wants.  We are manufacturing more butter now than before we joined the EEC and, despite what the Minister of State said about the nutritional value of butter and so on, the public perception of butter is that it is not good for you.  Sales are declining, which support that view.  The Irish dairy industry should not be converting a greater percentage into butter.  Over 80 per cent of milk delivered to creameries is converted into butter.  Bord Bainne are expected to find outlets for this product. Inevitably it goes into intervention and the problem is left for somebody else to solve.  Unfortunately, it is becoming insoluble.</P>
      <P>The other main product as an adjunct of butter is skim milk powder and that also is a product nobody wants.  It is a commodity product, there are about a million tonnes in intervention and the management committee of the Community have great difficulty trying to get rid of it.  However, it uses a large volume of milk and, as such, is attractive to the dairy industry.  It solves many problems for them.  They do not have to worry too much about marketing, for instance.</P>
      <P>I am glad that Bord Bainne have initiated a campaign to set up a fund which should bring in about £5 million per annum to foster research and development, especially market and consumer research.  If we have 1,000 million gallons of milk to process, surely we should find out what the consumers want?  When we have established that, we should sell it in a positive fashion.  There is no use in screaming for protection, although I know we need some.  I support the Luxembourg compromise or veto, whatever you like to call it, to defend the Irish position against the super-levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2050" /> It is insulting to Irish farmers, the dairy industry and those who market it to realise that £40 million of dairy products are imported every year.  Our market is written off as being too small, but we could do a lot more in that area.  For example, we took up the school milk programme recently but even then it was in a halfhearted fashion.  No co-operation was sought with the school authorities or the Department of Education, and unfortunately, it is now a lame duck operation.</P>
    <P>We have a number of outstanding examples where individual dairies and individual processors looked beyond the farm gate and beyond intervention, did their market research and development and found very remunerative products. The Minister of State mentioned cream liqueurs.  In Ballineen in west Cork we have a dairy, Carbery Milk Products, who are an example and a showpiece not only to Ireland but to the entire dairy world.  I was glad, as I am sure everybody else was, a few months ago to read in the newspapers that Carbery Milk Products in association with a number of other firms in Cork had landed a very valuable contract in the United States of America to sell new technology for the development of dairy products and to provide the factory and the facilities as well.  If we are world leaders in that area, why can we not transfer that expertise to the whole national scene?</P>
    <P>In another part of Cork, in Imokilly, we have the production of Italian-type cheeses and about £5 million worth was exported last year to the Middle East.  In Waterford we have the franchise arrangement with Yoplait Yogurt.  More recently the Town of Monaghan Co-Op have had the franchise arrangement producing Móna new products.  They are the kind of developments we need, rather than taking the cowardly attitude and looking for all sorts of protection.  If we continue in a positive fashion and if support is given to An Bord Bainne for a development fund, we can utilise the increased production which we hope we will have over the next few years and also convert a larger and larger share of the 1,000 million gallons of milk available for processing into high added-value products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2051" /> We have a number of constraints.  In a recent Bord Bainne publication they emphasised the problem of seasonality of production.  That is no constraint at all. I am surprised that Bord Bainne should use that old excuse for problems in the industry.  Over the past two years there was a fantastic increase in sales of cream liqueurs.  One of the major exporters of cream liqueurs, Virginia Milk Products, went as far as west Cork looking for milk to supply that industry in the winter time. They offered a premium for the production of winter milk.  The response was outstanding and they were offered much more than they required.  Unfortunately, due to the contraction of sales in recent times, the farming community have to use other outlets.</P>
    <P>There was no constraint on production. The farming community have demonstrated over and over again that, if they are paid for their products, they will produce them.  To talk about a 16:1 ratio of winter milk production as against a summer peak production as an excuse is negative.  I should like encouragement for a reduction of this peak to be given because of the problems it creates in the winter time with staff being let off and valuable equipment lying idle, the difficulty of making certain products at particular times of the year, late lactation milk and early lactation milk causing chemical problems and making it almost impossible to make some sophisticated products.  I encourage Bord Bainne at least to look for an extension at both ends of the season, earlier calving and a continuation at the back end of the season as well.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that about 25 per cent of the cows in Ireland calve after 1 April. If that date could be brought forward to 1 February it would increase the amount of milk available by about 60 million gallons. That additional milk would be available for processing and we could make better use of the facilities, equipment and personnel in the whole industry.</P>
    <P>The importance of the dairy industry to the whole economy is much more than just the processing end of it, because it has a regional significance.  People are <Col N="2052" /> employed directly in factories and creameries, but every supplier benefits from the industry as well.  In particular in rural areas it has a very valuable spin-off effect.</P>
    <P>If I might refer again to west Cork, in the last two censuses of population the most outlying peninsular areas, including the area from which my friend Deputy Sheehan comes, have shown an increase in population.  Part of the reason for that is the outstanding contribution which Carbery Milk Products in particular are making to the economy not only of the area where the factory is located but the entire dairy farming community in the whole of west Cork.</P>
    <P>A number of other aspects of the dairy industry are used as excuses for our poor performance.  One is the low solids content of milk.  In a recent IFA survey one might be excused for believing that the method of testing was responsible for our apparently low solids content of milk.  It is factual to say that the solids content of Irish milk is less than the Danish or Netherlands supply, mainly because we are not breeding for higher solids milk, or we are not testing or paying for milk supplied to creameries for anything other than butter fat.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that a number of our more progressive co-ops are tending to pay for milk not only on a butter fat basis but also on protein and lactose.  I would not like to see a development which at least one major co-op are suggesting, that is, payment for milk on a volume basis. That would be a very dangerous development for the dairy industry.  As everybody knows, milk contains 87 per cent water and you are only interested in the 12.5 or 13 per cent solids.  If you are not testing or paying for those solids, how can you have breeding programmes and how can you encourage people to have a better quality and higher constituents of milk?  With energy costs so high, the higher the solids content the less will be the energy costs for producing a ton of butter, or a ton of powder, or whatever else.</P>
    <P>Also, the Irish farmer receives about 85 per cent of the target price as against a much higher percentage in some of the more advanced dairy industries because <Col N="2053" /> of our low product conversion ratio.</P>
    <P>Another disappointing aspect of the industry is the poor uptake of product development grants made available by the IDA.  Several million pounds have been spent in the industry on the provision of new buildings and machinery in recent years.  The amount of money and the number of grants taken up for product development have been negligible. That is a tragedy.  Possibly the IDA are to blame to some extent.  Up to very recently they had no great concern for the food industry.  They had no section dealing with the food industry.  In the past 12 months they have restaffed and strengthened that section of the IDA.  I hope that in future they will have personnel and especially food technologists, not only in Dublin but throughout the country and particularly in Munster.  There are some outstanding co-ops in the Munster area with the IDA headquarters in the South Mall in Cork.  The minimum they would need is a section dealing with the food industry.</P>

      <P>They may not have been published but they were outlined in full two weeks ago in the <i>Financial Times</i> in an article by Nobel economics prize winner, Samuel Britten, so I am surprised, if that particular newspaper had the proposals in full, that they are not available to the Government.  Basically the proposals, are to try to achieve some form of smoothening of changes within the EMS.  Will the Minister make it his business to study the proposals?  Does he agree in general that exchange rates stability is desirable?  If the Minister has not actually seen the proposals will he have a look at them to see if they can contribute to exchange rate stability? Other countries seem to feel that they can contribute to exchange rate stability. We have had seven or eight devaluations in the EMS and these proposals offer a way whereby we can avoid that situation in future.  Will the Minister have a look at them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a little difficulty here because I am in a position to say to the Deputy that the proposals were not outlined in full in the article to which he refers.  With regard to his specific question, I agree with the Deputy that exchange rate stability is not only desirable but essential for the orderly conduct of business, particularly within the European Community.  I have been concerned to ensure the maximum stability in exchange rates and specifically in our effective exchange rate.  I have some doubts about some of the particular proposals which apparently have been put forward by Professor Meade, but on the general objective of stability in exchange rates with the qualification of effective exchange rates I am in agreement with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the continuing absence of Britain and the British currency from the system is putting pressure on the system and on the member states, as happened last year in our case when the Government devalued our currency within the EMS to achieve a realignment of our relationship with sterling?  Would the <Col N="2058" /> Minister agree that it is vitally important in any discussions which take place that Britain is encouraged in the strongest possible way to join the system?  Would he be able to comment on the progress that has been made towards establishing the ECU as the basic unit of currency within the system, which is in fact the second chapter of the proposal for the EMS introduced some years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to the Deputy on previous occasions here, I would consider it highly desirable if we could arrive at a point where the pound sterling could be brought within the EMS.  As I also said to the Deputy on previous occasions, we have made it as clear as we could, in the discussions that have been going on in regard to the system, that this is a result we would wish to see.  It is not, as the Deputy appreciates, a result which we on our own can bring about.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of his question about progress towards the second stage of EMS, this, in my view, has been regrettably slow.  There is an ongoing discussion and examination of measures that could be applied in order to bring us to the point where we would progress to the second phase of EMS; but the matter to which the Deputy first referred, the position of sterling, is a fairly substanial stumbling block on the road to making that transition.  I agree with the Deputy that the position of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EMS has created some difficulty for us in the past and our management of exchange rate policy has been designed as far as we can to offset those effects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister acknowledging the difficulty that has been created for us.  In view of that acknowledgement that it poses for us, particularly all member states in the system, a grave problem, as was evident last year when we had to realign within the EMS because of the Government's stated intention to reduce the value of our currency against a currency outside the system, will the Minister try to win every possible support from his colleagues to ensure that the stability of the system, <Col N="2059" /> the purpose of the system and the cohesion of economic and monetary stability in Europe, which is central to all this, is brought to bear particularly on the British Government as a matter of urgent priority, otherwise the possibility of achieving any of the aims of the system cannot be realised?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the House what my feelings on the matter are and what the Government's feelings are in relation to the basket of currencies that are actually in the EMS.  I am sure the Deputy will understand if I tell him that I do not want to go any further in being specific publicly about the efforts we will make.  I believe we are agreed on the desirability of bringing about the kind of change in the system to which he refers.  I am sure the Deputy will also agree that there are some parts of the effort which are probably best not conducted in public.  I believe we are agreed essentially on the objective.  That was reflected in the action we took last March, which, as I said then and I repeat now, was based on our particular concern with bringing about the result we need in terms of our effective exchange rate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he estimates that unemployment will exceed 225,000 in 1984; and the cost to the State of every 1,000 persons becoming unemployed in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the second part of the question, I assume that the Deputy is referring to the average cost of social welfare unemployment payments made by the State in respect of every 1,000 <Col N="2060" /> persons who register as unemployed in 1984.  On the basis of the published estimates for the Public Service, the estimated cost in question is £2.47 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the figures released in the last few days showing an increase in one month of over 7,000 unemployed does the Minister still hold to his budget figure of 225,000 unemployed?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>How can the Minister explain that?  At the time of the budget when the average figures were projected for the year the Minister stated that there was already a significant downward trend in unemployment.  Within three weeks the Government acknowledge that the latest figure is disturbing.  Is it not clear on that basis that the figure of 225,000, the average projected from official sources as the Minister said at budget time, is much less than what the average will be in view of what the Government themselves have now acknowledged to be a disturbing post-budget trend that they obviously had not contemplated at budget time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing I can do about that.  You come half-way to having that kind of problem yourself but you will never get the rest of the way.  The disturbing feature that has emerged are the figures for one month.  It is not a disturbing trend.  I remember Deputy O'Kennedy about this time last year objecting to my use of the trend in figures for several months as being unrepresentative of the trend.  In the event he turned out to be right.  However, that is water under the bridge.  I have not said at any stage that there is a downward trend in unemployment.  I have said over the past few months, and it is still the case this month, that we have a downward trend in the rate of growth in unemployment. That gives me no joy but there is a downward trend in the rate of increase in unemployment.  The figure on which the provision for the expenditure of the Department of Social Welfare is based, as the Deputy knows, is taken within a range of figures.  It is a mid-point in a range.  The range is what we expect will be the case during the course of 1984. The figure could turn out to be a little below or above that.  My conclusion on the basis of an analysis of the figures as they have emerged in the last month is that the kind of range we have based our figures on is about what we can forecast reliably for 1984.</P>

      <P>A final supplementary. Would the Minister recognise that the Government in their official statement and the Taoiseach yesterday indicated clearly that the January figures <Col N="2062" /> were, in the words of the Taoiseach, demonstrating a sharp increase in the rate, and in the words of the statement, a disturbing growth in unemployment.  Will he acknowledge that they represent something that apparently he did not expect when the budget was being framed when he indicated that the trend was downward?  In view of that, will the Minister acknowledge that the official estimates must be influenced by the impact of the budgetary policy on employment &mdash; or unemployment?  Will he acknowledge that it is time to review some of the provisions in the budget which we will come to in the Finance Bill to give rise to increased investment leading, one would hope, to falling unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Deputy is under a misapprehension.  Neither I, the Taoiseach nor any other spokesman for the Government has said at any stage that the trend in unemployment is downward. We have said, and it is still the case, that the rate of increase in the numbers unemployed is moderating.  As I have said, it gives me no pleasure to say that, but the rate of increase in unemployment is moderating.  On that basis the figures released the other day to us gave me no reason to change my overall forecast for 1984.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the task force in unemployment should bring forward some proposals pretty quickly.  They were set up apparently almost 12 months ago and there is no sign of any recommendation that I can see coming from them.  I put a question to the Taoiseach yesterday and he informed me, as far as I can remember, that they were considering what proposals they might bring forward.  Would the Minister tell the House that he will ask that task force to bring forward their proposals to tackle this emergency in the short term?  Finally, will he agree that perhaps we are all taking what is happening in this country at the moment just a little too lightly?  Unemployment in Europe is about 10 per cent and it is 16 per cent here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, despite the trend, if we have 7,000 unemployed every month for the rest of the year, which I know he does not want to contemplate, his figures by the end of the year will be 300,000 which is 75,000 above what he put in his budget? I do not want to contemplate that either. Is he taking this seriously enough?  Are the Government taking it seriously? Where are the task force and when will they bring in their recommendations?</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan yesterday travelled his question about the task force reasonably well.  It is not the case that the task force have not yet announced any initiative of any kind.  They made a statement last July which referred to a number of measures which have begun to have effect.  I mention only one which I think is important.  The Government last year made provision for an enterprise allowance scheme, with which I think the Deputy is familiar, which has turned out to be a valuable initiative in this area and we are now considering what improvements we can make in the scheme in order to build up on the evident willingness <Col N="2064" /> of many people now unemployed to get back into gainful employment on their own account.  It is important that we encourage people in that respect.</P>

There is ample evidence in the general economic policy of the Government, and in this year's budget, that we are concerned with that.</P>

      <P>The pilot publication of comprehensive public expenditure programmes received a very favourable <Col N="2067" /> reaction from interests as varied as employer and farming organisations, management consultants, independent research bodies, and public sector bodies. Useful comments were received from these sources, which my Department will draw on in developing the programme approach.  Work is at present under way in my Department aimed at publishing before the summer recess a document which will extend the programme approach to a wider range of public expenditure than was covered in last year's publication.  It is proposed to present expenditure data for both 1983 and 1984 in this document.  I cannot give the Deputy the date of publication.  It is contingent on work pressures in my own and in other Government Departments preparing the data.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the production of this comprehensive public expenditure programme which has added tremendously to the analysis of public expenditure here.  Is the Minister telling the House that the Department are getting word back that this has been a success and that he will move as quickly as possible to present the budgetary figures, mainly the expenditure figures, programme by programme as opposed to the existing method?  It is a valuable document and the sooner the House has it the better so that we can analyse public spending programme by programme and decide the programmes that are useful.</P>

      <P>In answer to Parliamentary Question No. 15 on 17 November I drew the Deputy's attention to the reply given by the Taoiseach to Parliamentary Question No. 7 on 19 October 1983.  I should like to remind the Deputy of the answers given by the Taoiseach yesterday in response to related questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> As indicated in October and yesterday, the National Planning Board are working on a draft medium-term plan for the economy which will provide the framework within which short-term economic and social planning will proceed.  I understand that the draft plan will be available to the Government by the end of March next.  The Government will then be in a position to produce a medium-term planning framework which will set out the kinds of action needed to attain national objectives.  It would be premature to say when this will be published but it is hoped that it will be earlier rather than later this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated publicly that the budget should not be over-emphasised as an instrument of economic policy, that there are broader issues of policy outside of it and I should like to know if he will acknowledge that it is high time we had a comprehensive plan for national renewal and development. It is time we had that plan, particularly in relation to, for instance, the development of our resources &mdash; agriculture, fisheries, forestry &mdash; and the necessary expenditure to develop these resources.  A comprehensive plan for investment in education in this era of technology is also necessary.  Those obvious and self-evident things will not be dealt with in a budget and may not be covered in the considerations being made by the various committees.  Will the Minister acknowledge that it is vital that we do this work immediately to give a signal to our people of the general direction of the Government?  In the absence of that our people are waiting and wondering what the opportunities are for renewal and development.  Will the Minister ensure that such a comprehensive plan is prepared as a matter of extreme urgency so that people can respond to it, if it has some positive elements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been as clear as anybody could wish me to be about the Government's intention to produce during the course of the year, earlier rather than later, a medium-term comprehensive plan which will set out the <Col N="2070" /> direction in which we need to go and which will set out the way in which we should deal with our problems.  As I informed the Deputy during the course of an aside on the Order of Business yesterday, it will be one on which the Government will not turn their backs a couple of months after its publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wishes to engage in such point scoring he can do so but he has responsibility.  Will the Minister recognise that the key to such a plan will be to improve the climate for investment? Will the Minister agree that the rise in unemployment is directly linked to the fall in investment?  The Minister must recognise that we must have a clear direction from the Government as to how to encourage investment.  In that connection I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a statement from a churchman which appears in today's newspapers.  I am not saying that churchmen are experts but when one feels obliged to say that the jobs problem is linked with the exodus of capital from Ireland we must take note.  I hope the Minister does not accuse that churchman, as he accused me yesterday, of undermining confidence in the country. Does the Minister not agree that it is vitally important to improve the investment climate by tax incentives, to give signposts to the efforts to deal with the pressing question of unemployment? Will the Minister tackle the fall in investment as a major priority in the plan he has been talking about?</P>

      <P>I cannot add anything to what I have said now and on other ocasions about the medium-term plan which we propose to bring forward.

      <P>The Deputy can be sure that when the Government produce a medium-term plan there will be every opportunity for a full discussion on it in the House.  As the Taoiseach told the Deputy yesterday, this is a medium-term plan and it would be inappropriate to bring forward now, in the extreme pressure of circumstances, any part of that plan to respond to short-term difficulties, particularly when we have already in hand arrangements for responding to the maximum of our capacity to short-term exigencies as they appear.</P>

      <P>Why has the number of people employed in the National Parks in Killarney and Letterfrack been reduced?  Why is no superintendent employed in the Phoenix Park?  There was a reduction of two people in the National Park in Killarney and another two in Letterfrack.  The condition of the Phoenix Park has deteriorated considerably. What is the reason for that?  Is it because there are fewer people employed <Col N="2076" /> or the fact that there has been no superintendent there for the past six months?</P>

      <P>The reduction in the numbers employed is due to a number of reasons but the main one is the Government embargo.  Before we have an argument about that, Fianna Fáil when in office also adopted that policy. In Glenveagh the posts are of a supervisory nature.  It is intended to employ a superintendent in the Phoenix Park.  An offer was made to an employee in that range of national parks and we hoped to fill the vacancy in that way.  However, it has not proved successful and we are now asking the Civil Service Commissioners to hold interviews.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that when this matter was raised in the Dáil some months ago I brought to his notice the fact that our greatest national park, indeed the greatest national park in Europe, was without a superintendent?  The number of people employed, notwithstanding the ever-increasing use of the Phoenix Park, has been reduced.  In raising this matter does he accept that his hand might be strengthened in bringing to the notice of the Government the national disgrace that exists in what should be our greatest national amenity?  Does he offer any hope that it will not be turned into a derelict site?  That is what is happening.</P>

      <P>That is a separate question.  I am aware of it.  We thought the appointment of a superintendent for the Phoenix Park would be filled by way of a promotion.  We believed a very suitable person was offered the position but it did not work out for various reasons. We are not taking steps to fill the vacancy.  I do not accept that the park is becoming a derelict site.  I was in it recently.  Dublin Corporation are carrying out major works there and it may <Col N="2077" /> look bad.  I was often in the park many times when I was younger.  It is in excellent condition.  I do not accept the Deputy's allegation that it is becoming a derelict site.</P>

These are fine examples but I do not think there are immediate plans to create any more.  We have reorganised the work force in the park's section and we are confident that we are doing just as good a job with this very slightly reduced work force as has ever been done.  We hope to open Glenveagh National Park to the public this year. Extra people were taken on there.  Posts had to be filled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the reduction in the number of people employed in arterial drainage and I am asking the Minister to take steps to have reinstated in their jobs those people who have been laid off.  Arterial drainage is very important in terms of agriculture and we are losing EEC funds by not having people employed in this area at this stage.  The work is funded by the EEC to the extent of 50 per cent so it is a disgrace to reduce the number of employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that agencies such as the Board of Works who are in a position to create employment should be doing so at a time of recession?  Would the Minister agree also that plans have been drawn up for a large scheme in the Border area and would he take steps to have work on that <Col N="2079" /> scheme commenced now so as to provide employment in that region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my belief that drainage should be carried out on an economic basis.  If there arises a situation in which a drainage scheme is run down, I would not consider it proper to continue to employ people on the scheme just for the sake of keeping them at work.  To act in that way would be to make a case against drainage because one would then be spending on drainage money that was surplus to the requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another argument but I am speaking about undertaking drainage work in a proper manner. The question of schemes of work is a different one but drainage should be undertaken on the most economic basis possible and should not be considered in terms of a grant-in-aid for the creation of employment as such.</P>

      <P>Regarding the second part of Deputy Leonard's question, it is not the fault of anyone on this side of the Border that the Blackwater drainage scheme has not been started. We have gone as far as we can go in that respect.  We provided in the Estimates the moneys that we were required to pay to the northern authorities who must drain the river on their side of the Border so as to allow us to drain the Blackwater on our side.  The money has been spent elsewhere but in this year's Estimate we are providing £1.6 million for payment to the Northern authorities.  I understand that they are commencing work in March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained, we had intended starting the Blackwater scheme but it has not been possible to do so.  That scheme would provide more employment.  Regarding the other schemes, 90 per cent of the Boyne scheme has been completed while in regard to the Boyle and the Bonet, we will be taking on extra hands.  I am sure that at that stage those people who have been laid off will be considered if they find it suitable to work in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the need for arterial drainage works so as to allow field drainage to be undertaken, will the Minister not consider it important that more money be spent on arterial drainage and more employment provided in that way?  The Minister must realise the importance of field drainage to agriculture which is our major industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the Boyne scheme for instance is completed to the extent of 90 per cent.  In <Col N="2081" /> such circumstances it is not posible to keep gainfully employed as many men as had been working on the scheme.  The Maigue scheme is completed to the extent of 80 per cent while the Corrib-Mask-Robe scheme is completed also to the extent of 80 per cent.  Obviously, in respect of these free schemes there is a normal run down in the employment content. There is reduction in the Estimates in the total area but that will have the effect of prolonging employment for those still in employment.  It will cut down output on the drainage but for the bulk of those employed on the schemes, employment will be prolonged by possibly another year.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(g) to foster, assist and aid projects of community involvement and activity, and to facilitate the mobilisation of self-help particularly in communities in which there is a high <Col N="2105" /> degree of poverty and social deprivation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A somewhat similar section was included in the National Community Development Agency Act.  For a Government, and particularly the Labour Party, who say they are committed to the socially deprived and to those who suffer poverty, I am surprised this section was left out in the legislation before the House.  I am asking the House to agree to have this section included in the Bill because it will help different groups, for example women's groups, those who wish to organise play groups, personal development, it would help youth involvement, itinerants and so on.</P>

      <P>I regret I am unable to accept the amendments proposed by Deputy O'Hanlon for the reasons I have already given during the Second Stage debate.  I explained that the National Social Service Board was intended specifically to assist the development of social services and I strongly feel we need a new separate statutory body if we are to work in the specific direction of developing our social services structures.  As I have already indicated in relation to the combat poverty question, I am in the process of re-establishing the combat poverty organisation.  Deputy O'Hanlon's amendments come more appropriately within the ambit of that body and a memorandum has been circulated to various Government Departments in relation to the combat poverty organisation and final observations are being received.  I will be going to the Government with these observations within the next few weeks and I hope to have this cleared in the very near future. For these reasons, and bearing in mind that the thrust of this legislation is to establish the National Social Service Board on a firm statutory basis, I regret I am unable to accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he intends establishing the combat poverty organisation.  We know from experience that there was an appalling overlapping <Col N="2106" /> of the work being done by the local community associations with the result that a number of associations were in complete disarray.  When we are talking about the National Social Service Board we are mainly concerned with the community associations rather than the poverty association. I served on the National Service Council, which was more or less working in an advisory capacity rather than giving directions to various community associations. In Cork we had sad experience with the poverty group overlapping and interfering with the work of the local community associations.  Deputy Desmond was not Minister at that time, but he must have some information of the number of representations made from local community associations, together with the central community association, about this appalling overlapping and obstruction of the work of the local community associations.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly hold the view that there is a need for a separate role for the National Social Service Board.  Deputies are aware of the specific functions of the board as outlined &mdash; questions of accessibility to social services, the co-ordination of social service delivery, the development of information and advice in relation to social services giving assistance to other local communities to help them in setting up voluntary social services.  All these aims are quite specific but the broader question of alleviating poverty and doing research into poverty in the community in any part of the country is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Social Service Board never intended to get into the area of pilot projects or research projects on poverty questions, for example, dealing with the international aspects of poverty, matters of emigration, poverty among certain groups within the community and so on. All those issues are not germane to the functions of a National Social Service Board.  Under section 4 I have provided reasonable expansion of the functions of that board in relation to other voluntary <Col N="2107" /> agencies, and that is as far as we should go.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sound unduly caustic about the previous body but it was a bit of a hybrid.  It attempted to do everything and ended up being responsible for virtually nothing.  It encompassed too great a range of activity.  For some reason which I have never been able to fathom, the Leader of the Opposition and his spokesman, Deputy Woods, had a terrible aversion to combat poverty questions, probably because they emanated from this side of the House, particularly the Labour Party.  To overcome that aversion the National Community Development Agency was proposed.  I do not think it was particularly successful or if there was any real heart behind that approach.  I have spoken to people in this area who have no axe to grind or who are not politically motivated, and they assured me that what most people want is to see the National Social Service Board established on a statutory basis, to give it a chance to get its life together and to get the staff working delivering information services, setting up local community social service councils, assisting them and so on.  They will have additional functions now.  I would hope that the agency would be able to give considerable assistance to the National Council for the Aged.  I have asked them to help out and co-ordinate the work of that body.  The Bill is very specific and does not lead to any confusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister but he did not explain why it was necessary to delete these sections from the National Community Development Agency Act.  The Minister went on to talk about his view and that the Leader of our party was not committed to the Combat Poverty Agency.  It is important to recognise one or two facts.  The first is that the EEC-aided Combat Poverty Agency was complete in 1977.  It was funded by the Fianna Fáil Government when the Leader of our party was then Minister for Health.  That is an indication of his commitment, as indeed is all the social legislation he introduced in this <Col N="2108" /> House during the time he was Minister and did something positive for the less well off in our society.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the features of the present Government's commitment to the less well off, with this latest 7 per cent increase for those in receipt of social welfare benefits and assistance this year and the 8 per cent VAT imposition on clothing which will affect the poorer sections of our community.  I do not want to go into that line of argument now.  But I should have liked the Minister to have given us some reasons why this paragraph should not be included in the Bill, as to why a combat poverty element should not be incorporated.  After all two years ago this House passed the National Community Development Agency Bill.  Last year £2,250,000 were allocated to be spent on this specific work to alleviate poverty in the community and in helping community development.  It should be pointed out that £1.8 million of that amount was left unexpended.  Five hundred thousand pounds of it was given to voluntary bodies through the health boards.  The Minister has not advanced any good reason today why these amendments should not be incorporated in this Bill.  Had he allowed the National Community Development Agency to function for one or two years and then come in and said to the House, &ldquo;Look, I have seen this agency in operation and I am not satisfied with the way it operates&rdquo;, he could have confidently stood up and told the House that he had a certain view on it.  The National Community Development Agency was in existence all of last year, it was not allowed function.  Now the Minister tells us it was a hybrid organisation. We do not know how it would have turned out.  I hold the view that it would have turned out very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about poverty, about pilot projects on poverty, about research into poverty and then particular groups that suffer from poverty.  Let us take the elderly as an example.  Apart from all of the statutory bodies involved in the care of the elderly, there is the National Council for the Aged and the National Social Service Board.  The <Col N="2109" /> National Council for the Aged will be independent of the National Social Service Board.  Now the Minister tells us we will have further legislation to deal with the combat poverty element.  Surely the point Deputy Wyse made earlier about overlapping is an indication to us in this House of good legislation not being allowed to work.  Now we are introducing further legislation which, in all probability, will have the effect of overlapping with existing legislation.  I see no reason why this amendment should not be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment put forward by Deputy O'Hanlon which would meet the needs the Minister seems to feel exist.  I was questioned in the House in the early days of the establishment of the Combat Poverty Agency. That agency did achieve many satisfactorily results on some of the projects they initiated.  Certainly one would have to question some of the activities of the combat poverty group when one sees them involved in schemes encouraging farmers to fatten lambs down in Castletownbere, or involved in projects organising the setting up and selling of newspapers and newsletters in certain areas.  The importance of such projects would have to be justified in the combating of poverty if one were to be satisfied that a combat poverty team was to be successful.  It is important that we identify the problems obtaining.  There is nobody better qualified to do so than the people involved in community activities already, people involved in the existing social services arrangements or those with the statutory responsibility in health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment put forward by Deputy O'Hanlon will meet what the Minister is trying to achieve and, at the same time, avoid any overlapping.  This will ensure that we will not have, as in many aspects of industry, numerous bodies promoting the same projects and ideas and endeavouring to tackle the same problems.  We can have an effective National Social Service Board which, in conjunction with voluntary organisations, can identify the areas most in need of attention.  We do not want to have a <Col N="2110" /> repetition of overlapping and added bureaucracy onto an already over-burdened bureaucracy.  This amendment can meet the needs of this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must labour this point with the Minister.  I do not think the Minister replied to the point I was endeavouring to convey to him.  We should examine the basic principle of community services councils and how they commenced from their inception. They were people getting together, carrying out a proper assessment of the needs of their community.  Once established then they set up a structure to cater for those needs.  That is the basic principle of such community services councils in our part of the world or, indeed, anywhere such services operate.  We have agreed on this.  The Minister tells us then that, with the aid of the National Social Service Board in helping people to establish this structure, there is another structure which we might call the combat poverty one.  It is difficult to understand this.</P>
      <P>Every Minister, since the inception of community services council boards has had experience of the two bodies working against one another, the cost involved, with a complete overlap of their respective functions.</P>
      <P>Here I am not being political because we should forget about political involvement &mdash; I am not indulging in any political dialogue this afternoon; I am endeavouring to say to the Minister, in the interests of all concerned to please forget about establishing a structure if he intends establishing another one later.  It will lead to utter confusion.  The people best able to serve their communities are those living within those communities.  As the Minister knows, there were people operating this combat poverty project who were not members or had not come from a given area.  For example, in Cork I understand there was one person from Dublin.  One might well ask what on earth would he or she have in common with the needs of a community in the city of Cork? However, that is beside the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to let me know now what he has in mind regarding the combating of poverty.  We are now talking <Col N="2111" /> about a second structure and we have already enough confusion about the many existing structures.  Not alone are we going to have a National Social Service Board, but later on another similar organisation under a different name. I fear no contradiction in advising the Minister in his own interest to contact the various health boards on the whole question of the two structures we are now discussing.  They will know from their experience of the two groups working against one another and depriving of important services the community they are supposed to be serving.  What exactly has the Minister in mind as regards the terms of reference of the combat poverty group which he promises to establish later on?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I both agree and disagree with the last speaker.  I would not fault the proposed amendment.  The Deputy is confusing two very different jobs.  I welcome the proposed legislation to establish statutorily a National Social Service Board which is doing excellent work of a particular kind, of which a great deal more is needed.  In their task of developing an extensive social services network throughout the country they have much to do and would benefit from being statutorily established.</P>
      <P>The kind of work needed in the poverty area must be undertaken by a separate organisation in a wholehearted, concentrated and full fashion.  This is a problem which is radically different from being involved with the surfaces of the problem in our society and needs a deep examination of root causes.  There are areas which need national policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies underestimate the work which is needed if they see the National Combat Poverty Agency as simply a repeat of the activities undertaken by the National Social Service Board.  One of their most important roles must be a fundamental examination of Government policy areas such as accounting policies and educational policies, which need to be examined from the roots, and for overall changes to be made in how money is spent and how many areas are <Col N="2112" /> approached.  As well as work being needed on the ground there is certainly work needed at Government level.  The National Social Service Board have a different job to do and they have been setting about it very well in their informal existence.  I hope that they will continue to expand and develop.  The Minister has shown wisdom in ensuring that the chairman of the National Social Service Board is now chairman of the Review Body from which the proposals will come for the programme to combat poverty.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker's comments about duplication are valid and there is a lot to be learned from the experience of the previous pilot programme.  It is important that those lessons be learned and the same mistakes not made again. Nobody is more suited to being aware of those pitfalls than the person who was head of the National Social Service Board and who would have been aware of the problems of individuals with whom the council were experiencing difficulty in working on the pilot projects.  In learning from that experience the Minister is going about things in the right way and we need separate organisations.  The problem is too big and essentially too different to be tackled by the National Social Service Board which has a particular and important job to do.</P>
    <P>Finally, I totally agree with the last speaker concerning local activities and local projects.  There are local needs and there should be, perhaps not absolutely local people to deal with them but certainly the aims and the targets of local projects should be decided by local people and as far as possible run by local people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, it is fair to say that when the National Social Service Board were in their former state of existence prior to the setting up of the National Community Development Agency the old Combat Poverty Agency was not in existence.  Despite whatever elements of confusion developed at that stage and whatever criticisms might have been levelled at the work of that agency &mdash; and undoubtedly there was some <Col N="2113" /> degree of confusion and lack of co-ordination &mdash; nevertheless, even with those defects it could hardly be said that they cut across the work of the National Social Services Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I, perhaps more than any other Minister so far with this portfolio, am adamantly opposed to setting up quangos either on the economic or on the social side.  I shall ensure that there are quite clear functional and operational differences between those bodies in their work.  I consulted with the Commission on Social Welfare prior to the setting up of the proposed combat poverty organisation, have received their views and have taken these into account in the preparation of the memorandum to Government.  I share the view that we should go ahead and establish the National Social Service Board on a separate statutory basis with the limited specific functions they have here.  I say to my colleague, Deputy Wyse, as a Corkman who came to Dublin and has worked here since 1957, that I see nothing at all wrong <Col N="2114" /> with a Dublin man going to work in Cork. A bit of cross-fertilisation in this country might eliminate a lot of our present parocialism.</P>

      <P>I see no reason why we should withdraw our amendment. Indeed, nothing that the Minister or Deputy Flaherty have said suggests that the National Social Service Board would be better without this amendment included in its legislation.  I believe that there will be overlapping in the coming legislation.  I agree with Deputy Flaherty about the excellence of the chairman of the National Social Service Board.  This is another very good reason for including the poverty element in that board rather than having separate legislation.  I ask the House to accept our amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(h) to draw on and evaluate research on self-help, poverty and social deprivation by third level educational and other bodies, and to promote, and with the approval of the Minister, to engage in, such research from time to time on specific projects.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why this paragraph cannot be included in the Bill.  A similar paragraph was included in the National Community Development Agency Act. It is unfortunate that the Government did not allow that Act to operate over the past year.  If the Government were not <Col N="2117" /> satisfied with the way in which that body were working the Minister should have come into the House and told us that he would like to propose some amendment to the Act.  A sum of £2¼ million was allocated to the National Community Development Agency.  The personnel of that agency are excellent but they were not allowed to operate.</P>
    <P>This paragraph and the paragraph in the previous amendment have been taken out of the National Community Development Agency Act.  A new Social Service Board are being set up and we are promised another Bill setting up a Combat Poverty Agency.  In other words, we will have the expense of two bodies and we believe one body would be well competent to carry out the functions of the National Community Development Agency.  If the proposal contained in the amendment applied to the National Social Service Board, I have no doubt that the board would be competent to evaluate research on self-help, poverty and social deprivation.</P>

      <P>The broad objectives behind the amendment are entirely laudable but the functions outlined in the amendment are not within the framework of the objectives of the board.  I have no doubt that the general operation of the board will highlight a number of the issues raised by Deputy O'Hanlon in the amendment but to give it a formal statutory function would be unwise. While I accept that there is a need to evaluate research on poverty and social deprivation by third level education institutions and other bodies, that work should be done by those bodies without specifically having a formal function under the board.  For those reasons, and those outlined in my reply to the first amendment, I regret I cannot accept that the amendments should be incorporated in section 4.</P>

      <P>There will be a lot of overlapping if we have the National Social Service Board and an agency to combat poverty.  The National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty <Col N="2118" /> recommended in their final report that a national agency should be established. They suggested it should have similar functions to those proposed in the amendment, the co-ordination and dissemination of relevant information to deprived groups regarding their rights and entitlements on a range of issues. That body suggested the provision of specialist resources, advice and assistance to such groups and others engaged in self-help activities, including priming grants and training.  We are anxious that the Bill should have a combat poverty element in it.  If the combat element did not function &mdash; I have no reason to believe it would not &mdash; the Minister could tell the House then that it was necessary to have two groups.  I cannot see any reason why there should be two statutory bodies dealing with this matter.</P>
      <P>The National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty suggested the establishment of a national agency. They did not recommend two bodies. The Minister has not given us any reason why two bodies should be set up.  He should accept our amendment.  The National Community Development Agency should have been allowed function to see if it would be a hybrid organisation, as the Minister described it.  I do not accept that.  It would have been a very effective agency and would have avoided overlap.  The elderly are catered for already by the National Council for the Aged and now the National Social Service Board will look after some of their needs.  We have been promised further legislation on a combat poverty agency.  They will function in addition to the Government Departments.  It is unnecessary at this stage to establish two bodies when it is possible to do the job efficiently with one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand why the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment.  There is no question of giving the board a statutory function.  The board will act in an advisory capacity disseminating information throughout the country.  Statutory bodies are involved already in local community associations.  The Minister is asking the <Col N="2119" /> board to see how best they can involve the different associations in this work. He has a golden opportunity to improve their position because he has a wealth of information in his Department on the development of community councils.  The Minister has an opportunity to perfect the work of the board and the various community associations.  He should not introduce another structure that will cause further confusion and put all the good work done down through the years in disarray.</P>
      <P>Community associations want to be linked to the Department of Health.  It is important that the Department are aware of their needs, their plans and their financial position.  The Minister should not consider a second structure.  Once it is known that there will be a second organisation there will be a complete lack of interest in the various community associations who are doing tremendous work for the old, the physically handicapped and others.  All services are being provided for these by local people.  There is a need for greater recognition of their work.  Our amendment is a guideline for the new board.  The board could not be considered a statutory group because they will act in an advisory capacity to help local associations.  I have had long association with community work projects in Cork City and from my experience it is important that the proposal contained in the amendment is adopted.  The Minister should do everything possible to involve community associations in this work.</P>

      <P>In a debate of this sort we may tend to talk to each other and to be at cross-purposes.  I share some of the sentiments expresed by Deputies Wyse and O'Hanlon but I would refer them to paragraphs (d) and (e):</P>
      <P>(d)  to promote, encourage and assist, whether by means of the provision of financial or material aid, personnel or services or otherwise, in local communities the establishment and development of voluntary social services for those communities,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2120" /> (e)  to promote, develop, encourage and assist, whether by means of the provision of financial or material aid, personnel or services or otherwise, co-operation in relation to social services between boards, and other bodies, established by or under statute and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>The board will encourage and assist and promote.  They will have an opportunity to provide money and therefore to assist some of the desirable objectives outlined by Deputy Wyse in relation to local bodies doing local work well.  When it comes to doing fundamental research on poverty and social deprivation and other broader social issues I am anxious that the board would not be engaged in those areas.  That is work for the proposed combat poverty organisation.  It would be work requiring great intensity and exceptional expertise.  It will be quite separate from the valuable work of the National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>However, it will be part of the board's work to create more public awareness and to disseminate information with that in view.  The board will advise on existing social services.  They will have their hands full in the years ahead.  The work of the board will remove the considerable uncertainty which has bedevilled our social service structure in the past 18 months or two years.  They will be on a firm footing and should quickly be able to settle down to do their work quickly and effectively.</P>
    <P>The amendment, I suggest, would be more appropriately aimed at the combat poverty organisation and I assure the two Deputies that I will be doing my utmost to ensure there will not be duplication and consequent waste of resources because all these issues are widely understood in the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quoted paragraphs (d) and (e) and said they were in line with the sentiments expressed by Deputies Wyse and me.  That just indicates how close the relationship will be between this board and the combat poverty organisation which the Minister <Col N="2121" /> intends to set up: indeed he has made a good case in favour of having just the one organisation.  Is the Minister satisfied with the words &ldquo;to draw and evaluate&rdquo;? If so, would he accept the words, &ldquo;to promote&rdquo;?  We would go along with that. We insist that there is not a need for two organisations, because one would do.  We have many skilled people in the country who would be prepared to serve on such an agency but I doubt if we would have enough of them to staff two agencies, in which case we would lose the benefit of the work of both agencies.  If the Minister accepts the words &ldquo;to promote research&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;to draw on and evaluate research&rdquo; we would be happy.</P>

      <P>Section 4 (1) (c) states:</P>
      <P>to promote . . . the development of services and schemes in local communities for the dissemination of information and advice in relation to social services,</P>
      <P>What is the difference between information and advice in so far as it affects that section?  I have in mind the possibility of overlap with health board functions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is largely to strengthen the section.  Basic information and data are extremely useful but very often there are subjective matters in the delivery of social services and as such giving advice would be of value.  In one of the board's publications, <i>Relate,</i> there is often an interesting analysis of what the services entail and how they might be changed.  It is not as rigid as information might appear to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to be clear on what advice means in the context of the section.  One would not want to see overlap with the functions of the health board or the services they provide at present. We would not want to see community information service centres in competition or conflict with the health boards who have a statutory responsibility to provide such services.</P>

      <P>Section 4 (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by regulations, confer on the Board such functions (in addition to the functions conferred on the Board by subsection (1) of this section) in relation to social <Col N="2123" /> services as the Minister thinks proper or withdraw from the Board any functions conferred on it by the said subsection (1).</P>
    <P>When speaking on the National Community Development Agency Bill, 1982, the Minister was concerned about a similar section in that Bill.  He believed it would interfere with the freedom of the agency.  On that occasion he stated:</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to give the agency powers to engage in programmes and in research, with the approval of the Minister.  This differs greatly from what we propose.  We speak about consultation, not approval, because we believe it is necessary that the agency would have freedom.  Of course we agree they should consult with the Minister, but it is necessary for the agency to have maximum freedom to embark on schemes and programmes without being forced to go to the Minister for approval on all occasions.</P>
    <P>Will this section curtail the freedom of the National Social Service Board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One merit of that section, taken in conjunction with section 25, is that any regulations made under the subsection must be laid before the Oireachtas.  This will give us an opportunity to comment on any changes which the Minister might propose subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  That enabling section will obviate the necessity for constant return to the House with a new Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby appoints Mr. Justin Keating of Bishopland, Ballymore Eustace, County Kildare (who has been nominated in accordance with section 15 of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977, by The Labour Party) to be a representative in the Assembly of the European Communities for the constituency of Leinster in place of Mr. Séamus Pattison who was nominated in accordance with section 15 of the fore-mentioned Act by The Labour Party and who was appointed by Dáil Éireann and who has resigned as a representative in the Assembly with effect from 16th December, 1983.</P>
      <P>I have paid tribute already to Deputy Séamus Pattison, whose work in the Assembly was of unfailing diligence and whose knowledge and understanding of the Social Fund and its potential will stand him in good stead in his current appointment.</P>
      <P>I wish also to say a word about Justin Keating.  I regard him as one who could hardly be better qualified to represent this country in the Assembly of the European Parliament.  A distinguished member of Government from 1973 to 1977, a gifted commentator on public affairs, and a man with a deep and abiding interest in matters political, agricultural, and cultural, he will bring an added dimension to our representation in the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish, too, to take this opportunity to set the record straight in relation to the spurious charge, usually purveyed on occasions such as this, that my party have somehow downgraded the importance of our European representation.  Although Fianna Fáil have frequently levelled this <Col N="2125" /> charge at us in the past, they have never accused their own partners in the European Progressive Democrats, The French Gaullists, of downgrading the importance of the European Parliament, although no fewer than 40 of that party's deputies have occupied the 15 seats held by that party in the lifetime of the Parliament.</P>
    <P>The facts in relation to rotation of seats are these, and it is important that they be clearly understood: The total numbers of changes in the European Parliament has been 102 &mdash; 103 including this proposed change.</P>
    <P>The changes from each member state has been as follows: Belgium, 12; Denmark, two; Greece, four; UK, one; France, 46; and Ireland, seven as of today.</P>
    <P>In the Socialist Group since 1979 there have been 35 changes out of a total membership of 125.  These replaced members who had become: President &mdash; Mitterand of France; Prime Ministers &mdash; Mauroy of France and Craxi of Italy; Commissioner &mdash; Pisari of France; and Ministers in Ireland, France, Italy, Greece and Denmark and ambassadors, Ceann Comhairle, and other positions.  By contrast, the Gaullists, who are Fianna Fáil's partners in the Group of European Progressive Democrats, practice a rotation system known as the Tourniquet system. Under this system every member on their electoral list for the 1979 elections had to sign a declaration that he or she would resign after one year.  In fact 15 French Gaullists were elected in 1979 but 40 members have sat in the European Parliament. The main reasons have been their pledge and party pressure and some of their seats have changed hands five times.</P>
    <P>I am asking the House to accept the nomination I am putting forward today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I should like to make in relation to the proposed appointment of Mr. Keating.  We are now in the position where none of the people elected to represent the Labour Party in Europe is holding a seat in the European Parliament. <Col N="2126" /> In the case of the Dublin area there have been changes on two occasions, while there has been one change in respect of the Munster area and two changes also in so far as the Leinster area is concerned.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste raises the question of the Gaullists in France, but those deputies who were elected in France to represent the Gaullists went before the electorate on the basis that they would be changed each year.  On the other hand those elected in Ireland to represent us in Europe were elected on the basis that, obviously barring death or ill health, they would serve the full five-year term.  It is unsatisfactory that there should be so many changes of our representatives in Europe.  In these circumstances I urge the Government to introduce a more realistic and practical way of replacing people who, for whatever reason, resign their positions.  I understand that at least two alternative systems have been suggested, one being that there would be named substitutes on the ballot paper at election time and another being that the next in line to those elected, irrespective of party allegiance, would replace those who had to resign.  That would be a far better procedure than the one we are adopting whereby a replacement is chosen, first by the political party whose seat is being vacated and then by way of them being brought before the House.  It is not satisfactory that the electorate, having selected people to represent them in Europe, should not have a say as to whom should replace those representatives.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin North-West</i>): I do not have anything personal against Mr. Keating but I do not agree with his methods. Long before he was elected to Dáil Éireann he spent a considerable length of time in presenting a television programme. On that programme he advocated the benefits that would accrue to Ireland as a result of membership of the EEC but strangely, when Mr. Keating joined the Labour Party he and that party canvassed against our joining the Common Market.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin North-West</i>): The point I am making is that Mr. Keating is very inconsistent.  Irrespective of what the Tánaiste says, the entire Labour Party have made a laughing stock of the whole question of our representation in Europe.  Their attitude in this regard can be likened to a game of draught, with one member going and another coming back.  A former leader of the party was an MEP for some time before coming back to take a Dáil seat but he has decided to go forward again for election to Europe.  It is only right that these matters be put on record.</P>

      <P>No more than anyone else here I have no personal antagonism towards Mr. Keating.  He is a former Member of the House and a former member of Government.  During his term in office he was the subject of some criticism, though that might be said of all Minister, but he carried out his duties conscientiously and I am sure he will act in that conscientious way, too, during the brief period in which he will be representing us in Europe.  If any member of the public was asked to name off the top of his head the members of the Labour Party who have been appointed in the lottery within the Labour Party to fill vacancies in the European Parliament I do not think he could do so.  There is no doubt that the perks of the European Parliament were utilised by the Labour Party in a rather unfortunate way.  I hope the people who will be voting in the European elections next June will note the performance of the Labour Party during the past five years.  Apart from anything else we have had very little return for the time the 14 or 16 members&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>So far it is 11 but there are still six months to go.  To say the least their performance in the European Parliament has been lackadaisical and has not brought any particular benefits or credit to their constituencies.  One would have to search very hard to find <Col N="2128" /> any benefits to the Leinster constituency as a result of the efforts of Labour MEPs. We had a rather freakish election five years ago.  Fianna Fáil were in Government and we had various crises with the trade unions so far as bin collections and postal strikes were concerned.  We had a former Labour Minister publicly picketing the office he once held.  Two Labour representatives were returned to the European Parliament and at that time we were told their total commitment was to Europe.  The people assumed this was correct.  As a distinguished Member of this House described it today, they used it as a public convenience and that about sizes it up.  It has been a public lottery within the Labour Party.  They talk about the &ldquo;mercs and perks brigade&rdquo; in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and they are very sanctimonious about it but the Labour Party have used the European Parliament simply as a way of rewarding people who were a little bored doing what they should do, namely, looking after their constituency.</P>

I hope the Labour Party will commit themselves to a number of matters when they put forward their candidates. I hope it will not be a question of a candidate resigning and handing the seat to a pal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa suggested that there should be a list system.  I hope the list system that will be brought in will be acceptable.  I am sure the Tánaiste will agree that it is undesirable that the present <Col N="2129" /> practice should continue.  Ireland cannot remain isolated from the mainstream of European thought from the political, social and economic points of view.  We must be a part of Europe.</P>
    <P>The people who will be elected in June for the Leinster constituency should give a commitment to the concept of the European ideal, something that has been lacking in the commitment from the Labour Party in the past five years.  The people in Dublin deeply regret that lack of commitment to the European ideal and to the concept of European unity on the part of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>In what I have said I hope I have not offended Mr. Keating, a man for whom I have enormous respect.  I am sure that in this short intervening period he will do his utmost on behalf of the people of Leinster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not give one any pleasure to have to deal with this matter. The cynical approach of the Labour Party in swapping seats in the European Parliament has been quite disgraceful.  It has shown utter contempt for the European Parliament.  We have a situation where we have yesterday's men taking up today's posts.  Mr. Keating had virtually retired from politics but he is now reemerging within the Labour Party.  This is evidence of the lack of imagination, policy and of personnel within that party. They are now part and parcel of the Fine Gael Party and they do not have an identity of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Keating is replacing Minister of State, Deputy Pattison, who replaced Deputy Kavanagh in the European Parliament. Mr. Keating is not representative of the people of Leinster.  He did not go before them in the European elections in 1979.  Indeed, he was rejected by his own electorate in the general election and he declined to go forward for the Seanad.  Eventually he turned up as a broadcaster.  He returned to RTE where, seemingly, they had held a place for him in their programme schedule even though they have an abundance of talent.  This is evident from the fact that the programme entitled &ldquo;Keating on Sunday&rdquo; has been replaced by another programme.  The <Col N="2130" /> programme &ldquo;Keating on Sunday&rdquo; served one purpose and one purpose only, namely to promote one of their own friends for a place in Europe.  It is quite evident that RTE have been involved in supporting a candidate for replacing Deputy Pattison as a member of the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>When RTE decided to appoint Mr. Keating as presenter of the programme &ldquo;Keating on Sunday&rdquo; I said in the House that RTE were involved in a political operation with the Labour Party.  Their connection with and friendship for Justin Keating has allowed him to re-emerge as a member of the European Parliament.  The programme was a disaster.  The rating was very low.  I had one opportunity to see part of the programme and I found it the most disappointing programme ever presented on television.  We had this pompous individual presenting his views in such a way that we were not sure if he was a member of the Labour Party or if he was trying to promote himself within the Labour Party for a job.  RTE will have to be very careful when they are appointing yesterday's politicians for jobs because yesterday's polticians in the Labour Party become tomorrow's people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to a replacement of the European Parliament, Brendan Halligan MEP.  At one stage he replaced Deputy Cluskey or was it Deputy O'Connell or was it Deputy Michael O'Leary or some other member?  The Tánaiste might be able to tell who actually served in the Dublin constituency for the Labour Party.  The people elected were Deputy John O'Connell and Deputy Michael O'Leary.  Deputy O'Leary became Minister and resigned from the European Parliament.  Then he jumped the fence and joined the Fine Gael Party.  Deputy O'Connell also jumped the fence and left the Labour Party and at one stage he was replaced by Deputy Cluskey and is now replaced by Brendan Halligan and Senator Flor O'Mahony.  Mr. Brendan Halligan had the audacity to go to the European <Col N="2131" /> Parliament and vote in favour of abortion.  I object to that.</P>

      <P>I am referring to Brendan Halligan who replaced another member of the European Parliament.  Now Justin Keating will be putting forward his personal views in Europe but he was not prepared to put those views before the electorate.  The elected MEPs went before the electorate but Brendan Halligan has disgraced himself in the European Parliament by his vote.  In my view he should be expelled from any political party in this State of which he is a member. I am delighted the Tánaiste has dissociated himself from Mr. Halligan's vote in favour of abortion in the European Parliament because it is a disgrace to this country that one of our members should vote for abortion.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justin Keating's name is before this House for endorsement.  We are not in favour of this kind of approach.  I have nothing against Justin Keating although he served here at one time but in my view he should have gone before the electorate. The jack-in-the-box operation of the Labour Party &mdash; putting them in office, giving them jobs and keeping them in their places &mdash; is wrong.  On 14 June when the European elections are held, the local elections should also take place.</P>

      <P>It is relevant and important. I will confine myself to discussing this motion dealing with the selection of Mr. Justin Keating.  Mr. Keating will be taking his place in the European Parliament because that is what this Government have decided to do.  He will serve as a member of that Parliament for approximately three months before the European elections.  He is being appointed to improve his chances of being elected to Europe on 14 June.  I believe his chances of being elected are very slim because as a member of the Labour Party he will be associated with the disastrous performance of the Labour Party in this Government, a Labour Party conniving with the Fine Gael Government to bring about a situation where there are 45,700 more people unemployed than there were on 14 December 1982.  He will go before the people of Leinster in June but I am giving him a warning that he will be rejected by the electorate in Leinster.  His stay in Europe will be very short.  I wish him a very short trip in Europe.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party is a democratic party and as a member of that party I was approached and asked to consider putting my name forward for Europe.  When Mr. Justin Keating was nominated, and taking into account the calibre of the man who had been a Minister in the Government from 1973 to 1977, the delegates decided by 7-1 that he was the right man for Labour in Europe.  I have no doubt that he will be the best candidate to be put before the Irish electorate for the European elections this year.</P>

    <P>I want to comment on what Deputy Leyden said.  I was surprised that he left himself as open as a 12 foot gate when he mentioned RTE.  I hope I can rig a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme and give Justin Keating as soft a political interview as Deputy Doherty got on the &ldquo;Late Late <Col N="2133" /> Show&rdquo;.  If we can get television broadcasts like that Mr. Justin Keating will head the poll.  Deputy Leyden said Justin Keating was rejected by the electorate in 1977; so were the previous Government.

      <P>I did not intend to contribute to this debate but having heard some of the remarks which have been made, I find it necessary to put the record straight.  It should be made <Col N="2134" /> clear that the replacement procedure going through this House is exactly the same as that put through by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Listening to Fianna Fáil Members, one would think that the system of replacement was &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it was not agreed.  I did not interrupt the Deputy although I felt like it a few times, but I try to be orderly in this House.  The impression is deliberately being created that this system was invented by the Labour Party.  This system was laid down by a decision of this House, put through the House by a Fianna Fáil Minister for the Environment and agreed by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>
      <P>There is not anything being done here which is in any way underhanded, illegal or about which there is any doubt.  It is strictly in accordance with the law of this land, and that is the way it should be.  I did not think it was necessary to put that record straight again.  It is a fact that the European Parliament has questioned that procedure and that proposals are being formulated to amend the legislation in that regard.  But we can have another debate on that when it comes before this House as to whether it is the best kind of system.  That will receive its airing on the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed at Deputy Niall Andrews's remarks.  As a person seeking to be a candidate himself I should have thought he would have acquainted himself at least with what has been going on in the European Parliament in recent years, and had he done so he would not have made the statements he did make. There will be plenty of time for this in coming months.  The record of the Labour Party members of the Socialist group in the European Parliament, their participation at plenary sessions, their involvement at committee meetings, at all other activities, their attendances and votes compare more than favourably with members of Deputy Andrews's party, members who hold a single mandate. <Col N="2135" /> That is a matter of record, not just hearsay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression was being given that because of the system of changes that has gone on here people have suffered in some way.  Indeed there was the impression created that people appointed to these positions by the Labour Party over those years had not attended to their duties in the European Parliament.  These are matters of fact, of record.  I expect those facts will be thrown up in discussion on television, in the newspapers and media generally when the people will be able to form a judgment as to whom and which groups had the greatest input and devoted most attention to their duties.  For example, take the question of employment.  Here again I think it was Deputy Leyden who wanted the election fought on local or on national issues.  Obviously he did not want the election fought on European issues, on how the European Parliament and its various political groupings had approached the problems of unemployment, the major problem not alone for this country but for Europe, and the records of those political groupings in relation to what they proposed about the unemployment problem.  This is what we want debated in the European election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because we are talking here about the record of the members of the European Parliament representing this country in Europe.  That is what this June election is all about.  I know it disappoints the Fianna Fáil Party that there are not local elections being held in order to keep people's minds off the major issues in Europe that were debated, voted on and discussed in depth at the European level.  I am one of those people who fully support the contention that the European elections should be fought without any local or other kind of election taking place simultaneously.  It is time <Col N="2136" /> that people were able to judge the workings of the European Parliament and, above all, the performance of the various people in the Parliament, that the central issue in the European election would not be overshadowed by any issues of a local authority or national nature.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been reference to the proposed candidate, Mr. Justin Keating.  He is an eminently suitable and able person. At one time he was President of the Council of Ministers when Ireland held the Presidency in the mid-seventies.  He is well suited in all respects for that position. There has been reference also to his rejection by the Irish electorate.  I take it such reference is to the loss of his Dáil seat.  It should be remembered that he is not the only member of the European Parliament who failed to regain a Dáil seat.  There are at least two Fianna Fáil members of the European Parliament who were rejected, if one wants to use that term, by the Irish electorate.  But <Col N="2137" /> that, in itself, does not render them any less worthy to be there.</P>

      <P>There seemed in 1979 something sacrosanct about the nominating of Fianna Fáil non-Deputies to stand for the European Parliament.  That obviously was a time when Fianna Fáil were in Government and could not spare the big guns who are now going to be paraded before the people in June of 1984.  The Deputy will also appreciate that because of Deputy Haughey's decision to run for cover in 1981, about 18 months before he was constitutionally required to do so, the Labour Party members of the European Parliament had the choice of representing our party in Government and in its formation.  Like any working politicians, they made a practical choice and are no less people for that.  If Deputy Andrews is successful in his election campaign for Europe, and I wish him well in it, I am sure that if he is offered, in eight or nine years time down the line, the opportunity of participating in Government he will do what any practical working politician would do and he would be rather short-sighted and foolish not to take up an invitation to represent his country in this Parliament and in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa had some comments to make as to the method of selection by the Labour Party.  It may be worth reflecting on the whole question of the method by which The Workers' Party have selected their candidates for the European election, those of them who have been selected or on whom the finger has been put.  At least the Labour Party went through, and at all times go through, a democratic process of having <Col N="2139" /> conventions.  All branches in the Leinster constituency were represented on this occasion.  This will also apply in the course of the forthcoming election.  In stark contrast, The Workers' Party's central executive committee apparently decided that they would nominate the people that they decided to put before the electorate.  Not exactly a lesson in democracy, I might say.</P>
    <P>Just as surely as day follows night, I expected somebody from the Fianna Fáil benches to raise MEP Halligan's choice of vote in the European Parliament. Deputy Leyden, in true character, was the man.  I have been looking at the records in this House over the past 20 or 30 years and there will always be somebody who goes for the bottom, right at base.

      <P>I want to query the Minister on the fact that this section dealing with reviews is limited to cases which were settled by the court, where the terms of commencement of reversionary leases are settled by the court.  Is it the intention, then, where the terms of the lease are settled, not by the court but by agreement between the parties, that in such cases the review provisions enacted would not apply?  That is what the section appears to say and I am a little concerned about that because in all but about 5 per cent of cases agreement in these matters is reached between the parties without the necessity of going to court.  If under this section, in order to achieve the benefits of the review provisions, it was necessary to go to court, the effect that that would have on the court lists would be catastrophic.  I wonder if consideration has been given to that aspect of the matter?</P>

The basis on which the rent which is payable under such leases is determined remains unafected. The procedure would be that if people can agree, they agree.  If they do not agree, they go to arbitration and the arbitrator would be the county registrar. If one party does not agree with the decision of the arbitrator, then the case would go to court.

      <P>then and only then do the review provisions come into claim.  Quite clearly, any landlord who wants to secure his review provision &mdash; which, of course, he will want to do &mdash; will ensure that he goes into court.  That will bring into the courts a great many cases which do not normally go there, for one party &mdash; whether landlord or tenant &mdash; to achieve the benefit of the review situation.  I wonder why, to overcome that, it is not provided that where the terms either are settled by the court or agreement is reached between the parties out of court, the review provisions would apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The necessity for the Bill arises out of the Supreme Court judgement in the Gilsenan case.  It requires that provision be made for rent reviews as closely as possible in line with market practice.  I am advised that rent reviews at intervals of five years would be consistent with market practice. I am therefore proposing in this section that the rent review period in the case of <Col N="2142" /> future reversionary leases should be five years wherever the terms of that lease are fixed by the court.  This is the same rent review period as provided in Part II of the Act of 1980 in occupational tenancies. It is, of course, unnecessary for the legislation to prescribe rent reviews for reversionary leases whose terms are agreed by the parties.  Section 15 proposes to change the law somewhat in regard to rent reviews in occupational tenancies.</P>
      <P>The point that the Deputy is making here, I think, is that it is unnecessary for legislation to prescribe rent reviews for reversionary leases where the terms are agreed between the parties.  This is to meet the difficulty of where terms are not agreed between the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the point that I was making.  The point I was trying to make was that the section limits the right to a rent review to cases where the initial terms were fixed by the court.  It would exclude the cases where the parties reached agreement on terms.  The effect of that would be to induce every landlord to go into court, which would have a disastrous effect on court lists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have followed with increasing concern the rapid deterioration of the situation in Lebanon in the course of the past week.</P>
      <P>Our sympathy goes to the people of Beirut who once again are suffering the consequences of the inability of the various factions and communities in that country to agree on suitable measures for the future government of Lebanon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also concerned that the present crisis will make even more difficult the possibility of achieving such a reconciliation. We can only urge that all parties involved, and in particular those with most influence in the area, will refrain <Col N="2143" /> from actions which would have the effect of further inflaming the situation.</P>
    <P>My Department are in constant contact with our Embassy in Beirut which in very difficult conditions has continued to supply valuable information and assessments of the situation there.</P>
    <P>A small number of Irish citizens remain in Beirut and to the extent possible contact is being maintained with them by the Embassy.  As of 4.15 p.m. this afternoon the First Secretary, Mr. Piaras Mac Einrí, has contacted the 25 known people of Irish birth or extraction and he is satisfied as to their safety.  Even in the present tragic situation we must not lose sight of the wider dangers which the conflict in Lebanon holds for the stability of the region as a whole.  The problems of the Middle East overlap and interconnect. Indeed, Lebanon in recent years has presented in microcosm the wider conflicts of the region.  While the immediate priority must be the alleviation of the suffering of the people of Beirut and Lebanon and the promotion of reconciliation there, it must also be recognised that the long term stability of Lebanon and the region can only be achieved in the context of an overall settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  Irish policy in co-ordination with that of its partners in the Ten remains directed to this goal.  This should also be the objective of the wider international community.</P>
    <P>I understand that the United Nations Security Council may meet soon to consider the most recent developments in Lebanon and the appropriate response which they require.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, Ireland's direct involvement in the situation in Lebanon arises primarily from the participation of our Defence Forces in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.</P>
    <P>The tasks of UNIFIL are confined to Southern Lebanon where it continues to play a valuable and valid role in keeping the peace and protecting the local population. It is worth noting that in all of Lebanon the area patrolled by the UN force is one of the few places where there is relative peace and stability.  The Government remain, as they have always <Col N="2144" /> been, concerned for the welfare of our troops and we shall continue to monitor the situation and ensure that all steps are taken to maintain their safety.  Our latest information is that, unlike that in Beirut, the situation in the south is relatively stable and calm and UNIFIL are continuing to carry out their duties in accordance with the Security Council's mandate.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of portions of the MNF from Beirut may give rise to call for a UN force to help restore and maintain peace in the city.</P>
    <P>While the UN may indeed have a role to play in Beirut, this is a matter in the first instance for the Government of Lebanon and for the UN Security Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation to the Minister and the Government for responding to my request for a statement to the House today on the situation in the Lebanon. We are all deeply conscious of the tragedy that is unfolding by the hour in the Lebanon, a country which was once prosperous and a centre for tourism for that part of the world because it was so attractive in many ways.  The agony of the Lebanon has continued for a long time now and, unfortunately, no end to that agony seems to be in sight.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to visualise how peace can effectively be brought to parts of the region, especially to the capital, Beirut. We should have a very special sympathy for the Lebanese people and should avail of any opportunity that presents itself to make some contribution to alleviating the situation in the Lebanon.  Of course, overshadowing the whole situation is the plight of the Palestinian people whose problems continue to be unresolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a valuable lesson to be learned internationally from recent developments in the Beirut area.  It is instructive to contrast the situation that obtains where United Nations forces have been entrusted with the role of peacekeeping with that which obtains where this multinational force have been brought in.  On this side of the House we have always been quite clear that the UN <Col N="2145" /> are the international agency with whom we should work for peace and the peaceful solutions of international disputes and tensions.  Our commitment is and should be to the UN and we can be reinforced in that belief by the unfortunate happenings in the Lebanon.  It is quite clear that the concept of a multinational force of the sort brought in is a mistaken one.  With the best will in the world, a multinational force of that kind cannot be relied upon to achieve the objectives there which we would all like to see.</P>
    <P>In Southern Lebanon our information is that the UN force and our troops who are part of it are welcomed by the population, accepted, respected and are making a very important contribution to stability in the area and to maintaining peace.  I hope our Government will keep this stark contrast clearly in mind &mdash; the acceptability of the UN force in one part of the Lebanon as against the tensions which, rightly or wrongly, have followed in the train of the multinational force in another part.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Government are constantly in touch with the situation.  We want to play our part as a peace loving member of the international community of nations.  We have always undertaken a commitment to UN peacekeeping.  It has its dangers, and many of our soldiers have lost their lives in maintaining that role in the UN.</P>
    <P>It is something we must continue to adhere to.  A situation may develop which would make it necessary for UNIFIL to be withdrawn.  I hope the Government are assuring us that no such situation obtains at present.  The Irish people would like to be assured when they read these terrifying reports of what is happening that, in the circumstances, the UN force is as secure as it can be and that there is no particular need to review its presence there or to consider its withdrawal.</P>
    <P>As the Minister can see, parliaments and public opinion in other countries are quite nervous and agitated about the position of their troops.  I am referring, of course, to troops which are part of the multinational force.  While we would not necessarily have the same anxieties about <Col N="2146" /> UNIFIL, it is important that from time to time we should get a review or an assessment of the situation from the Government.  We should get assurances that the situation in so far as our area out there is concerned is reasonably stable and secure.  It is important that the Minister should be in a position to give that assurance to the Dáil today and in the future if the situation continues indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged the difference when he said:</P>
    <P>It is worth nothing that in all of Lebanon the area patrolled by the UN force is one of the few places where there is relative peace and stability.</P>
    <P>That is a very important consideration to keep in mind and I hope it will help to point the way forward out of the tragedy now taking place in the Lebanon.  Perhaps through the UN a solution can be found.  For us the UN should be the main agency on which we could rely.  I do not know whether the Minister would consider taking any initiative at the UN at this stage.  He said that the United Nations Security Council may meet soon to consider the most recent developments in the Lebanon and the appropriate response which they require.</P>
    <P>Whatever we can do to bring about such a meeting should be done.  It is quite clear from recent developments that the multinational force has failed.  It might be going too far to say it has made a bad situation worse.  I do not know enough about the political and military realities on the ground, but it does not seem to have any capacity to contribute to a peaceful solution of the tragedy of the Lebanon.  That makes us all turn to the UN, in desperation, if you like, to see if there is some action which can be taken at the level of the UN to intervene or take an initiative or make some contribution to the appalling situation which prevails out there.</P>
    <P>Our sympathy must go out to our Ambassador and his staff and our understanding of the very difficult circumstances in which they find themselves.  We hope they will be able to keep the services of the Embassy in being.  It is good to <Col N="2147" /> know that, as of 4.15 this afternoon, all the Irish citizens we are aware of out there are safe and well.  It is a very anxious situation.  I urge the Minister and his Department to keep in the closest possible touch with it and be ready to undertake any emergency action which may be necessary at any moment.  On some early occasion the Minister may give us a fuller review and assessment of the position of UNIFIL, whether it is in the position to fulfil its mandate and what the future possibilities are.  I urge the Minister to consider seriously whether, in conjunction with other like-minded countries, we should take some initiative in the UN to endeavour to bring peace to the Lebanon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks by welcoming the Minister's assurance that Irish people living in Beirut at the moment are safe and that all steps possible are being taken to ensure the safety of our troops in the Lebanon.  The situation in the Lebanon, which has deteriorated so rapidly in the past couple of weeks, must be a matter of great concern to all of us.  The divisions in the Lebanon are obviously a direct result of the wider problems in the Middle East.  It is clear that if the situation in the Lebanon continues to deteriorate, this could spark off a train of events leading to another Middle East war.  This, in turn, could lead to a confrontation between the world powers which could have appalling consequences for all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another reason why we should have a very direct concern and interest in the events in the Lebanon, that is, the presence of an Irish contingent in the UN forces in the south of the country.  We have paid a considerable price in terms of the lives of our troops in our contribution to the UN peace-keeping forces. While the roots of the problem in the Lebanon go back over very many years, direct responsibility for the present situation must be firmly laid at the door of the Israeli Government.  The Lebanese had largely recovered from their disastrous civil war in the mid-seventies and the various factions had managed to <Col N="2148" /> reach some sort of accommodation when the invasion by the Israeli army in June 1982 unleashed what can only be described as a murderous chain of events which led to destruction on an unprecedented scale.  We still have strong memories of the massacre of innocent Palestinian civilians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Chatila and, of course, there is a virtual state of civil war at present.</P>
    <P>There can be no solution to the problems of the Lebanon until there has been a total withdrawal of all Israeli forces.  The Israeli Government have persistently refused to comply with the terms of Resolutions Nos. 508 and 509 passed by the United Nations in 1982 calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all Israeli forces from the Lebanon. The partial withdrawal of Israeli troops to positions in Southern Lebanon last year was aimed effectively at enforcing the partition of Lebanon and the <i>de facto</i> extension of Israel's northern border.</P>
    <P>Similarily the treaty forced on the Lebanon by Israel from a position of strength has been a major contributing factor to the present situation primarily because it was so unacceptable to so many of the Lebanese people.  This treaty imposed upon the Lebanon a security zone in the south under the effective control of Israel.  Under this treaty Lebanon had to repeal all treaties with fellow Arab countries to which Israel had any objection, while future treaties had to be scrutinised by Israel.  All cultural activity deemed to be a danger to Israel had to be suppressed.  The treaty compelled the Lebanon to withdraw from all mutual defence pacts with other countries.  It was a specific requirement that the troops of the multinational force would have to be drawn from countries which had diplomatic relations with Israel.</P>
    <P>The treaty imposed on Lebanon conditions that negated its history and made no concessions to its traditions or Arab character.  It must be clear to everyone now that to have introduced at that time a multinational force made up of troops from NATO countries was a grave mistake. While the troops of some countries, notably the Italians, made a real effort to be impartial and to offer protection, the <Col N="2149" /> US troops in particular made no secret of their support for one faction and consequently became a further source of conflict.</P>
    <P>The Lebanon has a very detailed constitution going back to the 1940s.  It takes account of the divisions in the country between Christian and Moslem and gives the country an institutionalised form of sectarian power sharing.  Systems like this rarely, if ever, work.  Institutionalised power sharing did not work in the Lebanon and did not work in Cyprus.  We believe that if it were to be introduced in Northern Ireland it would not work there either.  When the constitution was introduced the Maronite Christians were in the majority and were given the dominant position under the constitution.  The Moslems were very much the second-class citizens.  Since then the balance has changed and the Moslems are now in the majority.  The Maronites do not, however, seem to be prepared to accept that they should now have to surrender their privileged position.  Any solution to the problems of the Lebanon would have to take into account this change in the population structure.</P>
    <P>I would not support any call for the withdrawal of the UNIFIL contingent at this stage.  While its influence is very limited, largely because the United States and other world powers allow the Israelis to flout its authority, the force does offer some degree of protection to people in Southern Lebanon.  The Government must make sure, however, that the Irish troops have the authority and the means to defend themselves against any forces which may attack them.</P>
    <P>We believe that at international level the Irish Government should call on all factions to observe a ceasefire.  They should call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops.  They should demand that the Israeli Government immediately withdraw their troops and observe the spirit and the letter of various UN resolutions. The Government should consider the introduction of diplomatic sanctions if this is not done.  The Government should also call on the US Government to speed up the withdrawal of their troops and should, as a matter of priority, <Col N="2150" /> demand that President Reagan order his naval force to cease shelling the Lebanese mainland.</P>
    <P>Foreign troops may be necessary in the Lebanon to help keep the peace but they should be under the control of the United Nations and should be acceptable to all factions there.  Consideration should be given to the calling by the United Nations of a conference with a view to producing a new constitution which would guarantee the territorial integrity of Lebanon and enable all groups to play a full role in the country's affairs.  The people of the Lebanon have in recent years been asked to endure more than any people should be asked to suffer.  The world community has a duty to ensure that they are not effort is made to come up with a lasting solution, not just to the problems of the Lebanon but of the entire Middle Eastern The main crux of the Middle Eastern problem is, of course, the plight of the Palestinian people and lasting peace can never be found in the Middle East until the Palestinian people are allowed to return to their homeland and live in peace.</P>

      <P>, <i>(Limerick East</i>): When we were on this section earlier Deputy Mervyn Taylor asked a question and we were teasing out the implications of that question.  The situation is that if the parties agree to the terms of a reversionary lease they write these terms into the lease and both are then bound by the agreement including agreement concerning any rent reviews subsequently.  The Deputy's difficulty seemed to be that he felt the court lists would be cluttered up, but under section 3 if the court fixes the terms of the lease to start with under section 34 of the 1980 Act, section 3 of the Bill will give either party the right to have the rent reviewed every five years.  They can go back to the court under section 3 (6) of this Bill if they cannot agree on the rent.  If the Deputy will look at subsections (4) and (5) it is in default of agreement on the rent that they go back into court.  There is not a situation where people are being pushed back <Col N="2154" /> into court unnecessarily if they have agreement.</P>

A question has been raised about the continuing use of the one-eighth factor on a five year rent review.  Will the Minister say what his position is in relation to this?  The Society of Chartered Surveyors in the Republic of Ireland have said they are disappointed to note that the one-eighth is being retained.  They made some submissions indicating their objections to the principle of an arbitrary percentage being used to establish the rental value of the site element of a property and they are somewhat disappointed that the one-eighth factor is still being removed.

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Under the 1931 Act where rights were given first of all to ground rent tenants, the fraction was a quarter and in the 1958 Act it was made one-sixth.  In the 1967 Ground Rent Act it become one-eighth.  In the 1967 Act the one-eighth fraction was the fraction selected and fixed but power was given to the Minister for Justice to vary that fraction by order.  The trend has been since first rights were given to tenants in 1931 that a smaller fraction would be the operative fraction, coming from a quarter down to one-eighth.  To vary the fraction upward again and to make it a larger fraction would be to reverse the trend of granting rights to ground rent tenants which commenced in 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing here that the one-eighth fraction will still be the operative fraction because that has been the position since 1967.  This particular Bill is <Col N="2155" /> before the House to give rights to a certain category of tenants which we thought they had been given previously but the Gilsenan case shows they could not avail of these rights.  There is no change being made in the fraction.  I hope it is helpful to show the sequence of the law.  It would be a reversal of the rights if we went for one-fifth, one-third, a half or something else now and would be out of line with the trend towards rights being given to tenants.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The power is not in exceptional circumstances. The power would be to fix a different fraction but if there were pressures from any particular group to fix an alternative fraction the trend would suggest a lesser fraction rather than a greater fraction. The submission from the particular body the Deputy mentioned indicates that their position would be to move the fraction in the other direction, which would certainly be out of line with what has been going on since 1967.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that, following on the case the Minister refers to which necessitated bringing in this provision, it means in effect a very substantial deterioration in the position of lessees of this category because hitherto they would have become entitled to a straight 99 year lease at a fixed rent whereas now they will become subject to review. Would the Minister agree that that will have an effect that will work its way through into the purchase price which will have to be paid for somebody setting about acquiring the freehold interest save in the cases which come under the fixed category by reference to gilt edged securities? In cases coming outside that category by reason of the fact that there will be a review now every five years under this Bill this means in effect a marked deterioration in the postion of lessees who are caught in that situation.  Perhaps that might be a factor which might induce <Col N="2156" /> the Minister at some appropriate stage to consider a reduction in that fraction to provide some compensation for that deterioration in the position of lessees.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): My intention in this was to enable tenants who had been affected by the Gilsenan decision to avail of the rights which previously people thought they had.  I am not suggesting a major change.  The Supreme Court judgement in effect requires that the provision be made for rent reviews as closely as possible in line with market practice and rather than taking on board new elements I decided that the one-eighth fraction would be the appropriate fraction because that was the fraction which was in operation since 1967.</P>
      <P>I am trying to enable the people who found themselves in the difficulty which led to the Gilsenan case in the first instance, and subsequently in difficulty as a result of the decision, to have the rights which we thought they had previously. They are different now but it is as a result of the Supreme Court case I have to keep as closely as it can be framed to the decision of the Supreme Court.  I am prepared to listen to submissions on whether the fraction should be varied.  It is not necessary to move an amendment to that effect because there is power under the 1967 Act for the Minister to vary the fraction.  As I said in reply to Deputy Woods, the trend would be towards a lesser fraction rather than a greater fraction which would be to the benefit of the tenant rather than the landlord.</P>

      <P>Section 4 deals with the temporary extension of the right to a reversionary lease in the case of a lease which has expired.  I agree with the thrust of the section.  The only point I would like to tease out is the limitation of the period to 12 months.  Is it necessary to have any limitation there?  Would it not <Col N="2157" /> be more appropriate to put the obligation on the landlord to give notice to the lessee of his rights before a lessee under an expired lease would abandon his right altogether under the legislation?  The section helps to some extent but 12 months is rather an arbitary figure.  Is any limitation there necessary?</P>

It is meant to be a temporary extension of the right and it would refer to entitlement to obtain reversionary leases after 13 November 1980 for 12 months.  The provision can be availed of over a temporary period and 12 months is standard in such cases.</P>

      <P>It would be useful if the Minister would confirm that these changes will apply only to the future fixing by the court of the rent of sporting leases and club leases and that, therefore, they do not prejudice the clubs who have already had their rents fixed.  Will he confirm that it is necessary in view of the change which is taking place now but that it will not have any effect on the rents that are fixed until they come up for their five-year review?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I can confirm that.  The section states:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where, after the commencement of this Act, the rent under a sporting lease is fixed by the court . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore it applies only after the enactment of this Bill.  Certainly there would be concern among sporting bodies about this and may be a more lengthy explanation would be in order in case people would get hold of the wrong end of the stick in thinking that their situation would be affected.  It will not apply to existing leases.  It is for new leases after the enactment of this Bill.  The proposals in section <Col N="2158" /> 5 are similar to those in section 3 which concerns reversionary leases.  This means that the rent payable under any sporting lease which is granted after this legislation goes into operation and where that rent is fixed by the court will be subject to review at intervals of not less than five years instead of at intervals of 24 or 25 years as provided by the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971.  While the judgement of the Supreme Court in the Gilsenan case did not refer to sporting leases and sporting leases did not even come within direct scope of the judgement, nonetheless a possible inference from it is that a lessor must be presumed to be unwilling to grant a lease of any kind at a rent that would not be altered for a period as long as 24 years.  Therefore, I am taking this opportunity to block a prospective loophole which would be likely to occur in the case of sporting leases in future.  I think it is reasonable to take that inference from the Gilsenan case even though it did not apply to sporting leases.  What would apply on the one hand to the reversionary leases we are talking about could validly be interpreted to apply to sporting leases also.  Therefore, we are taking the opportunity of including that provision.  I am glad of the opportunity to clarify what the Deputy has pointed out by the implication of his question.  It does not apply retrospectively.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have grave reservations about this section.  I wonder why it has been included.  It takes away the protection given in section 29 of the 1967 Act and section 67 of the 1980 Act, leaving with the landlord who gave a sporting lease the right to refuse permission for its change of use.  Maybe the idea behind the section is to endeavour to secure the protection of sports premises and clubs for their use for sporting activities.  I would support that objective wholeheartedly, <Col N="2159" /> but the question of preservation of land or premises of any kind for any purpose is and should be a matter for the local planning authority and not for any ground landlord.  From 1931 until the 1967 Act was enacted any lessee who wanted to change the use of his premises had not only to get planning permission from his local corporation or county council, he had to get permission from his lessor also.  All too often that situation was exploited by the lessors who raised charges and put financial impositions and increased rents and so on the lessees for giving their permission to do something for which the lessees had obtained planning permission in the first place.</P>
      <P>For many years the effectual planning authority for the Dublin 4 area was in the hands of the Pembroke estate and the Earl of Pembroke.  To such lengths did that situation go that it became necessary to bring in the 1967 Act, section 29 of which quite properly indicated that a lessor's permission was no longer necessary once the planning permission of a local authority had been obtained.  The one exception to it, the one hangover from that situation, is this section 6 of the Bill dealing with sporting clubs.  The reality here is that no adequate protection would be given to preservation of sporting premises as such by leaving this residual right of refusal for a change of use with the lessor.  All it would mean in effect would be that if a lessee of a sporting club by reason of having provided alternative premises elsewhere or whatever, got his planning permission for a change of use of the premises in that lease he would then be held to ransom by his ground landlord by virtue of this section.  It seems quite inappropriate that that should be so.  Surely in this day and age we should get rid of this last vestige of an old situation and leave planning matters where they rightly and properly belong that is with the local planning authorities and not in the dubious hands of any ground landlord who, after all, is likely to be motivated by what he can raise out of his interest rather than out of concern for planning considerations and the preservation of sports grounds or clubs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I will explain the intention of this section and of a covenant restricting a user of land to sporting purposes.  It is appropriate that if land is leased for sporting purposes it would be used for sporting purposes.  The intention here is to accomplish that end and to avoid a possible difficulty.  The Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971 gives outdoor sports clubs the right in certain circumstances to obtain a 99-year sporting lease.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (3) (b) of the Act provides that, where the terms of the sporting lease are fixed by the court, the lease shall contain a condition that, if the property is not used for or in connection with some outdoor sport, game or recreation the lessor shall be entitled to terminate the lease on three months' notice.  Section 29 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1967 and section 67 of the Act of 1980, afford a lessee relief in certain circumstances against covenants restrictive of user.  It would clearly be undesirable &mdash; everybody accepts this and it was never intended &mdash; that the 1967 Act and 1980 Act provisions should be used to circumvent the restrictions confining user of land in a sporting lease to outdoor sport.  There is some authority for the opinion that the provisions could be so used in certain cases to enable people to use land for the purposes other than those on the lease.</P>
      <P>If, for example, the sporting lease were to satisfy the definition of a building lease, as that expression is used in the 1967 Act, and if planning permission were obtained for the change of use, or if planning permission for the change were not required, then, apart from certain special cases, section 29 of the 1967 Act would permit the user of the land to be altered from use for outdoor sport to some other use, despite the condition in the lease restricting user to use for outdoor sport.  Section 6 of the Bill proposes, for the avoidance of doubt, the necessary amendment to obviate that possibility.  In addition to the case where the terms of the sporting lease are fixed by the court the proposal also covers the case of a covenant as to user inserted by agreement between the parties in a lease to a sports club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2161" /> Like all the provisions in the Bill, we are not advocating any major changes in the present position or the legal arrangements between the lessor and the lessee. This arises out of the Gilsenan case.  We are taking the opportunity to put in certain sections where difficulties have arisen as a result of reasonable inferences arising out of the judgement or where following examination it is considered desirable that certain doubts or lacunae in the law should be removed.</P>
    <P>It is not that I do not agree with the Deputy's general presentation on what might be desirable in regard to the powers of local authorities.  The provision was put in explicity to plug a possible loophole which, I have been informed, may arise.  It may hinge on whether one would view sports grounds as ancillary to the buildings or the buildings ancillary to the grounds.  That could present one with a difficulty.  It is worth putting in this section. It is not a major change and we may not get an opportunity again to make the change so quickly.  We should avail of the opportunity of improving the legislation we have.  The advice I have been given is that it is worth plugging this loophole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that if the loophole was to be plugged it might have been done in the direction of removing any role the ground landlord would have in this area.  It is the last residue of the old idea under which ground landlords' consent was necessary, in addition to the need to get planning permission, for any change of use.  I am concerned that this possible method of exploitation by a lessor is left as a result of the section. A sports club may have a lease on a piece of ground and, for whatever reason, the planning authority may decide it is appropriate that the use of that area for sporting purposes should be discontinued in favour of a use for other purposes as happens.  The club may decide to move to an alternative site or their grounds may be in the middle of a housing area.  That club may have a 99-year lease and may apply to the local planning authority for planning permission.  The planning authority after examining the application <Col N="2162" /> may, in their wisdom, in a suitable case decide that the proper county or city plan makes it appropriate for a change in use. What position is the club in then?  The fact that they have got the permission from the local authority should be sufficient without the club having to go cap in hand to the lessor to seek a permission which he will not be obliged to give, even on reasonable grounds, by virtue of the residual provision we are carrying forward here.</P>
      <P>The implication is that the ground landlord will be high-minded about the matter and respond by saying that he is interested in preserving sporting facilities but that is far from reality.  The reality is that the ground landlord may say to the club that having obtained local authority permission they could have his permission if they made him an offer he could not refuse.  Section 67 of the 1980 Act has a provision that a landlord may not refuse his consent unreasonably but that is excluded in the section under discussion. In effect, this means that a ground landlord in these circumstances is entitled to refuse his consent.  I do not see why that should be.  It seems wrong to leave this residual bargaining power in this case in the hands of a ground landlord.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): This applies to leases after the enactment of the Bill.  The whole point of the sporting lease is that the land be used for outdoor sport and continue to be so used for that purpose during the term of the lease. Section 6 seeks to secure the position against any loophole.  The advice I have been given is that there may be a loophole under section 29 of the 1967 Act combined with section 67 of the 1980 Act.  If both sections are applied I am advised that we may have land leased and intended for use for outdoor sporting purposes not being used for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have a long argument about whether a rugby club, if they got planning permission, should build apartments on their field on the basis that they were moving further out to larger facilities but the intention in the section is to close off a loophole.  There is not a question of exploitation by the landlord.  The advice <Col N="2163" /> given to me is that a loophole exists where land intended for and leased as ground to be used for outdoor sport under a sporting lease could, through the exercising of two sections of different Acts be used for other purposes.  I want to plug that loophole and the section does that.</P>

Section 17 of the 1978 No. 2 Act in turn represented the re-enactment with certain fairly minor changes of section 18 of the 1967 Ground Rents Act.  The Supreme Court in the Gilsenan judgement found that, since evidence has established that freely-negotiated leases for a 99-year term at a fixed rent are now unknown, it is not possible to have regard to the rent that would be reserved by a reversionary lease for the purpose of applying section 17 (2) (b) of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt comprehensively with the Government amendment last night.  I said I deplored the Government's statement which announced that their only response to the unemployment figures was that they were disturbing.  Such a word is very mild, to say the least.  It is a very poor message to send from here to the 67,000 young people without jobs, without hope or direction for the future. There is no Government plan or strategy with which they can identify.  Of course the same problem affects their parents. The Government's attitude to the young unemployed, after 14 months in office, is immoral.  The best we, the elected representatives, can say to them is that the unemployment figures are disturbing.  Of course the Government also have told us that the figures are not as bad as they might appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sort of distorted type of information being handed out to our young people will frustrate them even more and drive them into the arms of <i>personae non grata</i> as far as the democratic system is concerned, and we will only have ourselves to blame for that.  This sort of propaganda emanating from this Government in distorting the facts, trying to convince the people that there is little or no borrowing taking place, is flying in <Col N="2165" /> the face of truth because in 1983 the national debt increased by £2,900 million. Foreign borrowing increased by £100 million last year.  It is time our people got a fair presentation of the facts.</P>
    <P>It is bordering on the unmentionable to think that the Government would state in their amendment that unemployment is only half what it was under Fianna Fáil. Under Fianna Fáil Government, from March to November unemployment rose by 22,000 &mdash; plain figures, no distortion. Under the Coalition, under their Programme for Government, we were promised firm decisive action on the 170,000 then unemployed.  We know all about the decisive action.  No action has been taken, no policy and no strategy were produced and we end up with 45,000 more people unemployed.  The figures are there and cannot be disputed.</P>
    <P>What we should be concerned about is how to tackle the problem.  In Opposition we have a duty to try to extract from the Government where they are going and how they think they will get there.  I have always been constructive here and always will be in efforts to solve the biggest social evil affecting our people.  For heaven's sake, will the Government produce the White Paper on Industry so that we can come to grips with it?  If I have constructive suggestions to offer I will do so.  I complimented the Government when they took steps in regard to venture capital for industry.  I will do the same when the White Paper comes out, but I will criticise what should be criticised.</P>
    <P>Where should we be going?  The only way forward for this economy is by way of export net growth and import substitution. They are the real long-term answers.  However, I want an interim strategy in an effort to encourage young people who have been left without hope and who are suffering from extreme frustration. I want to see them taking advantage of opportunities that may exist or will exist in the future.  There are areas of opportunity here, particularly in the import substitution field.  It has not been significantly tackled, though I, as Minister, made an attempt.</P>
    <P>A 10 per cent cut in imports would create 16,000 new jobs.  That is an objective <Col N="2166" /> worth going after by any Government. There are agencies that can be brought in to help to identify those opportunities.  Already the information is on file in computers in the Irish Goods Council, in the IDA and in the IIRS.  All this information should be co-ordinated and syphoned down to our young people to give them encouragement to start small businesses.  There is community awareness of our real problems and the people want to take part.  It can be done in small areas but a lot of bureaucracy stands in the way of our young people and frustrates them even more.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister realises that the Government have an enterprise scheme through which they pay people who are unemployed to get involved in something. In Longford &mdash; I am sure it is symptomatic of other areas in the country &mdash; three girls started an enterprise on their own.  They looked for help but because one of them was not entitled to unemployment benefit they cannot get any assistance from the scheme.  Was that girl supposed to go out, spend some time on the unemployed list and get on the dole queue, which she never wanted to do?  Her two friends are there and the whole enterprise will fail because of bureaucratic regulations.  We will have to break down those regulations in relation to young people.  They are impatient. They have no time for this sort of thing, they want to get going, they want to do something.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State was winding up he called for the fostering of entrepreneurial spirit.  He can start off in one place, in the schools.  When school tours come up here and go to the Dáil, the National Museum and elsewhere, a positive step forward would be to establish a permanent exhibition in Dublin, put together by the Irish Goods Council, the IIRS and the IDA, to show the products being imported here.  Those agencies should become involved.  We have two million square feet of idle IDA factory space but until we get rid of bureaucracy we will not be able to take the necessary step forward.  That should be done straightaway.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister I initiated such a <Col N="2167" /> scheme in regard to import substitution. I should like to see that fostered and developed.  I am not talking party politics because the problem is too great for that. Two weeks ago I drew the attention of the House and the Taoiseach to an arrangement I had made with a German computer firm to train and employ 300 people in a real life work environment scheme in Bray.  That got bogged down in bureaucracy and I am asking the Minister for Labour to get rid of the bureaucracy. The German firm were prepared to put in 50 per cent of the cost with the IDA contributing the balance, but because the Department of Education want a bit of it, because the manpower section want a bit and AnCO want a bit, the thing is bogged down and 300 young people are being deprived of training and employment.</P>
    <P>There is a basic immediate need to get out a policy on the development of our natural resources.  We can no longer depend on foreign industrialists.  Industrialists already here are getting cheesed off by the approach of the Irish Government. They are beginning slowly but surely to pull out.  Irish companies are now investing in America for the very same reason &mdash; there is no return on their risk investment here.  We must get our act together properly in that respect.  The large industrialist can look after himself &mdash; he has the banks to help him.  The medium industrialist has the IDA to look after him.  But the small fellow, the real job creator here, the man who employs four or five people, has nobody to turn to.  It is time that the latent talent in all our agencies was brought to bear on this. The Irish Goods Council should be helping with home marketing.  Despite massive investment by the IDA in the last ten years, only 25 per cent of the products and services required by large investment companies that have come in here are being supplied from within the country.</P>
    <P>There are opportunities there to be taken up.  We need to identify them and get the people back to work.  I do not want to hear any more distortion of the facts.  We all know the problem.  It is about time we had some kind of strategy. <Col N="2168" /> There are many opportunities to be availed of in the softwear industry.  The world market is under 35 per cent undersupplied at present and we spend money educating young people to become technicians, graduates and so on who are capable of turning out the products required but we do not give them any opportunity to do so.  Let us use the assets we have invested in whether it is in education, IDA space or whatever.  We must put the whole act together and get the people back to work.  It is time that we turned over a new leaf and got on the right road.</P>

We could make that case.  The two former Ministers opposite me know how well that case could be made because they presided over many of the figures I could quote to them.  I do <Col N="2169" /> not propose to take that soft option but I am putting down a marker to them and to the people that if this is the way they want us to play this game of debate I reserve my position.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Reynolds and the constructive manner in which he was trying to address the problem.  I hope to make my contribution in the same spirit. The Minister of State put on record yesterday some of the facts and figures which are party to this debate.  In relation to the Nixdorf question which the Deputy raised in the last moments of his speech, I will make every effort to ensure that wherever bureaucracy is blocking that I will try to unlock it.</P>
      <P>I was unable to attend yesterday's debate because I was at a seminar/ conference which was called specially by Ministers for Labour from all the OECD countries.  While it is no consolation to say that things are bad but they are bad elsewhere, what could be learned from the conference and applied here is that, firstly, the economic crisis the western world is going through is not the same as any crisis that happened before.  There was general consensus, even among the most traditional and conservative representatives at the conference, that this time it is a major structural change.  The consequences of the change are totally unforeseen and we are into new country for which there are no maps, guides or wise old men to point to solutions that were utilised the last time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds emphasised the fact that we were on our own and paraphrased the words of a former leader of his own party, Seán Lemass, when he said that the world did not owe us a living and if we did not go out and earn it ourselves nobody else would do it for us.  I share that view and his view in relation to a combination of export led growth and import substitution.  There are constraints in relation to that.  We are looking at it.  The two former Ministers know the nature of EEC constraints and know how the importation boom that was precipitated in the late seventies is now part of the problem.  However, I take the point and we will be looking at ways in which we can harness the enterprise of young <Col N="2170" /> people.  We will go after areas of import substitution in a manner which, even if we were to achieve the 10 per cent as suggested, would be very productive.</P>
    <P>What we are basically saying in response to the motion put down by Fianna Fáil is, firstly, the figures are bad. Nobody would suggest otherwise.  Secondly, they are particularly bad for young people because of the percentages involved and thirdly, not only do we recognise that but we have taken a series of detailed steps to try to counteract it. The Minister of State outlined a number of those yesterday.  I do not think it would be productive to repeat them.</P>
    <P>It is clear that despite the difficult establishment of the Youth Employment Agency because of the change of Government, a difficulty not made any easier by the unfortunate criticism which Deputy Fitzgerald made of it, the agency is beginning to show substantial results.  These results will get better and better.  It is a unique organisation.</P>

      <P>Attacking the agency for whatever reason is an unfortunate counter-productive activity.  As far as this administration and the Labour Party, which conceived the idea of the agency, are concerned, the agency was enacted as part of a joint programme for Government under a previous Coalition Government and was established and had its initial operation when the Deputy was in the Department of Labour.  The agency has the resources, talent and commitment to do what it was set up to do, that is to implement the social guarantee extended to all young people and to say to them that there is hope in this land. They do not have to face the dole queue indefinitely.  The social guarantee is that for every young person who leaves third level or second level education and fails to get a job, the agency will act to identify them, try to target in on their needs and provide them with a suitable form of training and education to enable them to get work.  It is not a machine for making people instantly happy.  It was never intended to be that.  As Deputy Reynolds indicated yesterday evening, it was doing much of what the people opposite wish us to do now.  It is looking at the figures of unemployment, looking at the breakdown of the numbers of young people who are unemployed, looking at why they are unemployed and trying to unravel the extraordinary lack of information we have in this area, despite all the statistics.  While the numbers on the live register increase slowly, much more slowly than previously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Anybody endeavouring to get into that kind of argument is going down the <i>cul-de-sac</i> that Deputy Fitzgerald finds himself being pulled into. What we do not have and what previous administrations did not have is information as to the breakdown of the numbers on the live register.  We do not know why it is that up to 18,000 people move on or off the live register each month.  In many cases we do not have a sufficient picture of where are the jobs people are going into, of why they are not holding on to them and whether for those who do not move from the register there is a need for a particular skills or training.  When in response to the then oncoming industrialisation that was seen as being delivered in the main by foreign led domestic companies, AnCO were established.  There was then a clear role for training, for providing workers with the necessary skills to work in the Nixdorf- type companies and other companies throughout the country.  A catch-22 situation in which many young people found themselves was that of not being able to get jobs because of not having experience and of not being able to acquire experience without first getting jobs, but to get jobs they needed some kind of vocational training.  Initially that problem was broken down successfully by AnCO in their training centres and that successful work is being carried on now by the Youth Employment Agency in conjunction with the educational and training services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are aware that many young people are finding jobs but this does not mean that there are anything like enough jobs. In our industrial White Paper we will be producing the kind of blueprint that Deputy Reynolds has been asking for, asking for in Opposition, though in a constructive manner.  During this year with the assistance of the Cabinet task force and the National Planning Board we will be producing the kind of blueprint by which we will be able to identify the jobs that can be created and which will <Col N="2173" /> outline a support system to enable people to produce those jobs.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy Reynolds that the best prospect for job creation in our type of economy or in many other OECD economies is in the small-to-medium sized enterprises.  There has been an unprecedented increase in the numbers on the live register, an increase of 78 per cent since 1981, which was a period covering three administration so that all of us spent some time in office during the time of that dramatic rise.  We all know the factors that brought about in part that extraordinary increase, but in contrast to what might have been anticipated in the past there are on the live register many people who have the capacity, the skill and the experience to start an enterprise and who because of their knowledge of their localities or of a particular industrial process, are in a position to identify where the potential is for import substitution.  This Government have recognised that and have introduced a scheme to assist people to use their skills and experience.  The enterprise allowance scheme, details of which were announced in the House before Christmas but which were enlarged on substantially in my contribution to the debate on the budget, has been an unprecedented success.  It has been totally over-subscribed.</P>

It is an indication of the strength of our analysis that people are showing that they wish to work, that they wish to work on jobs they know they can do and that they are anxious to fulfil market needs as they perceive them to be.</P>

      <P>I said it before &mdash; perhaps it is unfortunate that the full details of my speech were not made available to the Fianna Fáil Deputies &mdash; that we are happy with the initial progress of this scheme which effectively was inaugurated only before Christmas.  We are considering ways in which the scheme can be enlarged.  That is very much the point Deputy Reynolds made in relation to the problem of qualifications for someone who had not been on the live register. The purpose of the exercise is to remove any difficulties and constraints which may be inadvertently in the way of anyone who has an idea, who has the capacity to put that idea into effect and who therefore should be given every encouragement. That is a constructive recommendation and one that we will put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking behind the enterprise scheme is that, as in the White Paper which is in draft from that has just been completed, we are identifying a whole <Col N="2175" /> range of areas in which work can be created. There is the development of what is known in the OECD as the third sector. In every other European country, particularly Finland, the Scandinavian countries in general, Belgium and the Netherlands, governments are considering ways in which people who have ideas, who have the ability to put those ideas into effect and who have perceived a market for their products can be encouraged. This can be extended to include other categories apart from those on the live register and to include anyone who wishes to work but who needs to be in a position to draw unemployment benefits. The contradiction that has permeated our society in terms of the nature of the insurance scheme has been broken in virtually every other European country.  This could not be more relevant to any group than it is to young people because the great crime about unemployment as it affects young people is that, as most of us realise, so much of our education began only when we started to work.  While formal education gave us a qualification, whether in terms of the leaving certificate or whatever, even someone with third level vocational training in medicine, dentistry, architecture or whatever was educated only in the final analysis by way of experience on the job in becoming a productive member of society.  This is something that must be harnessed so far as our young people are concerned.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are anxious to criticise us trenchantly in relation to this area but I would say to them that the problem is of such a scale that it should not be made a political football.  Without intending to be party political, Fianna Fáil's record is subject to fairly severe scrutiny in terms of their failure in this area when they had the opportunity of doing something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not getting into a party political debate.  I wish to maintain the spirit of constructive dialogue that Deputy Reynolds and I at least have established in regard to this debate.  In relation to the enterprise agency and young people, it is absolutely essential that we get young people working and we are proceeding on a variety of programmes designed to do that.  The reasons for doing that are not just the reasons outlined yesterday and earlier today, those of social cohesion and of utilising the energies of young people so that others may not harness those energies &mdash; that was the euphemistic way Deputy Reynolds referred to the matter. The real reason is that they constitute an enormous resource capable not only of looking after themselves but of looking after our generation and older generations who will need their help.  The coming generation will also need their help.</P>
      <P>In his closing remarks Deputy Reynolds said the old solutions had not worked, that it was time to break new ground and to produce new solutions.  I will give this undertaking to the Deputy: we will introduce proposals that will be radical, new and different and that will cut across many of the prejudices and preconceptions many people in this House have in relation to this area.  I hope the spirit of radicalism contained in his concluding comments will reflect itself in a constructive appraisal of those proposals. I hope the Deputy will not fall into the trap that all of us can fall into so easily, namely, opposition for the sake of opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be nice and comfortable to think that this recession, like the other recessions which we experienced previously, will go away, that all one has to do is to keep one's head down, to manipulate the levers of the economy as successive Governments have done and that somehow we will get back to the good old days.  Many people still think on those lines.  They think that if we throw a few <Col N="2177" /> million pounds into the construction industry, open up a few more advance factories and re-drain the Shannon, we will solve the problem.  All those solutions were perceived in the past to have worked but that is another argument. However, I wish to say to this House and to people who may be listening to this debate that we are not in that country any more.  There is an extraordinary economic revolution occurring across the globe that is wiping out whole industries with a suddenness and a savagery that is beyond our comprehension.  This is happening to such an extent that no longer can one ask young people in primary school what they will be when they grow up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government for the first time will produce a manpower policy document &mdash; it will be my responsibility to do this &mdash; that will address itself to that problem.  It is something we have not had for five or six years.  We will have to deal with the reality of the changing nature of employment in our society.  We have to do something previous administrations have not done, namely, to give back to people the basic identity work confers on them.  The normal common preliminary social interchange in this country is to ask a person their name, where they live and what they do.  Too many people have been forced into answering they do nothing because they are unemployed when the reality is that they do a lot but they do not get paid properly for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New technology will change the way economies function.  All the economies that are experiencing an enormous increase in unemployment are, at the same time, experiencing an increase in <Col N="2178" /> the wealth produced in their societies. Our economy will grow this year by 2 per cent to 2½ per cent of GNP.  However, no longer can we take comfort in such a performance because it will not automatically or significantly reflect itself in increased employment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the spirit of constructive debate as demonstrated by Deputy Reynolds and have attempted to respond to it.  I give the House and those listening to the debate this undertaking: we will come forward with a manpower policy and with an industrial White Paper that will exceed all the radical expectations Deputy Reynolds mentioned in his concluding remarks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment regarding the introduction of a manpower policy and industrial White Paper in the next few months. I am working with him in a committee in connection with this matter and I know the kind of work being done.  I am reflecting the views of the trade union movement when I say that, given the present unprecedented high level of unemployment, there are three obvious areas where we can create jobs that are needed. I am talking about housing, roads and drainage work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICTU suggest &mdash; they can prove this with figures &mdash; that if there was an injection of an additional £250 million into the construction industry that would create immediately 15,000 jobs with 5,000 jobs downstream.  Milton Friedman is a man we do not quote very often in my party but even he has identified that the greatest industry for reflation in a downspin economy is the construction industry because it has the greatest multiplier effect.  Europe and the UK are built up.  We have the fastest growing population in Europe and we <Col N="2179" /> need houses.  I propose that there be an immediate programme providing for 35,000 local authority houses per year. This would be provided by a national State building agency.  Let us consider a breakdown of that figure.  If £250 million were invested, £167 million would be saved by the State in unemployment benefit and in recoupment of PAYE and PRSI.  We could get a net 20,000 jobs for £83 million.</P>
    <P>With regard to roads, I propose it is not unreasonable to state that the taxpayers, especially the motorists, would be prepared to accept a levy on a gallon of petrol for the sole purpose of providing roads and creating jobs.  Our roads structure has been described by foreign industrialists as deplorable, especially in the west.  There is great need for development of that infrastructure.  If work were carried out, such as that done on the Naas bypass, it would relieve local authorities of the obligation to provide roads and it would create much-needed jobs.</P>
    <P>With regard to drainage, I understand there is a row at the moment between economists in the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works.  The Department of Finance people say that drainage is not feasible.  The reason given is the unduly long time it took to drain the Boyne.  When one analyses the progress of the Boyne drainage project one realises that it was dragged out over the years by bureaucratic delays.  It should have been completed in five years but it took nearly three times as long.  This was due to the manipulation of the officials in the Department.</P>
    <P>In my constituency about 212 workers are being laid off on the Maigue drainage. These workers could be transferred to the Mulcair.  This would save 212 jobs and they would pay for themselves on a cost-benefit analysis and add about £15 million in terms of actual value to the land in the Limerick East constituency alone.</P>
    <P>These are three definite areas where we can provide worthwhile jobs.  It makes sense to provide jobs in areas where work has to be done.  We have the model of SFADCo.  They built factories during <Col N="2180" /> depressed times and they were there when times improved.  I urge the Minister to take note of my comments.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy Prendergast.  Listening to the Minister I got the impression that he was on the Opposition benches because every idea he trotted out had already been mentioned in this House by Deputy Reynolds over the last year.  The Minister gave us no new information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's amendment to our motion represents nothing short of a misleading statement and, in my opinion, is the greatest load of codswallop ever heard in this House.  With over 250,000 people unemployed in this small country, how can this Government try to justify their amendment?  They appear to be saying we have 250,000 people unemployed but we are doing a great job.  Two weeks ago the Minister for Finance in his budget speech said that the unemployment trend had already improved.  Since the budget an extra 7,000 people have joined the dole queues.  I would like the Minister to <Col N="2181" /> define what he means by an improvement when a further 7,000 people are added to the dole queues.  This problem should be tackled and if this Government continue to travel down the road of monetarist policies, that can only add to our already frightening dole queues.</P>
    <P>In every town and village outside employment exchanges and Garda barracks, the dole queues are growing larger every week.  One would expect that some members of this Government &mdash; one would expect the Labour Party &mdash; to be at least concerned to see so many able-bodied men and women, many of them in their thirties, forties and fifties having worked since their teenage years being put on the scrap heap and told, &ldquo;This is your future; do not expect to work again&rdquo;, embarrassed and paraded weekly before the public at employment exchanges.  It would be cheaper to keep them in employment rather than pay social welfare.</P>
    <P>The majority of the unemployed are willing and want to work for their families and their country but because of the Government's unwillingness to come up with the policies and investment so necessary for job creation, they are unable to find employment.  We all accept that we are living in recessionary times that must affect a small country like Ireland. However, in such times we must look to our own natural resources and develop them to create jobs for our people.  Look at the natural resources we have in agriculture, forestry, fishing and the building industry, all with tremendous potential for development and job creation.  The present Government have downgraded agriculture and written off our forestry industry by allowing Scarriff to close. They have also allowed the building industry to go into a state of decline with one out of every two people in the industry unemployed.  Given the right type of Government leadership, these are the areas where jobs could be created almost instantly and this would bring about a substantial reduction in our unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>I would like to give an example of a county devastated by unemployment over the past five years &mdash; my own county <Col N="2182" /> of Wexford.  Our present unemployment figures are the worst in the country. Twenty per cent of the total work force are unemployed in County Wexford whereas the national figure is only 16 per cent and the figure for the south-east region is also 16 per cent.  At present a total of 7,000 people are unemployed in County Wexford, yet the Government and the IDA have consistently refused to declare the county a priority area.  Take Wexford town.  There are 25 per cent of the working population unemployed, I believe the highest in the country; in Enniscorthy there are 17 per cent unemployed, in Gorey 16 per cent, and New Ross 18 per cent.  These figures constitute a national scandal and demand immediate attention.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have three Dáil seats in County Wexford and Labour have one Senator, but because of the anger and disillusionment of the people of Wexford with this Government's policies I can assure the Minister that at least one of the four will be very disappointed after the next general election.  Over the past year Wexford has suffered severe job losses with the closure of Barna Buildings and Springs of Wexford.  The Great Island Generating Station might close, but we hope the Minister will use his good offices to ensure this does not happen. I call on the Government to declare County Wexford a special case for immediate attention by the Minister and the IDA.  The advance factories and land are available but what we need are jobs.</P>
    <P>Unemployment of this magnitude &mdash; 250,000 &mdash; is tragic enough in itself but a feature of this adversity which should concern all is the way the youth in our society are affected.  Today we have at least 70,000 people under 25 years of age unemployed.  No other country in Europe has such a severe and lethal problem on its hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a young, highly educated population willing and wanting to play their part in the Ireland of today, but due to the lack of jobs we are unable <Col N="2183" /> to utilise their talents, their idealism and their youthful expectations for the betterment of this country.  It is obvious that the present Government have abandoned our young people and are prepared to sacrifice a whole generation of youth for the sake of financial rectitude. However, I would warn the Minister that the unemployed youth of today constitute a time bomb in our society which is on the verge of exploding and which will lead to open revolt and rebellion against the democratic system unless action is taken.</P>
      <P>Many of our young people have become cynical of politicians, have a low level of tolerance for political parties and are turning more and more to the politics of protest which may never achieve the desired results but may very well fill a vacuum in the lives of our idle youth. This will be encouraged by minority political parties, as we have seen happening.</P>
      <P>Life on the whole is a bleak prospect for our well educated young people, many of them married with families and most of them on the dole since they left school at 18 years of age.  What hope can these people have if they never get an opportunity to learn the skills and habits of work?  What of kind of example is it for their children if the breadwinner never leaves home for work during their period of growing up?  This type of example for our young people can only lead to the weakening of the work ethic among future generations.  The one per cent youth levy so willingly paid, in the main by PAYE workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister when he was speaking.  The one per cent youth levy so willingly paid, in the main by PAYE workers, in the belief that substantial jobs would be created for young people, has been a total failure. There are no visible signs that it is helping to alleviate the growing unemployment amongst our young people.  I should like <Col N="2184" /> to ask the Minister where the levy collected in the years 1982 and 1983 was spent.  Has it been swallowed up by the different agencies, paying high salaries to overstaffed officers on administration and telling us where the unemployment problems exist?  Or was it used to balance the books in different Departments?  The time has come for the Government to examine the situation in relation to the Youth Employment Agency, AnCO, Manpower and the other agencies with a view to bringing all those youth agencies under the one umbrella.  This would eliminate the bureaucracy and red tape involved, ensuring that the levies collected are used for the purpose for which they were originally intended&mdash; job creation for our young people.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are grinding to a halt because of lack of finance.  Why not have these levies paid directly to urban, district and county councils who have the expertise and administrative facilities to employ perhaps 10,000 young people on environmental and other works throughout the Twenty-six Counties?  The main objective of this Government should be to get our people back to work through imaginative and constructive policies.  I contend this Government have reneged on our youth.</P>
      <P>One might have expected the type of policies being pursued from the Fine Gael Party but their socialist partners in Government have a lot to answer for, this great Labour Party who portray themselves at election time as the defenders of the poor, the worker and the unemployed. Obviously they found the lure of the State car greater than their ideals and principles.  Are the Labour Party to continue to support these policies of financial rectitude at the expense of our young people?  If they do then they will have contributed to the sacrifice of a generation of young people which, in turn, would constitute genocide of a type from which our nation will not recover for half a century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before it is too late I appeal to the Government to give some ray of hope to our young people because I believe they will respond to such hope.  They do not expect miracles overnight; they understand <Col N="2185" /> our economic circumstances.  But they do expect that the least the present Government could do is develop our resources, enabling them to participate in what is the right of any human being, that is to serve and contribute to one's country through the workplace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reaction of the Government to the latest unemployment figures is simply to express disappointment which sums up the hopelessness and sense of defeat now felt throughout the community.  Indeed the ethos of this Government is to accept an increase in numbers of people out of work each month, to blame our lack of competitiveness for this trend and to deny their responsibility as being the catalysts in setting this trend in reverse.  Whichever public relations person in the Government scripted this amendment he has some neck.  The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann . . . notes that the rate of growth of unemployment has been halved since the election of the Government in December, 1982. . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the 100,000 young people unemployed do not read that amendment because it will merely add to their frustration. Let us engage in an analysis of what this Government have done by way of initiative in employment creation for our young people.  They set up the Youth Employment Agency which, since its inception, they have done everything possible to strangle by refusing them adequate staffing and overlapping its role with that of existing agencies, many of which have been given money which should have been devoted to the Youth Employment Agency.  Six million pounds only were spent by the agency on direct youth employment up to 31 October 1983 out of a total of £98 million collected.  The Government have conned PAYE workers into making a further sacrifice by way of the 1 per cent youth employment levy.  They contributed this £98 million on the understanding that their extra sacrifice was providing more resources for the employment of our young people.  What have the Government done with this money?  They have <Col N="2186" /> used it to finance existing Exchequer expenditure on agencies such as AnCO, the Department of Education, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Labour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, the capital expenditure programme of AnCO in this year's Estimates is down by a massive 72 per cent and AnCO's day-to-day capital costs are down by 10 per cent.  In other words, they have simply juggled the figures and a small proportion only of the youth employment levy has gone into the creation of direct employment.  They have given no extra resources of any significance to the area of employment of young people.  Rather they have simply taken money from one pocket and put it into another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their Programme for Government they promised a National Development Corporation with a capital requirement of £200 million, which was reduced to £7 million in the 1983 budget.  But having been totally inactive in this area during the year they decided in October that this National Development Corporation would not get off the ground during 1983. Then the National Enterprise Agency, earlier rejected by them, was revived with a provision of £3 million.  I want the Minister to tell the House before this debate concludes how many jobs have been created by this agency up to 31 December 1983.  It is my guess that no jobs have been created and that the only money spent was that on further wasteful administrative costs, this from a Government who raised the expectations of so many of our young people.  There was a time when I had some admiration myself for the Taoiseach.  Having raised the expectations of so many young people, having been 10 months in Government and having hardly mentioned a young person, this Government cobbled together a national youth policy committee to make up for 12 months of their inactivity, a window-dressing exercise for their failure to take the positive action promised.  This national youth committee will produce nothing.  It will merely give <Col N="2187" /> this Government 12 months further breathing space.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kind of action over which the Government are presiding. I warn them here this evening that our young people will not stand for this kind of policy any longer.  There is tremendous frustration felt in every town and village where young people are walking the streets unable to find employment. That fact will be tied around the neck of this Government for the remainder of their term in office unless they are prepared to effect significant changes in the policies they are pursuing.  In summary that is a catalogue of Government action on youth employment to date.  It amounts to nothing more than the Government pussy-footing around with the lives of 100,000 young people.  I say 100,000 deliberately because that is the figure of young people unemployed, not 60,000 as is stated in the statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me cite an example of the disgraceful situation obtaining which I came across in my constituency this week.  Four former university graduates from UCG have decided that they will have to continue to live in the house they used to rent when they were students because, if they moved out and gave their home addresses, they would receive no unemployment assistance whatsoever.  How can such young people &mdash; who have spent years in the educational system &mdash; continue to exist for much longer accepting the disappointment of this Government? It is not my intention to spend all of my time in this important debate lambasting the Government, simply because the same negative attitude would merely match the Government's ineptitude on the question of youth employment.  I reject the notion now accepted by many Government Ministers that full employment is no longer a realistic objective.  In a country with a population of only 4,500,000, with the benefit of the resources at our disposal, a job for everybody is well within our capacity.  But that <Col N="2188" /> will be so only if we correct our many unbalanced social attitudes, if we correct our now almost incoherent commercial and economic principles.</P>
    <P>Employment can be created through action on two fronts.  First, I believe in the creation of a climate conducive to investment initiative and the pursuance of the work ethic.  This involves changes in our present regressive form of taxation. At present a company pays taxation when providing extra employment &mdash; in other words, right now there is a tax on employment, so how could we expect companies, who are finding the recession biting, to take on extra workers?  PAYE taxpayers pay more for greater effort and productivity.  Increased income to a company, increased company performance and greater growth increase from a company will bring about greater tax liability. This regressive taxation must be reversed.  Existing industry must be enticed to become more efficient.  State resources must be pumped into the traditional industries, in particular in areas such as quality control, marketing, cost control, training and management&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I shall tell the Minister in a moment what his Government are doing &mdash; so that they can compete on the home market and then expand on foreign markets.  Let me refer to the 1982 EEC survey and mention of few criteria under the heading of Irish Companies Attitudes. The company attitude to marketing of 22 countries was surveyed.  Ireland was No. 21.  Attitude to company sales orientation &mdash; Ireland No. 22, last.  Marketing analysis &mdash; Ireland in 16th place. Advertising expenditure <i>per capita</i> in 1980 &mdash; Ireland in 18th place.  Product quality &mdash; Ireland in 19th place.  Product design and styling &mdash; Ireland in 21st place.  Product safety &mdash; Ireland in 17th place.  Packaging of consumer goods &mdash; Ireland in 18th place.  On-time delivery &mdash; Ireland in 19th place.  After-sales service &mdash; Ireland in 18th place.  Consumer protection &mdash; Ireland in 17th place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2189" /> I should have thought that the budget would have addressed itself to problems such as those outlined here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy reads the speech in which we make money available to CTT to deal with those precise problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As we can see from the Government's budget, they are not interested in tackling those problems.  We have the most professional agencies to be found anywhere in Europe, in the IDA, AnCO, the IMI, Córas Tráchtála and so many others.  I am impressed by the talent and enthusiasm of those people whom I have met from those agencies in the two years since I became a Deputy.  Clearly, their enthusiasm is severely blunted by lack of Government commitment to allow them to exploit the massive potential which is present in our work force. Young Irish people have all the ingredients to partake in industrial growth.  We are well educated, highly motivated, ambitious.  We want to work for Ireland but we must be properly rewarded.  I continue to be amazed at the wealth of our young people's talent which I find every day in industry and throughout the various agencies &mdash; people like Brian Patterson, Director General of IMI or Denis Brosnan, Managing Director of Kerry Co-op.  They are two high-profile people, but there are thousands like them throughout this country and they are desperate to make things happen.  It is the structure, the bureaucracy, the indifference and the inability of this Government which are causing the present problems for those many so well educated and so talented young people throughout our industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The climate created by the present Government, which is at present about gale force 10, is stifling the great potential <Col N="2190" /> which is there.  We must direct our resources away from a wasteful public sector.  We must take Government from around the necks of the people.  We must make our public service efficient and cut public expenditure in that area.  The Government promised to do this but, as we have seen in the budget, they could not agree.  We must put those resources into the creation of an economic climate which is conducive to industrial growth and development.</P>
    <P>Take just one sector and a report brought out by the IDA last month.  The report <i>Consumer Foods &mdash; Ideas for Development</i> should be closely studied by members of the Government.  Let me quote from the first paragraph:</P>
    <P>Food imports to Ireland in 1982 were valued at £750 million.  Processed foods account for £425 million, with the remaining £320 million taken up by primary unprocessed food products.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions in this House I have called for the appointment of a Minister for Food to try to redress the ridiculous situation outlined in this report.  I have called for an agricultural development organisation properly constituted under the umbrella of the IDA. I must compliment this body on this very useful and worthwhile report.</P>
    <P>We see from the budget that the Government are not simply interested in taking action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;very quickly is with regard to specific action in various areas some of which I outlined in the Adjournment Debate before Christmas.  I asked specifically that a number of measures be taken in the budget.  Those included the extension of 10 per cent manufacturing corporation tax to the service industry such as international finance, insurance, reinsurance, data processes.  I asked the Government specifically to introduce that measure.  Clearly the IDA again have told this Government that this is the real growth area.  There are examples of that throughout the country, but again <Col N="2192" /> their demands fell on deaf ears.  The second point that I put forward was the motivation of Irish people to support Irish industries.  Thirteen thousand jobs could be created if 500,000 households bought £1 more of Irish products.  But the Minister, Deputy Bruton's reaction was that he could not have protectionism.  I am not talking about protectionism &mdash; I am talking about motivating our people to be nationalistic.  I am talking about putting resources into Irish industry. Indeed, coming up with the excuse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish.  The excuse that it is against the European court decision taken some time ago is a lame one.  We have only to examine what Britain is doing.  Look at the Buy British Campaign.  Look at the Food from Britain Campaign.  Look at the policies of the French Government.</P>

It is about time that we took off our kid gloves with regard to this problem.  But clearly this Government are not motivated in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third point that I made before Christmas was the employment of young people by existing industry on a tax incentive basis.  I suggested that a company should be allowed to pay a gross wage to young employees who would not be asked to pay either PAYE or PRSI for the first year of their employment and that they would not lose their social welfare entitlements, and that the company should be further compensated with corporation tax incentives.  This is a direct opportunity to encourage companies to employ young people.  The fourth was the payment of gratuities to married women who retire from their jobs after a specified period of marriage, together <Col N="2193" /> with an increased tax free allowance to the husband for a number of years after the wife's retirement, in order to make retirement attractive and to open up job opportunities for young people.</P>

      <P>The effect of that proposal would be to entice more married people to get out of work within a number of years after marriage and make more job opportunities available.  I could go on all night with such proposals.  I am convinced that in 1984, without spending millions of pounds, those proposals would create employment.  I am also convinced that this Government are not interested in such proposals.  Their latest efforts are simply disappointing.  In the budget statement, you will find that they are considering, examining, looking, reviewing, assessing.  I describe this Government as a do-nothing administration. I warn them that the young people will not tolerate their neutral methods and these disappointments.  They will not tolerate the excuses that the Government have come up with for 215,000 being unemployed.  Unfortunately, there is no evidence to suggest that there will be any change in attitude on the part of this Government.  There is no evidence to suggest that they are the slightest bit interested in the problems of the young people whom I have described.  Not alone will young people not vote for them because of their actions but they are likely to take the law into their own hands because of their frustration.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fahey's attack on the Government will not get us anywhere because I believe if the problem is to be solved it will be by the collective will of the people.  That will have to happen in every city, town and village.  The State can certainly help by providing incentives but the people must also have the will to create full employment.  I believe that full employment is an achievable reality if we have the will to do so because there is plenty of work to be done and many people to do it.  If there <Col N="2194" /> is plenty of work to do and plenty of people to do it why can we not get that equation right?  However, as we know the equation is wrong and I wish to register my dissatisfaction with the high levels of unemployment.</P>
      <P>We can go round in circles for years and blame whoever we wish but that will not solve anything because the real problem is unemployment.  Many people suffer the demoralisation and loss of self-respect that goes with unemployment. Adrian Sinfield, a British sociologist, has done much research into unemployment and he says that in interview after interview the shame of unemployment is evident. He says that you do not really know what it is like to be unemployed until you have experienced it.  We must provide for the needs of the people and one of the most basic needs is employment.  If we cannot do this under our present structures we should set up new structures and institutions to cope with the problem. The Coalition Government during their short term in office have done good work in this area by setting up the Youth Employment Agency and in more recent times the Enterprise Allowance Scheme. Although the enterprise scheme is very good, the money allocated only provided for 500 people, there is now no more money and further applications cannot be considered.  In the last two weeks two of my constituents told me they applied for this allowance but did not receive it and when I checked I found they were correct.  The Minister for Finance said this money would be made available and I am urging that this be done as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Without being dramatic, as we all know history has a very definite and unambiguous account of what happens when one generation is unmindful or blindfolds itself to the legitimate needs and aspirations of another.  We have a young population teeming with energy, full of idealism and well disciplined who to date have been following the requests of society and have been amenable to the demands, exhortations and remonstrations of their parents, all aimed towards the promised land that we had held out <Col N="2195" /> for them, that when they had completed their education they would have a suitable opportunity of gaining worthwhile employment.  Since 1982, when the Government took office on promises of <i>inter alia</i> halting and reversing unemployment generally, which at the time stood at 170,000, it has become obvious that they have failed in their hopes and aspirations and that they have not the capacity to deal with unemployment.  My colleague, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, in deference to his own wishes and those of our Front Bench and party tabled a very concerned, responsible and understandable motion.  He asked the House to acknowledge that in respect of what the Government had promised they had failed and that they had failed to produce policies to provide employment opportunities for our young people.  There was an amendment tabled which was as pathetic as the spokespeople representing our young people in the matter of providing employment.  It is typical of the gobbledegook which has been coming from the Government and they have asked us to accept that the rate of growth in unemployment has been halved.  They said that, with an adequate response from every section in the community, they will provide the necessary framework to combat unemployment.</P>
      <P>I am going to do an extraordinary thing.  In deference to the justification which we had for tabling this motion I am going to refer briefly to the understanding and acceptance of it which has come from the far side of the House.  I do not speak in the remote past tense.  Last week in this House the Tánaiste, in accepting the need for such a motion, referred to the fact that there was an unemployment crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why then did the Government reject the terms of our motion?  Why, a short time ago, did Deputy Birmingham ask us to avoid the temptation of treating this as party politics? Why does he not accept that the crisis exists?  Why did he not make it his <Col N="2196" /> business to listen to the contributions of Deputies last night?  The Minister charged with this responsibility came in here tonight and it was obvious that he has neither taken the time nor the interest to discover what has been said last night. He endeavoured to make his contribution by reacting to the ten minute contribution made by Deputy Albert Reynolds.</P>
      <P>That is a further insult to our young people, but it is what the Minister did. His Junior Minister came in here last night and, in a manner befitting the L and H society, said there was no basis for what we were attempting to bring before the House even though, as I said, we had confirmation of it by the Tánaiste and last Thursday Deputy O'Donnell spoke of the crisis and his disappointment that nothing was being done.  Tonight Deputy Prendergast and Deputy M. Barry were also concerned about unemployment. Nevertheless, the Minister and his assistant &mdash; assistant being a euphemism in this regard &mdash; told us that Fianna Fáil are talking about something which does not exist.</P>
      <P>The contribution made last night by the Minister of State at the Department of Labour was the most insulting and smart alecky contribution I have ever heard.  It showed his complete disregard for our young people.  When we talk about young people we cannot forget their parents who have made great sacrifices to enable young people to engage in educational pursuits to prepare them to join the labour force.  They are concerned about career guidance and getting points in their examinations.  This year they had to pay £30 to sit for the leaving certificate examination.  What is at the end of the road for them?  Nothing.  I could understand that up to a point if I saw the Government making some attempt to provide employment for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, tonight one would think we had no Minister for Labour for the past 12 months.  He was careful to avoid making any reference to any achievement by his predecessor.  Last night the Minister of State told us what a nun had <Col N="2197" /> succeeded in doing in Limerick &mdash; and he seemed to take credit for it in his contribution &mdash; to satisfy the employment needs of our young people.  Tonight the Minister for Labour mentioned something I never heard mentioned before. He said that in respect of obtaining employment we all knew education began only when you started to be employed.  In answer to Deputy Reynolds he said he accepted that we must now be ready to take three different jobs in our lifetime.  Is he suggesting there must be three different forms of education?</P>
    <P>It was obvious to me that the Minister and the Minister of State saw this as an opportunity to indulge in talking about policies, to blame other Governments and to appeal to the community to solve their problems.  They seem to forget that they are now where they were striving to be.  They are in Government.  It is their responsibility to indicate not only what they hope to do but what they have done. In the matter of providing employment I hope they will be able to go further than to commend the good nun of whose efforts on behalf of the young people in Limerick I am aware.  That was the major contribution made by the Minister of State last night in a flippant and insulting contribution the likes of which I never heard before.</P>
    <P>Tonight the Minister was equally disappointing. I appreciate that he has been travelling and, like the rest of us, he cannot be in two places at the one time but I would have been happier if he had indicated to the House the inhibitions he was faced with and if he accepted that the motion is a true reflection of the existing situation.  That is what it is.  I do not have to remind the Minister that last month the unemployment figure rose by 7,000.  In a few months time the total unemployment figure will be 250,000, 80,000 of whom will be under 25 years of age.  What are the Government doing to provide gainful occupations for those people?</P>
    <P>Today we heard the pathetic offering by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  He admitted to me that this year fewer people are employed in <Col N="2198" /> the Phoenix Park than last year.  Young and old people are anxious to work in the Phoenix Park.  Young people are anxious to pursue horticultural studies which would enable them to obtain gainful employment.  The Phoenix Park is not just a park to which the people can have recourse.  It is a worthwhile tourist attraction. Tourism should be our most attractive industry.  We understand the economics of inviting people here to eat our food rather than exporting it and how wise it is to have meat available at home rather than sending it out on the hoof.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about employing people for employment's sake.  We know the potential that exists for involving many of our young people in operations which would help to make our country a centre of beauty and leisure which thousands of people could enjoy.  Automatically this would help our economic position. The Government just go on referring to their reviews, the boards they are establishing and their commitment to A, B, C and D.  There is no evidence that that commitment is bearing any worth-while fruit.</P>
    <P>Most hypocritical of all was the attitude of the two spokesmen for the Department of Labour who tried to infer that Fianna Fáil were pursuing this matter for the sake of opposition and talking about something which does not exist.  They tried to castigate us for turning this into a political matter.  I notice that the Minister has been nodding his head to me since I started to speak.</P>

I am asking the Minister who made the charge here tonight, in the near emergency which exists and in deference to the youth of Ireland about whom we hear so much, to accept the motion, perhaps excluding the word &ldquo;deplore&rdquo;?  The evidence is there that the Government have not applied themselves to the task of providing jobs for our young people.  Will the Minister accept the motion?</P>

He will live the lie until such time as there are manifestations in the House which he can no longer contain. Young people have a sense of justice and a sense of idealism.  Woe to the Minister who goes too far.  Woe to the Minister who turns his back on them, wears a blindfold and takes refuge in a lot of clap-trap about something everybody knows he is not doing.  I do not see any great difference between what the Minister claimed here tonight and what we suggest in the motion.  He should show the understanding and magnanimity he would expect from others.  He should accept the reality and the truth, and accept our motion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Leonard has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the allocation of funds for the local improvement schemes.  The Deputy has nine minutes and the Minister has five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The local improvements schemes took over from the rural improvement schemes in 1968.  The allocations we have received range from £2,750,000 in 1979 to £3 million in 1983. The 1984 allocation has been reduced to <Col N="2203" /> £2,150,000, which is 71.7 per cent of last year's figure.  The criterion under which those schemes operate varies from county council to county council.  Some of them do the complete road work, fencing, drainage, reinforcing pavements and black topping and others only do the black topping.  We have less funds this year for this.</P>
      <P>I am mainly concerned tonight with the unfair allocation of funds over the last few years.  I raised the matter on an Adjournment Debate on 20 March 1975. When I told the Minister, then Mr. Tully, that the schemes related to the period from 1963 to 1968 under the rural improvement schemes he said:</P>
      <P>In 1973 I changed this.  The criterion now relates to the applications on hands and there is no reference to what a local authority got under the special employment schemes in the allocations now made.</P>
      <P>I took it that from then on they were allocated against the number of applications in each county but I found out in reply to a parliamentary question recently that in Monaghan, where we have a backlog of 423 applications and a delay in handling them, we are now only dealing with the 1974 applications and we got an allocation of £122,000 last year.  If we got the allocation on the number of applications, as the Minister said in 1975 &mdash; we believed since then it was under those conditions &mdash; we would have received £174,000.</P>
      <P>In Monaghan we have 5.8 per cent of the total number of schemes of 7,272 but we are only getting 4 per cent of the total number of applications.  We have a shortfall of £50,000.  When I asked the Minister for the Environment a question about the criterion used in the allocation of the funds he said that the local improvements scheme partly replaced schemes of grants provided for under the former employment and emergency schemes, from which the western counties benefited the most.  Accordingly, the practice over the years has been to allocate the major share of funds available under the scheme to those counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2204" /> However, last year eight counties outside the 12 western counties got a higher allocation on their backlog of allocations than did the western counties.  I ask the Minister to refer to the serious situation when some of those counties got 12 times per scheme, considering the waiting list, more than Monaghan.  The three counties which fared very badly out of this were Monaghan, Mayo and Donegal, and Mayo fared worse than Monaghan.</P>
    <P>I want to give part of my time to Deputy Conaghan to enable him to make a case for his county.  I mentioned the western measures.  In 1981 when the programme for development measures for the west came in it was stated that deficiencies in road systems must be overcome as a prerequisite for further development. Under the measure, £15 million FEOGA aid over a ten year period or approximately £1.5 million per annum would be available for farm roads, accommodation roads and local roads and approximately £0.78 million would be available annually for farm roads and the balance, £0.72 million, for county roads.  The FEOGA aid was to be supplemented by State funds of £20.5 million. We did not get the allocation when the scheme came in in 1981 and now instead of being supplemented we find it is to be reduced in 1984.  I ask the Minister to look at that and to give the allocation in accordance with the backlog of applications and to be fair about it.  The allocation may be reduced but at least each county should have a fair share in the distribution of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Leonard's concern in relation to the application for moneys for the local improvements scheme.  Donegal is getting a very small proportion of the entire moneys distributed throughout the country. Donegal has 24.6 per cent of the schemes but we got only 12 per cent of the total allocation in 1983.  That year a total of £3 million was allocated for local improvements schemes.  According to the <Col N="2205" /> Estimates this year there will be only about £2.15 million for this type of work and if the same criteria are applied in the distribution of the money Donegal will come in short in relation to the demand there.  This scheme is used very extensively in County Donegal particularly in the development of bog roads.  No moneys are available for the making of roads into the bogs and this allocation is the only means we have of getting moneys in order to provide people with means of access to their turf.  It seems that the present system of allocating the moneys discriminates against the western counties, particularly the counties which could benefit extensively from the schemes.  I ask the Minister to think again about the distribution of this money throughout the country.  I ask him to tell the House tonight how he arrived at the figures for allocation.  The allocation made, as I have said, discriminates against the county I represent and against the counties on the western seaboard.</P>

      <P>In relation to the charge that three counties have done particularly badly under this scheme, let me say that for 1983 Donegal received a total allocation of £363,000, Mayo received £371,000 and Monaghan received £122,000.  From my observation of the allocations I can say that Mayo got more money than any other county with the exception of Kerry which received the same amount.  Donegal received £8,000 less than those two counties which put it in third place on the total allocation for 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating that of the moneys given Mayo and Kerry received the largest amount and Donegal the second largest.  Undoubtedly Monaghan received less, and I take into account the applications that were available to the Department from the various counties in the allocation of the scheme.  I would not like it to go out that two counties which were at the top of the list in allocations <Col N="2206" /> were somehow left much shorter than any other county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this scheme Deputies should note that about 85 per cent of expenditure under the scheme related generally to non-public roads.  In 1984 the Government are providing some £125 million for roads compared with £120 million last year, when the ordinary road grants and local improvements schemes are taken into account.  In other words, we are providing an extra £5 million for roads this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall approach is based on the general principle of getting value for money and making the best use of our limited resources in the present difficult economic situation.  In 1984 the Government provided £2.15 million for grants under the scheme in respect of farm road projects eligible for EEC aid under the Western Package.  This compares with an expenditure of £3 million <Col N="2207" /> last year.  The 1984 scheme does not apply to projects such as drainage schemes and works on bog roads which do not come within scope of the package.  EEC aid is conditional on a minimum local contribution of 10 per cent from benefiting landholders and is confined to the western counties.  Local authorities were notified by circular letter to this effect on 19 December 1983.  The authorities concerned will be notified of the 1984 allocation shortly.  The provision of £2.15 million compares with a previous provision of £2.14 million last year for the Western Package element of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I have not time to develop the point, but I can say that we can show that this represents an increase over the allocation made when the Deputies' party opposite were in power.  A sum of £2 million was given in 1980 and that was a drop from £2.75 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The provision in 1979 <Col N="2208" /> was £2.75 million for the whole country. That was reduced to £2 million in 1980. We are trying to build up our national primary roads, at the same time giving value for money by increasing the Road Fund and getting full value from the EEC for money spent under the local improvements scheme.  That would be regarded as the best possible policy for any Government in a time of stringency such as we have at the moment.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of Dún Laoghaire Corporation, the local authority with responsibility for the water <Col N="2086" /> supply.  The corporation have indicated that they are aware of the problem of weak water pressure in the area concerned and that they have been carrying out waste water investigations.  As a result the corporation hope to reduce leakage and waste and thus improve the supply.</P>
      <P>In the longer term an improved supply to the area will result on completion of Contract No. 7 of the Liffey Aqueduct Duplication Scheme which is expected to be completed towards the latter part of 1984.

      <P>The abatement of water charges is not so confined.  Under the provisions of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, local authorities are empowered to waive all or a portion of a water charge on the grounds of personal hardship.  The operation of the waiver provision is the determination of the criteria to be applied and the application of those criteria in assessing hardship in individual cases is a matter for each local authority concerned. Following enactment of the legislation to which I have referred local authorities were asked to examine applications for waivers of domestic charges on their merits and in a sympathetic and considerate manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>VAT was correctly charged in this case by the printer on the cost of supplying the booklet to the community festival committee.  The fact that the booklet was then distributed free of charge by the committee does not affect the position. There is no provision for repayment of tax in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>In general voluntary bodies such as the festival committee, providing goods and services to the community, may be regarded by the Revenue Commissioners as not being &ldquo;in business&rdquo; for VAT purposes. As such, they are exempt from VAT.  &ldquo;Exemption&rdquo; means that such groups do not have to register for, or charge, VAT on goods or services provided by them, even where a charge is made for such goods or services.  On the other hand, such groups must bear, without refund, any VAT charged to them on their inputs.  There are a number of reasons for not altering this system. Firstly, there is the cost, which could be very substantial.  Secondly, it would be next to impossible for the Revenue Commissioners to administer a system of refunds for voluntary bodies generally. Thirdly, the best method of giving State aid, where funds are available, is directly through the appropriate State Departments or agencies.</P>

      <P>Following a review of his unemployment assistance claim, the means assessed against the person concerned were increased from £1.40 per week to £7.65 per week from 18 January 1984.  These means are derived from land.  He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at the rate of £72.65 per week being the maximum rate payable to him £80.30 less means £7.65.</P>
      <P>He was given a form for completion to enable him to appeal against the assessment of his means.

      <P>The old age pension claim of the person concerned was investigated and forwarded to the local pension committee for decision on 30 November 1983.

      <P>A claimant is disqualified for receipt of an unmarried mother's allowance as long as she and any person are living together as man and wife.  It was held that this disqualification applied to the person concerned and her claim was therefore disallowed.
