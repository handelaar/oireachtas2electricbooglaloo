    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if each Minister of State has responded to his request to resign membership of local authorities; if not, the names of the Ministers who have not resigned; and the authority and committees of which they continue to be members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question on 18 January 1984.  The position has not changed since that time except in respect of Deputy Séamus Pattison, Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, who has resigned from the South-Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying that his Ministers of State have refused to act on his request to them to resign their membership of local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said anything about a request.  In reply to previous questions I stated that I notified them of the practice of previous Governments <Col N="1668" /> which included the Fianna Fáil Government from 1979 to 1981 in which six Ministers of State remained members of local authorities until the end of the life of that Government and the practice of the short lived Fianna Fáil Government of 1982 during which four Ministers of State and one Minister remained members of various local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As did Deputy Flanagan. Did the Taoiseach write to the Ministers of State asking them to resign their membership of local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated the practice of previous administrations to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there is a definite conflict of interest in the case of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment retaining membership of Dublin Corporation?  In view of his statement to the House last week that he played a major role in the formation of policy in regard to reforming local authorities, drawing up new electoral boundaries for Dublin Corporation and in relation to the proposed metropolitan council to serve the needs of the Dublin local authority area and in view of his participation in and funding of these local authorities, surely the Taoiseach must agree that there is a definite, identifiable conflict of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach seriously expect that by giving such a negative answer he can hope to retain credibility in the eyes of the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach in relation to the two vacancies which exist <Col N="1669" /> on the Law Reform Commission, if he will indicate in each case when the Government were informed of these vacancies by the Attorney General; and the reason they were not subsequently filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No formal proposals for the filling of the vacancies have been submitted to Government pending an overall review of the work of the commission. The Government were, of course, notified on each occasion when the vacancies occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not answer my question.  As regards the information I sought, he said that no formal complaint had been made.  With the exception of two of the nine reports the Law Reform Commission seem to be operating with only three of their five members.  Since the legislation under which they were established specifically states that the commission shall consist of a president and four members, does the Taoiseach agree that the commission are acting in contravention of the law under which they were established?  Does he agree that since the commission are making a number of recommendations in the areas of law they are currently examining, the absence of two members can make a significant difference to the recommendations which the commission might make?  If the commission are to continue to operate satisfactorily does he not think they should have their full quota of members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the Deputy that both vacancies were notified to me by the Attorney General but that no formal proposals for filling the vacancies have been submitted to the Government pending an overall review of the work of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very unsatisfactory. How long will it take for the Government to review the overall performance of the commission?  These vacancies have existed for some time.  In <Col N="1670" /> relation to an article which appeared in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday, will the Taoiseach confirm or deny the report that a complaint has been lodged with the Attorney General to the effect that there seems to be some connection between a member of the staff of the commission and a secret religious organisation?  What action does he propose to take if that is true?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of local authority dwellings made available for reletting in each year since 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of vacant local authority dwellings that became available for reletting in each year since 1979 have <Col N="1671" /> been as follows: 1979, 2,132; 1980, 2,341; 1981, 2,056; 1982, 2,182; 1983, 2,753.</P>
      <P>Figures for 1984 are not yet available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the number of houses available for reletting in 1983 was 2,753.  In <i>Building on Reality,</i> the Minister said that 3,000 houses would be made available for reletting each year. How and when does the Minister hope to achieve that target?  Will there be 3,000 houses available for letting in 1985?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the £5,000 grant scheme for local authority tenants of three years' standing will provide a number of additional houses to the local authorities to enable them to add to the average total which is around a figure of 2,500.  The figure of 3,000 houses should be achieved with that incentive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will give details of the changes in rent levels of local authority houses as mentioned in <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether prior consultations with the National Association of Tenants' Organisations will take place before the implementation of changes in the differential rent scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will give details of proposals to raise local authority house rent levels more in line with the actual costs of local authority housing; and when it is proposed to introduce the increased rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the national plan, it is intended that rents of local authority dwellings should be raised progressively to a level more in line with the actual costs of the dwellings and that the changes will be made within the framework of the differential rent scheme, which ensures that rents are reasonable in relation to family incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> Proposals for a revised rent scheme, to come into effect from the beginning of 1985, have since been put to the National Association of Tenants' Organisations. At this stage, it would not be appropriate for me to give details of likely changes in rent levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the new rents come into operation on 1 January?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister make the proposals which he has made available to the National Association of Tenants' Organisations available also to this side of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will give a list of minor repairs and maintenance works which will not be carried out in future by local housing authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Discussions on the various housing matters dealt with in the national plan, including the proposed arrangements in relation to the carrying out of minor repairs and maintenance of a routine nature to local authority dwellings took place recently between officers of my Department and a group of local authority managers.  Circular letters dealing with relevant aspects of the plan will be issued to local authorities shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not prepared to give the House some of the information requested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1673" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Details will issue shortly and I can make them available to the Deputy if he requires them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any decisions been made yet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy is aware of what was suggested in the national plan, that minor repairs should be undertaken by tenants.  There is nothing unusual in this since the standard tenancy agreement which governs all local authority housing provides that a tenant is responsible for all internal decoration, breakage of glass or damage to fixtures and fittings.  He is also responsible for the proper maintenance of fences surrounding his garden or plot.  It further obliges him to make good such damage without delay or, if the damage is made good by the local authority, to pay such cost.  This part of the tenancy agreement has not always been applied in the past but all local authorities are now being asked to operate it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that local authority tenants are concerned that they will have to pay for repairs which were hitherto undertaken by the local authority?  This is a penny-pinching exercise and many people are very surprised that he, as a Labour Party Minister, would inflict this on one of the weaker sections of the community, people who are unable to provide homes for themselves and who depend on the State to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that in cases of hardship we will indicate to local authorities that they should continue to carry out these repairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North West):</i> Is the Minister aware that in cases where houses are robbed and damage is done, <Col N="1674" /> the corporation have refused to carry out necessary repairs?  In many cases it involves windows and old people who are unable to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, where hardship is involved and where tenants are unable to pay for repairs we will be asking the local authorities to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the specific steps which will be taken to promote joint venture housing projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>A circular letter about joint venture housing will be issued to local authorities as soon as a review of certain aspects of this type of housing has been completed.  I should add that all housing authorities were asked by my Department in February 1982 to encourage owner occupation through joint venture arrangements involving the provision of building land, under licence, for the construction of modestly priced houses for sale to selected purchasers.  Up to 31 March 1984, 17 housing authorities were participating in joint venture schemes resulting in the sale of 355 houses by seven authorities.  At that date a further 1,367 joint venture houses were at the planning stage among 14 of the 17 authorities.  Many participants in the schemes are availing themselves of Housing Finance Agency loans and the combination of such loans and of the new £5,000 grant for local authority tenants and tenant purchasers buying a private house and giving up local authority dwellings should give a boost to the demand for joint venture and other modestly priced new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the circular contain proposals whereby local authorities will be able to make land in their possession available at a nominal cost as I understand that this has been proving a major <Col N="1675" /> obstacle to local authorities participating in the joint venture programmes to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by a nominal cost but I am sure he is aware that local authorities have to pay the going rate for land which they also have to service in many cases. To suggest that land should be given at a nominal cost is something that I should have to consider very seriously before I could agree to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12, 13 and 14 together.  I am not aware that deterioration of the kind suggested by the Deputy is taking place.  Housing authorities are responsible for the maintenance and repair of their rented housing stock, including the drawing up of repainting programmes, and for the employment of staff in this connection.  I have no function in relation to these matters.  To meet the costs of the management and maintenance of local authority housing, the <Col N="1677" /> authorities have available to them the entire rental income from their estates, together with 40 per cent of the proceeds of sales of local authority houses and any other moneys from revenue sources that they may decide, at their discretion, to allocate for the purpose.  In addition, non-repayable grants are available from my Department in respect of certain improvement works to local authority dwellings and these may be supplemented in certain cases by the provision of loan finance.</P>
      <P>The national plan provides for the payment of a new subsidy on loan charges incurred by housing authorities in carrying out substantial improvements to categories of houses requiring major remedial works of a structural nature.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to require that all local authorities should operate a specified repainting programme or submit annual reports on such programmes to my Department. Neither do I consider it necessary to issue guidelines on a national maintenance programme for local authority dwellings.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister believe that a repainting programme with an interval of eight to ten years would be sufficient to maintain at least the quality of the timberwork of the housing?  Does he not think that a four to five year repainting programme would be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that I could agree with the Deputy that eight years appears to be an usually long interval between repainting being done on outside work.  However, I have pointed out to the Deputy that this is a decision for the local authorities.  I have indicated to them the money available to carry out this work at more frequent intervals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point I am making in my question. Where does the Minister's responsibility come in ensuring that at least local authority housing stock is maintained from <Col N="1678" /> the moneys available for that purpose? How does he know if they are being maintained if he does not issue any guidelines or receive back any reports?  Has he any idea of the deterioration existing in the housing stock?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking me to carry out the democratic duties of the local authorities and their public representatives.  I should think that they are in the best position to indicate what is needed in that area.  It is certainly one of the areas about which local elected Members are very diligent and they would make the necessary provisions in their Estimates to have this work one more frequently.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the major new towns of Tallaght, Clondalkin and Ronanstown-Blanchardstown, which will very soon have a population of 300,000, there is just one maintenance depot and that there are 11 painters for the whole of that enormous area?  Of these, seven are temporary, laid off in the winter and brought on in the spring and summer something like the nineteenth century farm hands.  Is the Minister aware that this is the way top class tradesmen are treated?  Does he consider this to be a satisfactory way of maintaining the housing programme in that area?  Would he examine the situation with a view to seeing that these men are made permanent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Dublin County Council, the area to which the Deputy is referring, employ 30 painters, six of whom are temporary workers, with the objective of painting one-fifth of their housing stock every year, weather and staff resources permitting.  That council last year and this year took on temporary painting staff during the summer months. This year, six temporary painters were taken on for the period 1 March to 31 October to paint housing schemes.  The staff involved requested an extension of the period to 31 December.  The council have agreed to this extension to 30 November. During the extended period, they <Col N="1679" /> have been involved in painting libraries and courthouses as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is very revealing.  He stated that there are something over 30 painters in the Dublin County Council area.  I am talking about Dublin West, a huge area where there are 11 painters.  In fact, with one vacancy there are ten painters.  The only six painters working for the Dublin County Council on a temporary basis are the six out in the Dublin West area.  Why is such discrimination being practised in the Dublin West area?  Painters are laid off for the winter time and are on a temporary basis.  Why can they not be on a permanent basis, the same as the rest of the county council painters?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say in reply is that this discrimination should be taken up at local authority level if the Deputy feels so strongly about it.  If that is the situation, that is the appropriate authority with which to take up the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the <Col N="1680" /> Minister for the Environment if he is aware that the Guinness hop store in Rainsfort Street, Dublin 8, which was renovated as a public building at a cost of £200,000 to the Exchequer, has no lift which would provide access for disabled persons to floors above the ground floor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed building regulations published earlier this year provide generally for access for the disabled to and within new public buildings. However, these regulations do not as yet have the force of law.  The Building Control Bill, which provides for the making of building regulations has completed Second Stage and moves to Committee Stage next and I hope to see it enacted in this session; this will enable the building regulations to be made and given legal force.</P>
      <P>However, when publishing the proposed building regulations earlier this year I issued a public statement asking all those concerned with design and construction to have regard to them.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Guinness hop store, I have been given to understand that conversion work is not complete and that the building was opened temporarily to house the ROSC exhibition because of a commitment given to do so.  I have also been informed that when the ROSC exhibition finishes on 17 November, 1984, the hop store will close to enable the remaining conversion work, which includes facilities for the disabled to circulate internally, to be completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate what facilities are proposed to be provided in the hop store to enable disabled persons to circulate particularly those in wheelchairs?  For instance, is a lift to be provided for them?  At the moment, something like 85 per cent of the building is inaccessible to persons confined to wheelchairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot give the Deputy that information.  I am <Col N="1681" /> assured that the disabled will be able to circulate through the building when work is completed.  I have been given this assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister also give us an assurance that buildings being provided in the State at the moment under existing regulations will be required to provide access for the disabled, not simply access to the ground floor but access to all floors where this is necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a very wide question and it would be for the experts who are designing and bringing forward their plans for the building.  At this stage I could not say that I can give that undertaking.  Naturally, it is up to the designers and architects to follow the building regulations which are being processed through the Dáil so as to enable the circulation of the disabled to those parts of the building which are designed and might be required for their access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of access for the disabled to buildings which are provided for public access, there is a grave need to ensure that the Department of the Environment are requiring that this access at least be provided. Would the Minister consider that applications where planning permission is being sought for public buildings or buildings for public access would at least be referred to some representative group for the disabled so that the applications could be vetted?  In many cases the absence of facilities for the disabled is simply an oversight on the part of the people making the proposals and the planning officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning process sets out the time limit in which any individual or group of individuals can study plans for any building.  I do not think that I could make a regulation that would require that planning procedure to be changed for just a certain category of individuals.  Nevertheless, I suggest that <Col N="1682" /> should the Deputy wish to read a copy of the building regulations, I will make it available to him and he will see that they are very strict indeed in this area.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they have the force of law and in the interim a considerable amount of building is going ahead. As a temporary measure pending the coming into law of the building regulations, would the Minister not require or request planning authorities to refer major building planning applications to representative organisations of the disabled to see if they meet the requirements of the disabled?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>All planning authorities have been made aware of the context of the building regulations and have been asked to take them into account when considering planning applications.  I do not think that it will be very much longer before the building regulations come into effect because the Building Control Bill is at Committee Stage and I hope to see all parts of that Bill through the House before the recess.  I think the Deputy is unduly concerned about this.  We are making every effort to see that building regulations, whether at the level of planning or in the process of law, can be achieved at the earliest possible date.

In regard to the second part of the question and the second supplementary question, as I said, the penalties for uninsured driving were increased substantially in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1984.  The former maximum fine of £100, which was specified in 1961, has been increased to £1,000.  The Road Traffic Acts also provide for imprisonment for a term of up to six months and disqualification from driving for at least one year for a second or subsequent offence in any period of three years.

      <P>I am so aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of county roads in County Galway rests with Galway County Council. The overall road grant allocated by my Department to the council in 1984 at £4.19 million represented an increase of <Col N="1687" /> 26 per cent on the grant of £3.33 million paid to the council in 1982 and an increase of 352 per cent on the grant of £0.928 million paid to the council in 1977.  The council may, at their discretion, apply the block grant to the improvement of county roads.  The council's block grant this year amounts to £812,000 compared to £733,000 in 1982 and £400,000 in 1977. State road grants were never payable in respect of the maintenance of county roads.</P>
    <P>The provision made by the council for financing road works from their own resources, including the rate support grant, amounts to £1.55 million in 1984 compared with £1.74 million in 1982 and £1.38 million in 1977.  The council's provision for 1984 reflects the fact that the charges for services and the increases in the levels of rates in 1983 and in 1984 applicable to Galway County Council are less than the corresponding typical figures for other areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 27, 30, 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>A circular letter has issued today to housing authorities giving details of the new grant.  The grant scheme will be administered generally by local authorities and payments will be made by my Department on receipt of the appropriate payment certificates from local authorities.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific matters raised in the questions the position is as follows: The operative date for the new scheme is 2 October 1984.  Subject to meeting the other grant conditions, an applicant will be eligible to receive the grant on occupation of the private house if the contract for the purchase of the private house was entered into on or after 2 October 1984, or where a new house is being built by him on his own site, if the foundations were completed on or after that date. The grant will be payable in one sum when the applicant has surrendered vacant possession of his dwelling to the local authority and has purchased and occupied the private dwelling.</P>
      <P>Because of the nature of the scheme, the actual payment of the grant cannot be made until the house has been purchased and occupied.  Some applicants may wish to use the availability of the grant in lieu of a deposit and for this purpose, local authorities are being asked to raise no objection if, for example, applicants wish to assign the payment to a third party such as a lending agency or a builder.</P>
      <P>The grant will in all cases be £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to ensure that moneys provided under the grant scheme will actually be applied towards the building or purchase of a house, it will be a condition of the scheme that any loan, together with grants payable, other than the mortgage subsidy, must not exceed the gross cost of the house, including reasonable legal and other incidental expenses. There is no question, however, of any automatic reduction of the amount of a <Col N="1692" /> loan by the amount of grant payable.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to anticipate the result of any specific application for a grant.  It will be a matter for the local authority concerned to deal with the application in accordance with the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

Naturally, I will examine the situation.  I will be placing details of the scheme for Deputies' consideration in the Library.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not all.  An applicant certainly will have to prove that he is the legal owner of the new house. Details of the scheme are being circulated to all local authorities today.  If the Deputy wishes to see these details I shall let him have them this afternoon.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke about a commencement date of 2 October and applicants having completed or signed contracts.  Could he clarify exactly what he means by the signature of a contract?  There seems to be some confusion among solicitors and so on about what contract the Minister is referring to.  For example, is it the title, the contract to purchase or to what exactly is he referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Any arrangements made or contracts entered into to purchase houses before 2 October will not be eligible.  I think the date of commencement <Col N="1694" /> of eligibility announced, 2 October, has been very generous.  I repeat that the operative date is 2 October.  Subject to compliance with the grant conditions, applicants must occupy the private house before the grant is payable.  That would assume that the contract has been completed and evidence to that effect will have to be furnished to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I am sure the Minister is aware that there will bound to be borderline cases with regard to the operative date of 2 October.  For example, I have had a number of inquiries about what contract the Minister is referring to when he says that contracts signed before 2 October will not render applicants eligible for this grant.  Could the Minister say what precisely is meant by the contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually when one is buying a house there is a solicitor dealing with the transactions.  For example, if it is a new house the applicant will sign a form with his and the builder's solicitor drawing up the necessary documentation. As soon as a purchaser signs the contract to purchase a new house, that becomes the operative date.  In the case of a second-hand house the same thing would apply: one would be called in by one's solicitor and asked to complete the necessary documentation, that is, signature of the contract at that stage.  The deed of title may not be presented on that precise date but certainly the contract for purchase would be signed by both parties and that would then become the operative date.</P>

As indicated in the national plan, the grant will apply to qualifying local authority tenants and tenant-purchasers who buy or build private houses and surrender their local authority dwellings in a condition suitable for letting to a housing applicant.  A house which had previously been purchased from a local authority and which is available for resale would be accepted as a private house for the purposes of the grant.</P>

There are, of course, wider issues affecting conveyancing which come within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Justice and of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who is at present considering a report by the Restrictive Practices Commission on the restrictions on conveyancing and the restrictions on advertising by solicitors.</P>

I am satisfied that a better effort is being made this year than was made in previous years to have these charges collected throughout the country.  In some counties perhaps the charges applied were not sufficient to meet the problems of those counties.</P>

      <P>I must make clear my <Col N="1700" /> disappointment about this transfer and my reading a deep significance into it.  I want to ask the Taoiseach if, arising from newspaper reports stating that the extradition to Britain of a woman who has been living in Dundalk was being sought by the British authorities in connection with a series of offences in Britain, he will state whether this is so and if he will make a full statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, (<i>Limerick East</i>): In the normal course, as the Deputy will appreciate, I would not be free to say whether a warrant seeking extradition had been received by the Garda Síochána since to disclose that kind of information would obviously interfere with the effectiveness of the procedure in those cases where it was in train.</P>
      <P>In the present instance, however, due to what I must criticise as a particularly unfortunate piece of newspaper publicity, the fact that a warrant has been received is now public knowledge.  The matter is being dealt with in accordance with the normal procedures.  There has been no delay on the part of the Garda Síochána, as has been publicly confirmed in London by Sir Michael Havers, Attorney General.  Equally I must stress that this is not a matter in which it would be at all proper or permissible to act with such haste that fundamental legal requirements might be ignored or overlooked. What is involved is a request for the arrest of a person in one jurisdiction and her being handed over to another jurisdiction.  It would be quite improper to treat that situation otherwise than in a formal way that reflects the nature of what is involved and a due respect for the rights of all concerned.  Beyond that I do not think I ought to go since obviously if the warrants are executed it must be taken as probable, and it is certainly possible, that there will be litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot accept that the article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> did nothing more than suggest that there were worries in British circles about possible difficulties here.  The tone and thrust of the <Col N="1701" /> article clearly conveyed the impression that there was an unjustifiable delay and an unwillingness on our side to operate the normal procedures.  There was a scarcely veiled suggestion that we were inventing difficulties.  For instance, there was a reference to the Garda Síochána rejecting warrants because of undisclosed errors, the word &ldquo;errors&rdquo; being placed within quotation marks as if they were simply being invented or put forward as excuses.  Elsewhere there was a reference to frustrating bureaucratic delays as if adherence to legal requirements was something that we ought not to bother about.  There was also a very clear suggestion that a person may be handed over to another jurisdiction for the purpose of being questioned.  That suggestion is totally misconceived.  Neither can I accept the excuse that the person concerned had, according to reports, already left her home at the time of publication.  Even if that is true, and I do not know whether it is, it is irrelevant.  There is all the difference in the world between what would at most be a rumour that a warrant might exist and a public disclosure that it does exist.  That is the situation and reflects the damage this publication has done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to agree with me that <i>prima facie</i> the editor of <i>The Sunday Times</i> seemed to have acted with a reasonable sense of responsibility in so far as he delayed publishing the story for a period of three weeks, that he telephoned the Irish Embassy and, in his own words cleared the story at the highest level with the British Government?  Would the Minister further agree with me that this would seem to clearly indicate, whatever about the validity of the story as a story, that it was given to <i>The Sunday Times</i> by somebody in Britain of the highest authority, possibly the Attorney General himself?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The only advance notice the Irish authorities had <Col N="1702" /> about the publication of this story was the telephone call by a reporter working for <i>The Sunday Times</i> to an officer working for the Irish Embassy in London on the afternoon of 9 November in which the reporter said he was willing to entertain any request which might be made to delay or withhold publication.  Before an opportunity had been given to respond to the statement, the same reporter made a further telephone call at 9 a.m. on 10 November in the course of which he said that the editor had taken a definite decision to proceed with publication.  Consequently, I could not agree with the first part of Deputy Haughey's supplementary.</P>
      <P>On the second part of his supplementary which speculates about the source of the information to <i>The Sunday Times,</i> I do not know who the source was, but I am confident it did not come from this side of the Irish Sea because there could be no possible benefit to anybody on this side of the Irish Sea for divulging such information.  I understand the people attached to <i>The Sunday Times</i> said their source was a London police source.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that whatever view he may take, about the telephone call, it did contain a certain degree of friendly responsibility by the editor of <i>The Sunday Times</i> who took the trouble to telephone the Irish Embassy before publishing this story? Furthermore, would he care to comment on the very clear and specific statement by the editor of <i>The Sunday Times,</i> whose word we have no reason to doubt in this matter, that &mdash; and I quote &mdash;&ldquo;it was cleared at the highest level in the British Government&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I should prefer that the Taoiseach would answer those questions because obviously he would have better knowledge of all this than the Minister has. Would the Minister agree that all the indications are that this story was planted in <i>The Sunday Times</i> by someone high up in British Government circles, probably the Attorney General, for whatever motive he may have had in mind?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;but not to follow through with the particular offer, to withdraw it at 10 a.m. the following morning, indicated that whatever the resolve may have been on Friday it had weakened considerably by Saturday morning.  I have answered already the question as to speculation on the source of the story.  I have no information on that other than what I have given but of its very nature the story appeared to me to be incompetent in so far as it displayed a very weak knowledge of the law of extradition.  There were basic errors in the story which anyone with even a passing acquaintence with extradition law would spot.  I find it difficult to understand how such mistakes could be made particularly the one suggesting that it would be international practice to extradite people for questioning.  That is an outrageous suggestion.  It would not be, and is not, entertained by any sovereign government.</P>

Would the Minister make it clear that in this case there was no question of a certain person being extradited for the purposes of questioning, something that all British newspapers, not only <i>The Sunday Times,</i> have adverted to?  Has the Minister satisfied himself that the proper procedures in this case have been followed to date, that a charge has been sworn against the person concerned, that it is clear that if the person is to be extradited, it is to face a charge and not in respect of questioning?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The law which governs our extradition proceedings is the Extradition Act, 1965.  That legislation was introduced by Deputy. Lenihan following earlier legislation which was introduced by Deputy Haughey in 1963.  The 1963 legislation was replaced subsequently by the legislation introduced by Deputy Lenihan consequent on certain court decisions.  As the Deputy is aware, our extradition law does not require the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case.  The procedure is that a warrant which has been sworn is sent from one police force to another.  Certain procedures are then followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not answering the question I asked.  I am aware of <i>prima facie</i> cases not having to be established but has the Minister satisfied himself that in this case an affidavit was sworn to the effect that the person concerned would face a charge in the British courts and was not being extradited purely for questioning?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The normal procedure was followed.  That procedure is still being followed and the Garda hope to exercise the warrant here. As an extradition warrant here does not require the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case, the authorities here, after certain procedures have been followed, act on the warrant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not yet answered my question.  He is well aware that the proper procedure in these cases is for the British police to go before a magistrate on the basis of an affidavit and to establish that a charge is being brought against a certain person.  Was that position followed in this case and if so, what were the charges in the affidavit as put before the British magistrate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): My understanding is that such a procedure was followed and that in the normal course of events a warrant was advanced <Col N="1705" /> here.  I understand that normal procedure was being followed when the story was published in <i>The Sunday Times</i>.  If Deputy Haughey is suggesting that there is any question of extraditing people for questioning, I can assure him that there can be no question of that happening.  A person can be extradited only in respect of a charge.</P>

Had it anything to do with the forthcoming Summit?

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I have no intention of speculating on the source of the story or on the motives of those who provided it.  I have said already that people in <i>The Sunday Times</i> have suggested that their story came from a senior Scotland Yard source but I would draw the Deputy's attention again to what Sir <Col N="1706" /> Michael Havers said in the statement he issued in London.  I presume that as Attorney General he is regarded as a high source in the British Government. Speaking on behalf of that Government he said that there is no truth in the allegation that the Garda have refused to arrest a named person, that an extradition warrant in respect of Evelyn Glenholmes was transmitted in due form to the Garda on Wednesday last after some earlier communications, that processing of such warrants takes some time due to the vital importance of ensuring that there is no deficiency or loophole that could vitiate the process and that he was satisfied that any suggestion of undue delay by the Irish authorities in processing the application was without foundation.  He said he was satisfied also that allegations of any political involvement in the process in Dublin, implicit in the reference to alleged Irish political difficulties and to the matter being in the hands of Irish politicians, are false.  He is the only high British political source on the record in this matter and he is now on the record of this House.</P>

Again, I deplore the fact that the Taoiseach is not answering these questions because he could tell us first-hand whether he believes that the story emanated from the British Attorney General.  Does the Minister share with me a very real feeling of resentment that the statement by the British Attorney General in the House of Commons regarding our Garda behaving with impeccability intimated that in some way there was residing in him some authority either to approve or disapprove of what our Garda do when we know that in this, as in all other matters, they comply fully with the law?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is implementing what has been done in many European countries.  In 1972 the Council of Europe passed a resolution that the age of majority be reduced from 21 years. They recommended the age of 18 years. Since then that age has been introduced in Northern Ireland, England and more recently in Germany, Luxembourg and Sweden.  It is important that this is being done here because it is of particular relevance to young married couples.  It is important that no legal impediment should stand in the way of young married couples, particularly as regards purchasing their own home.</P>
      <P>Under the 1965 Act one was entitled to make a will at 18 years of age and the referendum to reduce the age at which one could vote was passed in 1972 by a vast majority.  Young people can act as jurors since 1976.  Major progress has been made in this area and this Bill is a further step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significance of the Bill is that it gives legal standing to young people. They can enter into contracts, for example, to purchase property and enter hire purchase agreements.  Young people of 18 years of age can now be sued.  Prior to this many of them felt they could get away with misbehaviour, to put it mildly, because they had not reached the age of <Col N="1832" /> majority and their trustees were responsible for them.  Now an 18 year old can be sued and can sue.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain the position about a person's 21st birthday. Will it be an 18th birthday?  I have no doubt that the commercial world will be very anxious to find out.  A person's 21st birthday was a major breakthrough in his life.  Deputy Kelly might deal with the point relating to 18 and 19 year olds missing out on a 21st birthday.  There is a peculiar rule in law that a person attains a particular age not on the day they become that age but on the first moment of the day preceding the relevant anniversary of their birth.  For instance, if a person's birthday is on a Saturday their legal birthday is midnight the previous Thursday. I am sure not many people were aware of that.  It is ludicrous.  It is no harm that that rule is now abolished by section 4 of this Bill.  I do not know if that will have any significance for the Department of Finance but I see that the Minister has a peculiar grin on his face.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas which are not covered in the Bill, for example in relation to raising the age from 16 to 18 years under the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Order) Act, 1930, and the maintenance laws which are governed by the 1976 Act.  The Department of Justice should introduce legislation to increase the age from 16 years, as it stands at present, to 18 years.  I was delighted to hear that the Bill does not affect social welfare or taxation legislation.  It is important that the tax relief available to parents for the further education of their children continues to be available in future.</P>
    <P>An area which requires urgent action is that of criminal responsibility.  The age of criminal responsibility is much too young.  It should be increased sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very welcome.  The Law Reform Commission did an excellent job in examining the whole area and in proposing the heads of the Bill in their report.  The Department and the Minister are to be congratulated for acting on the <Col N="1833" /> report so quickly.  It is a major step forward for young people and I am happy to support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Deputy's concluding remarks with some interest.  I do not agree that the Minister has implemented the report of the Law Reform Commission.  It would be tempting to describe the Bill as one of the most cautious, conservative and uninteresting Bills to be brought before the House.  On reflection, cautious and conservative it is, but uninteresting it is not.  It is interesting for what it omits rather than for what it contains.</P>
      <P>On page 1 of the explanatory memorandum there is a statement that:</P>
      <P>The remaining recommendations in the Report (principally, those relating to the age for marriage and the requirement of parental or court consent for certain marriages and recommendations that certain ages should be changed for the purposes of adoption, income tax and social welfare laws) are being considered separately.</P>
      <P>This means that the Bill is extremely narrow.  How long will consideration of these proposals take?  When will we see proposals to implement the changes recommended by the Law Reform Commission or whatever changes the Government consider desirable if they do not agree <i>in toto</i> with the Commission?  In what form will these proposals appear? Will they appear as legislation in separate forms such as this Bill?  Will the changes to be made in the income tax law appear in taxation legislation?  Will changes in the adoption law appear in legislation dealing with adoption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains very little.  From the point of view of simplicity and easy access to law it would have been better to pospone the Bill so that the matter could be dealt with all at once.  The basic purpose of the Bill is to reduce the age of majority from 21 to 18 years.  This rule applies from the commencement of the Bill.  The Schedule to the Bill states that it will commence on 1 March 1985, but <Col N="1834" /> does this give sufficient time to adjust to the fundamental change being made in the Bill?  I realise that there are various transitional provisions to facilitate the changeover in the age of majority from 21 to 18 but I will be questioning on Committee Stage whether the time lag of four or five months is sufficient to allow the change to take place.</P>
    <P>Section 2 brings about the fundamental change in the law.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of that section states:</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) applies for the purposes of any rule of law and, in the absence of a definition or of any indication of a contrary intention, for the construction of &ldquo;age of majority&rdquo;, &ldquo;full age&rdquo;, &ldquo;infancy&rdquo;, &ldquo;infant&rdquo;, &ldquo;minor&rdquo;, &ldquo;minority&rdquo;, and of other cognate words and expressions in&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) any statutory provision passed or made before, on or after the commencement of this Act, and</P>
    <P>(b) any deed, will, court order or other instrument (not being a statutory provision) made on or after such commencement.</P>
    <P>The effect of that subsection is that any deed, will or other instrument which is made by an individual as opposed to statutory provisions made by Parliament, before the commencement of the Act, i.e. before 1 March 1985 and which refers to full age, majority, etc., will continue to be interpreted as if full age means the age of 21.  The intention is quite obvious, but could there be a situation where a person has already acted in some way other than executing a deed, will or instrument to which section 2 (2) (b) relates on the basis that full age means 21 as it does at present and whether such person could now find himself prejudiced by the fact that full age is now declared retrospectively to be 18?</P>
    <P>Section 2 (4) takes certain statutory provisions out of the ambit of the Bill.  It states that a change will not affect the construction of any reference to 21 years or the construction of references to full <Col N="1835" /> age, infancy, age of majority, etc. in certain legislation.  The legislation concerned is set out in section 2 (4) (b).</P>
    <P>Section 2 (4) (b) (v) refers to the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976.  This provision in the legislation directly contradicts the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission which recommended that section 11 of the Adoption Act, 1952, should be amended now to change the adoption law in a certain way.  Under our present adoption laws a married couple who propose to adopt a child must each have reached the age of 30.  A widow or widower who proposes to adopt a child on his or her own must also have reached the age of 30.  An adoption order can be made in favour of a married couple, each of whom has attained the age of 25 if they have been married for at least three years before the adoption order is made. Where, however, the applicants are a married couple and the wife is the mother of the child, only one of them needs to have reached a lower age of 21.  If one of them is the natural father or a relative of the child, each spouse must have reached the age of 21.</P>
    <P>In order for the mother, the natural father or a relative to adopt by themselves, they must have attained the age of 21 years.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that section 11 (3) of the Adoption Act, 1952, should be changed so as to allow a married couple, one of whom is the mother, the natural father or a relative of the child to adopt a child whether or not each has attained the age of 21.  This is a worthwhile and worthy recommendation and I see no reason why it should not be introduced now.  It seems to be in line with the spirit of any Age of Majority Bill which would be introduced in the House.  The Minister should look at the ages of 25 to 30 in the context of adoption laws and do something about reducing them, as proposed by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>We are talking about giving younger people responsibility so it is very difficult to know why this approach is not carried into the area of adoption law.  It is all the more peculiar when we see that the law <Col N="1836" /> of guardianship has been changed in this way along the lines recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  The provisions in the legislation before us on guardianship are exactly similar to those proposed by the Law Reform Commission in the draft Bill which they recommended to the Minister in their proposals.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill introduces a change in the rules about when a person reaches a particular age.  The effect of the section is to abolish the old common law rule that a person attains a particular age on the first moment of the day preceding the relevant anniversary of his birth.  This rule of common law has been extremely well established over many years.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that it should be changed and the Minister has changed it along the lines recommended by them.  However I note, having carefully read the working paper which preceded the report of the Law Reform Commission and the report itself, that they did not advance any reason for changing the law along those lines.  We are changing this provision simply because the British changed it in 1969&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the common law position thrown up any particular problems in this area between 1969 and the present which would make the need for this change obvious?  I submit that it has not and that the old position is well established. There is no reason given for the change and it is unnecessarily complicating the law.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on this aspect later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 (3) introduces a new rule for defining when a person reaches the age of 18 for the purpose of voting in certain elections, referenda and so on.  In effect, section 4(3) introduces a separate rule for <Col N="1837" /> calculating the date on which a person becomes 18 for the purposes of voting. There is a rule already introduced by section 4(1) for calculating the time at which a person reaches a certain age. Section 4(3) introduces a different rule to calculate the date on which a person reaches the age of 18 for the purpose of voting.  The date on which a person reaches the age of 18 solely on the time when the person is defined as reaching the age of 18.  Therefore, one wonders can there be a contradiction between section 4(1) and section 4(3).  Can a person become 18 on two different dates under this Bill as drafted?  Could the Minister also deal with this aspect?  Section 7 states:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding any rule of law, a will or codicil executed before the commencement of this Act shall not be treated for the purposes of section 2 or the Schedule as having been made on or after such commencement by reason only of the fact that the will or codicil is confirmed by a codicil executed after such commencement.</P>
    <P>One wonders about the necessity for that provision.  The position in relation to wills is that in the case of any ambiguity in a will, external or extrinsic evidence is admissible to show the intention of the testator and if that can resolve the ambiguity, the will is interpreted accordingly. However, the ambiguity to which section 7(2) impliedly adverts is the ambiguity introduced by the use in a will of such a term as &ldquo;age of majority&rdquo; and so on. If a person has made a will before the commencement of this Act and refers to the term &ldquo;age of majority&rdquo; or &ldquo;majority&rdquo;, surely it can be shown that at the time when the will was made that term was clearly understood to be 21.  There is any amount of external or extrinsic evidence available in case law and various legislative provisions to show that.</P>
    <P>The intention of the testator who refers to the age of majority before the commencement of this Act is quite clear. Of course, there is no harm in trying to further clear up the point &mdash; that is, if the legislation introduced to clear it up does <Col N="1838" /> not give rise to other unforeseen consequences. The provision which the Minister has introduced will give rise to some consequences which he has not envisaged. It seems somewhat ambiguously drafted.  However, that is a matter more appropriate to Committee Stage and I hope to deal with it more fully then.  It would seem that the approach adopted by the Minister in trying to copperfasten the situation by legislation when there is an apparent lack in the law, contradicts his approach in not adopting the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission to delete that portion of the Statute of Limitations of 1967 which was ruled to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the case of <i>O'Brien</i> versus <i>Keogh,</i> 1972 Irish Reports, page 114.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 of the Schedule to the Bill refers to trust instruments made before the commencement date where the subject matter is land or property to which an infant is beneficially entitled.  Subparagraph (1) of paragraph 3 ensures that the trustees under any such trust instrument may continue to apply the income of the land or property for the maintenance, education or benefit of the infant until he reaches the age of 21.  That seems fair enough.  However, subparagraph (2) of paragraph 3 changes the present law.  It provides that where the trustees of one of those trusts are, under section 42(4) or section 43(1) of the Conveyancing Act, 1881, empowered to pay the income from the trust to the parents or guardians of an infant on reaching his full age, they will also have power to pay that money over directly to the infant himself.  That is a substantive change in the law.  I just wonder why it appears here, rather than in separate property legislation.  It would seem &mdash; and I would be prepared to argue this &mdash; a most inappropriate place for such a substantive change in property law to appear.  It tends to make the law more confusing and more difficult to find and to leave general legal practice more open to the possibility of error.  It may also be mentioned, even though this again is more appropriate for Committee Stage, that subparagraph (2) is somewhat ambiguously drafted.  Does the term &ldquo;full <Col N="1839" /> age&rdquo; in subparagraph (2) in relation to instruments made before 1 March next mean 21 and after 1 March does it mean 18?  In relation to my difficulties on that paragraph, if a relevant trust is set up between now and 1 March next, allowing trustees to pay income to the parents of a child who has reached the age of 18, can the trustees pay it to the child himself?  In case the Minister thinks that a merely academic point, I can tell him that I have a specific query on that.  It can arise and has arisen in practice.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission referred to various matters which the Bill should include.  For instance, initially in their working paper the commission were concerned that the Bill should contain some provision to ensure that maintenance paid by virtue of an order under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, could continue to be made in respect of a child up to the age of 21 when that child was in receipt of full education.  They thought further about it and changed their initial recommendation. I prefer their initial recommendation, but feel that there was no necessity for the Bill to contain such a provision.  The same applies to their recommendation in relation to affiliation orders.  The Bill makes no change in the present position because the 1976 legislation and the legislation of 1930 covering affiliation orders both refer specifically to the age of 21.  They do not use terminology like &ldquo;age of majority&rdquo; or anything of that sort, which can give rise to difficulties in interpretation now.  That legislation specifically refers to the age of 21 and from that point of view the Law Reform Commission were mistaken in their discussion surrounding the working paper in thinking that this could have given rise to any difficulty.  In effect, the Bill as I read it makes no change in that present position.  However, the Law Reform Commission did recommend that the age of 16 should be increased to 18 in certain cases in the 1976 and the 1930 legislation.  That recommendation was worth while considering and it is <Col N="1840" /> regrettable that the Minister did not see his way to do anything about that at this stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have no personal objections to the Bill.  It is very difficult to have any objection to something which does so little.  This Bill will achieve as little as the Criminal Justice Bill which we had occasion to debate recently.  However, unlike the Criminal Justice Bill, it will do no harm.  From that point of view, I am not opposed to it.  It would be too strong to say that I support it, because it contains so little.  I can put on record the fact that I have no grave reservations or no deep philosophical opposition to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy O'Dea in his excellent and interesting but technical legal speech, I do not want to go into the details of the Bill and would not be as well equipped to do so as Deputy O'Dea, anyway.  I do want, with a certain amount of diffidence, to strike what I am sure will impress the House as a rather square note in regard to the principle of the Bill itself and a quick look through the report of last Thursday's debate does not appear to disclose that anybody has struck such a note.</P>
      <P>Before I strike that note, I must say that this subject belongs to an area like the whole of the closely related area of marriage law and the law bearing on the private and intimate departments of life. This is an area in which I find it very hard to make up my mind on almost anything. There are a few points of reference, a few firm conclusions that I think I have come to about this and that.  However, I am very far from feeling sure that I am right about most propositions in the general area of marriage law or the law of the family or any areas which are contiguous with these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as opposing this Bill.  Even if I did, party discipline would constrain me to support it in the lobby if that should arise, but the Bill should not pass through the House without sounding some reservation about the necessity for it in principle.  It has been welcomed in principle even though damned with faint praise by Deputy <Col N="1841" /> O'Dea as being something one could scarcely oppose because it is so small and slight.  Even that slight effect which the Bill has is something about which a reservation is legitimate.</P>
    <P>We are rather late in the queue of countries moving down the age of majority. That would not surprise me if only the British were concerned, because we do almost nothing without taking our lead from them.  That is a fairly modern trend here.  In the more rugged days of the early State when the Government were run by whichever party supplied them, to people who knew what independence was all about because they had fought for it or worked for it, that was not so conspicuously the case.  From the very area we are talking about I will give an instance.  I do not want to be taken as holding this instance up as particularly laudable and even now I would find it hard to have a judgment on it.  In 1935 the Criminal Law Amendment Act, introduced by a Fiánna Fail Government at the time, introduced a difference in the so-called age of consent between our law and the law in Britain, in other words the age at which it ceases to be a criminal offence to have sexual intercourse with a girl.  In Britain the age then was 16 and we made it 17. For reasons which I do not propose to pronounce on, I would find it very hard to lecture the House or anybody on such a theme.  All I am saying is that some Government here made their own minds up about what an appropriate age for this country was.  The Act contained other material with which I disagree bitterly and which there were reasons to object to even in 1935, but here was an instance in which a Government &mdash; I do not care what party supplied them &mdash; consciously addressed their minds to the Irish situation and said that it did not matter a damn what the English age was; this was a different country and we were going to come to our own conclusions.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with what Deputy O'Dea said about the Bill being apparently trivial, but the more trivial it is the more humiliating, in the sense that for the sake of such a trivial degree of uniformity we would enact a provision to bring our law <Col N="1842" /> into line with that of a country from which apparently we were so keen to be free. It is a moral certainty that if the British had not reduced the age of majority there some years ago, this Bill would not be before the House today.  I do not care if the Danes, the Dutch and the Greenlanders have done it, we would have found some reason for not doing it if the British had refrained from it.</P>

      <P>I am not casting doubt on the bona fides of anybody.  It is not a question of fides, it is a question of ingrained paddyism, the instinct to throw away and abandon what the people two generations ago fought for, to run our own affairs as we saw fit according to our own criteria.  That instinct has become ingrained in us in the last generation and we are running back to the English, not further away from them.  This is a small Bill to get into a heat about on a theme like this and I am not going to pursue that any futher.  However, I am not convinced that even the well-intentioned reasons behind this general proposal are adequate to justify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the purpose of such a thing as an age of majority, 21 years or whatever it is, is to protect young people against themselves, against the consequences of improvident conduct whether in the doing of business or anything else, and to put others on notice that they are dealing with young people who could not be held to the letter of a contract they might purport to make.  Since we seem to be heavily into historical references here &mdash; the Minister for Justice mentioned the age at which the capacity to don a heavy suit of armour could be imputed to a young man &mdash; as far as I am aware, the word &ldquo;minor&rdquo; has a Roman rather than common law origin and in the Roman setting meant minor than 25 years of age.  The Romans, as businesslike a people as ever were on the earth, regarded somebody up to the age of 25 as being perhaps in some respects insufficiently mature to carry out transactions without the agreement of a tutor.  I do <Col N="1843" /> not mean a tutor in the modern sense but usually a member of his own family who were there to protect him against the consequences of folly.</P>
    <P>I do not know that a case has been made that there is any grievous necessity for reducing this age.  Perhaps there is such a case.  There is no question but that the Law Reform Commission have gone to a great deal of trouble.  They have invited evidence and so on.  I did not listen to the evidence and I am not sure how far I would have been convinced by it had I heard it.  All I can say from my experience as a Deputy for almost 12 years and a Senator for three and a half years before that is that I do not remember having once had a single representation from a constituent of any age group citing as a grievance the fact that 21 was the age of majority.  I do not recall ever having had a representation from a mortgage institution, a bank or a financial institution urging me to get the law changed so that they might now be able to lend money to people to whom they were not now safe in lending it or being able to recoup it from them if they lent it.  I have had many odd representations in my time, as all Deputies have.  I do not mean to hold this one up to ridicule; far from it.  Perhaps I had better not give instances because one never knows whom one will hurt.  In the entire gamut of eccentricity which burdens a Deputy's postbag I do not think I have ever had a single letter or telephone call from anyone urging that the existing law needed to be changed in this direction. That leads me to believe that the reason we are doing it is the old &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; reason. That remark may be superficial or hurtful although that is not intended, and it may be grounded in ignorance.  There may be a crying need to reduce the age of majority to 18 in the interests of the 18 year olds themselves, but I do not know where that need arises or how pressing it is.  A large part of the Minister's speech and of other contributions centred on the problems of people who at the age of 18 are married.  The Minister in his speech <Col N="1844" /> said and I quote from the Official Report of 8 November 1984, column 1564, Volume 353:</P>
    <P>The principal areas of law that will be affected are contract, property and guardianship.  Full contractual capacity will now be acquired at 18 or, if a person marries before that age, at the date of marriage.  I am glad to say that one effect of this will be to remove an obstacle in the way of many young married couples seeking to buy a home.</P>
    <P>No matter what I say here, someone will be malicious or dim enough to put an unintended slant on it.  I do not want to be accused of lack of sympathy for young married people whether they have a home, have not got a home, want to buy a home or whatever, but it would be a pity if this Bill passed the House without at least one Deputy saying that perhaps the more obstacles there are in the way of people getting married at 18 the better. I am quite aware that that is a square opinion, but I have teenage children. Two of my children are over 18 and the other three are below it.  Many Deputies here are in a similar situation, and we cannot be accused of not having some instinctive appreciation of maturity at least in the sense that we would expect to see it in our own children.  I think that 18 years is too young for marriage and it was a scandal that for many years the law of this country permitted, in theory, girls to get married at 12 years of age and boys at 14 years of age.  If I may lecture the House for a moment about the origins of that, that law goes back through canon law to the Emperor Justinian and beyond him to the Roman jurists of the second century AD, a school of jurists who believed that the appropriate age to permit people to get married at was the average age at which puberty might be imputed to either sex.  That was the law of a school of Roman jurists which had come up through Justinian and canon law and was still the law in this country when I came into the Seanad in 1969.  How could one stand over that type of thing?  I can recall <Col N="1845" /> complaining about it at the time.  Finally the law, not in consequence of my complaints but because of the inherent absurdity of it which began to get people by the throat, raised the age to 16; but is 16 an appropriate age for marriage?</P>
    <P>I hope it will not be thought that this is simply a square prejudice of a notoriously square Deputy.  I have only to turn to one of the less square Deputies, my own respected and admired colleague, Deputy Shatter, who is reported in the same volume of the Official Report &mdash; if any Deputy was likely to play down such a thing, and I do not mean to dishonestly play it down, if any Deputy were more likely than another to put this in what might be called some humanistic perspective it would be Deputy Shatter &mdash; as drawing attention to the fact that Dr. Helen Burke in a working paper printed as an appendix to the work of the Law Reform Commission makes well the point that research has established that marriages of very young people are more at risk than marriages between people in an older age group.  Dr. Helen Burke is a nationally respected figure and it is important to have the authentication of a very distinguished sociologist for a point like this, but it scarcely was needed because we all know that marriages contracted at a very young age are marriages which are heavily at risk.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to swallow &mdash; it very likely is ignorance &mdash; the fact that in one part of the House, methaphorically speaking, there is a committee which is scratching its head over problems of marital breakdown whereas in the Chamber we are using the fact that people are getting married at a younger age, notwithstanding the fact that that is at the root of perhaps the majority of breakdowns, as a ground for changing the law on the age of majority. I wish somebody would explain to me the logic of that proceeding.  I do not wish to make a party political point about this. I know Deputies opposite are as anxious as any Member on this side to make the law right, but I am defeated by the logic of the Dáil's concern as a body.  In one breath it sets up a committee to investigate marital breakdown, the major factor <Col N="1846" /> in which, as I understand it, is the marriage of people who are inherently immature because of their age.  I accept that there are other factors such as alcoholism and so on.  In the next breath the House, in its plenitude, is enacting something which is intended to facilitate extra young marriage.</P>
    <P>So far from being callous about young people in their situation I should like to give the House some examples, and I am not saying that every Member could replicate one hundred times over.  I had coming to my clinic, when I had a clinic, young people looking for houses on the Dublin Corporation list or the Dublin County Council list.  It would break one's heart to see a young couple coming in looking for a house, the girl not out of her teens and the boy barely out of his teens; the girl with a crying infant by the hand and expecting another or, perhaps, two infants by the hand and expecting a third and the boy in despair.  Both of them with their youth still ahead of them but shackled for life to a situation which, perhaps, they may have already regretted entering into.  Naturally, I am not pretending that the presence of the children does not complicate the matter.  I accept that it complicates it and it makes it horrifically difficult to answer, but I have found that very young people, having got married, decided they had made a mistake after realising that they were barely 20 and had their youth ahead of them.  Youth is there to be enjoyed as much as a single person as as a married person.  I cannot see anything disreputable, sinful or <i>libertinist</i> in saying that the twenties for a single person can be marvellous years.  I say that without any <i>double entendre</i> or anything of that type. They can be marvellous years and one can have marvellous freedom as a single person then.  Any person who throws them away without the most serious reasons of absolutely indelible attachment to another human being is taking a very heavy gamble in the stakes of life. That person is putting a great part of his or her life on a square which rarely comes up on the roulette table.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of people remaining <Col N="1847" /> single for a long time.  I am not trying to lay down a rule.  I do not want to propose a rule about this but the idea that people ought to be encouraged to hustle into marriage, the idea that the House is trying to remove an obstacle from their doing so while in another part of the House some other Members are beating their brains out trying to solve the mess which this creates seems to be an illogical proceeding.  I wish I could be persuaded otherwise.  I have very few clear ideas on this subject.  I would be in despair if I was asked to draft a law of this type.  I do not know how to go about reforming family law; but this proposal has not, perhaps, been sufficiently considered &mdash; Deputy O'Dea pointed that out in a fine speech &mdash; perhaps in relation to some of the contiguous areas of law.  My objection to it is that it does not seem to have been sufficiently considered in relation to the very fact that it purports to remove an obstacle from extremely young marriages.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the Minister's point that an obstacle was being removed in regard to loans and so on.  He said that this was removing an obstacle in the way of many young married people seeking to buy a home.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has received a guarantee from the Irish banks that they, and their hard-headed business people whose money is on the line, are going to reduce the age of majority. There is no legal compulsion that I know of on a bank to lend money to anybody if the bank decides he or she is not a good risk.  If banks and loan institutions are of the view that 21 years of age is the absolute minimum age at which they are going to take somebody on their books the mere fact that the Oireachtas decides to sink the age to 18 is not going to make them change their minds.  Perhaps, the Minister has an undertaking from the joint standing committee of the Irish banks in his pocket that they will revise their guidelines downwards.  I am not trying to make a sarcastic point at the Minister's expense because he may have such an assurance.  However, I should <Col N="1848" /> like to know if we are removing this obstacle, which I have grave doubts we ought to be trying to remove, that at the very least it will confer the benefit the Minister thinks it will.</P>
    <P>If I were a bank director &mdash; they do not come much squarer than that; the people who have to make money for themselves and their shareholders out of bank profits &mdash; and I was living in a period of recession, when notoriously a lot of people find it hard to meet their payments and a large provision has to be made for bad debts and so on, I would say to myself; &ldquo;It is absolutely sweet that the Dáil should be giving these young people a present of majority three years earlier but they are still gormless 18 year olds as far as I am concerned.  They are, as far as I am concerned, people that are not safe risks for lending money to&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot control what private lending institutions do.  I do not know that they have decided to follow the Minister three years downdate with this Bill.  We will all look proper fools if not only are we removing an obstacle from early marriage which, perhaps, we ought not to be removing at all but if the obstacle we are removing does not have the effect of conferring the benefits which we are promising.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make is a niggling lawyer's point.  The Minister mentioned what the Law Reform Commission stated in their working paper, which they cite again in their report.  They had cited an argument based on Article 41 of the Constitution.  That Article states:</P>
    <P>1.  1ºThe State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>2º The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>I have great admiration for the Law Reform Commission and have on one or <Col N="1849" /> two occasions written to tell them that, that they do a great deal of extremely good work and do not receive much recognition from the Dáil for doing so.</P>
    <P>The commission said that they noted from this that it could be argued that no legal impediments or obstructions should be placed in the way of young married persons solely on the ground of age and that such persons should have the legal capacity to acquire a home and to furnish it.  If that Constitutional argument is true does it bind the banks, if they decide not to lend money to somebody under the age of 21?  That is the practical question arising out of this proposition of the Law Reform Commission.  But it is a very weak argument anyway.  It could be argued &mdash; and this is the proposition the State is committed to &mdash; that if the family is the natural and primary fundamental unit group of society, if the State is committed to protecting the family in its Constitution and authority, surely an equally arguable corollary is that our laws &mdash; in so far as one can do such a thing with laws &mdash; ought to inhibit the contraction of marriage, which is the basis of the family, by people who are notoriously, not through their fault but because of their stage of maturity, likely to run that family on the rocks?</P>
    <P>I know there are plenty of exceptions. I was speaking last week to my colleague, Deputy Joe Doyle.  He makes his speech and I do not want to go over the ground for him.  Deputy Doyle &mdash; because of his avocation in civil life, has had enormous experiences of marriages.  He contradicted me in what I said about early marriage. He said he knew a very large number of extremely happy and successful marriages which had been contracted very early.  Deputy Doyle knows this. That lends greater depth to his point of view than I could claim for mine.  But, if there is an argument to be made in the opposite direction &mdash; and all the statistics seem to suggest that there is &mdash; that the younger the age group from which marriage partners come the greater the risk that the marriage will go on the rocks, then it could be argued that that very same constitutional article requires the <Col N="1850" /> State, in so far as it can, to inhibit the contraction of marriage among people who are very likely to make of that marriage, not something which will protect the family but something which will put it in peril.  When I say &ldquo;inhibit the marriage&rdquo; I do not mean to forbid them to marry forever.  Naturally, I just mean to apply a certain age limit which most certainly ought not to be 12, 14 or even 16.</P>
    <P>A certain lack of logic in this area is displayed on the far side of the House as well.  Naturally I do not mean this in a partisan way.  I see that Deputy Woods in his speech &mdash; incidentally this is a very common feature of debate in an area like this &mdash; in the House on Thursday, 8 November, 1984, as reported at column 1571 of the Official Report, said:</P>
    <P>... the Bill contains a specific element of exclusion.  It does not include the commission's proposal that the free age for marriage should be the same as the age of majority.  This will mean that it will continue to be necessary for people between the age of 18 and 21 to obtain the consent of parents, guardians or the court before being permitted to marry.  It seems illogical that such an exception should be continued when it is accepted that a young adult has a right to acquire or to dispose of property or to enter into contractual arrangements with third parties and to be responsible for the legal obligations that arise therefrom.  The same young adult, without reference to his parents, to his guardians or to the courts can enter into a contract with a building society in respect of a mortgage.</P>
    <P>Where is the comparison, the logical parallel, or how am I forced into a logical dilemma by accepting one arm of the existing law but rejecting the other? Where is the comparison between the status of marriage, which is more than just a contract, and buying a second-hand motor vehicle?  Where is the comparison? I am free to do one at age 21 but not at age 18.  Where is the logic in suggesting that merely because one kind of function is permissible at a particular age every <Col N="1851" /> other kind of function should be permissible at that age also?  I know that kind of argument is often heard but I simply cannot see the logic of it.  What is so irrational about grading according to age, so far as imperfect reason can do so, the functions which a citizen is now free or still unfree to perform?  At present we have such things in other departments of law, for example, specifying that somebody under 18 years of age cannot buy alcoholic drink or if a citizen is under the age of, I think, 16, he is not allowed to buy tobacco, although I do not think that law is ever enforced.  Perhaps that age is 14 but, whether it is 14 or 16 does not matter, it is not enforced anyway; it might as well be two.  The point I am trying to make is that here is a case in which the Legislature, some legislature, has said: all right, some children should be allowed to buy cigarettes at 16 but cannot be allowed to buy drink until 18.  Where is the necessary connection between tobacco and drink that makes it essential to bring these ages into line with one another?  Surely it is a defensible way of proceeding to say that one function is perhaps less injurious &mdash; and we know now that tobacco probably is more injurious &mdash; but in the days when that perception was not available there was nothing illogical in saying that one function was more injurious than the other and, accordingly, we will attach a slightly higher age to the exercise of that function by a young person than we do in the case of the other.  What is illogical about that? Where is the logical necessity that compels me to equate, for the purposes of permitting someone to exercise a function, for example, buying a second-hand Anglia with taking on a partner for life? I had better not say anything offensive to Deputy Woods.  This is not a partisan debate.  Even if I did say something offensive here he would know that I would not mean it in a partisan way.  But that is the kind of logic which has this whole area damned.</P>
    <P>At the risk of boring the ears off the House let me repeat &mdash; so that I will not be misrepresented inside or outside it &mdash;<Col N="1852" /> that I am not taking up a line about this matter because I have not entirely made up my mind about it yet, nor have I seen the legislation promised.  But the Government and the Minister might consider the implications of this proposal for whatever the Minister for Health proposes to bring forward in connection with changes in the law about the availability of contraceptives.  One of the few things about which I am sure in all of this is that the 1935 Criminal Law (Amendment) Act was wrong in applying criminal law methods to the control of contraceptive devices.  Ever since this matter was first debated in the second year I was in this House, in 1974, I have repeatedly stated my belief that, in general, contraception is a matter so private, so intimate, so little susceptible to the State probing its nose over one's shoulder, and so revolting if the State does attempt to do that, that it should be taken quite outside the criminal law altogether.  I have never made a secret of my belief about that and I am not going to make pretences about it now.</P>
    <P>I accept that the State, at the same time, has a right and a duty to exercise reasonable measures of protection for young people.  I accept also the evidence which I seem to be getting in postal lobbying coming in every day, that excessively free access to contraceptives may, with very young people, lead not to fewer illegitimacies but to more, may lead them into situations &mdash; I am not going to go into great detail on this &mdash; may lead them prematurely into situations they are not able to handle.</P>
    <P>If that is so there is a case for having a lower age limit &mdash; I am not even sure that it will be possible to enforce it; I do not believe that it is enforced even now &mdash; above which the State, in my opinion, should decriminalise the thing altogether, subject to reasonable precautions for public decency and the absence of advertising and at which all sorts of people can be genuinely and reasonably offended.  I accept there is a case for protecting young people up to a certain age, but I have not made up my mind what that age should be and I am not sure what I will say if the <Col N="1853" /> matter is debated here.</P>
    <P>The effect of this legislation will be to put an extra implement into the hands of those who say that age should be 18 years.  Perhaps it should be 18 years but I am inclined to think that age is too low. I am not sure any age limit can be effectively enforced, but assuming in favour of such legislation that it can be enforced, in my view 18 years is a bit too low, although I may change my mind about that.  If I am right in thinking 18 years is too low, this Bill will deliver an implement into the hands of those who think otherwise.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have struck a dissenting note.  I know the Bill is very well intended and I would like to compliment the Law Reform Commission on their work and the Minister on having taken their work seriously, which is something too seldom done, but I do not think it would be right if the Bill passed through Second Stage before some general reservations were expressed about the principles behind it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy Kelly's speech particulaly his reservations because of what it would mean and has meant to early marriages. He spoke of meeting young people in his constituency and how burdened he feels they are.  I would like to put forward the idea that perhaps our education system is not fulfilling its role with regard to civic, family and domestic responsibilities which young people will come up against when they leave the formal school system.  Rather than say that people in their teens and early twenties should be enjoying their years in the single state, in my view that is a matter for individual passions.  Many young people make a commitment to have a meaningful relationship early in life which will probably lead to an engagement and then to marriage.  In many cases these marriages are very successful.  It requires determination, character and a sense of stability for a young person to cope with an early marriage and children.  I share Deputy Joe Doyle's belief that many young marriages are very successful <Col N="1854" /> because the people involved have youth and hope on their side.  Many people in their late twenties or early thirties may be jaded with life and may have become blasé, but young people have the idealism and determination to make a relationship work.</P>
      <P>I do not like to be as pessimistic about young people as Deputy Kelly, although I recognise that he sounded his warnings in a paternalistic way.  He suggested that they are stepping into an area with which they cannot cope, but my view is that their natural ability, spirit and vigour will enable them overcome any financial or other difficulties they might meet in the early years of marriage.  Young people have a resilience missing in many older people.  I speak as one who started married life very early.  When one is young one gets up in the morning very bright and ready to face whatever the day holds. Building a home, getting the finances necessary, facing the future and so on seem very trivial to young people.  Looking back I wonder how we coped, but because we were young we were able to cope.  In my view Deputy Kelly is underestimating the resilience and spirit of the young people.  Like Deputy Kelly I too have a young family and I admire their resilience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received a great deal of representation about this Bill from young people in my constituency, by post and by way of deputation in this House &mdash; this may be because I am Opposition spokesman for Education.  The eminent person quoted by Deputy Kelly said that one of the reasons for broken marriages was the young age at which these people were wed.  In my view the reason for many broken marriages lies not in the age at which they entered into this contract but in the lack of preparedness for marriage.  I have known young women of 17 or 18 years leaving secondary school with two As, two Bs or two Cs, going to university or some other third level education.  These young women would not have a clue about how one would get a mortgage, how one would interview a bank manager or how one would find out <Col N="1855" /> who was the local engineer or county manager and so on.</P>

      <P>Gallantry is not dead in Dáil Éireann.  That young person would not know how central or local government works or how one goes about one's daily life.  Many of the difficulties young people face are caused by the lack of relevance of second level education to life outside the school walls.  The gap between these two areas is huge.  The second level curriculum should cover many of the areas to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>In his Second Stage speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>This Bill is an important piece of legislation which will affect our society in many ways and will I believe have significant effects for our young people by enabling them to take responsibility for the conduct of their daily affairs.</P>
      <P>That sounds very good but if our education system does not help them to play their role in life outside the schoolroom, we will have failed.  It is an anomaly that a young person can leave second level education with anything from 20 to 27 points without knowing how central or local government works, how to raise a mortgage and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education at second level in the areas of civics, politics and consumer rights is sadly lacking.  For a long time these areas have been relegated to the end of the timetable when the school principal at the beginning of the year sets out the timetable.  It is a reflection on our education system that what seems to be the most important subjects &mdash; the academic subjects &mdash; should get higher priority when we should be placing equal emphasis on the experiences which will enable <Col N="1856" /> a young man or woman to face the type of responsibilities the Minister is giving them in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not being in any way partisan when I mention subjects such as political education. If one were to visit a leaving certificate class where girls were studying history or English at honours level, one might find that the girls would not know the system of government that applied in their town.  I am talking about the structure of government that involves the town hall, locally elected councillors, the county manager and the town clerk.  The same girls might not know who the Dáil Deputies for the area were or what legislation was going through the Houses at that time.  They might not know the system of government in the EC or what were the origins of the major political parties in this country.  They might not know how the main political movements throughout Europe began.  It would be likely that the girls would know who were the contestants in the recent US presidential election and what the outcome of that election was.  This is because they would have observed that event on TV.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that many young people are not aware of the daily minutiae which is bound up so much in the running of our institutions.  I am making a plea on the occasion of this Bill for a type of early civics education that would be related in a simple way to the workings of authority and to which young people would be introduced at early second level.  This could be included in the history course at intermediate or group certificate level.  There could be visits arranged to such places as town halls and the education could be broadened at fifth and sixth years to study comparative political systems within the European structure and subsequently in terms of the world as a whole.</P>
    <P>I submit that much of the boredom and cynicism with the political process as expressed by young people today may be of our own making.  Perhaps the fact that we stand up here and make long boring speeches which do not seem very relevant to the subject before the House has something to do with this, but mainly it can <Col N="1857" /> be attributed to young people not being made aware of how the system operates. This leaves them unable to cope with the system when they leave school.  The kind of civics education I have in mind would include information on how the banks and other lending institutions operate.  I had made up my mind to speak on this aspect during this debate.  Deputy Kelly broadened my ideas because of his, not gloomy, but knowledgeable comments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not heard very much of the debate so far but I have heard two Deputies refer to this legislation as being merely something we are copying from across the water.  I am amused at the number of times such a suggestion is made.  It is a strange suggestion when we think of being in accord with the ideals and aspirations as expressed in the report of the New Ireland Forum.  We should not have such hang-ups about the question of whether legislation being brought in here is very much in line with what has been enacted in Britain.  Since there has been a suggestion that there is no demand for this legislation I should like to refer to the relevant working paper of the Law Reform Commission but first I should like to associate myself with the tribute <Col N="1858" /> paid to the commission by the Minister for Justice for the work they have done. The commission, by way of advertising in the media, invited anyone who had views on the law relating to the age of majority to make those views known to them.  The views that were expressed to them by various persons and groups indicated a need for action.  For example, Cork County Council were concerned particularly with the desirability of reducing the age of majority so that persons under 21 would become legally entitled to avail themselves of house purchase loans.  I consider this to be the major area to uphold the case for a change.  It is a very important consideration for those who marry before reaching 21.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture indicated to the commission that they too, favoured a reduction in the age of majority on the basis that lending agencies would be more readily prepared to make money available to young farmers at an earlier age.  The Department expressed the view that progressive farmers who are under 21 are unable to undertake farm development programmes or qualify for aid under the farm modernisation scheme because of lending agencies not being prepared to make loans available to people under 21.  In addition there is the observation that the inability of young farmers to obtain loans tends to frustrate the desire of older farmers to pass on land to their successors at a younger age than has been customary.</P>
    <P>Another submission was from the Irish League of Credit Unions who at that time represented some 300,000 members. They indicated that they would favour a reduction in the age of majority to 18 mainly to allow young people to take an active part in credit union administration. The argument they put forward is that persons under 21 are interested in community affairs and display an ability to partake in decision making but that at present one must have reached 21 before being eligible to hold office as a director or a supervisor of a credit union.</P>
    <P>The Dundalk Credit Union also supported a reduction in the age of majority to 18.  There was a submission from <Col N="1859" /> FLAC who stated that a reduction in the age of majority to 18 would be beneficial to everyone.  They suggested that it would be beneficial in preventing young people from hiding behind their special status as infants and they suggested also that the term &ldquo;minor&rdquo; should be used instead of the word &ldquo;infant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Council, too, indicated that they favoured a reduction in the age of majority to 18, their view being based on answers to questionnaires that were circulated to members of the council, to voluntary youth leaders and to youth groups.  In addition, the council recommended that the whole area of infants' contracts should be reviewed.  In view of the fact that the views of interested groups in the community were so clearly expressed in that working paper, there is a need for the legislation.</P>
    <P>The principal areas that will be affected will be the law of contract and the law of property.  The relationship between rights and duties is well illustrated by the fact that once the Bill becomes law early next year such persons will be able to enter into mortgage agreements.  Thus one obstacle in the way of building societies and lcoal authorities providing house purchase loans for young persons contemplating marriage will be removed. The other side of the coin is that contracts in relation to moneys borrowed or for goods bought will be enforceable against young people who reach the new age of majority.  At present contracts for goods supplied to a minor are not enforceable except in certain limited circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone could deny the reasonableness of the proposals in the Bill.  Young people today are maturing at a much earlier age and, generally speaking, they have responsibilities thrust upon them much sooner in life than was the case, say, even a few generations ago. There seems to be a trend world wide which recognises this development. Young people nowadays are better educated than their counterparts in former generations and many of them strongly resist an over-protective and paternalistic <Col N="1860" /> approach.  The Minister covered this point in his opening speech and illustrated the recent developments which have taken place in our law, notably in relation to the making of wills, the minimum age for voting and membership of juries.</P>
    <P>When discussing the behaviour of young people we are inclined too often to thnk only of those who come into conflict with the law because of their involvement in muggings, vandalism, drug offences or other crimes of violence. These are the ones who make the headlines, but they are a small minority.  We tend to overlook the great numbers of young people who are conscientious and responsible members of the community and who contribute positively to society by their energy and enthusiasm.  I believe they are more than willing to shoulder the burdens as well as the privileges of adulthood.  Many of them, I am sure, feel that the present age of majority is a slight on their ability to act responsibly and an indication that their elders do not trust them sufficiently to look after their own affairs.  This, in my view, only discourages and frustrates the development of our young citizens.  I believe that nothing is more calculated to develop the strength of character of young people than to give them the right to be able to make decisions in matters that affect them closely in their daily lives.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant, I think, that the Bill will bring our law into line with that obtaining in neighbouring jurisdictions. An exhaustive study of the question of lowering the age of full legal capacity was made in England by a committee of inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Latey.  The committee's report was presented in 1967 and contained the basic recommendation that the age of full legal capacity should generally be lowered from 21 to 18 years.  The law was changed in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to implement that recommendation with effect from 1 January 1970.</P>
    <P>I am fully in agreement that the present legal rule as to when a particular age is <Col N="1861" /> reached &mdash; that is, on the first moment of the day preceding the relevant anniversary of birth &mdash; is illogical and artificial. I support its replacement by the statutory role which is proposed in section 4 of the Bill.  Realistically a person can only be said to have reached a certain age when he has completed so many years i.e. on his birthday.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for family law matters I am glad to see that payments of social welfare allowances in respect of children who are in full time education are not affected by the proposals in the Bill.  Furthermore, any tax allowances in respect of children up to 21 years that people may be entitled to at present will not be affected by the change in the age of majority.  This is to be welcomed, especially in relation to incapacitated children or those who are in full time education.</P>
    <P>I note that some of the proposals made by the Law Reform Commission are not being implemented in this Bill.  These relate to a proposed increase in the age from 16 to 18 years up to which parents are under an obligation to maintain a child under the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930 and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  Neither is the age being increased for a child to qualify for a supplementary welfare allowance under social welfare legislation as proposed by the commission.  The reason is that these matters are not directly related to the age of majority.  It is reasonable that any proposals to increase the age up to which maintenance should be paid would be more appropriately treated as a separate matter.</P>
    <P>As regards the commission's proposals in relation to the free age for marriage and the age below which consent of a third person to a marriage should be necessary, I think it is understandable that these matters should be dealt with separately from the question of the age of majority and I agree that it would not have been appropriate to implement the commission's recommendations in these areas in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have very strong personal views in <Col N="1862" /> regard to the changes in the legal age for marriage.  I have strong views on the need to look at this because here we do not have divorce so people regard marriage as a life long commitment.  Therefore, greater stress should be laid on the need for young people to approach this contract in a mature way.  Even the recommendation that the age should be increased to 18 from 16 years I do not think would change things drastically because many people believe that those who marry below the age of 21 years can have difficulties.  There is evidence to show that many marriages flounder which were entered into before the age of 21 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke painted an idealistic picture about young people who marry at the ages of 16 or 17 years.  In my view it is extremely difficult for young couples to marry at that age, to take on the responsibilities of homes and children and make some headway in life at a time when the ideal would be that they would be in educational institutions.  I appreciate that we should not follow the example in China, which I visited last year, where this year they imposed a minimum legal age for marriage for women of 20 years and for men of 22 years.  I support the idea of an increased age but there is much more to it than that.</P>
    <P>There is some evidence of a correlation between the age of marriage and the incidence of marriage breakdowns.  We must give this careful consideration and later when we get the report of the Marriage Breakdown Committee I hope we will have a further debate about it.</P>
    <P>I think that while the Bill may be described as a fairly technical one, Deputies will recognise it as an important measure with considerable social implications and as an expression of confidence in our young people to which they can readily lend their full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  As the Minister of State has said, it is a vote of confidence in young people.  To me it is a kick in the face to young people by politicians that we are in the last stages <Col N="1863" /> of 1984 before we introduce such legislation. When we compare our performance with that in other countries it is interesting to note that the age of majority was reduced to 18 years in Britain in 1970, in many of the EC countries in 1972, in Canada in 1974, the US in 1971 and in New Zealand in 1970.  It is only in 1984 that we are providing such fundamental legislation in regard to the rights of young people.</P>
      <P>This neglect on our part is one of the reasons why young people are so finicky about politicians.  They have every right to be because this recommendation was first made in 1975 and it has taken nine years to reach the House.  If we politicians treat the fundamental right of young people in this way we can hardly expect them to be anything but finicky about politicians in general.</P>
      <P>I am saddened by what the Minister said in relation to the Bill.  I thought this Bill would have been the start of a series of reforming legislation for young people but from the Minister of State's speech it would appear that there is no anxiety to deal with the other areas.  In addition to this legislation we should have a Bill brought in to abolish the status of illegitimacy, to raise the age of criminal responsibility and the minimum age for marriage.  I find it difficult to understand, when she says she supports the idea of raising the age for marriage, why she did not introduce legislation to do so.  The minimum age for marriage should be increased to 18 years and this should be done as part of this legislation.  Why did the Minister of State not do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important aspect of this Bill is that it allows young people to act responsibly.  Up to now they could not borrow money legally, incur debts or undertake contractual obligations. Young people were not allowed to prepare for life.  One of the most important preparations for life is to be able to enter into contractual obligations.  Deputy Kelly made the point that he never had a person make a recommendation to him for the age of majority to be reduced to <Col N="1864" /> 18 years.  He must not live in the real world if he has not had such representation.</P>
    <P>Since I became involved in politics ten years ago one of my main priorities was to have young people make preparation for the ownership of their own home. There were many serious difficulties encountered in this area.  One was that when young people applied to Galway County Council for a loan they were told that their applications would not be accepted until they were 21 years of age. In this day and age how could we put that kind of restriction on young people who want to help themselves?  It is impossible to understand.  During my time as a councillor I was trying to put it across to young people of 18 and 19 years of age that now was the time to plan for the future and for the ownership of their own home.  I could not understand why those young people were told their applications would not be considered because they were under 21 years of age.  That was the main problem I encountered from young people in my constituency and it is for that reason that I say Deputy Kelly must not live in the real world if he never received representations from young people about lowering the age of majority.</P>
    <P>Young people have every reason to be cynical about politicians when it is in the latter days of 1984 that we are introducing this necessary legislation.  My wish is that this legislation would pass as quickly as possible and not alone would we stop at this point but provide the essential back up for young people to take advantage of the legislative changes we are making. One of the greatest advantages young people will have under this legislation is that they can plan for the future.  They will be able to enter into contractual obligations and borrow money.  However, the legislation is about 15 years too late. It was rather sad that when the referendum was held to reduce the age at which a person could vote, politicians at that time did not have the foresight to take that further and reduce the age of majority.  The Government of today lack foresight in not making this Bill the forerunner <Col N="1865" /> of a series of reforming measures for young people.  How long will we have to wait to see the age of criminal responsibility raised and the minimum age for marriage raised?  How long will it be before the status of illegitimacy is abolished?</P>
    <P>I had great admiration for the Minister of State when she wrote in the newspapers. I used to read with great interest her reforming ideas and the new approach she had but for the last two years I have been deeply disappointed with the progress she has made.  There is no indication in her speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spoke about taking the heavy gamble in life, which was how he described getting married.  His view was that this legislation would make it easier for people to get married &mdash; I do not want to be critical of him &mdash; and therefore <Col N="1866" /> could be viewed as not being in their best interests.  Rather than looking at this legislation in that way I see it as giving young people who wish to get married responsibility by providing a climate in which they can properly prepare for marriage. Deputy Kelly is causing confusion between creating a greater risk in marriage and creating a proper climate for responsibility for young people in their preparation for marriage.  This legislation provides the necessary ingredients for a stable marriage, the main one being the provision of a family home.  It will enhance people's ability to have a good marriage rather than create difficulties for them in marriage.  I say that because parental consent for marriage has not been the cause of stopping people from getting married and the fact that the age is reduced from 21 to 18 will not make any difference.</P>
    <P>This legislation is welcome and will help yeoung people to help themselves. It will provide an opportunity for a young person with foresight to save money and to spend a couple of years preparing for marriage.  I hope it will put an end to the situation that applies here among young people that while you are young you spend, spend, spend and have a good time.  Most young people do not think about home ownership until they begin to think about marriage and by then it is too late.  I am concerned that so many people from 18 to 25 spend their money and do not give any thought to the future or to the responsibilities of providing their own home.  The introduction of this legislation will now give young people from the age of 18, when many are working, the opportunity to think seriously about saving and getting involved in financial institutions which will in years ahead advance money to them to buy a home.  They will be able to plan for a home which takes about three or four years.  So many young people cannot provide homes for themselves because they did not save from an early age.</P>
    <P>Young people of 18 years of age should be eligible to stand for election to the Dáil and Seanad.  This legislation provides for everything else and it is strange that we <Col N="1867" /> allow young people to get married at 16 years of age but not to enter politics, which is not as serious a contract, until they are 21.  It is typical of the attitude of politicians towards young people that we have decided to bring in this legislation reducing the age of majority to 18 years but specifically including that it will not provide for young people to enter the Dáil or Seanad until they are 21.  Many young people are quite capable of taking their place here and playing their role and they should be encouraged to get involved in framing legislation at that age because the whole emphasis throughout the world is on young people having an important say in all matters affecting them.  We are implying that they are not mature enough to get involved in politics but many of them are more mature than many senior politicians.  I feel very strongly on this issue and I urge the Minister to consider this recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome some of the provisions in the Bill which reflect the earlier maturity of young people and recognise their capacity to deal with many social and economic problems at an earlier age.  The provisions reflect our advancement in terms of education and equality.  The technical aspects of the Bill have been dealt with by many legal Members who made excellent contributions to the debate.</P>
      <P>There are, however, many young people who consider that the proposed legislation has a very low priority rating in terms of business conducted in this House and see it as legislative filling-in because of the Government's failure to bring forward more positive legislation to deal with the many problems facing us at present.  For that reason, I regret that we are not dealing with more urgent, important and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Many young people look to this House with a sense of disappointment <Col N="1868" /> and those who have not been able to find employment look on the legislators with a degree of cynicism because of our failure to create jobs.  It is fine to recognise the maturity of young people.  We are telling them that they have grown up and can take the responsibilities of adults, but what have we done to provide them with the background and opportunities to take on that responsibility? Deputy Frank Fahey rightly commended the provisions in the Bill whereby young people can sign mortgage contracts.  I also welcome that provision, which is one of the more positive proposals.  Those of us who are members of local authorities know from our experience that many young people are unable to provide themselves with their own homes because they cannot enter into a legal agreement with a local authority or a building society.</P>
      <P>It was a pity that when the Minister decided to bring this Bill before the House he did not wait until he was able to incorporate all the proposals contained in the report of the Law Reform Commission. If that had been the case the legislation would have tried to deal with a wide area of legislative problems which affect our young people.  That is why the Bill seems to be a stop gap measure and does not deal with a wider area of social reform which could be covered in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Very little has been done up to now and very little will be done on foot of this Bill to resolve many more pressing social problems facing our young people.  It makes no difference whether you are 18 or 21 years of age, if you are unemployed. It makes no difference whether you can sign a mortgage contract if you have not a wage or salary to meet your financial commitments in relation to providing yourself, your wife or family with a house.  Some people, particularly the young, will view this debate with cynicism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, dealt in a very broad way with her hopes for the young people of this country.  I share with her and with Deputy Frank Fahey my hope and confidence in our young people.  However, they are not in a position to decide their future and they <Col N="1869" /> are dependent on those they elect to this House to legislate and ensure an economic base on which they can provide themselves with suitable employment, housing and other essential material requirements.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not take into consideration a very wide range of social problems which were referred to in the report of the Law Reform Commission.  That commission did an excellent job in preparing the groundwork for the introduction of effective social reform legislation.  It is regrettable that we have only touched on one or two basic points in this regard in the Bill.  It is not my intention to delay the House in discussing this proposal, which is very limited in scope and will have very little effect on the future of our young people.  Until such time as we introduce more effective legislation to cater for future needs, the results will be very minimal in terms of the problems facing our young people.</P>

      <P>Like the majority of other speakers, I welcome the Bill before the House.  Opposition speakers may indicate that it does not incorporate enough, but it is only meant to incorporate a certain amount.  Its results, however, will be quite far reaching and will have quite an effect.  At times we would all wish for a quicker passage of legislation through the House and that we could make better use of our time here.  Some Members of the Opposition should look at their own performance in recent times when we had the debacle of discussion on this Government's plan for two weeks running, after a thorough debate for one week, just to keep the spotlight on it, when we could have been debating something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is before the House as a result of commitments.  This Government cannot take all the credit, but they have brought it before the House.  I hope that other legislation mentioned by some speakers opposite will be before the House shortly.  With regard to legislation coming on stream, we have been keeping our commitments.  However, the production of legislation does not merely entail <Col N="1870" /> the typing and delivery of it.  Much work must go into its preparation.  The legislation which has been passed and which will be passed in future will be the result of work done, particularly over the last two years of the present Government. That may go to show what was being done previously.  Was anything being prepared in the cupboard?</P>
    <P>As we are aware, this Bill reduces the age of majority from 21 to 18 years, bringing us into line with many other countries, some of which have had such legislation for many years. This Bill is a result of the extensive deliberations of the Law Reform Commission, whose report covered a number of areas.  It was not unexpected that they arrived at this age, because 18 is the governing age in much legislation.  This relates to the Succession Act and the enabling of young people to make a will, also rights and duties under the Guardianship of Infants Act, the question of eligibility to vote, which legislation was passed by means of a referendum in 1972 and the Electoral Amendment Act of the following year. It also relates to jury service under the Juries Act.  We could discuss at great length what is the approprivate age. Some people far older than 18 are not mature enough to conduct their own affairs and probably there are some under 18 years who are quite capable of doing that.  However, in the light of modern thinking, 18 would appear to be the right age.  The proposal in this Bill will be quite significant.  It brings rights and duties on individuals who are now reaching 18 or who are now between the ages of 18 and 21.  While some of us are inclined to think only of rights, people will be made more accountable because they can be sued at the age of 18, like any adult person.  They will no longer be considered as minors.  I shall mention a few out of the range of activities dealt with in the Law Reform Commission report:</P>
    <P>Persons at the date of operation of the legislation between the ages of 18 and 21, and every married person who has not reached the age of 18, will <Col N="1871" /> become adults with all the rights and liabilities of adults.  During the succeeding years a number of persons will attain the age of 18 years or marry under that age.  For brevity in the following paragraphs all these persons are called &ldquo;new adults&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I shall read out a few of the obligations to which these new adults will be subject:</P>
    <P>(a) A new adult will be liable for the repayment of any money that he may borrow and for any goods that he buys after he attains majority;</P>
    <P>(b) He may enter into any mortgage, charge or hire-purchase agreement;</P>
    <P>(c) He will be free to make settlements of his property;</P>
    <P>(d) He may buy and sell land and give valid receipts for the purchase money without the intervention of a trustee or other third person;</P>
    <P>(g) He may marry without the consent of his parents or guardians or of the President of the High Court;</P>
    <P>(h) He may sue or be sued in his own name without the intervention of a next friend or of a guardian <i>ad litem;</i> and he may enter into a binding compromise of an action without the leave of the court;</P>
    <P>(i) If he is a ward of court he will be discharged from wardship.</P>
    <P>These areas are fundamental to modern living and many people at present 18, 19 and 20 years of age will welcome the changes.  It is to be expected that people will have to accept the responsibility that these changes will bring and respect the rights that will ensue therefrom.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission have done a great deal of research work into the system in operation in other countries and, having regard to the fact that 18 is now taken generally as the time when a person comes of age rather than 21, this change is overdue and necessary and <Col N="1872" /> most of us here at least welcome it.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the commission's reference to an anomaly which will exist having regard to the permitted age of marriage at the moment.  The committee may come forward with a recommendation to raise the age at which a person may be married from 16 as at present to 18.  In many of the areas we are discussing it is desirable to have a uniform age and not to have different ages for different rights and liabilities. Probably 18 is the appropriate age to adopt.  This measure is of significance to many young people who are at present between 18 and 21 or who will be 18 shortly and thus will acquire rights under this legislation.</P>
    <P>Regarding wards of court, at present a person under the age of 21 must go through a lengthy procedure under the Wards of Court Act if he wishes to withdraw money awarded to him.  He faces expense and must go to the trouble of swearing various affidavits and appearing before the Master of the High Court in order to get his money which he needs for a legitimate purpose.  People aged 19 and 20 will be relieved that this money can now be paid out to those who are 18 or over.</P>
    <P>One Deputy here suggested that the age of majority might even be raised, but in this day and age we must ensure that people can go about and do their business and acquire their own money if necessary. The Bill before the House will bring rights, responsibilities, benefits and obligations to the people who will benefit under it, and people who are at the age of majority now and who will be at the new age of majority when the Bill is passed must recognise that.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I support the Bill before the House.  It is worthy legislation.  It may be a weak enough Bill but it is significant and its effects will be far reaching.  While it is only a small Bill, we have brought it before the House and I hope it will be one of a series of reforming measures which will be brought forward by the Government shortly.  The Minister of State here present is working on quite a number of measures which most of us <Col N="1873" /> hope will come before the House as soon as possible.  We appreciate the difficulties and delays that can take place, but it is important that matters be expedited as much as possible.  We hear about the slowness of bureaucracy, but the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State at that Department have indicated their commitment in this regard in the measures they have brought forward already. The implications of this brief but significant Bill will be far-reaching.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hyland said that the Bill had little scope.  While that may be so, it is revolutionary in concept, particularly in an Irish context.  As has been mentioned, many other countries have already incorporated provisions such as are in this Bill into their legislation.  In the few words I am going to say I want to highlight a note of caution to those affected by this change in the law.  In summary, this Bill affects the laws of contract, property, guardianship and full contractual capacity which, as other speakers have stressed, will now be acquired at 18 years of age or in the case of a person married before that age, on the date of marriage.  The Bill is a product of one of the many good reports of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>I hope that the people affected by this change in the law will be strong and mature enough to resist the contractual onslaught they are about to face. Contractors and other people will realise that they have a much larger market than heretofore in which to sell and to contract. The <i>caveat emptor</i> that has applied up to now should be stressed again in the light of the changes that will take place as a result of this legislation.  We have found it necessary to be very cautious about recent legislation and to put it on trial for a number of years.  It is only fair to highlight to young people coming out of school, most of whom will not yet have sat for their leaving certificate, the effect of this law.  We should point out the pitfalls that will be there as a result of the passing of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fahey stressed the enormous advantage that will accrue to people who <Col N="1874" /> wish to purchase a house and to get married. As many as 200,000 people might be affected in this regard.  Between 1975 and 1980, 38,000 marriages with at least one of the parties under 21 years of age were registered.  I do not know whether the Deputy is advocating that we should have an increase in the number of young marriages, of people being married between 18 and 21 years of age as a result of the passing of the legislation.  While that might solve some problems, sometimes it is more prudent not to enter into that contract until one has attained at least the age of 21, if not a good number of years more than that.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and other Members, mentioned that this will open up new horizons for a lot of young people.  It appears that we are assuming that those who are now irresponsible will tomorrow or the next day be responsible people who will be able to undertake all types of very onerous contracts.  The fact is, contrary to what Deputy Fahey said, that young people when they start earning tend to be a little irresponsible with their money and spend it on clothes, cars or sowing wild oats.  I would not be encouraging them to get married but if they wish to enter into a contractual obligation to purchase I would consider that a good thing.  It would help towards maturity, to them settling down and accumulating some wealth.  Of course, in another aspect of our legislation we do not encourage the latter.  On the one hand we are making it a little better for people who wish to invest while on the other hand we clobber them when they do.  I do not consider that to be consistent.</P>
    <P>One of the areas that needs to be highlighted is the huge market that would result when the Bill is passed.  The majority of our population are young and they will now become eligible to enter into contracts to buy and sell land or commit themselves, irrevocably in many cases, to a heavy payments schedule as a result of contracts.  Up to now it was not possible to insist on the repayments and as a result of this change many young people may find themselves in trouble.  There is an obligation on us to point these things out <Col N="1875" /> to young people.  That could be done through our educational system, or by a PR exercise or advertising on radio, television and in the newspapers.  We could arrange for officials to address students at schools.  I do not think young people are mature enough at that age to enter some of the contracts I envisage them being eligible to enter into.  It is not possible to put an old head on young shoulders.  Young people need to be gently exposed to the markets over a period of time.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by the Minister or some other Member that one of the reasons why we had been relying on the age of 21 was that it related to the age when a young man was regarded as being strong enough to wear heavy armour and wield the heavy weapons that went with knightly service in the feudal system. That may be true but there is a necessity now to be able to resist with a thick skin rather than heavy armour the type of sharks that exist in our society and prey on unsuspecting and honest people.  The type of confidence tricksters that are going around now were not around in feudal times.  They are the type of people our young people will have to watch out for.</P>
    <P>Young people will now be able to enter into contracts to purchase property, a responsible undertaking.  It has been stated that in recent years there has been evidence that 18-year-olds are responsible enough to take on these obligations. It was stated that the Succession Act granted permission to a person of 18, or married, to make a will.  In 1972 the voting age was reduced from 21 years to 18 years.  Young people have been eligible to serve on juries since 1976 but few people of that age are aware of those provisions.  Those of us who attend clinics regularly realise the appalling amount of ignorance that exists outside in relation to such matters.  Very often people twice that age do not realise that those provisions exist.  It is wrong of people to assume that most of the population are aware of their rights, their obligations or their contractual rights and would not <Col N="1876" /> lightly enter into a contract they could honour.  I spend half my time at my clinics advising people as to what they should do.  Most of the time those young people are in predicaments they cannot get out of easily.  On occasions they are hopeless cases.  In most cases they get into those predicaments due to lack of experience or lack of responsibility and understanding. Lack of education is another reason.</P>
    <P>We must remember that after we have passed the Bill a wave of a wand will not suddenly make our young people more mature and responsible.  I venture to suggest that without the guidance and advice of parents, professional people or seniors most people of that age would make the wrong decision when entering into an obligation or contract.  They are likely to make many mistakes initially before learning through the experience of life how not to get tied up and what not to get involved in or committed to.  Many people have had to spend years trying to extricate themselves from some onerous contract or obligation they entered into when they were immature.  A lot of young marriages fell on the rocks because they were entered into lightly.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the logic behind the thinking that a great door will now open and we will have people between the ages of 18 and 21 rushing to buy houses or to get married.  Most people of that age would not be earning enough to be able to meet repayments.  Perhaps Deputy Fahey was thinking of local authority houses.  Our religious leaders have tended to caution people, to endeavour to get them to put off marrying and enrol for pre-marriage courses so that they do not rush into early marriages.  I should not like it to go out from this House that these provisions enabled people to rush out and buy houses.  I agree with Deputy Hyland when he asked: what good is it telling people who have not got jobs that they will be able to buy a house when they would be unable to afford the appropriate payments?</P>
    <P>Therefore a cautionary note must be struck.  There will be certain sections of the community well able to take advantage of the provisions of this Bill, probably <Col N="1877" /> the small, favoured sections. Probably the vast majority will be unaware of its provisions, will not understand them and it will probably be they who will suffer as a result.  That is not to say that it should not be done but I have not seen an awful lot of research devoted to deciding whether the age of majority should be reduced to 18.  I can judge from my experience only.  If the question were posed directly to me: do you think a young person of 18 years of age is sufficiently mature to enter into the obligations that will be open to him or her as a result of the provisions of this Bill &mdash; meaning that he or she could buy land, issue receipts, enter into contracts &mdash; I would have to reply straight away: no, I do not think so.  I spoke to some hundreds of pupils today in leaving certificate classes. I do not think such students would be at all prepared to enter into such obligations or commitments because they go from primary into secondary school, are subjected to the protection of their parents, families, the companionship of their fellow students, or those who participate in various sporting activities.  They will have had no experience of being out in the real world; they will not even have had the experience of a job as yet.  One really must go out into the world and learn the hard way.  One may enjoy the benefits of having had good parents, education or of having had good teachers' advice.  But it is only when one goes out into the world and is knocked about a bit that one learns how to proceed.</P>
    <P>There should be a small amount of money, energy and expertise expended endeavouring to get across to those people who will be affected what the proposed change will mean to them.  Perhaps there should be established for a limited time throughout the country advice bureaus to which young persons wishing to enter into serious or long term contracts would have redress, where they could talk to somebody in a Government or Department service and have explained to him or her exactly what is entailed in the obligation they propose taking on or the contract into which they propose entering.  There will always be <Col N="1878" /> the hotheads but we are aware that probably there will be unscrupulous, sharp people who will entice young people into entering into all kinds of obligations.</P>
    <P>Very soon after the passage of this Bill I can foresee the onslaught on young people, throughout schools all over the country, on people who have just left school, the 18-year-olds, even those now attending university, most of whom are insufficiently mature to enter into such kinds of obligations.  Therefore we may have to engage in an education exercise in this respect and we have an obligation to do so.  If one looks at successful members of society one will see that they are not to be found among the 18, 21, 25, 30 or even 35-year-olds; indeed rarely are they to be found among the 40-year-olds. They may be found among people in their fifties who will by then have begun to accumulate some modest degree of wealth or success.  One is inclined, through inexperience, to throw away opportunities and so on in one's early years.  It is a shame to see young people getting themselves into positions in which they will be committed over a long number of years and from which they may not easily be able to extricate themselves. I shall confine my remarks to emphasis of that last point.  Most other Members' contributions have ranged over different aspects of the Bill.  Certainly everybody is aware of its provisions.</P>
    <P>In regard to 18 being advanced as the appropriate age of eligibility for election to the Dáil, I do not foresee any great problem.  If young persons put themselves forward for election the electorate will form a judgment.  Generally speaking people seem to make a more serious judgment of people entering this House than those offering themselves for election to local authorities.  I would hope that the electorate would take a greater interest in the type of persons who put themselves forward for election, to the extent that they would question their capabilities, attitudes, background from every angle and question also what they stand for. If the candidates pass that test, then of course they should receive votes.  That is <Col N="1879" /> something to which very often not sufficient attention is paid in this country. Some lecture on politics taught me that democracy, of its nature, breeds mediocre parliamentarians.  It is up to the electorate to be selective, to go into great depth in regard to the background of people offering themselves for election. Therefore I do not think that the dropping of the age of majority to 18 would make any difference in this respect.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the sting has been taken out of the Opposition's criticism of the Bill, constructive or otherwise, by the fact that its provisions will not affect the social welfare or taxation legislation.  I am sure we would have heard from the far side of the House had such measures been overlooked and the Bill would have received even more criticism.  The exemption of social welfare legislation will ensure that persons who are entitled to social welfare payments for children between the ages of 18 and 21, who are in full time education, will not become ineligible.  Additionally, the exclusion of taxation legislation will likewise ensure that a taxpayer will not lose his entitlement to any tax allowance in respect of any child up to age 21.  That constitutes an enlightened provision in the Bill and one to be welcomed.  I hope Members of this House will be given credit for ensuring that no hardship will be imposed as a result of the introduction of this Bill. Rather its provisions represent an honest attempt to put something right by reducing the age of majority.</P>
    <P>Even though the age of majority will have been reduced it should be remembered that it will place much pressure on a section of our society which does not exist at present.  For example, many young students who do not suffer deprivation, who live in secure homes, will not realise what is ahead of them. They will not realise what it is like to live in the world outside because they will not, as yet, have had an opportunity of having had that real experience.  When this measure becomes law it will put pressure on them which they did not realise was there.  One of the arguments <Col N="1880" /> in favour of bringing in this legislation is that it exists in other countries.  Because we are west of Europe it may be that we are a little less mature than the people on the mainland but nevertheless this legislation needs to be brought in gradually. As it has to go to the Seanad, and may be back here again, there is time for an education programme to be undertaken using the facilities we have to enlighten the people who will be affected by this legislation.  Apart from those reservations and words of caution I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to make a few brief observations about this measure.  This is a welcome Bill which underlines the readiness of this country to embrace modern thinking with regard to the rights, entitlements and obligations that can appropriately fall on the heads of people of 18 years and upwards.  A resolution of the Council of Europe, 1972, recommended this course of action.  The age of majority was reduced in Britain and Northern Ireland in 1969 and a number of other European countries have since endorsed that action.  It is now the turn of this country to embody that principle and I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission Report referred to the Brehon laws.  The more one knows of these laws the more one sees how wise they were in their own way.  There was no basis in the Brehon laws for a mandatory age of maturation. One was subordinate legally as long as one lived in one's father's house and one was not entitled to enter into contracts but when one left one's father's house, whatever age one was, one took full legal responsibility for oneself.  Any legislation that points to a specific age as being the age at which it is implied that one has political, legal or other responsibility embodies the idea that that is the age we collectively accept to be the age of emotional, psychological or other type of maturity.  That is an arbitrary principle but one has to settle on some age and the age of 18 years is very much in line with modern thinking. <Col N="1881" /> The Bill and its implications allow access to people of 18 years to a whole range of rights but there are also obligations which are spelled out in the Law Reform Commission Report.  The people affected by this legislation should acquaint themselves with the new responsibilities which rest on their shoulders. This legislation gives them a new and equal status with their adult peers but there are specific obligations which, if individual circumstances obtain in relation to certain cases, would fall quite heavily on their shoulders if the full rigour of this legislation is applied to them, for example, pursuing legal responsibility in relation to moneys borrowed and so on. I believe there is a need for some form of educational campaign.  This is one of the areas that could be considered in the context of a review of the school curriculum.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation but I want to refer to what I consider to be a possible omission.  The general objectives of the legislation, apart from the specific rights and obligations involved, are to bring about specific changes in similar legislation affecting young people &mdash; all that has been spelled out by the Minister and the Law Reform Commission Report.  There should be some way to communicate this body of information to the young people affected.  The basis for the move towards incorporating this new legislation on our Statute Book goes back to Working Paper No. 2, 1977, Report on the Law Reform Commission.  Relating to the Age of Majority, the Age for Marriage and Some Connected Subjects.  That document forms the basic reference work for this legislation.  From that there has been a logical progression to the present situation.  As I mentioned, that document was entitled Report on The Law Relating to the Age of Majority, the Age for Marriage and Some Connected Subjects.</P>
    <P>I would like to question whether the omission of the reference to the age of marriage in this Bill is important.  I take the view that if it was possible or practicable it would have been better to have included specific reference to the age of marriage in this Bill.  The Minister said <Col N="1882" /> he deemed it to be a separate matter, which it is to a large extent, but it is not a separate issue totally.  The measure relating to the age of majority has an implication for the age of marriage because people will reach the age of majority at 18 years or at the age of marriage if it be under.  The age of marriage is bound up with this.  Point (g) of the Law Reform Commission summary of the implications of this measure says: &ldquo;He may marry without the consent of his parents or guardians or of the President of the High Court&rdquo; on the enactment of this legislation.  We should not let an opportunity like this pass without this House spelling out its thinking on this very important issue.</P>
    <P>Reducing the age of majority to 18 years with the implication that 18 year olds are increasingly responsible for their actions and should be deemed to be so in law is fine.  However, the age at which young people enter into contractual obligations, which is the nub of this legislation, is a matter of concern in certain other respects.  This legislation presents us with an opportunity to deal with that. I take the view that there is a major omission by the State in dealing with the age of marriage, that there is a serious crisis affecting teenage marriages in particular, about which no Member of this House would say he was ignorant and that ideally this could and should have been dealt with in this Bill.  The Minister said that because this was not in the Bill did not mean that his mind was closed to the possibility of bringing about a change. That is welcome because it indicates he is showing an openness to be persuaded about the need for new measures if they are required.</P>
    <P>On page 16 of the Law Reform Commission's Report they deal at some length with the need for a modern legislative approach to the marriage age.  It said that as far back as 1960 there was a strong body of opinion in favour of raising the minimum age for marriage.  It went on to say:</P>
    <P>The United Nations Organisation was particularly concerned about the <Col N="1883" /> minimum age for marriage.  Under the United Nations Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriage (1962) it is provided that States who are parties to the Convention should take legislative action to specify a minimum age for marriage.</P>
    <P>But they observed that Ireland had not yet acceded to that convention. The report continues:</P>
    <P>In 1965 by General Assembly Resolution 2018 (xx) the General Assembly of the United Nations recommended that, where not already provided by existing legislative or other measures, each Member State should take the necessary steps to adopt such legislative or other measures as might be appropriate to give effect to the following principle: &ldquo;Member states shall take legislative action to specify a minimum age for marriage, which in any case shall be not less than fifteen years of age; no marriage shall be legally entered into by any person under this age, except where the competent authority has granted a dispensation as to age, for serious reasons, in the interest of the intending spouse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In December 1967, it was suggested in the report of the Dáil committee on the Constitution that the existing marriage legislation might be thought to be discriminatory against certain religions and that committee made certain observations. This, too, shows that there was concern about this matter that far back.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that subparagraph (c) of paragraph 41 of the report of the commission reads:</P>
    <P>Section 18 gives power to the Minister for Health, by regulations made in the manner prescribed by the section, to substitute &ldquo;18&rdquo; for &ldquo;21&rdquo; in the Marriages (1) Act, 1844....</P>
    <P>It goes on to refer to certain other legislation. It seems to me, therefore, that this change would not require new legislation but merely a regulation.  No such regulation <Col N="1884" /> has been made.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister's thinking is in this regard and on the likelihood of a measure which, together with giving increased statutory responsibility to people of 18 and upwards, would end the farcical situation that is blessed by the State, and very often by the Church, of young people of emotional and psychological immaturity engaging in marriages which inevitably break up quickly.  I take the view that there is no ideal age at which it can be decided that one is suitable or otherwise for any major contractual undertaking but for the purposes of legislation such as this one must make reasonable and rational judgments.  It is somewhat illogical that valid marriages can be entered into by people of 16 or 17. Though, theoretically, they are supposed to obtain consent, lack of such consent does not render the marriage invalid. Even with this modern legislation that we are introducing such young persons would not be entitled to enter into contractual obligations relating to hire purchase, for instance.</P>
    <P>I consider it extraordinary that such a situation remains in respect of what is the most fundamental of human commitments with all its ensuing social and economic repercussions.  Our approach to the seriousness of the marriage commitment is rather blinkered but this Bill affords us the opportunity of indicating clearly that there is a need for review in this respect, that we consider people of 16 and 17 too young to marry and that they should be discouraged from marrying.  If possible, marriages at such an age should be outlawed.</P>
    <P>We are now into an era in our social development where the very institution of marriage, its permutations and the norms we apply may have to change also. When we talk about marriage we talk first about a ceremony which is usually a religious ceremony combined with a State ceremony but increasingly young people take the view that one can make this sort of long term commitment to another without going through what they would regard as the formalities.  Therefore, I do not believe that legislation is <Col N="1885" /> the answer but at least if the State is to be consistent it must bring its thinking into line in terms of the marriage age.</P>
    <P>I am saddened at the large numbers of young people with whom I come in contact and who have either married or are contemplating marriage but who have no understanding of how serious a step marriage is.  All of our systems of education appear to have failed these young people who mistake emotional infatuation or transient feelings with a desire to live for the rest of one's life with a person of the opposite sex.  Shortly after such young people marry, reality dawns and in many cases the couple return to their respective homes.  I had the experience of being invited to the marriage of teenagers, a marriage which lasted from Saturday afternoon until the following Monday afternoon.  That is not typical. Not many of our young people would be so irresponsible.  In that case everyone had a good time at the wedding.  I did not attend but I felt that to facilitate the charade that that marriage was, was in effect to be deceitful and to rob those young people of their futures.  The couple have been very muddled and unhappy since.  They are trying to forget that unfortunate black spot in their lives.  In November 1972 when the then Minister for Health, the late Mr. Childers, was dealing with the Second Stage of the Marriages Bill in the Seanad, he tabled two amendments, one of which was to reduce from 21 to 18 the age at which consent to marriage would be required and the other was to delete section 18 of the Bill.  After hearing arguments, the Minister withdrew the amendments.</P>
    <P>I am putting forward the suggestion that marriages between persons of between 16 and 18 years old ostensibly require consent but that that requirement is not observed.  This is borne out by statistics.  The number of applications to the courts for exemption orders or for consent to marriage is minimal in the context of the numbers of such marriages taking place.  I am convinced that we should think about trying to bring about an improvement in the present legislation situation.  Though this could be a matter <Col N="1886" /> for this Bill, I shall be happy if the Minister says this is not so but that in due course there will be a Bill on those lines. That would only mean our bringing our legislation into line with modern thinking and with thinking in Northern Ireland and in Europe on this matter.  Wherever possible, provided we do not rob ourselves of some basic principle, we should try to be as facilitating as possible in relation to making our legislation run parallel with legislation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The age at which a marriage can be contracted validly without the consent of a third person should be the same as the age of majority.  There is no overriding evidence for that but it is logical and reasonable.  In view of the fact that there is overwhelming statistical evidence in all those countries which publish such evidence that teenage marriages in general do not work, that more of them fail than succeed, we should bring the age of marriage without consent in line with the age of maturity.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that this Bill is before us. The legislation will be a help to young people.  It underlines the confidence that this House and the country generally have in them.  I would consider it remiss of me to talk about a Bill relating to the age at which young people can enter into contractual arrangements without referring to the age at which they can enter into the contract of marriage.  I regret that the report of the Law Reform Commission is not being implemented in total. I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the commission for the often turgid, always difficult and sometimes unrewarding work they have done.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the Law Reform Commission for the often burgeoning and always difficult and unrewarding work which they do.  They have been a rather isolated body but whether it is clear to all of us or not, the world is unfolding as it should be and the work of the commission is percolating into legislation. We owe them and the Minister a substantial debt of gratitude for preparing for the publication of the Bill which we hope will pass through the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> There is a very urgent need to get some legal rationality into the marriage age so that we will end the present farce of young couples who could not in any way be seen to be emotionally or psychologically mature getting involved in marriage. They should be discouraged by all of us and by law from so doing, thereby avoiding lifetimes of trauma and hardship and sometimes worse.  Anybody who has been with a counselling agency or who represents the urban areas will know the kind of hardship that can, but does not always, arise from such unhappy arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank all the Deputies who contributed for the various suggestions and comments.  I am glad there has been general support for the Bill from across the floor.  First of all, I will deal with some of the general issues raised to which many Deputies referred, and then pick some of the specific questions put by individual Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputies Woods and Shatter in particular, and other Deputies, including Deputy Keating today, queried the exclusion from the Bill of the Law Reform Commission's proposals relating to marriage. Generally speaking, the commission proposed that the free age for marriage should be 18 years &mdash; that is the age at which a person could marry without the consent of a third party such as a parent or guardian.  They also considered whether the absolute minimum age for marriage should be fixed at 16 or 18 years.  In their proposed legislation they opted for 16 years as the absolute minimum and recommended that a marriage contracted by a person under that age should be null and void.  The consent of a parent or guardian or of a court would be required for marriage of persons between 16 and 18 years and absence of consent would invalidate the marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the Law Reform Commission's report and their section on the age of marriage, we are not talking about one age but two ages.  At present the free age for marriage beyond which one does not <Col N="1888" /> need consent is 21 years, which is the present age of majority.  One requires permission to marry from a parent or guardian between the ages of 16 and 18 years, but under the age of 16 years there is a provision whereby somebody intending to marry under that age must have a parent or guardian to apply to the President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in effect we are dealing with three ages of marriage, the Law Reform Commission recommending two ages for marriage, the free age of marriage at 18 years and we have an age of marriage with consent between the ages of 16 and 18 years.  We are debating an Age of Majority Bill and it is not as simple as saying that everything will happen at 18 years and nothing will happen under that age, whether marriage, legal contracts or sitting on a trade union committee or going into hire purchase agreements or taking out mortgages on houses.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally there are two different questions and I intend to treat them as separate.  By moving on the report recommendations on the age of majority I am not to be taken as inferring that I do not agree with the recommendation in regard to marriage but I am treating them as separate issues.  They need to be examined seriously, especially because the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown is imminent.  Newspaper reports have indicated that the committee have very strong views on the age of marriage.  I presume that what they have decided already will not be changed but will be included in their final report. So it is appropriate to wait for the final report to see how it matches the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and then have a debate on the appropriate legal age for marriage on a separate piece of legislation to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Keating and others that it is a serious question to which parliamentarians should direct their attention quickly.  I am separating the two issues for the reasons I have outlined.  We will examine the matter and if change is appropriate we will be back with separate legislation. <Col N="1889" /> In regard to the free age for marriage, as Deputy Keating explained section 18 of the Marriage Act of 1972 already gives power to the Minister for Health to make regulations substituting an age lower than 21 years in regard to parental permission for marriage.  Therefore, making 18 years the free legal age for marriage can be accomplished without legislation.  If we decide that the age of majority should be the free age for marriage a regulation by the Minister for Health can regularise it and we do not need amendments here.</P>
    <P>In regard to the minimum age for marriage, it is reasonable to suppose that there is a divergence of views about what the law should be in regard to marriages below the age of 16 years and marriages between the ages of 16 and 18 years. These proposals are not in any way related to what the age of majority should be and it is reasonable to suggest that we should deal with them separately.  It would be undesirable to have provisions relating to such an important aspect of life contained in any legislation other than a Marriage Act.  In the past marriage law has always been the subject of separate legislation and there does not appear to be any good reason why that principle should not apply in relation to the matters we are now discussing.  The Oireachtas Committee report is imminent and we will have to look at that matter again.</P>
    <P>Deputies Woods and O'Kennedy asked about continuing protection for young persons between the ages of 18 and 21 years and they referred to such protection in New Zealand in regard to certain transactions so that a court could intervene in certain circumstances.  I appreciate their concern but it would defeat a major objective of the Bill, which is to give young people the right freely to enter into contracts at 18 years or on earlier marriage.  It is easy to see that if there would be any possibility of a court intervening to upset a contract in certain cases it could result in lending agencies or traders being reluctant to deal with persons between the ages of 18 and 21 years.  Therefore, if there is any possibility of intervention by the courts and if a person is anything less than totally free <Col N="1890" /> to enter into obligations, I do not think the lending agencies or traders would provide the facilities which young people might need between the ages of 18 and 21 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked why should a person be able to take out funds lodged in court at 18 years but not trust funds until the age of 21 years.  There may be misunderstanding about what is involved. The provision in paragraph 3 of the Schedule relates to trust instruments made before the commencement of the Act.  It is right that we should not interfere with the intentions of a person who set up a trust before the Act comes into force.  That person would have taken account of the relevant provisions of the 1881 Act in deciding on the terms of the trust.  The object of the paragraph is to preserve the trust instrument as it stood before the commencement of the Act. However, the paragraph includes an enabling provision to allow the trustees to pay income from the trust to the beneficiary at the age of majority.  In addition to the powers already contained in the 1881 Act, the income can be paid to his parents or guardians for his maintenance or education.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies asked about changing the age for membership of the Dáil and Seanad.  This would require an amendment of the Constitution.  Such a proposal could not have been included in this Bill because Article 46 of the Constitution provides that a Bill to amend the Constitution may not include any other proposal. A proposal to reduce the age for membership of both Houses to 18 years was not proceeded with in 1972 when the Constitution was amended to reduce the voting age to 18 years.  It was decided that the age of membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas should remain at 21 years.  In most EC states the age of election to parliament is higher than the voting age.  In Belgium it is 25 as against 21 years; in Italy and the Netherlands it is 25 as against 18 years; in France it is 23 as against 18 years; in Luxembourg and the UK it is 21 as against 18 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods suggested I was being inconsistent in not considering adjustments <Col N="1891" /> of other age limits specified by law in line with the change in the age of majority.  For example, he asked if I was considering a change in the age of criminal responsibility.  First of all, it would not be appropriate to deal with the age of criminal responsibility in a Bill principally concerned with reform of the civil law. Furthermore, I would not wish to pre-empt any decision which the Minister for Health may take in relation to the age of criminal responsibility under the Children Bill.  During the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill I made my position quite clear on this.  The same Deputy spoke of the possibility of the Bill leading to a reduction in the maximum age of 21 years, not 19 years, up to which a young offender could be sent to St. Patrick's Institution, with the result that more juveniles would be mixing with older and more hardened criminals in Mountjoy Prison.  It is not intended that the Bill should affect any age limit prescribed in legislation relating to imprisonment or detention.  I will be putting down an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Myra Barry asked about persons over 18 years living at home who apply for dole payments and being assessed on the basis of parents' income.  This Bill is not the appropriate one on which to deal with this point.  It is relevant to social welfare legislation and the question of assessment of income under that legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's failure to control the price of electricity and, in view of the serious hardship the high cost of electricity is causing countless families and the loss of jobs in industry resulting <Col N="1892" /> from lack of competitiveness, calls upon the Government to withdraw its approval for the recent price increase pending the publication and a full debate on the report of the inquiry into the high cost of electricity in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is agreement among the Whips that the time be divided between myself and Deputy Fitzgerald.  The recent increases are inconsistent with an enlightened industrial development policy.  Job losses are inevitable and damage will be done to our industrial base.  Liquidations and closures will continue unchecked and the revenue gained from the increases will not compensate for the resultant unemployment and redundancy payments and loss of personal taxation.</P>
    <P>The recent excessive price increase, unjustified in the present economic climate, will have a very big impact on our competitiveness in two essential areas. Firstly, the exports that will be lost because of this price increase and secondly the penetration by imports into key sectors of our domestic markets.  This is an area which has accelerated in the past five years to alarming proportions at present.  Economic growth depends on our ability to export and proportionately Ireland is the third largest exporter in the EC after Belgium and the Netherlands with our exports accounting for some 60 per cent of our national output.  Our technological industries now account for one-fifth of manufacturing employment. These industries are critically dependent on cost competitiveness and one of the main essential services, electricity, has increased in price much faster than in the countries of our competitors.  It is making markets of exporting firms very vulnerable. Imports in the food sector and building materials have doubled in the past five years and have now reached the alarming sum of £1 billion.  Had Irish electricity costs been contained thousands of jobs could have been saved and many closures avoided.</P>
    <P>We have to bear in mind that in 1983 there were 700 liquidations and business closures with the resulting loss of 11,000 jobs in manufacturing industry and perhaps <Col N="1893" /> half that much again in other areas. This was reflected upon in this House in recent weeks in support of our claim that the national plan is based on dubious statistics.  There is no doubt but that if the factory closure dilemma is allowed to continue we will have a totally fragmented industrial base.  If our high technological industries become part, as is now threatened, of these closures it will be a devastating blow to our balance of payments and export positions.  There is no doubt but that it can be clearly established that electricity costs have played a big role in the factory and business closures which have taken place in the last few years.</P>
    <P>The excess burden by way of additional costs which has to be made up by Irish industry is estimated at £50 million which is the equivalent of 5,000 manufacturing jobs.  When one considers that each manufacturing job also accounts for one in the service sector it is obvious that this extra burden placed on the economy is reducing the possible number of extra jobs by some 10,000 and this is in that one field alone.</P>
    <P>High ESB charges have damaged the productive process of our island economy. We have to export to survive. Without export growth no recovery or job creation programme can succeed.  If the Government are serious about their commitment to job creation as outlined in the White Paper on Industrial Policy, chapter 4, under the heading Creating a Competitive Economy, now is the time for their industrial costs monitoring group to show its effectiveness in assessing the effects of charges, costs and prices on industry.  These costs and the effect they have on industry have been tabulated by the CII and economists in all fields of industrial endeavour and still no recognition is given to this dilemma by the planners of industrial policy.  Every national and international commentator agrees on the critical effect that essential service costs have on maintaining market share through competitiveness.  Now is the time to translate sentiment into tangible cost policies.  I put it to the Minister that 10,000 jobs are more necessary than <Col N="1894" /> 10 million excuses for inaction by the Government.</P>
    <P>We listened to a plethora of assumptions outlined in the national plan and, as yet, no positive, realistic step has been outlined by the Government about which way they will deal with the jobs crisis which exists.  Our industrial electricity prices must be brought into line with the average of our competitors and trading partners in the EC.  At present our electricity costs are 25 per cent higher that the rated average of our trading competitors. The greatest gap with the greatest cost penalty exists with the large energy-intensive users where industry pays between 40 per cent and 80 per cent more than their competitors.  In other countries users over £2 million of electricity per annum obtain special discounts per unit of about 50 per cent.  In Ireland it is about 20 per cent.  Consequently large users of electricity in other jurisdictions pay considerably less than our industries. The differential is 30 per cent more in Ireland than in Germany.  It is 40 per cent more than our UK competitors and 80 per cent more than our French competitors. There is a huge electricity demand in industries such as Alumina, Irish Cement and Irish Steel and the cost of the electricity works out at more than the total wages bill in these types of industries.</P>
    <P>In the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, the cost of electricity is almost half the total payroll of the industry. Small industries are also penalised and are charged at higher rates than the domestic rate.  This is not the practice in other EC countries and we must get in line with out international competitors.  If we fail to do this, large companies will reduce their operations here, expand their operations abroad and will install their own generating capacity which will result in ESB sales falling still further.  The worst effect of all will be that no new electricity-intensive industries will set up here.</P>
    <P>To reduce electricity costs here would not only help our industries to stay competitive and create additional jobs in industries and the service sector, it would <Col N="1895" /> also result in extra electricity being used and would effectively help the ESB's balance sheet by increasing their revenue. On the domestic consumer front, this new increase in the price of electricity is a further blow to the household budget and will cause widespread hardship to all consumers, particularly the old and those living on small incomes.  The ESB bill is a major family worry and, because of the essential nature of the service and the lack of alternatives available to the consumers, families have to suffer diet deficiency in order to keep the light on.  There has always been a stigma attached to families who had their supply of electricity cut off often due to no fault of theirs and families will endure enormous hardship to avoid having their light cut off.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to have promotional campaigns urging greater use of electricity when almost 200,000 families are living on the poverty line at present and are unable to meet existing costs of electricity charges.  Is the Minister conscious of the hardship being endured and the extent of the decline in living standards of ordinary people?  It is not enough for the Minister's amendment to say that the Government are keeping the increase in line with inflation.  Does the Minister realise what has been happening to disposable income in so far as ordinary workers are concerned?  Does he realise the increases that ordinary people have to suffer over and above that now being implemented as far as electricity is concerned?</P>
    <P>Is he aware that there is talk of a further increase of 10 per cent in the cost of telephones?  Is he aware of the impact which service charges have on disposable incomes and that one-third of the people are unable to pay that charge to local authorities?  Is he aware of what the Minister for Health and Social Welfare has been doing to the health services by increasing hospital charges?  There are also increases in fees for education and in costs for school transport.  Is he aware of the increase in food prices, a staggering 14 per cent, in the past 12 months?  His <Col N="1896" /> amendment says it will be below the rate of inflation but all these go together in the impact that the prices have on a family budget, and adding insult to injury by putting an extra 7 per cent on electricity charges is nothing short of scandalous from a socialist or Labour Minister.</P>
    <P>How can the Government reasonably expect the trade unions to exercise pay restraint when price increases in essential services and food are reducing the living standards of families every single month? Pay restraint requires price restraint and the Government control prices.  There is an urgent need to review the fuel voucher scheme in urban and rural areas.  There is discrimination against old age pensioners in provincial areas as against those in the cities.  This anomaly must be rectified and it should not take a High Court action and decision on fuel vouchers to show a Labour Minister the proper action to take.  The need was there, the Minister knows that need and he has not made a satisfactory response.  It was bordering on very dubious politics to allow a case to go to the High Court which was going to cause such great hardship to so many people.</P>
    <P>The causes for the high cost of electricity are overmanning in the ESB, stagnating demand, the high cost of peat, the hydrocarbon tax on fuel oils, rates charges, the price of natural gas and the lack of coal fired stations.  The Government are involved in decisions concerning many of these areas so they have a major responsibility with regard to the price of electricity.  It will take Government action to bring about a reduction in the cost. The mix of primary fuels in the generation of electricity has changed over the years, especially since the availability of natural gas became a prime fuel for generation.  The percentage of electricity generated by oil has declined from 73 per cent in 1979 to 40 per cent in 1982.  The percentage generated by gas has increased from 7 per cent in 1979 to 36 per cent in 1982.  The percentage generated from peat has declined from 19 per cent to 14 per cent.  As an interim measure, natural gas sources should be used to stabilise prices and it must make more <Col N="1897" /> sense to ease electricity prices, protect jobs and create new ones than to use the vast profits from Bord Gáis to pay unemployment benefit to workers who have lost their jobs because of high energy costs.</P>
    <P>I understand that the new plant at Moneypoint will come on stream in April 1985.  It is estimated that the cost of generation will be only half that of existing plants.  We would like to hear a commitment from the Minister and an acknowledgment that it is proper that the consumer should benefit from the cheaper cost of generation.  That would be one way of dealing with the high price of electricity.  If the price of peat through the ESB is greater than its equivalent energy value, it should be priced in direct ratio to that of competing fuel.  It is an indigenous energy source and, to use an unfavourable pricing mechanism to close down Bord na Móna bogs and peat generating stations, throwing thousands out of work, is shortsighted and not in the national interest.  It is also nationally wasteful.</P>
    <P>We are tired of hearing arguments in support of huge national expenditure for so-called strategic reasons in maintaining shipping, steel and transport interests. Surely protecting a home generating capacity with indigenous fuels is more important than assisting the balance of payments accounts of other countries by purchasing oil and coal abroad?  We should maintain a level of generating capacity within our shores using our own fuels.  If there was ever a national emergency and we found that they had all been disposed of we would be subjected to the ire of the general public.  There is substantial excess electricity generating capacity here at present but this should be viewed as a national asset and utilised as a growth generator in the economy. Had the projected growth targets been reached as envisaged at the time of planning, we would have had no spare capacity by 1990.  Sales grew during the seventies by an average of 8 per cent and if we had a genuine interest in providing jobs for our people then sales would again <Col N="1898" /> have to reach those percentages.  However, there is no indication in the national plan that it could even be expected or hoped that such percentages would be reached.  That is why the general public have condemned out of hand the plan of no hope that was recently published by the Government.</P>
    <P>Planning future capacity should be carefully considered.  In the meantime the existing capacity should be used as an investment incentive and so increase demand and revenue for the ESB.  In any service where there is excess capacity any sale that will reach minimum fuel operating costs should be utilised.  The contribution these sales will make would reduce the capital and interest costs expended in installing that very capacity.  It would keep the installations operational, maintain the job complement already in the service and encourage electricity intensive industries to locate here.  A marginal cost pricing strategy has merit and it should be considered favourably at this time.</P>
    <P>The results of two inquiries are awaited at present.  The first is the review of the electricity generating programme which will deal with the need for existing levels of capacity and planned additions for the future.  The second is an inquiry into prices which was set up in October 1982 by the Fianna Fáil Government and has been sitting there for the past few years. This will have considerable impact on job creation in industry generally.  It is a national scandal that these reviews have not been published.  What good reason can the Minister give for their non-publication at this time?  What is he trying to hide by not immediately having the reviews published and debated here in this House?  These two inquiries are interdependent and they should be published forthwith.</P>
    <P>In May 1984 the National Prices Commission considered a proposal to renew the ESB annual prices contract from April 1984 to April 1985.  The ESB, as we understand it, wanted £63 million extra revenue for that period.  They claimed, in support of their application, projected increases in fuel, materials and payrolls, <Col N="1899" /> with exchange losses.  It is difficult to understand how they could have included all these matters in their application.  In the area of fuel, there is no consistent view of energy cost movement for the period.  The National Prices Commission were quite justified in disallowing this part of the claim.  The claim was for £15.9 million extra under the heading of material overheads and payroll, of which £13.9 million was allowed.  It is very difficult to understand why this was allowed, considering the downward trend, if one is to believe the Government, of the inflation rate and taking note of the public pay policy as announced by the Government in the national plan.  The allowable cost increase by the National Prices Commission ended up at £42.43 million but there is evidence available that would suggest that this could have been further pruned.  The National Prices Commission also recommended the elimination of a cost differential between Irish and European tariffs, particularly in industrial costing.  There is no justification for further delaying this recommendation.  The commission deemed it inequitable that industrial, commercial and domestic consumers should have pay increases in costs controlled by the Government which their competitors do not have to bear.</P>
    <P>Holding the line on electricity costs can benefit every sector of the economy, exporters, industrial effort, job creation and consumers.  We can maintain our competitive edge by controlling prices of essential services.  This, in turn, will control price increases for the necessities of life and give the country what it most needs at this time &mdash; faith in itself and a sense of optimism for further development and job creation.  There is no doubt that electricity prices have a very big impact, not just on our competitiveness but on the attraction of further industries to this country.  There has been a very big shortfall in the number of industrial projects in the pipeline to be considered by the IDA in recent years.  It is reckoned internationally that one of the prime reasons for this is our essential services costs.  Principal among those are our electricity <Col N="1900" /> costs.</P>
    <P>The Government are a major contributory factor in the high level of electricity cost and must be made to see that their inactivity in stabilising prices has caused widespread hardship on the domestic front and considerable job misplacement and redundancies on the industrial front. They must act now if these interests are to be protected in so far as job creation is concerned.  We as a political party are demanding that the reviews should be published forthwith, so that we will have an indication as to what is being recommended in this area, rather than allowing increases to go on apace and then suddenly publishing the inquiry at a more favourable time, obviously to the Government's interests.  We are asking the Minister to give a commitment in this regard this evening in so far as the publication is concerned and we are asking him to withdraw the last increase because of the hardship it is causing consumers on the domestic front, the difficulties it is causing our industrialists and which it is creating for job creation prospects as far as development is concerned. We ask the Minister to consider this favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They come like thieves in the night to steal our food subsidies and to cut off our electricity. That is the public perception of this Government.  That is how the ordinary, decent people perceive the parties now in Government.  Quite frankly, they see no distinction between the Labour Party and their partners in Coalition.  Sadly, it is as stark and real as that.  This is a perception which is firmly branded and etched into the minds of the poor, the deprived, and the needy in our cities, towns and throughout the country at large.  The long nights of August 2 and October 26 of this year will for a long time be remembered among the starkest and darkest in our history.  The refusal of this Government to halt electricity price increases clearly demonstrates their heartless and cruel attitude to the poor and the unemployed and compounds a callous insensitivity which has been the <Col N="1901" /> hallmark of the reign of this Coalition Government, in office for the past two years.  How a Labour Party could seek to justify the inflicting of such hardship and injustice surely defies comprehension and reason.</P>
      <P>In these difficult times a powerful case is to be made, even for the middle income groups, for the controlling of electricity charges.  Once again, however, the so-called left wing of the Government have dissipated before the monetarist hordes. There is no doubt that this recent increase will deal a very severe body blow to those already struggling to weather the ravages of the recession, the problems of unemployment and of Government cutbacks. I regard the wording of this amendment as an insult to those people to whom I have referred.  In no sense of caring does it address the problem that this increase has inevitably compounded.  To attempt to justify increases in the cost of electricity in these extremely difficult times on the basis of &ldquo;decisions taken over many decades with the approval of successive Governments&rdquo; is opting out of one's duty as a Government.  Since this Government took office, every decision they took and every pronouncement they made, they qualified by reference to previous Government decisions.  Surely it is about time this Government made decisions for themselves and were prepared to rule and form policies on the basis of what they as a Government considered right, proper, caring and reasonable.  But no.  Everything done, every announcement made is qualified in this way.  The Minister opposite should be ashamed and embarrassed to be associated with this statement of amendment from the leader of his party. Very few people will be interested in its contents or in hearing what happened two, four, six or eight years ago.  They are interested only in what is happening now and what is to happen tomorrow and how they are going to get by on the morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past year or two ESB bills have represented a significant proportion of total family outlay on a regular basis. Even with the best system of family budget management, even applying this <Col N="1902" /> to the middle income groups as they are referred to, the payment of the ESB bill represents a serious burden which is not shouldered very lightly by most of the community.  When we take account of the fact that even the middle income groups are hit by unacceptably high taxes, direct and indirect, and a shrinking national cake &mdash; as the cake shrinks the take shrinks and the burden becomes increasingly greater on those who are fortunate enough to have even the smallest chunk of that cake &mdash; their plight is worsening and their standard of living is eroding rapidly.  They are asked to accept a pay freeze but at the same time to take on board a significant hike in what is for them an area of essential spending. Surely such a situation is untenable and must be denounced by any fair-minded person as a further attack on those who invariably are asked to carry the can.</P>
    <P>This Government are inviting revolt &mdash; and I hope that my words are not true, that my belief is not accurate &mdash; from those still fortunate enough to hold down a job who, God knows, are becoming fewer as the days go by.  They have taken more than could be reasonably expected of them, and quite clear is the answer they would give to either Fine Gael or Labour if they were to be given the opportunity tomorrow.  Throughout my constituency former Labour Party activists are coming to me in the streets, outside the church and at my clinics, telling me how ashamed and disappointed they are and how their great expectations of the leader of their party have been so starkly and harshly dashed, particularly in the past year.  They were prepared to allow a period of settling in, but they expected that the kind of social conscience that over the years they have come to associate with the Labour Party would be realised as he sharpened his teeth.  Instead, all they find is the stark reality of capitulation.  My duty as a public representative is to bring that message to this Minister, to his leader and to their party and to ensure that, in so far as is possible, this side of the House represents the views of those unrepresented former Labour activists.  Some <Col N="1903" /> of them are still very confused.  They do not know whether they are Labour, whether they are more to the left or identified with people who would be sitting normally on my right or whether they would favour coming across to this side in their support.  Their confusion is great because it is created by those who presumed and still presume to speak for them and represent them.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this provocative exercise, my overriding concern is for the unemployed, the poor, the aged and those on various forms of social welfare as well as those on very low incomes. The Government are attempting to take solace from the fact that they granted only a 7 per cent increase on the application for 12 per cent.  This is poor consolation for those who have to attempt to meet the extra burden.  A married man with two dependent children on unemployment assistance of £69.65 per week will not be convinced so easily by this kind of spurious defence.  How is he expected to feed and clothe his family, keep adequate heat in his home and now pay anything from £5 to £10 extra for his ESB bills?  This is what the extra amount will be.  I understand that recent estimates of the average increase put the figure at around £3, but this seems extraordinary and out of line with the quantity of ESB bills being presented to me at my clinic throughout Dublin North-East. The average bill will be in the region of £100, and I cannot see any justification for using a figure of £3 which, I understand, emanated from a Government statement, again released in the dark of night on 26 October.  There is courage, commitment and conviction for you. Take a widow with dependent children, a deserted wife, with dependent children or the father on disability benefit or invalidity pension.  Gravest of all, how is the non-contributory old age pensioner expected to cope this winter? These are the silent, unrepresented groups &mdash; unrepresented in this Government &mdash; whose meek voices and gentle pleas have been callously ignored by this most uncaring <Col N="1904" /> Government.  I suggest that a long, cold, hungry winter is in store for many of our citizens this year.</P>
    <P>Voluntary and charitable organisations speak daily at local level of the impoverishment and hardship.  They speak of increased and ongoing petitions for assistance to enable people to pay up so that disconnection does not follow.  The conmanship and public relations exercises that have been brought to a sickening new low by this Government are to be condemned.  This Government were seen to send civil servants late at night on 2 August to announce the halving of food subsidies.  The Taoiseach had gone into hiding a few hours earlier.  The people hardest hit are the recipients of social welfare.  The Labour Party were not going to stand for such hardship, so the family income supplement was to be brought forward, so we were told.  The one big problem was that when it was brought forward they forgot to include those thousands of our least well off. What a sick, cruel, unforgivable way to treat the weakest among us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Social Welfare may attempt to defend this decision on the spurious basis that the health boards are available to assist those most genuinely in need.  Surely to attempt to do so is to set out deliberately to mislead. After all, was it not he as Minister, who issued instructions to the board's superintendents regarding the new regulations, telling them how to fob off those applicants for assistance with ESB bills and those who found recently that they were denied the few bob which would have helped them as parents in need to purchase the school uniforms and shoes for their now embarrassed children? In 1983 upwards of 35,000 families had to be assisted in the payment of their ESB bills by the Eastern Health Board, but because of this instruction that figure for 1984 will be halved although the level of need has increased in the meantime. Increasingly my clinics &mdash; I suppose this applies to my colleagues also &mdash; are being filled by people old and young who are threatened with disconnection of their electricity supply or who have just been <Col N="1905" /> refused help with payment of bills because of their inability to make the first part payment.  I have witnessed people crying with embarrassment and shame because of their woeful predicament. I refer to both old and young in that regard.  I tell the Minister and his leader, the Tánaiste in this Government, as they seem to need to be told, that the needy in our society have no interest in the report of the inquiry into electricity prices referred to by the Minister if it is offered as an excuse tonight.  The here and now with all its attendant difficulties is their full concern.  Families have told me that they did without food in order not to suffer the indignity and stigma of being without electricity supply.  Senior citizens living alone and dependent on electricity for heat are invariably so sparing and conserving in their use of the supply that they are left cold and miserable for most of the winter.  If this Government do not realise the extent of the problem with this category, then they should go out and ask those people. These are the hardships the Minister and his party along with this Government have chosen to ignore, and by ignoring them they have either failed or refused to acknowledge the level of bitterness, disillusionment and demoralisation they are engendering.</P>
    <P>The philosophy of the Government appears to be, &ldquo;if you are down we will put you down further and keep you there&rdquo;.  We have read about complaints from the ESB apportioning blame for their worsening trade deficit of £32 million. We have seen references to huge losses by the board on foreign loans.  The Government should come forward and give us open, honest answers that have meaning and sense to the ordinary people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy has recently received for examination the report of the Inquiry <Col N="1906" /> into Electricity Prices, notes that the costs behind electricity supply result from decisions taken over many decades with the approval of successive Governments, notes that the finances of the ESB must be assured to maintain an appropriate level of service to all consumers, endorses the view of the Minister for Energy that it is likely that electricity prices can only be reduced through long term structural measures which allow for the regional, employment, and social, as well as economic aspects of electricity supply, and approves the decision of the Government to allow the recent increase in electricity charges, as recommended by the National Prices Commission, which keeps the increase in electricity prices below the already reduced level of general inflation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion is totally unacceptable in its attempt to imply failure on the part of the Government to control the price of electricity.  What is expected apparently is a refusal to allow the Electricity Supply Board any price increase at all without regard to positive justification for a price increase to compensate the board for increased costs which it has incurred.  The ESB are not subject to any less price control than any other manufacturer or producer here and, indeed, they are subject to far greater control and scrutiny of their price increase applications in that they are examined in great detail by the National Prices Commission, whose recommendations are subject to the approval of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. They are then examined by the Minister for Energy who in turn submits each application to Government for their approval.  This, as no doubt the movers of the motion will know from their former experience in Government, is an extremely detailed and searching examination. This process needs to be put in perspective relative to the situation with price increase applications by most other manufacturers or producers whose applications pass through the process of examination by the NPC and approval by the <Col N="1907" /> Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  Most of these applications do not, therefore, pass through the additional process of examination by another Minister and his Department nor are they submitted for final approval by the Government.</P>
    <P>The recent price increase approved for the ESB was for an increase of 6.83 per cent on average to come into effect from the board's November-December 1984 billing period.  This increase was recommended by the National Prices Commission following a detailed examination of the board's price increase application. Just how detailed that examination was is clear to anybody who takes the time to read the commission's monthly report No. 139 for May 1984.  The commission's recommendation was designed to compensate the ESB for allowable increases in the costs of fuels, materials, overheads and payroll.  A significant part of the allowable increase in fuel costs arose from the increased cost of fuel oil due to the fall in the value of the Irish pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> the US dollar.  The increased payroll costs allowed were in accordance with the commission's standard price control criteria.  The approved price increase of 6.83 per cent was an annualised figure which should be seen in the light of the annualised increase of 10.2 per cent which the ESB had applied for approval to implement in its current fanancial year.</P>
    <P>The ESB are required to operate against a general requirement laid down in the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, that it must break even, taking one year with another.  This is of particular significance in view of the present difficult financial situation of the board.  The annual report of the ESB for the year ended 31 March 1984 shows that in that year it had a deficit of £23.3 million.  It is the worst trading result ever experienced by the ESB and brought the cumulative deficit at 31 March 1984 to over £37.4 million.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious situation for a board which can justifiably be proud of their record over the years since their establishment of being one of the most <Col N="1908" /> efficient semi-State organisations.  The country indeed owes a great deal to the dedication and efficiency of the board and their workforce in their operations down through the past years.  The situation, however, is likley to get worse before it will get better.  In fact, in the current financial year, the ESB have been projecting a deficit of £40 million which would bring the cumulative deficit at the end of this year to over £77 million, that is without taking account of the recently approved price increase.  This would obviously be an intolerable situation for the ESB and is one which has to be faced up to by all concerned including the ESB, the Government, the public at large and this House.  This is the context in which the recent price increase of 6.83 per cent in ESB charges has to be seen.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, that price increase will come into effect from the November-December 1984 billing period and will bring additional revenue of approximately £19 million in the remainder of the financial year ending on 31 March 1985.  This will leave the board's projected cumulative deficit at that date at £58 million unless further measures are taken to reduce the costs of the ESB.  This is essential to meet the present difficult situation but it must be carried through in a planned manner so as to ensure that all the considerations involved including the regional, employment and social, as well as the economic, aspects of electricity supply will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The ESB have a statutory responsibility to provide an acceptable electricity service to the community at minimum cost to consumers.  However, the business environment in which the ESB must operate now is very different from that which existed for the past fifty years for two main reasons.  First, the price of electricity has become a major problem because of a very substantial increase during the past ten years not alone in the price of electricity but of all other energy forms as well.  In 1981 the ESB publicly declared their objective for the eighties to be to contain annual electricity price increases to less than the level of national inflation as measured by the consumer <Col N="1909" /> price index.  To achieve this objective every cost factor in the board's operations is being challenged and various cost-reducing measures have been taken for the past three years.  Secondly, the great development phase of the ESB is finished with electricity now readily available to every home in the country.  Coinciding with this has been the upheaval in the energy world following two major oil crises which affected demand for all energy forms.  The outlook for electricity in Ireland now is that demand growth for the next decade will be low or moderate compared with an annual increase approaching 10 per cent in past years.</P>
    <P>Already the ESB have in hands plans based on their five-year Strategic Plan 1983-1988 which has as its primary objective, &ldquo;to make major changes to achieve substantial price improvement&rdquo;.  That plan was drawn up by the board and management of the ESB on their own initiative and responsibility.  The plan sets out the measures which the ESB will be adopting to accelerate the transition of the board from a high growth expansionist organisation to a low growth stable one.  The measures relate to each and every section of the organisation and aim to reduce costs by way of reduced staff numbers, improvements in administrative and accounting procedures and greater control of overheads generally. The proposals for overhead reductions include the setting of operating standards, improving efficiency and monitoring performance.</P>
    <P>As is well known, the ESB, like most other electricity utility today, have substantial excess generating capacity which can be attributed to a number of reasons such as a sharp cutback in demand for electricity mainly due to the recession, generating capacity provided to burn Kinsale gas and the provision of the Moneypoint generating capacity to come on stream over the next three to five years as a measure to reduce dependence on oil.  The strategic plan envisages greater efficiency in operation of the generating system with a view to achieving economies. When the present generating <Col N="1910" /> programme has been completed no further generating projects will be needed until well into the next decade.  They also propose strict economies in premises construction. No further head office or headquarters development is envisaged before 1990 and other premises developments will be limited to absolute priority cases.</P>
    <P>In the area of distribution, the plan proposes greater efficiency to reduce system losses and stockholding costs. Better organisation, planning and work methods which are proposed will lead to a reduction in staff numbers.  In the marketing area the plan envisages the maintenance of a strong presence of electricity in the energy market, the development of new uses for electricity as well as shaping the increasing loads to give a satisfactory financial contribution.  The development of tariff structures which achieve financial objectives and which support load shaping and load building is also proposed.</P>
    <P>The ESB's financial position is now very serious in that it is financing heavy deficits and that the price increases allowed in recent years were often not alone insufficient to cover the costs incurred by the board but were also delayed until well into the board's financial year so that the additional revenues which accrued from the price increases were unable to impact significantly on the board's deficits at the end of financial years.  Any situation where continuing serious deficit is incurred would damage the financial integrity of the ESB to the point where it could no longer borrow or service its borrowings and its future could only be seen in the context of another major burden on the Exchequer.  The projected deficit for the current year arises from a combination of increases in costs and continuing relatively low growth in demand reflecting the effects of the recession.  The ESB, therefore, in submitting its price increase application to the National Prices Commission, proposed that the deficit, existing after the implementation of a price increase, should be recovered over a five year period commencing in April 1985 in order to minimise the effect on prices.  The <Col N="1911" /> board's proposals in this regard will be considered in due time.</P>
    <P>I referred a short time ago to the proposal in the ESB strategic plan to develop tariff structures which will support load shaping and load building.  This brings up an often repeated criticism in recent times that industrial and commercial electricity tariffs are unduly high and that these categories of consumers are, in effect, subsidising the tariffs of domestic consumers.  It is, of course, easy for certain interests to simply suggest the loading of costs onto domestic consumers as a means towards achieving a reduction in industrial and commercial tariffs but this does not give due account to the already heavy effect of electricity prices on domestic consumers.  Neither is it a fair thesis to advance that specific costs of production must, in themselves be lower than costs in other countries without taking account of the benefits of financial supports for industry here.  It must be remembered that fair comparison between prices charged by different electricity utilities is an extremely difficult proposition because of the timing of such comparisons and the virtual impossibility of determining the level of, and of quantifying, the benefits to industrial and commercial consumers in other countries through such measures as fuel subsidies, preferential fuel prices, injection of equity capital, capital subsidies and underwriting of currency exposure risks.</P>
    <P>A typical example of the importance attaching to the timing of price comparisons is represented by current ESB charges <i>vis-à-vis</i> those in the United Kingdom.  There have been a number of indications in recent days of firm proposals to increase UK prices for electricity in line with the increase in inflation.  Such an increase would restore the relative competitiveness of ESB charges with those of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, however, to keep a sense of proportion about criticisms of high electricity prices for industry here. Apart from a few large and energy intensive firms the cost of energy to industry comprises a small proportion of overall <Col N="1912" /> costs.  A survey of energy consumption undertaken by the Department of Energy and the Confederation of Irish Industry in 1981 indicated that for the majority of firms energy costs are less than 5 per cent of turnover &mdash; with heavy fuel oil the predominant fuel.  The results of the follow-up survey, which was carried out this year, are at present being processed.</P>
    <P>The price of electricity for industrial use is not a simple matter and is influenced by a number of factors such as: the tension of supply; the load factor; the level of consumption; the season of supply and day or night use of power.  In addition, Ireland's relative geographical isolation, especially in regard to electricity where our country is the only one in Europe without an operable electricity interconnection with a neighbouring country, is a further consideration to be borne in mind when responding to calls to bring our electricity tariff structure into line with those of our European Community partners.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the report of the inquiry into electricity prices.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Energy, in a press statement which he issued on 5 October 1984, announced that he had received the report of the inquiry, that it was very comprehensive and would require detailed examination in his Department and by the Government.  It is hoped to have that examination completed at an early date.  The Tánaiste also confirmed that, following consideration of the report by the Government, it is intended to have that report published.  I do not wish to pre-empt in any way the considerations or conclusions of the inquiry but I am sure there is little doubt that the report of the inquiry will be addressing the question of industrial, commercial and domestic tariffs and the basis on which these should be determined.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant to mention here that, when the price increase of 6.83 per cent in electricity charges was being approved, the Government decided that the increase would be subject to review when the report of the inquiry is being considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> The difficult financial situation facing the ESB is not unique to that board.  The same situation faces many electricity-generating utilities in other countries throughout the world.  This has largely influenced the International Energy Agency into convening meetings of electricity experts in member states to carry out a study of the overall situation and to prepare a report on their study.  The objectives of the study are:</P>
    <P>(1)  To assess the future role of electricity in advancing the economic development and improving the energy security of IEA countries;</P>
    <P>(2)  To identify obstacles which may prevent the electricity utilities achieving that role.</P>
    <P>(3)  To highlight experiences in Member countries which are relevant to the situations in other Member countries.</P>
    <P>(4)  To suggest policies to assure the proper role for electricity and in particular policies to: maximise efficient demand for electricity; improve the efficiency with which electricity is generated; transmitted and used; restrain cost increases; reduce the use of oil and other insecure primary fuels in electricity generation and enhance generally the contribution of the electricity industry to energy security; mitigate the environmental problems associated with electricity production and transmission; enhance international co-operation in the development and use of electricity resources and assure a sound relationship between electricity prices and costs.</P>
    <P>The first meeting of the electricity study was held at the end of last June and it is expected that the report of their findings will be available early in the new year.  There are also clear indications that the report will be a very comprehensive one which will be of great interest to anyone concerned with the industry, whether as a producer, distributor or consumer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn spoke about the importance of electricity prices in industrial <Col N="1914" /> expenses.  This has to be seen in perspective. There is no point in not keeping a sense of proportion.  For the majority of firms energy costs are less than 5 per cent of turnover.  That is worth repeating because the Deputy seemed to give the impression that costs were running beyond that figure and instanced only two areas where that might have happened. Another survey is being done and when the report is available those findings will be updated and I am sure Deputy Flynn will be interested to know of them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned the cost increase claimed by the ESB.  The Deputy accepted the disallowance by the National Prices Commission of a certain percentage of the increase demanded by the ESB and then said the Government should relieve the country of the rest of the increase.  He has been in Government and should know that the National Prices Commission have gone through the various problems faced by the ESB and the reasons for this price increase and after a very detailed examination they recommended this increase. It was not something which was just thrown out and accepted by the Government. This recommendation was submitted to one Minister, then a second Minister and then the Government before it was finally accepted.  We do not lightly accept national price increases and apply them to such an important commodity as electricity.

      <P>I would like to conclude now by calling on the House to approve the Government amendment to the motion and in particular to endorse the Government decision allowing the recent increase in electricity charges which was recommended by the National Prices Commission and which was in fact less than the increase in the already reduced level of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní mór dom a rá ar dtús go bhfuilim ag cuidiú leis an rún atá molta <Col N="1917" /> ag an Teachta Flynn.  The first day I commented on the increases the Government so willingly approved, and confirmed here tonight, I said that the increase will further reduce the competitiveness of Irish manufacturers resulting in increasing imports and a reduced share of the export markets which would make the Government's national plan figures for industrial growth and job creation unobtainable.  Since then I have had no reason to change that view.  At present the Government are asking workers for wage restraint.  Do they realise that this increase will make their request very difficult to attain?  Surely the Government must be conscious of the fact that the increase could not have come at a worse time of the year, November and December, when it will affect householders, all industry, manufacturing and supporting industries and agriculture?  Surely they realise that winter brings increased usage in all these areas.  The price increase is outrageous.  It shows the Government's insensitivity to our economic problems.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the workforce in the ESB, those people on whom we all depend, especially at times of storms or other bad weather.  It is not my intention to try to detract in any way from that workforce; rather, I wish to show that the responsibility for the position in which the ESB find themselves rests with the Government.  I wish to indicate particularly the adverse effect that the Government's action is having on industrial development.  As reported at column 1286 of the Official Report for 1 March 1984, the Minister of State at the Department of Energy said:</P>
      <P>Minister Bruton established a prices inquiry with regard to the high cost of electricity, particularly to industrialists. That inquiry has advanced in its work and the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy is at present considering an interim report from it.  When that is completed he will bring the matter to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that is the report that was referred to a few moments ago.  It is my <Col N="1918" /> purpose to prove to the Government that another plank of their famous credibility is shaken by this action as well as by their various other actions in Government. They have created a situation, by their ineffective policies, in which demand for electricity is reduced.  They contributed to the closing last year of 700 businesses. Demand has been reduced so the production of electricity must be reduced accordingly.</P>
    <P>We know that were it not for the fact that a by-election was in the offing the Government would have closed many generating stations.  Everyone knows, too, that the lack of confidence in the Government is stifling initiative in industry, is stifling the whole fabric of our industrial promotion.  There appears to be no realisation on their part of the damage they are doing.  The effects of the cost of electricity to industry have been established for some time.  In this regard I quote from column 1287 of the Official Report of 1 March 1984 when the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, said:</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt, and there should not be any doubt, that the price of electricity is vital to Irish industry.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that the ESB must adapt to a slow emergence from a recession. We are going deeper into recession while this Government are in power and there is no indication that they are about to take us out of that recession.  Further in the debate of 1 March the Minister of State referred to the national interest as being served by a constructive attitude by the ESB in regard to their future activity and in ensuring that the price of electricity to consumers &mdash; I presume he means all consumers &mdash; particularly industrial consumers was kept within reasonable terms and if possible returned to the price levels that prevailed in those countries with whom we compete, especially those in Europe.  The Minister went on to say that the Government have the responsibility for putting the economy back into order.  He said an important part of this would be to ensure that electricity prices to customers, particularly industrialists, are brought back into line <Col N="1919" /> with those of our competitors in Europe. He made that point twice in the same speech.</P>
    <P>In case the Government may be under any impression that we on this side of the House are the only ones who are aware of the detrimental effects of the cost of electricity, I quote that renowned body, the CII, as reported in their <i>Newsletter</i> of 19 July 1983:</P>
    <P>The Confederation deplores the decision to increase electricity prices solely to meet cost increases due to Government imposed charges on the ESB.  These included additional charges in lieu of rates, higher profits from natural gas charges and the continuation of the highest taxes on fuel oil in Europe.</P>
    <P>The confederation went on to say that major damage will have been caused to the industrial base without offsetting benefit.  More recently, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 26 June 1984 in a report by Mr. Tom Shiel we read that:</P>
    <P>As the ESB seeks a 9 per cent increase in prices, pressure is increasing on the Government to lower electricity charges for industry.</P>
    <P>Further, the report continues:</P>
    <P>Trade Minister, Mr. John Bruton, gave a clear indication last Friday that the Government intended to cut prices to industry.</P>
    <P>The reference was to the Friday preceding 26 June.  According to the report ESB prices are seen as a major factor in our recent industrial stagnation.  In their <i>Newsletter</i> of 23 October last, the CII say:</P>
    <P>The Confederation is appalled that the Government have decided to impose increased electricity charges on industry although large industrial users in Ireland are already being charged over 50 per cent more than their competitors.</P>
    <P>The confederation indicate by way of a table what the differences are.  Irish prices exceeding EC averages included the produce of small industries, 23 per <Col N="1920" /> cent, medium-large, 27 to 32 per cent, and large, 52 per cent.  Those excessive prices already had resulted in losses of export orders and increased penetration of the home market by imports.  Electricity intensive industries include synthetic textiles, cement, steel, aluminium, mining, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, in which electricity bills account for more than half of the total cost.  Those industries will be most affected.</P>
    <P>The imposition of these new charges means that more orders will be lost, that the attractiveness of Ireland for new investment in high output electricity intensive industries will be diminished. Irish industries must be cost competitive to survive in international competition. Essential services such as electricity must be available at internationally competitive prices.  Higher prices for these services will result in fewer jobs in the industrial sector, on which most of the employment here depends.</P>
    <P>A report has been issued by National Utility Services &mdash; each year that body do an international survey of electricity prices &mdash; and the findings for the year ended April 1984 were not a pretty sight when it comes to the ESB.  According to the report the ESB charges to commercial and industrial users is the highest among the 12 countries surveyed.  Surely the Government are aware of all these commentaries.  Yet they go along and increase the price of electricity to an already damaged industrial sector.  They must be aware of the first report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses in regard to manufacturing industry.  The report states:</P>
    <P>Although State policy towards small industry is one of support there are contradictions including, on one hand, a variety of support services through various Agencies and, on the other, excessively high charges for State provided commercial services such as electricity, post and telecommunications. It is generally recommended that there should be a third tier of electricity charges introduced for the benefit of small industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> When will the Government act on these reports in a responsible way, as everybody would expect them to do, so that our industrial development will be saved from annihilation?</P>
    <P>The rate of inflation being 8 per cent, the last budget gave an increase of 5.25 per cent to the short term unemployed. The family income supplement does not include this.  The budget gave more than 6 per cent of an increase for long term unemployed, a miserly and totally inadequate gesture, and this recent ESB imposition will leave them more isolated and hopeless.  The domestic consumer will be hit hard and Deputies across the floor should be able to get this message across to Ministers.  Government Deputies should not be turning a blind eye to this.  Many people throughout the country are finding it most difficult to pay their ESB bills at the present rate, never mind the increase of 6.83 per cent that will be added for November-December.  The days will be shorter but let us hope the winter will be mild so that they will not have to use too much heat.  When they come to pay in January they will be under more pressure.</P>
    <P>All Deputies must be aware of the pressures their constituents are under to meet present ESB bills.  Those who do not qualify for the family income supplement, those on unemployment assistance and many other social welfare recipients who already are going hungry in order to pay their ESB bills, will be hardest hit.  It is disconcerting and dishonourable for any of those people to have their electricity cut off.</P>
    <P>The Government do not care a whit about the pressure they are putting on the people by their policies of financial rectitude, the balancing of the books, their building on reality, how are you? They are not facing up to reality and the sooner they do so before they do any more damage the better.  The people of the country may be taking measures that none of us would encourage.  If the Government cannot face up to their responsibilities they should ship out and <Col N="1922" /> let Fianna Fáil take over and restore confidence, credibility, initiative, so that the country will be taken out of the morass it is in.  I wonder whom the Government will find to blame for their failures in their present term of office.  On one occasion they blamed the Korean war; they blamed the Suez crisis between 1954 and 1957; in 1973 to 1977 they blamed the Arabs and the oil people.  Who will be their whipping boy now?</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important issue and I thank the Minister for being present in the House.  I hope I will hear good news for this important development to Greencastle harbour.  Greencastle is the major white fish port in the Republic.  The value of fish landed in 1983 amounted to £4.1 million.  There was a total catch of 8,000 tonnes of white fish.  Apart from some dredging no significant improvement has taken place during the last ten years.  Nothing has happened to the port since 1965 other than dredging.  The immediate prospect is that because of dangerously inadequate facilities in the port the Greencastle fishery will be located in Derry.  This must be borne in mind by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a rapid expansion of the fishing fleet based in Greencastle particularly in the last three years following the revitalisation of the Greencastle fisherman's co-op.  In 1983 there were 42 trawlers.  In addition 87 small fishing boats of 26 feet to 30 feet operate in and <Col N="1923" /> about the port.  The trawlers employ 210 fishermen at sea with a labour force of ten men on shore directly concerned with fish landing and dispatch.  To date fish processing has been minimal.  There are 56 males employed at this on a part time basis.</P>
    <P>There are a number of proposals for new ventures and expansions either approved or being processed by the IDA which would give full time male employment. Given the nature of fishing the prospects for employment would be that for every man employed on fishing five could be employed on shore in fish processing. This is something that should be considered in relation to the development of this port.  Unemployment is chronic in the area.  The IDA would welcome the development of the port as they would then be able to promote the area for fish processing.  This point should rate highly in the Minister's approach to the project.</P>
    <P>Due to overcrowding and lack of berthing part of the fishing fleet has to seek safe refuge from time to time in Derry from southerly gales.  Until the harbour is improved there is safe berthage for only 20 boats.  Pier facilities are inadequate for the discharge of fish cargoes.  They allow for the discharge of one boat at a time. When more than 20 boats are seeking discharge the position is chaotic.  Apart from the waste of time, labour, loss of temper and market delays, there is a safety factor.  The anchorage facilities are dangerous for the men and the boats. The position is not improved by the fact that trawlers of 65 feet and over can only come in at high tide.  The harbour cannot benefit from the discharge of fish or other cargoes from foreign boats.  This is regrettable.  The Killybegs boats and trawlers trawling mackerel off the north Donegal coast have to steam up the Foyle to Derry to discharge their fish, a distance of over 20 miles.  If the present position is allowed to continue the establishment of landing and processing facilities in Derry could become a reality and lead to the relocation of the Greencastle and Inishowen fishing industry in Derry.</P>
    <P>The Inishowen peninsula comprises <Col N="1924" /> approximately one-fifth of the land area of County Donegal.  It has one-fifth of the population and slightly more than one-fifth of total agricultural production, yet it only has one-sixth of the county's industrial jobs.  The lack of industrial employment is creating many problems in the peninsula.  Unemployment stood at 2,237 in January 1984 out of an estimated labour force of 8,500, representing 26.3 per cent.  Most of the 1,200 jobs in manufacturing are in the clothing and textile area which is more orientated to female employment rather than male.  The IDA find it difficult to attract foreign industry to Inishowen.  Factories in Carndonagh, Moville and Buncrana have been lying unoccupied for a number of years.  If the Government believe in their document <i>Building on Reality</i> the development of this port should be sanctioned.  It would relieve the chronic unemployment in the area and give an incentive to people to set up a fish processing industry.  The IDA could promote the area.  It would give a kiss of life to an area which is virtually dead as far as employment is concerned.</P>
    <P>I raised the development of this harbour on 15 February 1984 and the Minister then agreed about the importance of the development and gave the impression that work would commence in 1984. During the European elections last year the Minister and the Fine Gael candidate, Mr. Joey Murrin who is now chairman of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, were canvassing in the area.  They gave an undertaking that work would start this year.  I should like the Minister to honour that commitment and ensure that work will start before the end of this year.  If it is not undertaken soon the fishermen who are presently working under great stress, strain and danger will have to go into other areas to make it economic for them to remain as fishermen.</P>
    <P>The Greencastle area is one of the best white fish ports.  The white fish industry is totally underdeveloped.  It is ridiculous to keep talking about our natural resources not being developed.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to give the go-ahead to a development which has been <Col N="1925" /> talked about for the last 20 years.  It would give an incentive to those involved in the fishing industry to continue and expand. It would create employment and give an area which is denuded of any worthwhile employment a chance to develop.  It would give those who are suffering from unemployment a chance to have a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Conaghan in raising the matter of Greencastle harbour.  This matter was raised on 15 February last year.  We were given a definite commitment that night by the Minister.  The Minister stated, at column 2762 of the Official Report, that he would do everything possible to facilitate improvements in Greencastle.  He said he would hope to be able to commence work in 1984.  When the Department of Fisheries and Forestry were contacted on 25 October regarding Greencastle harbour they said that that work was a priority and would be included in the harbour improvements programme for next year.  This debate could be short if the Minister would commit himself to what he promised last year and followed through on his Department's statement on 25 October when they were approached by a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>Donegal is largely dependent on fish and the development of fisheries but the Government do not seem to take that very seriously.  The amount of money made available to Donegal last year was practically nil as far as harbour development was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Killybegs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If the development of Killybegs had not been commenced by a Fianna Fáil Government we would be waiting a long time for the Coalition to provide any money for it.  The Minister and the Government had no option but to continue the work and the Minister is very petty to take credit for it.  Harbour development in Donegal is essential.  We have a number of major harbours and <Col N="1926" /> Killybegs is being developed.  However, Burtonport and Greencastle also need major development.  Donegal is a county where the unemployment rate is twice the national average, and, unfortunately emigration has started again.  Jobs must be created in the area of fisheries and forestry to stem that trend.  There would be tremendous job opportunities if there was greater investment by the Government. When they are considering the Estimates for next year, the Minister should allocate the small amount of money which is required for the dredging of Burtonport harbour and its development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that some years ago Donegal County Council agreed to commit themselves to a 25 per cent grant.  That commitment is still there but, since then, there have been four or five revised estimates.  However, if the Minister makes the money available, Donegal County Council will reciprocate by giving a £1 for every £3 granted by the Department.  Greencastle harbour is unique in that it has deep water except for the fact that dredging has not taken place.  In the sixties there were only 16 boats there, now there are in excess of 40 boats but there have been no additional improvements or developments to the harbour.  It is unfortunate that all our large mackerel boats are now landing into luggers off the coast of Scotland.  If those boats had landing facilities off the northwest coast of Donegal then they could deposit their fish in Donegal, thus creating further part time and full time job opportunities there.  Because we do not have these facilities, they have to use the port of Derry and the development authority there are doing their utmost to entice industrialists who are involved in the fish business into that part of Northern Ireland.  They have their deep water ports and, if we are to compete with them, we must make the facilities available, particularly around Greencastle, where it is just as convenient for the boats coming down the Foyle to land on the west side.  If the Minister does not commit himself to harbour development, the <Col N="1927" /> number of boats landing in Greencastle will be reduced month by month.</P>
    <P>Greencastle is traditionally known as a white fish port and is noted for its excellent quality which is second to none.  The reason it is a white fish port is because the larger boats which traditionally fish herring and mackerel cannot land their catches there.  We must ensure that the fish processors in that area can diversify from white fish and process mackerel and herring also.  They cannot do this until such time as the facility is provided.</P>
    <P>The development is in the region of £4 million and if one looks at this investment against the job potential there, the necessary money should be provided as the amount is not very great.  The Greencastle fishing enterprise is valuable to the economy in many ways.  One important, attractive aspect is that it is soundly and sensibly based on a plentiful natural source based on an economic and efficient catching strategy.  A report from a certain body commended the Greencastle approach and said that the best long term, stable enterprise is the 50 to 60 foot trawler operating out of Greencastle or Killybegs.  We cannot afford to put all our eggs in one basket and stick rigidly to this size boat.  We must ensure that our fishermen are enticed to invest in the larger boat which can be grant-aided by FEOGA.</P>
    <P>When referring to harbour development in Donegal and to Greencastle in particular I should like the Minister and his Department to ensure that the larger boats would be grant-aided by FEOGA. It is unfortunate that there is so much red tape and that the 33 metre boats and under are the only boats which can be grant-aided.  This makes very little sense and I hope the Minister will pursue this matter.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the election promises of the Government.  In the past, Fine Gael Ministers have been seen as whiter than white and they do not get involved in any bargaining for votes. However, I should like to quote from the <Col N="1928" /><i>Derry Journal</i> of 26 October 1984 which said:</P>
    <P>In June this year the Minister for Forestry and Fisheries accompanied the Fine Gael Euro candidate Joey Murrin, when he was canvassing in this area and gave an undertaking that work would start later this year, we have now been told unofficially that it has been postponed again.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for the Minister, I hope he will not let himself down, that he will fulfil his promise and start the work before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to have an opportunity to speak about Greencastle harbour development.  Deputy Gallagher and Deputy Conaghan mentioned the promises I made when I visited Greencastle last June at election time.  I stand over the promises I made.  I am not too sure whether Deputy Gallagher quoted from the <i>Derry Journal</i> or the <i>Derry Democrat</i> but it is wrong.  There were at least 40 people in the room, many of whom were not of my political persuasion, I am sure that they were of the Deputy's persuasion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Conaghan said that this had been talked about for 20 years.  I shall not go into who was in power for most of that time, but I can tell the Deputy that the talking is almost ended in so far as I am concerned.  We shall stop talking and put something there on that pier that the Deputy and I, the Greencastle fishermen and the country will be proud of.</P>
      <P>The Greencastle development is badly needed.  I have visited the area and have seen the terrible congestion there. Fishermen have told me that they have to queue for five or six hours at anchor in the bay at busy times, to find berthage to pull in and unload their catches.  Fishing is tough enough without having to spend that time waiting to unload a catch. These people are trying to carry fish across five or six boats to land their catches.  I am aware of all the problems, but they have existed for a long time.  Let us be honest and not throw stones if we live in glass houses.  The matter is now being rectified and I am saying now that work on the provision of that facility will commence early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give the reason for this work not having commenced at the date I mentioned last February.  Later, in June, I said that it would not commence until 1985.  The plans were drawn up on the basis of dredging to a depth of ten feet. A meeting of local interests in the Greencastle area was held and it was felt that depth might not be sufficient for the future and that it might be necessary to dredge to 15 feet depth at low water mark.  It then transpired, during the months when this proposal was being considered, that I would be back here in the House next year and possibly the year after with Deputy Conaghan breathing down my neck and rightly so, because that plan would involve the reconstruction of a model and all the attendant technical matters involved in relation to the building of a model for dredging at that depth.  What I have now decided is to dredge to 12 feet, which will cater for more than 90 per cent of the boats now operating from that harbour.  There are some minor technical matters to be dealt <Col N="1930" /> with, but that work can go ahead.  I understand that retendering must be done and the work will then commence.</P>
    <P>The construction of a pier at Queen-scourt which is across from the main port will provide 200 feet of berthage and a water depth of up to seven feet at mean low water of spring tide. That facility will cater for the smaller boats which are cluttering up the main quay at the moment.  There will be an extension of the existing pier to provide 400 extra feet of berthage at a depth of 12 feet along the extended portion of the harbour at mean low water of spring tide. There will be a deepening of 400 linear feet of the existing berthage to nine feet from the present depth of seven feet at mean low water of spring tide.</P>
    <P>There is also being provided 8,000 square feet of additional reclaimed area to provide working space for the fishermen. Deputies will recall that there was a much more ambitious initial proposal. As far as I recall, it was for 28,000 square feet of open space to be developed.  When this was discussed by officials with the fishermen involved, their attitude was that they did not want a football pitch there, they wanted a reasonable surface that they could work on which gave them plenty of room for their purposes.  For that reason it was agreed with them that the 8,000 square feet of additional space would be sufficient to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>These improvements have been scaled down, with a commensurate reduction, I presume, in the overall cost of the scheme.  The cost at present for the current proposals is in the region of £3.1 million.  I agree with the necessity for this expenditure.  It is necessary for the further development of the fishery in that area.  As has been said by both Deputies opposite, unless we provide the facilities there, because of its proximity to Derry, Derry will become the landing place for the catches from the fishery in the Greencastle locality.  That would be at the expense of the Greencastle area.  It is a big industry.  As Deputy Conaghan said, over 200 people are employed at sea. What we need is to develop the onshore processing and to do that we must provide <Col N="1931" /> space and landing facilities for the fishermen. The Government are totally committed to the development of that harbour.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Conaghan that this is the last time that it will be necessary for him or for Deputy Harte, who is on my doorstep every day about the same issue, to approach me on this matter.  I will be informing both Deputies when the Estimates are completed.  The specification has already been prepared.  There will be no great problem in having retendering.  We have all the documentation at our fingertips and there will be no <Col N="1932" /> extra work involved.  It is a question of getting our costings right and the tenders in.  The work, hopefully, will then commence.</P>
    <P>Even if a contractor were appointed tomorrow morning, because of the fishing season and weather conditions he probably would not start until next March. Deputy Gallagher is aware of the conditions that obtain there and of the Christmas fishing season.  I hope to be in a position to give the Deputies definitive dates in the very near future.</P>

      <P>With regard to oil and gas exploration and development, it has been the policy of successive Governments to ensure that Irish suppliers benefit to the fullest extent possible from any business opportunities arising.  To this end, section 62 of our Offshore Licensing Terms provides that: The licensee shall use goods and services of Irish origin in his activities as far as they are competitive in regard to quality, service, delivery period and price.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards has been entrusted with the responsibility of promoting the implementation of this requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of a new hydrocarbon development, a considerable amount of planning has already been undertaken, using as a guideline the experience of the Kinsale Head Gasfield, which was developed between 1973 and 1978.  The IIRS has already initiated a major review of the capabilities of Irish suppliers in order to achieve maximum advantage from any future development.  In addition, <Col N="1713" /> a survey is being carried out on the various technologies involved in particular systems of hydrocarbon development. The IIRS has also provided for a number of specialised action programmes designed to assist Irish suppliers on specific problems which they are likely to encounter in a development situation, such as tendering for contracts and meeting the quality assurance requirements for offshore fabrication.</P>

      <P>I am aware of reports that a number of Iraqi prisoners of war were killed or injured in an incident at a prisoner of war camp in Iran on 10 October. These reports are a cause for considerable concern.  The news that a mission is to be sent to the area by the UN Secretary General to inquire into the incident is therefore to be welcomed.  When the exact circumstances of the incident have been clarified by the mission, consideration could be given to appropriate follow up action.  The Government, and partners in the Ten, have consistently spoken out on the need in the context of the Iran-Iraq war for compliance with the principles and provisions of humanitarian international law in armed conflicts.</P>

      <P>Both I and the Minister of State <Col N="1714" /> at my Department are in continuous contact with the voluntary and other organisations providing emergency relief to Ethiopia.  My Department was closely involved with the arrangements for the airlift of seven tons of emergency supplies which arrived in Ethiopia on 1 November and also covered the cost of a further airlift of 22 tons organised by GOAL which left Dublin a week later. We have also been in touch with Guinness Peat Aviation concerning another relief flight.  In addition my Department has also had discussions with various organisations who will be involved in shipping up to 1,500 tons of food, building materials and emergency supplies to Ethiopia towards the end of this month. The shipment will be co-ordinated by CONCERN in co-operation with a number of other agencies and will be paid for from the funds allocated for emergency assistance to Ethiopia by the Government on 25 October.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to provide whatever assistance is required to the voluntary organisations who have responded so magnificently to this crisis.</P>
      <P>It is not considered either necessary or appropriate to designate a special day as the Deputy suggests.  He will be aware of the initiatives taken by the various Churches and voluntary organisations in this regard and of the tremendous public response they are receiving.  The crisis in Ethiopia has now become a matter of national concern and the Irish people are responding generously and selflessly to this cause.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware of the actions which have already been taken by the Irish Presidency to secure an increased contribution by the European Community to the famine in Ethiopia <Col N="1715" /> and other parts of Africa.  These efforts resulted in the recent decisions to allocate a further 32 MECU (about IR£23 million) for Africa to the emergency relief line of the Community budget.  The Community has also decided to provide an additional 100,000 tonnes of cereals in emergency food aid to Africa.</P>
      <P>The Government are currently considering what further action could be taken by the Community to respond to the famine situation in Ethiopia.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister of State at my Department, Mr. O'Keeffe is to visit Ethiopia shortly to examine the situation there, including the Community's relief efforts, at first hand.  The Deputy can be assured that the Government will make every effort to ensure that the Community contributes as generously and as effectively as possible to this tragic situation.</P>

      <P>Posts falling vacant in the Civil Service are exempted from the one-in-three embargo in the following circumstances:</P>
      <P>(i)  In cases where the application of the embargo would result in the total number of vacancies in a particular grade exceeding one third of the numbers serving in that grade on 21 July 1981.  In such cases, the rule is that the vacancy in question may be filled but another vacancy must be held open in compensation;</P>
      <P>(ii)  In cases where officers take career-breaks for periods of from one to three years, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  In cases where officers take certain types of special leave (e.g. to resume study or to work in an international organisation of which Ireland is a member).</P>
      <P>Exemptions from the embargo allowed under these three headings in 1984 are detailed in the attached table.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry in view of the widespread concern at the bold illegal activities of Spanish fishermen in Irish waters and the potentially grave implications of Spanish accession to the Community for the Irish fishing industry, if as the Irish Minister for Fisheries he will be demanding solid guarantees from the Madrid Government that upon entry they will undertake to control the maverick elements in the Spanish fleet and prevent poaching in Irish waters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>It is already accepted by Spain that accession to the European Communities involves full acceptance of the principles of the Common Fisheries Policy.  Spain is therefore aware that following accession the fishing fleet will be subject to the controls at present in force for all member states.  These include control not only at national level but also at central level by the EC Commission. The latter entails regular submission of catch details and inspection on the ground by EC inspectors.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the importance, from various points of view, of the continued operation of provincial newspapers and I appreciate the difficulties facing them and newspapers, <Col N="1753" /> generally.  The special position of the newspaper industry has, however, been recognised in the national plan which indicates the Government's intention to bring the VAT rate on all newspaper sales here more into line with the rates of VAT applying elsewhere in the EC to the extent that this is possible. The proposed first phase of the reduction, to which I assume the Deputy is referring, will bring the rate on newspapers back to the 18 per cent level introduced in May 1982.  It would not be feasible to introduce different VAT rates for daily, weekly and Sunday newspapers on the basis of their relative contributions to democracy or employment etc.</P>

    <P>* Statistics in relation to health board long stay geriatric homes and health board welfare homes are not readily available in a format to enable the calculation of average weekly cost per occupied bed.  The costs shown for these centres relate to average weekly cost per patient.  Due to the extremely high occupancy levels in these centres average weekly cost per patient would match very closely the average weekly cost per occupied bed.  The figures cover both in-patient and out-patient costs where such costs arise.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the European Communities programme under which grants towards the costs of training people for employment are available from the European Social Fund.</P>
      <P>Grants are available from the European Social Fund towards the cost of providing vocational rehabilitation training for disabled people who have been assessed as capable with suitable training, of working in open employment.  The costs against which grant may be claimed would include such things as depreciation in respect of buildings and equipment, training of trainers and the other costs of providing training for eligible handicapped persons &mdash; for example, wages and allowances paid etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The training of disabled people in a wide range of work skills is provided by a combination of State and voluntary agencies in a considerable variety of <Col N="1765" /> training centres and workshops throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The reason for the fall off in numbers between 1983 and 1984 is that the statistical base on which the claim made for certain workshops in the psychiatric area was changed in 1984.  The figures in 1984 reflect the number of places available in the workshops rather than the throughput of trainees, as was the case in 1983.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, under existing legislation (section 99 of the Children Act, 1908), a court may order a parent to pay a fine, damages or costs in respect of an offence committed by his child unless the court is satisfied that the parent did not conduce to the commission of the offence by neglecting to exercise due care of the child.  A child for this purpose means a person who has attained the age of criminal responsibility, which is seven years at present.</P>

      <P>An overpayment of £447.75 has occurred on this claim due to the failure of the person concerned to notify the Department of a change affecting her entitlement.  She is entitled to payment of £48.20 in respect of four qualified children and recovery of the overpayment is being effected by withholding payment due in respect of one qualified child (i.e. £12.05 a month).  She has an allowance book in respect of the balance of £36.15 due to her each month.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for recovery of an overpayment of children's allowances by deduction from current entitlement are generally determined by the fact that payments under the scheme are made by books of payable orders which are preprinted at set amounts related to family size.  The minimum rate of recovery under these arrangements is by deduction of the allowance in respect of one child and despite the size of the overpayment in this case, this minimum rate of recovery has been adopted to minimise any hardship which might arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 <Col N="1789" /> contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance under the Acts, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The person concerned does not satisfy this condition as the Department's records show that he had a total of 386 reckonable contributions in this period, equal to a yearly average of only 12.  Neither will he qualify for old age contributory pension at age 66; a yearly average of at least 20 is required for the latter pension.</P>
      <P>The employment of the person concerned was insurable at the reduced rate applicable to permanent and pensionable public servants from 1960.  These contributions are not reckonable for retirement or old age contributory pension purposes.

      <P>The person concerned was assessed with means of £31.35 weekly derived from the profit from his holding and from the value of capital.  An appeals officer also assessed him with means of £31.35 weekly.  His claim to unemployment assistance was accordingly disallowed as his means exceeded the rate payable.  However, from 4 July 1984 when rates of unemployment assistance were increased he became entitled to £0.40 weekly the appropriate rate £31.75 less means £31.35.  Due to a clerical error he has not been paid this £0.40 weekly but all arrears due to him will be paid this week.</P>
      <P>His claim was re-investigated recently by a social welfare officer after which his means derived from the profit from his holding and from the value of capital were reassessed at £52.48 weekly effective from 14 November 1984.  His means accordingly exceed the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable to him from that date and his unemployment assistance claim will be disallowed. Arrangements are being made to notify him accordingly and to advise him of his right to appeal against the re-assessment of his means.</P>

      <P>The Agricultural Institute in their most recent farm management survey point out that the results for 1983 once again reflect the unintensive nature of the dry stock system of farming in Ireland.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture in view of the increasing demand for lean meat in our British and continental markets, and in the light of the fact that at present we are taking the lowest prices for lamb on the French market because so much of our lamb is over-fat, the measures being considered to change our production here to encourage more quality carcases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The French consumer demands prime quality lean lamb and is prepared to pay premium prices for this.  It is, therefore, in the interests of Irish producers to meet this demand since this is our main export outlet.  Lamb exports from Ireland to France up to mid-October 1984 were almost 30 per cent higher than in the same period last year.  The most welcome feature in this trend is that there is an increasing emphasis on early lamb production. This demonstrates that producers here are, in the main, aware of and are, in fact, meeting French requirements and that the breeds of sheep available here are suitable for the production of the type of lamb required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the mid to late season there is a tendancy for producers to hold on to lamb for too long with the result that the lamb coming on the market may be too heavy and fat.  If this unfavourable practice is to be avoided it will be necessary for the trade to realise that the best interests of this valuable export industry can be served only by marketing lambs at the right time in order to avoid incurring penalties by means of lower prices.  The main inducement for producers will continue to be the price obtained on the <Col N="1812" /> market and the responsibility for ensuring proper marketing arrangements must rest primarily with exporters.  My Department have always supported improvements in both production and marketing standards,</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The list referred to in the question is a list comprising one named Superintendent and a number of named Inspectors of the Garda Síochána and accordingly &ldquo;promotion&rdquo; must refer to promotion to &mdash; in one case &mdash; the rank of chief superintendent and &mdash; in the other case &mdash; the rank of superintendent. Appointments to the ranks of chief superintendent and superintendent are made by the Government but the Government do not assign those officers to specific posts.</P>
      <P>I would not consider it appropriate, at any rate in the absence of some stated and substantial reason, to say whether the names of particular members of the force identified by the Deputy were or were not submitted to the former Government with a recommendation that they be appointed to the rank of chief superintendent or superintendent. There is no question of any person appointed to either of those ranks by the former Government still awaiting assignment in his new rank.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to appointments to the rank of superintendent and chief superintendent since 14 December 1982, the date on which this Government took office, is as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first appointments to those ranks were made by the Government on 8 March 1983, on the basis of recommendations made by the commissioner following examination by a board consisting of the commissioner, deputy commissioner and all six assistant commissioners of each applicant's record and &ldquo;history&rdquo; in <Col N="1817" /> the force and of assessments and recommendations made by local divisional officers in relation to each candidate.</P>
    <P>That method of selection was &mdash; and was intended to be &mdash; an interim one to be effective only until a new system would come into operation.  The new system came into operation later that year, before any further appointments needed to be made.  All subsequent appointments to those ranks have been made under that system which involves the holding of competitive interviews in accordance with new procedures governing promotions in the force agreed at the Garda Conciliation Council in October 1983. It is part of those procedures that all members of the force who compete in the promotion competition are officially notified of the result (the notification includes, in the case of those who are placed sufficiently highly to warrant this, the candidate's place in the &ldquo;order of merit&rdquo;).  The names of the successful candidates are placed on a panel which remains valid for a certain fixed period and promotions are made from the panel, in the order in which they were placed, according as vacancies arise during the period for which the panel operates.  One of the members named in the Deputy's list was succesful in a competition held earlier this year, was notified accordingly and has recently been promoted in line with his place on the panel.</P>

The question of the level of capitation grant for 1984-85 will be considered in the context of the Estimates for Public Services, 1985.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions 819 and 820 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures of social fund expenditure do not give an adequate basis for comparing participation in training and employment schemes in any year or changes in such <Col N="1825" /> participation from year to year.  This arises for a number of reasons.  Social fund figures are only part of the total expenditure on training and employment programmes.  The rate of assistance from the social fund varies between training programmes and employment programmes. In brief, training schemes attract social fund aid at 55 per cent of total eligible expenditure while schemes of temporary employment and work experience attract ESF support at a much lower flat rate.  In 1983, this flat rate was a little over £11 per week per young person.  For example, social fund aid for AnCO's community youth training programme in 1983 was around £46 per week per participant while a person on a temporary employment scheme attracted social fund support of a little over £11. Furthermore, the numbers trained do not give a reliable indication of total training activity because of the differences in course and programme duration and content.</P>
    <P>In my view the range of training and temporary employment programmes available meet the needs and aspirations of our young people in a cost effective way.  There is furthermore significant flexibility in the administration of training and temporary employment schemes for young people.  Measures undertaken by my Department, the Youth Employment Agency, AnCO, CERT and the National Manpower Service are designed to ensure that youth schemes respond promptly and flexibly to youth needs.</P>
    <P>There is a wide range of employment schemes available including the grant schemes for youth employment, the work experience programme, the enterprise allowance scheme, the employment incentive scheme, the community enterprise programme, youth self employment programme, marketplace and the youth scientist and technologist programme.  I would draw attention to the wide geographical dispersion of these programmes throughout the country.  With regard to training, AnCO and CERT operate a variety of courses again with a wide geographical spread.</P>
    <P>As regards unemployed young persons <Col N="1826" /> wishing to set up in business, they can receive a weekly income for up to a year under my Department's enterprise allowance scheme and can additionally qualify for assistance in securing a bank loan of up to £3,000 under the Youth Employment Agency's youth self employment programme.</P>
