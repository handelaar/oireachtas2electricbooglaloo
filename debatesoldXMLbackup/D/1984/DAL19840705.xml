      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have not given approval to the take-over.

The question of relationships between financial institutions is a matter on which there can be various opinions.  There is a school of thought that there could be considerable advantages in greater inter-penetration in circumstances in which the public interest was adequately protected.

      <P>That the Bankruptcy Bill, 1982, be referred to the Joint Committee on Legislation pursuant to paragraph (1) (e) of that Committee's Orders of Reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is in the name of Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa.  Amendment Nos. 2 and 7 are related.  Is it agreed that the House should discuss amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 7 together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 11, to delete &ldquo;Act&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;Act, but no section of this Act shall come into operation, prior to the making of regulations by the Minister for Justice, as specified in section 27&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations under section 27 refer to the electronic recording of interviews in Garda stations of persons detained under section 4.  On Committee Stage I argued that electronic recordings should be introduced immediately but the Minister pointed out that it was not possible to do this for practical reasons.  Subsequently I suggested that in that case the recording should be taken by a stenographer or by some person using longhand or in whatever way it could be done manually but <Col N="1628" /> the Minister indicated there were some practical problems, probably mostly of a financial nature, that would make that impracticable also.  In view of the fact that section 4 relates to the detention of persons and that it is a fairly serious erosion of and limitation on the rights of an individual and because there is a necessity to assure the general public that there can be no possible abuse of the powers contained in this Bill, I would argue that it should not come into effect until electronic recording facilities are available in Garda stations to which people would be brought for questioning.</P>
    <P>I have strong reservations about many sections of the Bill and I have gone into them in detail on Committee Stage.  In particular, I am not convinced regarding section 4 and some other sections that we will deal with in the course of this debate. Just as the sections will not come into effect until a complaints procedure is introduced, neither should they be brought into effect until an electronic recording system is available.  I notice from reports in the British papers that a case was heard recently in that country where electronic recording was used as evidence and it was considered to be a successful use of the system.  I understand it is intended to extend the use of this system in Britain.  I am fairly certain there is considerable advancement in the area of electronic recordings during interrogations and, therefore, acceptance of this amendment should not delay unduly the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1, which is one of the three amendments we are considering now, refers to the making of regulations as specified in section 27.  We must give the Minister due credit for bringing in a positive amendment which we shall deal with later.  This will mean that the regulations can be brought before the House to be discussed and agreed.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken that step which he promised on Committee Stage.  In any event, the question still remains.  We are going to pass the Report Stage of the Bill today but, in doing so, we will not have seen the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> The Minister has also said that certain parts of the Bill will not come into operation until the regulations are approved, but the regulations should have been before us earlier.  We have been discussing this Bill for a long time and they have had ample opportunity to introduce them.  Various proposals and suggestions in relation to safeguards which would be desirable were put forward by me as spokesman for the Opposition and by other Members of the House in their contributions.  It was very interesting to see on the television programme &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; on BBC television that the safeguards which we were talking about here were those which are relevant to the situation in Britain.  I was also very interested to note that they spoke of the removal of the watch from detained persons. I had made the point that its removal could result in the person being disorientated and not knowing where they are or what time of the day or night it is.  They mentioned on the programme that the only item which was returned was a handkerchief, but one could inflict injury by swallowing a handkerchief as well as a watch.  It was very interesting to get an insight into the operation of similar legislation although, as the Minister said, detention periods are much longer in Britain.  It emphasised the validity of the arguments we were making here in relation to the importance of safeguards.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised safeguards in the regulations to be introduced.  When these safeguards apply juries will be more influenced by the reliability of evidence, so it is not just a question of ensuring that people are protected but also that proper procedures are complied with which will result in convictions where convictions should be obtained.  Juries will feel confident in relying on the evidence put before them as a result of the safeguards. Cases have occurred where a note was not made and signed in relation to what somebody said when charged.  The omission of a work can be crucial.  Perhaps somebody said &ldquo;I was not the only one there&rdquo; and later on he might say &ldquo;I was not the one there&rdquo;.  This arises in relation to information which must be given and inferences which can be drawn from such <Col N="1630" /> information.  If there are not proper safeguards and accurate notes taken they will be in contest later in the courts and there will be lengthy legal arguments as to what was said.</P>
    <P>The same applies to many instances raised on Committee Stage, which was very comprehensive.  When informing the person at the time of his arrest of the offence or offences for which he is being arrested and the time of his arrest it is very important to provide a minimal note.  Deputy De Rossa mentioned the possibility of introducing recording by electronic or other means.  The programme to which I have already referred, mentioned the recording system and that there did not seem to be any difficulty with it.  I am sure the Minister will look at its use in Britain before he completes his regulations in that respect and that the committee which he set up to look at electronic or other means of recording will do likewise.  We see the safeguards as an integral part of the Bill. We accept that they will come before the House but they should have been available when the Bill was going through the House.  Their omission is very bad organisation on the part of the Minister and the Department, because there is no real reason for not having them before the House.  I accept the Minister's undertaking and recognise that he has given the amendment which he promised on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 7 are related. Amendment No. 2 says:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the generality of subsection (1) of this Section, no order shall be made by the Minister bringing into operation Sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 or 19, on a day earlier than a day on which a Garda Síochána Complaints Commission is established by statute.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 is in the area of the Bill which deals with interpretation of the words &ldquo;Garda Síochána Complaints Commission&rdquo;.  It says:</P>
    <P>`Garda Síochána Complaints Commission' means an independent body, irrespective of name or title, established <Col N="1631" /> by statute for the purpose of investigating complaints against members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>A complaints commission was promised in conjunction with the Bill in the memorandum published in October 1983.  The memorandum initially promised a complaints procedure and said that those provisions of the Bill giving increased powers to the Garda Síochána and which will come into operation only when a ministerial order to that effect is made will not be brought into force until a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal has been established.  We still have no complaints procedure although it cannot be that difficult to establish it.  It was promised when the memorandum was circulated with the Bill last October and it was promised again on Second Stage and on Committee Stage.  In reply to a question I asked on 8 March 1984 and a related question from Deputy Mac Giolla, the Minister said that the new procedure would not be brought into operation until both Houses of the Oireachtas had an opportunity to discuss it.  He went on to say that he expected to be in a position to inform the House of the proposals in the near future and that the indications were that the scheme would be a statutory one.</P>
    <P>We were reasonably happy that the Minister was proceeding with the complaints procedure and that it would be before the House in the near future. There were various exchanges across the House as to whether this procedure would be before the House while the Committee Stage was still on, at the end of the Committee Stage or whenever.  We are now on the Report Stage but we still have not seen the complaints procedure. We accept what the Minister said and what is in the explanatory memorandum, that this procedure will prevent the implementation of certain sections of the Bill.  I would like to hear what exactly the Minister has in mind as regards the complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>We went to considerable trouble to put together a draft Garda Síochána complaints <Col N="1632" /> commission giving the procedures, definitions, establishment date, establishment and functions, how the commission would operate, who would make decisions, the different levels of decisions and how they would be handled, appointments, reports, requirements for reports and so on.  The full processing of complaints was set out in a draft complaints procedure which was submitted some months ago when we put down the first amendments for Committee Stage.  This involved seven or eight pages of amendments.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot say we have not tried to be helpful.  We have given him draft views for discussion and consideration but in our view by this stage the complaints procedure should be before the House.  We read in the newspapers that the Minister had circulated details of a proposed draft Garda complaints body &mdash; some aspects of that body were similar to those proposed in our submission &mdash; but so far we have not seen anything although the people in the media were supplied with this information.  When I asked the Minister if this leak had been from his Department, or why this information had been leaked to the press but not brought before the House, he said the information did not come from him. I accept that but the document originated in the Department and therefore the information must have come from somebody who received the document from the Minister.  It is unfair that this document has been circulated outside this House but we have not yet seen what the Minister intends in this area.</P>
    <P>Naturally one becomes suspicious when one considers that there has been so much time to bring forward a complaints procedure but it is still not before us today when we are dealing with the Report Stage.  The reason may be that the Members would not be entirely satisfied with the kind of complaints procedure which will be put before the House, but we do not know that.  We will have to wait and see.  It is very hard to fathom why it is not possible to bring a complaints procedure before the House or to circulate the draft procedure which has been circulated outside the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> We have put down this amendment so that the Minister's intentions will be formally written into the Bill.  If this is in the Bill, it will be absolutely no matter who is the Minister of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>We believe the taping of the interview to be of considerable assistance both to the Garda and the accused.  Even without the new periods of detention in the Bill, there are frequent complaints &mdash; I do not know if they are justified or unjustified &mdash; about young people being brought into Garda stations, what was done, what was said and how they were treated.  Usually after a week these complaints are not pursued because of the difficulties involved, but in cases that come to court there are frequent disputes in court over what was said, what was meant by what was said and so on.  On the question of evidence, it would be of assistance if the new system were in operation.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the protection of the Garda, if there is a new, longer detention period during which the suspected person may be interviewed, there will be an increase in the number of complaints and in suggestions that the Garda are doing more than asking questions.  It is possible from what the Minister said on Committee Stage that a long period would elapse before the system would be introduced in many Garda stations unless there is pressure on the Department.  I gather from the Minister's statement on Committee Stage that it could be between one and five years before this would be introduced.  Of course if the Bill does not put pressure on the Minister to have it introduced it could be delayed for four or five years.  If pressure is put on the Department, the Minister and the Government, and if financial provision is made for its implementation it could be brought in within six months, or at the outside 12 months.  For those reasons it is necessary to provide the pressure in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people are brought in for questioning, problems will arise in relation to certain stations here and there throughout the country, and even from the point of view of the Garda it would be desirable <Col N="1634" /> that the protection which the amendment would provide would be there from the beginning.  Without electronic equipment there would be great difficulty proving that allegations were without foundation. We believe this section to be of great importance for the entire operation of the Act and for its acceptance by the community.  This procedure should have been prepared before the Bill was introduced. It would lead to more community involvement and more co-operation between the community and the Garda. As it stands, the Bill will tend rather to widen the gap.  Therefore we ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment. It is essential that we should see the shape and form of the regulations before passing the Bill.  On several occasions the Minister voiced the opinion that there is a serious crime problem and that the Bill must respond to that.  Though I disagree with the Minister about the response this Bill will provide, he is entitled to his opinion.</P>
      <P>Continuously in the House the Minister has agreed that the Bill represents a diminution of civil liberties, and therefore the need for necessary safeguards for civil liberties must be recognised.  The provision of these regulations before the passing of the Bill would ensure that the Act will be properly balanced.  Earlier I used the analogy of the Minister for Finance coming in here and saying that the net take from wages through PAYE had increased due to inflation and that the allowances would be increased correspondingly, but not telling the House what the increased allowances would be.  The equation should be balanced from the point of view of both sides, and therefore on this occasion the Minister should show us the other side before we pass this legislation.</P>
      <P>Surely it is not beyond the powers and the wit of the civil service to come up with these regulations which in this case will represent the other side of the equation. Without seeing the regulations we are being asked to pass the Bill into law, and that is unequal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): There is a misunderstanding about the nature of amendment No. 1.  The misunderstanding has been illustrated by Deputy O'Dea.  This amendment relates to the regulations to be made under section 27 for the electronic recording of interviews, but it does not refer to the general regulations to which I have committed myself in regard to the treatment of people in custody. Therefore, it is not relevant to discuss the regulations in general on this amendment, which confines itself to the enabling power of the Minister to bring in regulations to have interviews recorded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is an opportunity, legitimate or otherwise. This amendment would have the effect that none of the provisions of the Bill could come into operation until regulations providing for a system of electronic recording of questioning had been introduced pursuant to the powers conferred on the Minister by section 27.  This would mean that the entire Bill would be suspended until a system of electronic recording had been introduced on a national basis.  We could not even have the sections introducing simplified procedures for proving matters in court which are designed to speed up court hearings and reduce costs and which have been widely welcomed.  We could not have any of the many other provisions that have absolutely no bearing on electronic recording of questioning.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment. It is far too widely drawn, but even if Deputies MacGiolla and De Rossa were prepared to narrow the scope of it by confining it to, for example, the detention provisions, I would still not be prepared to accept it for reasons that I made very clear on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the provisions of this Bill are urgently needed to deal with the serious crime problem we have.  Indeed many people regard the Bill as long overdue &mdash; it was promised by a number of successive Governments of recent years. <Col N="1636" /> Electronic recording &mdash; I will refer to it as tape recording but it covers both audio and video &mdash; cannot be introduced overnight for reasons that I explained in great detail to the House on Committee Stage. We were discussing it at 2 o'clock on the morning of 22 June, so I remember it well.  Therefore, Deputies may not have heard my views clearly.  I do not intend to repeat now all that I said then &mdash; Deputies can read the debate in Volume 352, No. 2 of the Official Report, starting at column 245 &mdash; but in resumé my reasons for not agreeing to this amendment are that we need the Bill now but can only have tape recording after we have carried out proper trials to evaluate it and to ascertain how best it should be introduced.</P>
    <P>As I said &mdash; I communicated this to the Dáil &mdash; I have a committee working on this and they are proceeding with all possible speed, but until section 4 comes into operation, the field trials cannot be carried out because, apart from section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, there is no legal power to detain suspects in Garda stations under existing law.  The intention is that the field trials will start when section 4 becomes operative. Therefore, even if I were otherwise disposed to this amendment, I could not accept it for that reason alone because I would be cutting the ground completely from under any field trials I could organise.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendments tabled by Deputy Woods I should like to state that this question was discussed very fully on Committee Stage.  The effect of Deputy Woods' amendment would be to ensure that pending the establishment of a Garda Síochána Complaints Commission the specified sections of the Bill should not be brought into operation. Essentially, we are talking about the detention provisions and those dealing with the withholding of information and inferences from silence.  There were lengthy contributions by Deputies on all sides on the complaints procedure on Second Stage and again on Committee Stage on Deputy Woods' amendment.  I refer Deputies to No. 27A in Volume 351, columns 428-443 of the Official <Col N="1637" /> Report.  That amendment proposed that the then sections 3 to 8 detention should not come into operation until a complaints commission was set up.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I opposed the amendment on the basis that I had given a commitment already and there was not any need to write it into the Bill.  In withdrawing the amendment Dr. Woods said:</P>
    <P>We must rely on the Minister to carry out his promise.  On that basis I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <P>What he has done now is to reintroduce it and to add new sections to it.  The reason for refusing to accept it now is that the Government have given a commitment to have an independent procedure and made an announcement on publication of the Bill that the new Garda powers would not come into force until the complaints procedure was in operation. I repeated that commitment in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>At various stages during the debate on the Bill I stated that the previous administration were not committed to such a procedure and did not have work done on it.  It therefore was a question of starting the serious work on it and putting it through with all possible speed.  There is no doubt that I do not expect to go through my time in the House, or through politics or through this ministry without a lot of criticism.  A legitimate form of criticism is a Minister dragging his feet or delaying certain things, but that is not legitimate when it is applied to civil servants, and I would like Deputies to appreciate what the civil servants in my Department are trying to do in this regard.  For example, the amendments from Dr. Woods were communicated to my Department at 5 o'clock yesterday evening with the result that those involved with the Bill had to work until 4 o'clock this morning evaluating them.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A very small group of people deal with this area. <Col N="1638" /> Those dealing with the Bill are also involved in the complaints procedure and the regulations.  As the House in its wisdom decided to have a very extensive Committee Stage debate the civil servants involved were present to listen to the debate, noting the points made and responding with amendments.  I am not criticising the House.  We had a very constructive Committee Stage debate, but Deputies must remember that if time is given in one direction it is taken off somewhere else.  Notwithstanding that the Bill dealing with complaints is proceeding. The informal second draft of the Bill runs to 92 pages.  It went through Government and the Government have decided that the Attorney General's office would give it priority for drafting. A resume of the main provisions was communicated to the Garda associations, who sought time to discuss the complaints procedure and respond to it.  Nominated members of the four associations met jointly and decided to produce an agreed unanimous response to my proposals.  We received that last night.  The joint response is fairly extensive.  Officials from my Department are meeting Garda representatives tomorrow to discuss what are, in effect, their objections to certain parts of our proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be proper for me as Minister to give the House an initial discussion document.  The proper procedure is to get what agreement I can and then make a decision and return to the House with a Bill.  The House will be able to debate the Bill through all Stages, as had been the case with the Bill under discussion.  Initially, there was a question of whether the complaints procedure would be an administrative scheme or a statutory one, but having heard the views of Deputies on Second Stage and having given it further consideration we decided it should be a statutory scheme.  Of course going down the statutory road lengthens the procedure.  It would have been easier to bring in an administrative scheme.  It is easier for a Minister to draw up guidelines, announce them publicly and communicate them by way of advertisement to the public.  Now we are going down a road that involves the detailed <Col N="1639" /> drafting of a Bill.  Any former Minister &mdash; there are a number of them present &mdash; who has been involved in the preparation of legislation recognises that it is a slow process.  As well as the process being slow it must be remembered that there is an obligation on me to evaluate the proposed procedure in detail, to obtain the views of the Garda associations and consult with them on it before I introduce the Bill.  Those associations will not have a veto over my proposals. However, it is certainly desirable that we get the maximum agreement to our proposals.</P>
    <P>On the question of electronic recording, the committee I referred to on 22 June visited London and Aberdeen where they saw field trials in operation. They are familiar with what is happening in Britain.  I am sure it will be of benefit that pilot schemes are in operation there. We can draw from their experiences.</P>
    <P>On the question of the general regulations &mdash; they are not referred to in the amendment but because they were raised I should like to make a general reference to them &mdash; I should like to tell the House that they will be extremely detailed.  A first draft has been prepared and, again, consultations are proceeding. The draftsman must be asked to draft them again.  It is as difficult to draft regulations as it is to draft a Bill because the regulations are also statutory.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, we are not talking about having two classes of law.  The statutory effect of the regulations will be on a par with the statutory effect of the provisions in the Bill.  The draft regulations must, consequently be prepared very carefully.</P>
    <P>I have given commitments to the House &mdash; I thought the House accepted them on Committee Stage and I ask the House to accept them again &mdash; on the complaints procedure.  The detention and related sections of the Bill will not be introduced until both Houses show themselves satisfied by passing the Bill with the complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>On the question of regulations I have told the House that I will not implement the detention section until there are <Col N="1640" /> statutory regulations on the treatment of persons in custody.  I intend to keep that commitment.</P>
    <P>On the question of regulations under section 27, which is the target of the amendment tabled by Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa, I explained on Committee Stage that I cannot suspend the whole Bill until electronic recording is implemented nationally because the necessary preliminary work has not been done.  The committee was set up before the Bill was published.  That committee has already taken into account the experiences in England and Scotland. There will also be a lot to be learned from what happens in certain states in America and Canada because video recording is used there.  Pilot schemes will have to be set up, but I must repeat that to set up pilot schemes on electronic recording section 3 will have to be in operation. Otherwise the pilot schemes would have to be run on the basis of section 30 detentions under the Offences Against the State Act.  I am not prepared to use section 30 detentions as a basis for pilot schemes, for a number of reasons, one of them being the time involved &mdash; 24 hours initially with the possibility of extending that for a further 24 hours.  I ask the House to accept what I said on Committee Stage, and that the limited number of officials in my Department are working very hard to try to fulfil the commitments made in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned the hard work he and his civil servants are doing in relation to the Bill.  Naturally those of us who have any concern about civil servants are sympathetic about their working until 4 o'clock in the morning on amendments given to them by the Opposition.  The Minister is quite right to point out that this happened and we are saying that it should not have happened.  Our argument about the taking of the Report Stage has been crystallised by the Minister. He says that the amendments were drafted in haste and given to the civil servants.  I have no doubt that they were very deliberately considered by the Minister's estimable civil servants.  We had <Col N="1641" /> asked that the taking of the Report Stage be deferred a little longer.</P>
      <P>The Opposition spokesman on Justice called a meeting of those of us concerned about this Bill at 3 o'clock on Monday last to consider the Minister's amendments. I received a copy of those amendments before the weekend, and for that I was grateful.  The Minister has to look at the constraints placed on the Opposition by virtue of the time limit.  I pay tribute to Deputy Woods for calling this meeting last Monday.  Our discussions continued hour after hour in a rather second-class room in this House.  We had absolutely no back-up service, and this is a criticism of the facilities available to Opposition parties when considering technical Bills of this nature.  We met in a room in the first floor of the new extension which was in second-class condition. We went through the Bill deliberately and thoroughly and drafted rough sketches of desirable amendments.  We are not criminal lawyers, and we had to give them to people who were helping us. Then the Opposition spokesman had to consider them again and he was discussing and considering the Bill until the early hours of this morning.  Of course we are sorry for the civil servants who have to stay up until 4 a.m.  The Minister has the civil service at his back but the Opposition have very little guidance or assistance, and this is a matter which should be considered by this Government or some other Government.  We have made a very good contribution on this Bill, in spite of the defects of the back-up service available to us.  When technical Bills come before us in the future there should be more advisers available to the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already indicated that the question of electronic devices and their usage must be given deep consideration and that a committee is looking into the whole question.  There is much merit in the Workers' Party amendment, but the Bill cannot be held up because of section 27 and this side of the House cannot support that amendment, however well-intentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an unfortunate row on Committee Stage regarding the Garda complaints <Col N="1642" /> procedure.  The constitution of the Garda Síochána Complaints Commission should be available for discussion during this debate.  My opinion is that we will have to support amendment No. 2 through the division lobby.  I would hope that our spokesman would contest the right to discuss the complaints commission now rather than later.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to take much of this Bill on trust.  I have already suggested that it will cause more problems for the Garda and will be difficult to operate. We have a Garda force second to none who are supported by the community. The gardaí in their wisdom return that trust and they have served this nation well over the years.  In this instance the civil liberties of the individual are on the one side and the credibility of the Garda is on the other.  I want to see the credibility of the Garda upheld, and for that reason I believe amendments Nos. 2 and 7 are worthy of consideration.  When it comes to a contest I hope we will call for a division.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that Deputy O'Dea misunderstood amendment No. 1.  I do not think he did so.  He may have been a little ambiguous but his point was well made.  In the light of history Deputy O'Dea's contribution will be seen as excellent.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a dangerous one.  The powers of the Garda are at present limited in many ways, but the Bill will do more harm than good and will undermine the confidence of the community in our excellent Garda force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not contribute earlier on these amendments because I accepted the Minister's word that he would bring in a Bill before these sections became law.  My worry is the move away from making the Complaints Commission independent.  There is concern that when the provisions of the Bill are enforced, with the input of the Garda to this Complaints Commission, it will lose a lot of its independence, and its independence is most important.  They were able to achieve this in Britain under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, under clause 74 of that Act.  I might remind the Minister <Col N="1643" /> that Schedule III, clause 4 of that Act says that the members of the authority shall not include any person who is or has been a constable in any part of the United Kingdom.  There is genuine concern being felt here that we do not have the Garda investigating themselves.  That is not meant to be a criticism of the Garda.  But the present complaints procedure is unsatisfactory.  A lot of the public are dissatisfied with the present system of making complaints to the Garda and with the reception they receive whether it be when they go into a garda station, to a higher authority, or indeed what happens to the complaint after it has been processed and they do not get any response.  They feel they are not treated in the most friendly manner when they do make such complaints.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the hard work done by civil servants in regard to this Bill; indeed we have all worked on it, but one cannot take any kudos for that.  We must remember the number of times that innocent persons may be detained for up to 20 hours at a time, which would be the effect of a certain section of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the Garda will not have the right to a veto on the type of Bill to be introduced in relation to the Complaints Commission, because I should not like to see them having the same influence they have had in the compostion of this Bill.  If the proposed Complaints Commission is not independent it will be ineffective.  We could live temporarily with this Bill if we had a totally independent Complaints Commission. Although I accept the Minister's reasons it is unfortunate that that other Bill and the proposed Complaints Commission could not be brought before the House for examination concurrently with this one.  I should like the Minister, when setting up this commission, to remember that there was a trade-off here, that we would get an independent Complaints Commission as a result of giving extra powers to the Garda.  It would be totally useless and meaningless to have the Garda investigating themselves, with the provisions of this Bill in force, given the degree of dissatisfaction there is at present. <Col N="1644" /> Many people do not even complain. Although they go privately to public representatives at their clinics and sometimes perhaps come into this House to talk about them, most people do not go through with such complaints because they do not want the hassle, the trauma, they do not want to be harassed, be under suspicion or treated with comtempt when they do so.  Indeed that seems to be a national characteristic even when one complains in a shop or anywhere else, that people immediately become defensive. However, in relation to complaints made to the Garda, I do not think it can be questioned that there is total dissatisfaction with the methods obtaining.  If it is the Minister's intention to introduce the form of complaints commission described in the newspapers, with the Garda themselves being responsible for their investigation, it will lead to much unrest and dissatisfaction with the provisions of the Bill, certainly putting tremendous pressure on certain sections &mdash; which many of us would like to see deleted anyway &mdash; the public being alarmed at the lack of safeguards and adequate means of lodging justifiable complaints.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's explanation of the impracticality of amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputy Mac Giolla and De Rossa.  We are all glad to hear that the established committee are investigating pilot schemes in the area of electronic recordings.  Indeed the whole thrust of that amendment was to have electronic recordings implemented as quickly as possible, particularly in regard to the detention section of the Bill.  While we have all been striving within the limits of the provisions of the Bill and anxious about abuses there should not be allowed to happen any widening gap between the Garda and members of the public.  We must be seen in every way to support the trust there is between them.  Part of our worry has been that this proposal would lead to a sense of alienation or even hostility within certain communities which would have even wider implications for the whole of society. The electronic recordings taken and <Col N="1645" /> shown on British television I found tremendously courageous and honest, leading to a great public learning of the day-to-day work of the police.  I know Deputy Kelly may have grave reservations about our copying methods in Britain.  But what emerged from those recordings, as shown to the public, was the trust and honesty of the police to allow it happen because they recorded almost unconsciously their day-to-day workings.  What emerged from those recordings as well was that, in certain areas, conscious or unconscious biases and prejudices arose in the course of their work, particularly in the treatment of some people who had come before them.  However, these biases and prejudices were then tackled with public opinion supporting the police.  Our Garda force would be endeavouring to ensure that their work be as public as possible, open to public scrutiny and that the public would become aware of the frustrations and difficulties they experience.  Therefore reports on such electronic recordings cannot be over-emphasised, nor indeed the urgency for their implementation, particularly in the light of the detection section.</P>
      <P>In regard to the establishment of an independent Complaints Commission we are striving, as we did throughout the many sections on Second and Committee Stages, to ensure that the rights of people, particularly those who might be innocently caught up in this, but also those of the Garda themselves, be shown honestly and clearly to be open to investigation in an independent manner. Other members have spoken about the absolute need for its independence and our regret that this is not being debated simultaneously with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many times when we have endeavoured to set up agencies or bodies, with the right motivation, hopefully encompassing the right structures the necessary resources were not there to back them up.  What then happens is that there can be disillusionment felt about them.  My plea to the Minister with regard to these amendments is that the appropriate resources be there to back up the Complaints Commission, when established, so that there will not be a sense of cynicism, <Col N="1646" /> that it is merely a front.  Bearing in mind the points made by Deputy Skelly it should be seen to be totally independent, not alone having the commission act in an absolutely independent way without any hassle of any person approaching them, but also that the staff themselves will be able to deal with it with all due expedition.  We want to avoid disillusionment and cynicism about the area of gardaí versus the public.  Much of the anxiety expressed here has been in regard to that.  We must have the resources as well as the structure.</P>

      <P>I welcome the progress that has been made in relation to the independent complaints procedure. Ideally, everything should be ready at the one time but this is complex legislation and obviously that is not possible.</P>
      <P>Agreement has been general on what the Minister has repeated on numerous occasions, that several sections of the Bill will not come into effect until this complaints procedure has been brought before the House, discussed and examined. Points have been made about what that complaints procedure should contain. The public generally have the utmost confidence in the majority of the Garda, but a person whose house has been burgled or who has been the victim of an attack, on making a report of the crime may feel that he is merely part of statistics, that it is just another house that has been broken into.  The procedure should provide for a better relationship between the public and the Garda so that the complainant, the person reporting the crime will be aware that there is a follow-up and after a couple of weeks or perhaps months he will be informed that progress has been made, perhaps some of the stolen goods have been recovered or that a person has been apprehended for the crime.  Like other public servants, gardaí have a certain accountability to the public.  People contact Government Departments about various matters and sometimes the follow-up does not appear to be there.  The public should be made aware of progress by gardaí in the detection of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, this will take time and <Col N="1647" /> money.  While the possibility exists of people's rights being infringed by the Garda, one of the biggest complaints in this regard would seem to be apparent lack of interest.  The vast majority of gardaí are concerned that people's complaints about crime are not seen to be merely taken down and put into statistics, that there is a follow-up and that perhaps weeks or months afterwards a definite answer comes out from the Garda either that unfortunately they were unable to apprehend anyone for that crime or that inquiries are proceeding, somebody will be charged eventually, no progress has been made in relation to the stolen goods but they are still investigating.  This is one of the most important aspects of the relationship between the public and the Garda.  The Garda may have good reasons sometimes for not giving information, but after a certain time they should communicate with the person who made the complaint even if only to say that nothing has happened.  That communication could be by letter or by a garda calling to the person's house.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it quite clear that certain sections of the Bill will not take effect until the complaints procedure is decided upon.  When we have the Bill in the autumn we can discuss and establish that this complaints procedure will be independent, that it will be effective and that complaints made at a Garda station or to any body that may be set up will be investigated and that the public will get satisfaction therefrom.  Then expressed fears about possible harassment by gardaí will be alleviated.</P>

      <P>The Minister has guaranteed that we will have the regulations and the complaints procedure and in view of that I am satisfied.  With regard to certain important Bills such as the Planning Bill, the Finance Bill and this Bill before the House a number of amendments are put down.  We have 59 amendments to this Bill before us today and by 10.30 p.m. we will have got through only a fraction of them.  In view of the importance of this Bill I feel that Members should try to keep their contributions as <Col N="1648" /> short as possible so that we can get through as many amendments as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The response of the Minister to my amendment that the Act should not operate until the regulations governing the recording of interrogations are made is based on the difficulties of producing such a system of recording and he felt that there was such a demand for the controversial sections of the Bill in particular that my amendment would not be acceptable.  We must keep in mind that, generally speaking, we are being asked to accept the controversial points in the Bill on the basis that at some future date certain protections will be introduced. I accept the Minister's promise that he will not introduce the detention sections and other controversial sections until the complaints procedure and the regulations governing the detention of suspected persons have been introduced. However, the recording of interviews is as important as the other regulations and the complaints procedure.  I argued on Committee Stage that if the electronic system showed difficulties on introduction some other form of recording, such as a manual system, should be introduced. Obviously, there would be drawbacks in relation to that, but some effort should be made to ensure that in particular the section on detention would not operate until recording takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as a whole will bring about a fairly serious reduction in the rights of the individual and our system, as we have heard <i>ad nauseam</i> in the debate here, is based on the fact that a person is considered innocent until proven guilty.  While I have welcomed some sections of this Bill as improvements in criminal law and I could even argue in favour of some of the sections which I have opposed if brought in on their own, taken as a whole, the Bill is a serious attack on the right of the individual.  For that reason the House must ensure that every possible protection is included before the Bill is enacted.  On the basis of our experience <Col N="1649" /> in recent years under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act whereby six of every seven persons detained are released without being charged, we must assume that the vast majority of those who will be detained under section 4 of this Bill will be innocent, too, and therefore released without being charged.  It is important that recording systems be available for the purpose of monitoring detention and questioning so as to ensure that no undue pressure is exerted on the vast majority of those who will have no case to answer.  I recognise the difficulties in introducing the electronic system but reports in this regard indicate that in Britain a considerable amount of progress has been made.  Obviously any system we would introduce would have to accord with our own law but in the light of the commitment given by the Minister regarding the introduction of a complaints procedure and of regulations governing detention, he should give a commitment also in relation to the introduction of the electronics system of recording interviews.  This would allay concern both from the point of view of the person being detained and of the Garda.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) Notwithstanding the generality of subsection (1) of this Section, no order shall be made by the Minister bringing into operation <Col N="1653" /> Sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 or 19, on a day earlier than a day on which a Garda Síochána Complaints Commission is established by statute.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In relation to the complaints procedure I accept what the Minister has said.  He has given another firm assurance personally that he will proceed with the complaints procedure and has indicated that he is doing that.  We just have a different point of view.  We believe that this should be spelled out in the Bill now passing, and therefore we will press our amendment to have the Minister's commitment included in the Bill so that no matter what happens the complaints commission will be established at the same time as or on the day before these new powers of detention and arrest come into operation. We may be doing the Minister a good turn in so insisting, because he has to do his own negotiations in relation to the complaints procedure with various people, as he has said.</P>
    <P>We have argued before that it would be appropriate to have the complaints procedure in this Bill.  It is in legislation elsewhere and it is in Britain.  We have argued that it should be included in this Bill and see no reason why it should not. We believe we should have a provision here which will ensure that these measures do not go ahead until the complaints procedure is provided.  The Minister referred to the fact that he gave commitments at the Committee Stage and that we then withdrew our amendment.  That is true; we withdrew it to see what progress would be made by Report Stage. That is not an unusual practice.  That preserves for us the right to vote on that issue under Standing Orders on the Report Stage.  Since the Report Stage was brought on fairly quickly following the conclusion of the Committee Stage by the request of the Minister &mdash; he wanted to have that done and we cooperated &mdash; his comment about the time which it took us to prepare amendments and so on consequent on that and the time when they come to his Department is not warranted.  We regret that delay.  I said in the first instance it was not reasonable <Col N="1654" /> to consider this Bill on Report Stage before next Tuesday as the time required would be of that order.  The Minister wanted to take it this week and we agreed to oblige him.  That put us under a lot of pressure and, as Deputy Andrews has said, we do not have the Department officials behind us.  I appreciate the work that has to be done by the Departmental officials.  We do not have their help.  We have to put the Opposition view and we have to consider amendments very seriously and put them forward in a responsible way if we regard them as relevant to the Report Stage whether they are passed or not.  There is a duty on us to examine what is being done and make sure our points are aired on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I would also like to pay tribute to the work done by the Bills Office, by the staff of the House who have done an exceptionally good job in getting all these amendments together within a very short time and ensuring their technical correctness, which is one of the most difficult things to handle.  That duty falls personally on us also on this side of the House. The Minister does not have to worry about that in his personal capacity: once he agrees about what amendments will go in, somebody else will attend to the technical aspects of it.  We have to do this ourselves, watch the lines, the sections and the relationships and so on, and this is very difficult and time-consuming.  In supporting the Minister's tribute to his own officials I would like to pay tribute to the staff of the House for the very excellent work they have done and the very courteous way way in which they handled that work in fitting in with the requirements of the House to have the matter dealt with this week with that degree of urgency.</P>
    <P>In regard to the complaints procedure, we now have an ombudsman and people are adjusting to that and in due course they will find, as they did in other countries many years ago, that it was a good thing rather than a bad thing and was not going to do them any harm.  In fact it would promote the view and show that much of the work done by Departments is excellent and that grievances tend to be fairly minimal and that where genuine <Col N="1655" /> grievances exist they are dealt with.  Then the whole system and the whole bureaucracy are seen to be more responsive to the needs of the people.  There is a parallel here in the complaints procedure. While some people are reluctant to see it come into operation I believe if it is well thought out, keeping various interests in mind including that of the Garda Síochána, they will be happy to have it in due course and will see it as being in support of their activities.  Eventually they will recognise this.  In all countries where these complaints procedures were brought in the experience has been that they were very much resisted initially while subsequently they were found not <Col N="1656" /> to have the horns that people thought they would have in the first instance. People were very happy to have them established, and I believe that will be the case here.</P>
    <P>We are pressing our amendment.  We do not mean any personal affront to the Minister in doing that.  I accept his personal undertakings.  I believe that if he is there with all the opportunities he will have he will honour them, but in passing this legislation we feel there is an onus on us to ensure that the provision is tied into the legislation, and that is why we are pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the list of sections which fall after five years as it stands and after four years as the Minister proposes in his amendment.</P>
      <P>Section 25 relates to majority verdicts. On Committee Stage we argued that majority verdicts should not be introduced until such time as the Special Criminal Court had ceased to operate.  The Minister refused to accept that amendment. At least, the majority verdicts section should be up for review in a similar fashion to sections 4, 6, 8 to 10 inclusive, 15 and 16, 18 and 19.  These sections are referred to by the Minister as controversial sections.  These deal with detention, powers of the Garda in relation to questions asked of a detained person, the power to destroy records and the right to take inferences from a person's failure or refusal to reply to questioning.  We argue that the majority verdicts section should be taken as controversial and be reviewed after the four year period, the date which the Minister proposes for the sections to which I have just referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no indication whatsoever as to the effectiveness of majority verdicts, either in assuring the acquittal of an innocent person or the conviction of a guilty one.  During Committee Stage, the Minister referred to a number of headlines over a period of about a year to <Col N="1659" /> various stories in which newspapers reported hung juries.  There is no indication to what extent the juries were hung, whether it was one person who did not agree with the rest of the jurors, or half the jury or three or four.  There is no hard basis on which to judge the effectiveness of majority verdicts.  For that reason, the section should be reviewed in view of the fact that it affects a right which accused persons have had for generations. It reduces to some extent the right of an accused person to be considered innocent until proven guilty and to be proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  It does not in any way reduce the effectiveness of the section as it stands.  It requires the section to be reviewed in the same way as the other controversial sections.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This amendment seeks to make section 25, which proposes to introduce majority verdicts, temporary in nature, so that it would cease to have effect in common with the other sections listed in section 2 unless continued in force by resolution of both Houses.  I do not know of any compelling reason for doing this and when the point was previously put to me on Committee Stage I did not propose to do it.  You are either against majority verdicts or for them; it is a matter of principle.  One accepts that they are either right or wrong and I do not think that a temporary trial period will change people's views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it to be wrong that one person out of 12 can cause a jury to disagree, whether the verdict would have been for or against conviction, thus causing a mistrial with the inevitable consequence of an expensive retrial having to be ordered. Not only the cost and waste of court time causes me concern, but also the position of the accused.  He must endure the ordeal of a fresh trial which, in effect, subjects him to a form of double jeopardy. We must also think of the additional distress to witnesses who are often the victims of the offences.  I illustrated <Col N="1660" /> previously cases of hung juries and they seem to be on the increase.</P>
    <P>There is also the business of jury nobbling. I have no accurate figures on this, but there have been cases recently where there was more than a hint of interference with juries.</P>
    <P>To come back to the point of the amendment, I do not see what we are likely to learn over a four year period which would affect the issue of the principle involved.  All we would have would be a figure for the number of convictions by majority.  We would have no corresponding figure for acquittals, because acquittal by majority cannot be disclosed. Any figure, whether high or low, would be open to different interpretations.  A high figure could, with some justification, be said to prove the need for majority verdicts, on the basis that these would be cases in which juries would have been likely to disagree under the present regime.</P>
    <P>It could also be quite strongly argued that such a conclusion would not be warranted without further information, because nobody could be sure that unanimity would not have been reached under the existing system if the jury had stayed out for a longer period and tried to achieve unanimity.  I do not think that sort of information could be available in such a manner that we could use the statistic as a basis for a policy decision.  If at the end of four years, we discovered that the figure was low what would it prove, that majority verdicts were unnecessary, or that they were basically safe and acceptable?  One could view the matter either way.</P>
    <P>At the risk of exciting the ire of Deputies who do not like me to refer to what happens in neighbouring jurisdictions, there have been majority verdicts in Britain, in Northern Ireland and Scotland, and there is no evidence of a miscarriage of justice as a result of a majority verdict. On that basis, I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  The basic reason is that I do not think there is anything to be learned over a four-year period.  One either agrees or disagrees in principle with the idea.  I do not think that keeping statistics and making an evaluation of the <Col N="1661" /> statistics over a four-year period would prove anything either way.  The statistics will be open to different interpretations and we could have the same kind of argument we had here on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We can learn from the information that will become available in regard to the other sections of the Bill which are being given temporary life.  We will have statistics available to us and we can evaluate them.  We can also learn from changes in court procedures and practices.  There is little or nothing to be learned from a compilation of statistics on how many people have been convicted by majority jury verdicts.  I am not accepting the amendment.</P>

We believe it is necessary to introduce majority verdicts.  We have gone into the safeguards and the time limit involved.  The judge will call on the jury to bring in a majority verdict.

      <P>I disagree fairly strongly with this amendment.  Section 25 provides for majority verdicts in jury trials. There is a large corpus of legal history which has demonstrated the need for majority verdicts.  Subsections (3) and (4) of section 25 provide for reasonable safeguards when we have majority verdicts. Subsection (3) provides that the judge will not accept a verdict unless it appears to him that the jury have had a reasonable time for deliberation of not less than two hours.  Subsection (4) provides:</P>
      <P>The court shall cause the verdict of the jury to be taken in such a way that, where the verdict is one of not guilty, it shall not be indicated whether the verdict was unanimous or by a majority.</P>
      <P>A large body of legal history demonstrates the necessity for majority verdicts. I cannot see any reason behind the amendment.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Woods and Deputy O'Dea, it is not my intention to repeat what I said on Committee Stage.  During the Committee Stage debate the Minister gave a number of examples from press cuttings.  He did not suggest that these were juries which may have been interfered with, but nevertheless they were hung juries.  My colleagues at the Bar brought to my attention the strongest possible evidence of a drugs-related case where one member of the jury was interfered with and, as a result, there was chaos.  While the amendment may be well-intentioned, I do not think it stands up to critical examination.  I am glad the Opposition spokesman has consented to support the Minister's point of view.</P>

      <P>What we are proposing in section 25 is a move away from a long-established principle of unanimous verdicts.  It is only reasonable to expect that, when we are doing that, we should have some mechanism to ensure that the new system has the effect it is expected to have.  In introducing a majority verdict without any time limit, we are putting it on the Statute Book and it will continue in operation forever and a day unless, at some point in the future, there is sufficient demand to have it changed.  The change suggested by some people may be to reduce the majority even further, which would be totally unacceptable to me.</P>
      <P>There should be a requirement at the end of the four-year period which the Minister is proposing, to review any substantial changes we make in the law.  We are proposing that section 25 should be included in section 2 so that the machinery we hope will be established to review the other sections will also be used to review the effectiveness of section 25. That is why we put down the amendment. We do not believe that is an unreasonable proposal and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 15, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to reduce from five years to four years the period after which certain sections of the Bill &mdash; essentially those relating to detention, withholding of information and inferences from silence &mdash; will lapse unless they are continued in force by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The five-year limit was included by me by way of an amendment on Committee Stage, as a result of suggestions made in this House.  During the debate, a number of Deputies suggested that five years was too long and I agreed to consider the question further.  I am now proposing to reduce the time limit to four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four years is, I believe, about right for a provision of this kind.  We need to allow sufficient time to enable a proper evaluation <Col N="1664" /> to be carried out of how these provisions will have worked in practice.  We can, for example, expect certain aspects of the provisions to be judicially considered and we have to allow enough time for cases to be taken through the courts and the appeal process.  Reasonable time must be allowed also for amending legislation to be prepared and considered by both Houses, if we are to make changes as a result of the evaluation over the period.</P>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage, it is intended that so far as possible records would be kept of relevant matters relating to the detention and other provisions so as to facilitate the review of the sections at the appropriate time.  I hope we will have sufficient statistical information ready to form the basis for an evaluation by the Minister and by the Department and that if changes are necessary they will be carried out in good time so that they can be introduced at the end of the four-year period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Minister's amendment reducing the period from five to four years.  If I remember correctly, on Committee Stage we spoke about three years.  In deciding on four years, I think the Minister has decided on a reasonable period and we accept what he has proposed.  On reflection, four years is probably a sufficient period to have the measures tested, examined and applied in order to get the information which the Members of the House will need in relation to the decisions they will have to take.  We accept the Minister's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Our amendment will not be taken unless the Minister's amendment is defeated, which is unlikely.  Our amendment was to substitute two years for five years.  The Minister and the House are aware that the sections referred to are largely unacceptable to The Workers' Party.  We consider them to be unworkable in that they will not have the desired effect and have not been shown to have the desired effect in countries where they have been introduced. However, given that we are a party of <Col N="1665" /> two Members in this House and that it is unlikely that our view will be accepted, we consider there should be the shortest possible period before the sections have to be renewed.  That was the reason we put down two years.</P>
      <P>The Minister may well argue that what we propose is not practical because some cases may not have proceeded fully through the courts.  The effect of the Bill in dealing with detained persons does not have to result in cases appearing in court and being processed through the court before an assessment can be made regarding the usefulness of the measure. Amendment No. 6 in our name goes into details regarding the kind of statistics which we consider should be kept and how often they should be published.  The result of court cases or the fact that cases may be taking place should have no bearing on whether the section should be reviewed after any number of years.  Primarily this Bill is dealing with people who are arrested and detained and the effect on them before they reach court.  For that reason we are pressing the proposal that there should be a review after two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the reduction by one year I am sorry the Minister could not see his way to reduce the period by a further year for a very important reason.  Members of this House have agonised over this Bill for a long time.  There is an obvious concern outside this House on the part of ordinary people, professional people and members of voluntary groups with regard to this Bill.  Members of this House have spent considerable time debating the Bill and are familiar with what it contains, and I consider it would be advantageous for those same Members to decide whether the legislation should continue in operation in the future and, of course, that would mean during the lifetime of this Dáil.  For that reason it would be necessary to have a three-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I suggested that we have a period of two to three years. After much thought I have come to the conclusion that we should not have the shortest possible time.  That is not the best option if it is going to be based on <Col N="1666" /> statistics that will come during the monitoring of this section over a very short period.  That would ensure that the section would be extended in perpetuity by a vote of the House.  Therefore, it is necessary to have a reasonable length of time.  Taking into account the argument of the Minister regarding appeals and so on, I consider the minimal length of time should be taken, and that would seem to me to be during the lifetime of this Dáil. Assuming this Dáil will continue until 1987, we would have about three years to monitor the sections and then Members of this House could make a decision. After a general election the new Members may not be aware of the argument and the debate that has gone on for so long concerning this section.  These new Members will not be under the same pressure as the present Members of the House have been from outside bodies who have made submissions on this matter. By accepting four years, possibly the review will come during the first year of the new Dáil and if there is a majority I do not see any difficulty in the matter being voted through.  For that reason I should have preferred three years.</P>
    <P>A reasonable length of time will be needed to monitor the section.  I am confident on the basis of the statistics that will be available that we will want to remove from the legislation sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19.  Although I am grateful that the Minister proposes to reduce the time to four years, I wish to have it on the record that in my opinion three years would have been more desirable if it was considered that two years was too short a period.  We should have the opportunity of deciding whether this should be a permanent part of our legislation for two reasons, namely, for the protection and the continuance of the good standing of the gardaí in the community and for the effect it may have on innocent members of society, about which matters so many people have expressed genuine concern.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Really it is a question of picking what one thinks is an appropriate period which would <Col N="1667" /> allow the opportunity for a worthwhile evaluation to take place.  I suggested five years on Committee Stage and I am now proposing to reduce this to four years. An argument could be made to reduce it further to three years: around three or four years seems to be the correct time, especially in relation to sections 13 and 14, 17 and 18 and even section 3.  The courts will look at these sections and make decisions which will be appealed. We need the experience of a number of cases going through the appeals process. I should also like to point out that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent a Minister bringing in amending legislation within the four year period if it is considered necessary.  If sections are seen not to be working and there is a need for amending legislation, the fact that we are putting a four year moratorium on these sections does not mean that they have to run for the whole four years.  The option is there all the time to amend legislation in the normal way within that time limit.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána shall publish or cause to have published, for each six month period for which this Act is in effect, detailed statistics of the operation of the Act, which shall include: the numbers of persons arrested under section 4 (2); the number of persons in respect of whom the period of detention was extended under section 4 (3) (b); the number of persons arrested more than once under section 4 (2), and the number of arrests in each case; the periods of time for which persons were detained; the number of persons who were visited by (a) a solicitor, or (b) a relative, during the period of detention; the number of persons <Col N="1668" /> in respect of whom the powers contained in section 6 (1) were exercised; the number of persons released without charge following detention; the number of persons against whom proceedings were initiated and the number of convictions.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment goes into some detail as to the kind of statistics which should be published in relation to the operation of section 4 (2), (3) and section 6 (1).  It stipulates that the statistics should be published by the Garda Commissioner every six months from the date the sections come into effect.  There was considerable discussion on Committee Stage as to how section 3, as it was then, but which is now section 4, would operate. That is the section relating to detention and how we could judge after the four year period whether the sections had operated in the ways which the Minister expected or, as I claimed, that they would have no significant effect on the detention or conviction rate.  However, as the Bill stands, there is no requirement on anyone, the Garda Commissioner, the Minister or his Department, to gather the statistics required to help in making a decision on whether the section should continue in operation, and that is why we put down the amendment as worded.  The Minister may see defects in the wording or think that the six months period is too short but, having regard to the Minister's comments in relation to the previous amendment that if sections are not working it is quite feasible for the Minister to bring in further amendments within the four year period, it is reasonable to expect that in making such a decision &mdash; and Members of this House will have to decide on acceptance or rejection of such amendments &mdash; reasonably accurate and frequent statistics should be available on the operation of sections of the Bill, particularly those which are controversial. We put down the amendment to require that certain statistics are kept so that valid decisions can be made in four years' time on whether particular sections should continue.</P>

I have said previously that records of this kind will be kept in the ordinary course of administration to enable the detention sections of the Bill to be properly reviewed.  However, I do not accept that there is a need for a binding legal obligation to be placed on me or the Garda to compel the keeping of records.

      <P>The Minister has refused to accept the amendment on the basis that he does not believe it is necessary to include it in the Bill and because he has already made a commitment that statistics will be kept in relation to section <Col N="1670" /> 4.  On Committee Stage, frequent reference was made to the unavailability of information in regard to the criminal system and the great shortage of statistics or studies made on the operation of the courts, the Garda and prisons.  Specific reference was made to the operation of section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act where, although we could get figures on the number of persons detained under that Act, considerable effort had to be expended to locate information on the number of persons who were subsequently prosecuted arising from their detention and the number who were released without charge.</P>
      <P>I also sought information from the Minister in relation to the Misuse of Drugs Bill but the statistics I was seeking were not available.  When we were discussing the section in relation to bail there was no published evidence available. The Minister referred to confidential information which was available through his Department but there was no concrete published evidence in regard to the changes in the operation of the law. There is a general need for an improvement in the statistics which are kept by the Department and the Garda, especially in relation to the changes we are proposing in the Bill.  It is essential that at the end of four years those who are here will have the capacity, based on firm evidence, to decide whether the sections should be continued.  I will not press the amendment.  I accept the Minister's assurance and hope that when he is establishing the procedure on which the statistics are to be kept the broadest possible headings will be used so that we may have substantial evidence on which to make future decisions.</P>

      <P>This will shorten the debate but will make it more difficult to follow.  The Minister drew heavily on the Ó Briain report, particularly on the Ó Briain addendum, to support his case on this and other sections of the Bill.  I would draw the Minister's attention to page 22 where Barra Ó Briain said at the end of the second paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would favour the amendment of the law here to provide that a person reasonably suspected of a crime but <Col N="1672" /> none others might be &ldquo;detained&rdquo; for questioning until the gardaí either decide to arrest and charge him formally, or alternatively to release him, but in no case, for longer than a period of six hours.</P>
    <P>In the fourth paragraph he said:</P>
    <P>This power to &ldquo;detain&rdquo; in order to question is already provided for in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and I would recommend that the six hours mentioned above be adopted as the norm in all cases, with certain powers for a District Justice or a Peace Commissioner to extend the normal period for a strictly limited time in respect of cases covered by that Act and the Emergency Powers Act, 1976, rather than the lengthy periods now set out in these two Acts.</P>
    <P>In effect, Barra Ó Briain was saying that under no circumstances should the power of detention be for longer than six hours in the normal course of events, that under the Offences Against the State Act, the power to detain for 24 hours, and a subsequent 24 hours, should be reduced to six hours, and that it is only under the Offences Against the State Act and the Emergency Powers Act, 1976, that any possibility of an extension of detention should be considered.</P>
    <P>I have doubts as to how the six hour period was decided upon.  I know that in other jurisdictions other periods have been proposed &mdash; some as low as four hours: there may be other jurisdictions which propose even shorter periods, and others propose longer periods.  I do not see how in the normal course of events when dealing with ordinary crime the Garda cannot carry out their questioning, forensic tests and following up any lines of inquiries in six hours, given that six hours is very close to a full working day. I cannot see the necessity for allowing the extension for a further six hours.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 1 July, 1984, the point was made that one benefit of recording for the police was that the interviews were far more natural and spontaneous because instead of pausing between questions to take verbatim <Col N="1673" /> notes, the officer can keep up a rapid flow of relevant questions.  Interviews that might have taken 90 minutes are reduced to ten minutes by being taped. I do not propose to return to the taping debate, but in the normal course of events the questioning of suspects should not require a period of six hours to elicit the information required.  I am opposed in principle to the idea of detention, and I cannot accept that there is a need to extend the six hour period for the purpose of investigating ordinary crime by a further six hours, and the eight hours rest period, which stretches the total time for which a person can be detained to 20 hours.</P>

      <P>We are discussing amendments No. 8 to 12, inclusive, together. Deputy De Rossa outlined the purpose of his amendment, but this is something with which we cannot go along.  We accept that there may be certain circumstances in which the second six hour period would be required.  In amendments Nos. 9 and 10 the Minister is meeting a point I made on Committee Stage, that is, that there should be reasonable grounds for believing that a person should be detained for the second period. Amendment No.  10 proposes that &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo; be deleted and &ldquo;has reasonable grounds for believing&rdquo; be inserted. Section 4 (3) (b) reads:</P>
      <P>An officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent may direct that a person detained pursuant to subsection (2) be detained for a further period not exceeding six hours if he is of opinion that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I said I would be happier with a superintendent having the right, but based on reasonable grounds, rather than a chief superintendent at a further remove and being of the opinion. I welcome the Minister's amendment, which will mean that the paragraph will read &ldquo;An officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent <Col N="1674" /> may direct on reasonable grounds...&rdquo; I support these two amendments.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the points made on all sides and have taken into consideration the studies carried out in England on confessions and police interrogation. It was shown that nearly 86 per cent were questioned by police for shorter than two hours.  Having discussed this with a number of police officers involved in the practical side here we found that two hours would meet many of their problems. They found here that two hours would suffice for less serious offences but that in very serious cases more time would be needed.  Indeed 89 per cent of cases would require less than one hour.</P>
    <P>Of course the more serious categories would take longer, and the amendment proposes that the longer time would be needed only for very serious offences when the second six hours might be required.  It is about that second period that we are concerned, and that is what prompted us to put down the amendment. We confined it to very serious offences such as murder, rape, treason, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit any such offence.  It is difficult to think of all the possible very serious offences.  Our purpose is to give power to the Minister to add to that list and to place any further serious offences, by way of order or regulation, on the Table of the House for either annulment or confirmation.</P>
    <P>We regard the amendment as reasonable. It gives power to the Minister under normal procedures to lay any amendments he might want to make on the Table by way of regulation or order.  We are suggesting that the six hours would be confined to very serious cases, like those listed in our amendment.  The Minister may say the superintendent of the Garda operating the system will tend to agree with this in any event.  That might well be the case, but we felt we should indicate our view clearly that we only call for the second six hours for serious offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In reply to Deputy De Rossa's and Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment, I think the second six hours will be necessary for a minority <Col N="1675" /> of cases only.  That is why I specifically included six hours plus six rather than a single period of 12 hours.  The Bill provides that it must be seen to be necessary by a superintendent.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the amendment.  On Committee Stage the House decided that 12 hours was an appropriate period of detention.  I agree that, in the vast majority of cases, only a small portion of the initial six hour period will be necessary, but there will be cases where one full period will be required.  It will also be necessary to extend the period, but in that minority of cases we agreed on Committee Stage that the further six hours should be provided, and I want the House to continue its agreement to that.</P>
      <P>The amendments I am moving take into account points raised on Committee Stage.  Their purpose is to allow an extra six hours detention to be authorised by an officer not below the rank of superintendent. At present the authorising officer must be at least a chief superintendent. It is also being provided that the authorising officer must have reasonable grounds for believing, rather than &ldquo;be of the opinion&rdquo;, that a further period of detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, an amendment tabled by Deputy Woods would have required a chief superintendent to base a decision to authorise a further period of detention on &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo;. During the debate then I pointed out the difficulties that would be involved and the problems that could arise because a chief superintendent would normally be operating at some remove from an individual investigation and consequently might be said not be in a position himself to have adequate knowledge of the circumstances so as to satisfy the test of reasonableness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By allowing the decision to be taken by a superintendent, it is possible to get over this difficulty and incorporate the test of reasonableness.  This will be an objective test which will be open to review by the courts.  A superintendent will usually be closer to an investigation taking place within his district than a chief superintendent <Col N="1676" /> could be and will have sufficient knowledge and information available to him to be in a position to base his decision on reasonable grounds.</P>
    <P>The deletion of lines 29 to 31 is consequential since it now will be a superintendent who will be taking the decision to extend the initial detention period.  It is not proposed to provide for an officer of a lower rank to act in his absence. There ought to be no practical difficulty about the availability of a superintendent to perform this function.</P>
    <P>Originally, in the absence of a chief superintendent somebody acting in his place could have given the authorisation, but that is not considered to be necessary because superintendents are generally available and should be available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods' amendment No. 11 would mean that the extension of the detention period for a further six hours could only be granted for treason, murder, rape, attempt or conspiracy to commit any such offence, etc.  This would involve a list system on the purpose of detention under section 4.  This raises the problem posed in the five year formula, whether it was too wide or whether a schedule of offences would be more appropriate.  Another problem about the amendment is that there is no limit as to what could be included in the list.  Therefore, by extending it, I could achieve the same effect as is accomplished in the five-year formula.  I could come back with a list including all felonies, anything that takes a five-year sentence.  It would not necessarily achieve what it sets out to achieve.  What I have done is a better solution.  A two-tier system of detention operating on a schedule of offences for the second moiety would be very cumbersome and complicated.  At an operational level the Garda would have a certain amount of difficulty in dealing with it.  There is a drafting difficulty of a minor nature in that the amendment does not state who would make the regulations.  I presume it is the Minister who would make the regulations.  I would prefer if Dr. Woods withdrew the amendment. We need the 12 hours for all five year offences, if necessary in the course of the investigation of such offences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> Purely for the information of the House I should like to state that the Garda have a number of lists to contend with at present.  A common law classification of offences into felonies and misdemeanours determines whether a member of the Garda has the power to arrest without warrant.  Apart from some statutory exceptions the general rule is that there is a power of arrest for felonies but not for misdemeanours.  This classification, however, is complicated by the fact that a very minor offence &mdash; for instances of the larceny of a small amount of money &mdash; is a felony and very serious offences such as obtaining property by false pretences irrespective of the value of the property are misdemeanours.  Legislation is in the course of preparation to abolish the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and to provide that all indictable offences which carry a penalty of at least five years in prison will be arrestable offences, offences where gardaí will have the power to arrest without warrant.</P>
    <P>People frequently make the point that we are excluding misdemeanours and that they are generally in the area of what people call &ldquo;white collar crime&rdquo;.  We will have an opportunity to discuss that in the next session.  I am trying to illustrate that a garda has power to arrest without warrant but he has to decide whether something is a felony or a misdemeanour.  He has to have a very accurate idea of these lists or he will exceed his authority.  There is also a list of offences scheduled by the Government under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, such as firearms and explosives offences, malicious damage offences, offences under the Offences Against the State Act itself and watching and besetting.  The significance of the offence in this schedule is that there is the power of detention for up to 48 hours in respect of them and unless the DPP otherwise directs the offences on this list will be tried by the Special Criminal Court.  The point I am making is that gardaí have to learn and remember what is on the list, because if they arrest and detain under the Offences Against the State Act they must be sure it is for one of the appropriate offences.  Another list <Col N="1678" /> they have to cope with is for offences under the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976.  That list covers many more offences than those scheduled under the Offences Against the State Act.  The significance is that these offences are committed in Northern Ireland, are offences against the law of the State and are, therefore, triable in the State.  There is a list of offences in section 8 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976.  It is a complicated list of nine different categories of offences in respect of which gardaí have power to search vehicles and persons in vehicles.</P>
    <P>On the practical operational level those considerations weighed with me when evaluating whether I would put in the five-year formula which corresponds in general to what is at present a felony or whether I would go for a schedule. The schedule would have to be quite long and would add another list to the considerable number of lists gardaí have to cope with at the moment.  It would make it difficult for them at an operational level.  Deputy Woods' amendment suggests in effect that a number of specific offences should be mentioned in the Bill, which would be a list for which the second six-hour moiety could be appropriate in certain circumstances if the superintendent decided it was reasonable to believe he needed the extra six hours.  As well as that he wants the Minister to bring in regulations to the Dáil with another list of offences for which the second six-hour moiety would also be appropriate.  That suggestion would be cumbersome and would not achieve very much beyond what we have achieved already.  It would make for operational difficulties, and I ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing his amendment.</P>

      <P>I was surprised to hear the Minister say that the amendment put forward by Dr. Woods will not achieve very much.  In my opinion amendment No.  11 is fundamental to the entire operation of the legislation.  In the course of the Committee Stage debate we did not have much time to deal with the general principle of how long the period of detention should be because we were concerned to remove some blatant injustices from the original legislation.  The original legislation was blatantly discriminatory in that it appeared to discriminate against a person on the outside being taken in for the first time and against the person who was on the inside and could be detained on the opinion of a chief superintendent for a further six hours.  The arresting garda only had to have reasonable grounds for suspecting a person of having committed an offence to which the Act relates to take him in.  The chief superintendent could have a person detained for a further six hours on the basis of his opinion.  We argued long and hard against that provision on Committee Stage, and I am glad the Minister accepted our argument and the suggestion we put forward that the superintendent, as it is now, should come to the conclusion on reasonable grounds rather than simply as a matter of opinion. I thank the Minister for accepting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can now go on to discuss the general principle of how long the period of detention should be in total.  The Minister said he considers a two-tier system reasonable but there has not been any convincing case &mdash; I have gone through the Official Report of the Committee Stage debate &mdash; for the second six-hour period of detention in all types of offences covered by the Bill, offences that would carry a sentence of five years.  No convincing evidence, statistical or otherwise, has been produced to justify the necessity for a further six-hour period of detention.  The Minister seems fixed in having that second six-hour period of detention.  We have gone some of the way with him by agreeing to that second <Col N="1680" /> period of detention in very serious cases. We enumerated some of those cases but we left it to the Minister to set out the other serious cases he considers should be subject to the second period of detention.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when he said it would be easy for him to drive a coach and four through our amendment by bringing in a regulation containing a long list of offences.  However, I hope the Minister accepts the spirit of our amendment. We are not putting it forward so that the Minister can find a loophole in it and render it nugatory.  We are putting the amendment forward in a spirit of co-operation.  We want the best legislation possible.  If the Bill has to be passed by the Dáil we want proper safeguards included.  We do not want measures included in it which are not necessary.  I do not see any need for any second six-hour period of detenion, but in order to go some of the way with the Minister we have listed some serious cases to which it could be applied.  We envisage the Minister designating cases shown by statistical evidence to justify a second six-hour period of detention.  I hope the Minister accepts that our amendment was tabled in that spirit.</P>
    <P>No case has been made to justify the second six-hour detention period.  The gardaí have been looking for extended periods of detention but this fact does not of itself justify them or imply that they are necessary.  The amendment we are suggesting is fundamental to the whole basis of this legislation and the Minister should look at it reasonably.  I thank him for coming part of the way with us and removing the obvious injustices and discriminations in the original legislation. His proposal is contrary to the clear recommendations of the Ó Briain Committee, and he should also bear in mind the recent studies by the Commission on Justice and Peace which suggest that draconian legislation which does not work brings the law into disrepute.  There are no grounds for a second six-hour period of detention, except in very serious cases.  It is not justified in all the possible cases which could be dealt with under this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on record as saying that I would be happy if the second six-hour detention period was removed altogether and that I am totally opposed to detention in any form.  Amendment No. 11 put forward by Deputy Woods is reasonable.  It is another example of his thoughtful and constructive approach. He has brought forward another proposal which sets us back on our heels and makes us think very carefully about the section.  A positive improvement could be made by restricting the second period of detention to very serious cases, if it is used at all.  At least it would be confined. A person can be arrested for virtually anything.  Section 3 would apply in the case of anybody stealing a car or joy riding, because that offence carries a sentence of five years' imprisonment.  Not only does it apply to the person driving the car but it applies also to passengers. A garda might ask a person the registration number of a car and if he could not give the correct reply the gardaí could suspect him of stealing the car and section 3 would then apply.</P>
      <P>I see much merit in the proposal put forward and I support Deputy O'Dea's argument.  We should give this matter serious consideration.  It might to some extent reduce this abhorrent section to some semblance of decency by restricting the offences for which one could be detained, certainly for a second period, to very serious crimes.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to accept the Minister's argument that it would be difficult for the gardaí because they would have to have an extended list.  I cannot see any great difficulty.  I would urge the Minister to think about this matter.  I am on record as saying on Committee Stage that I was in favour of the deletion of &ldquo;chief superintendent&rdquo; in regard to extending the period of detention, but the Minister has balanced the section somewhat by changing &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; to &ldquo;has reasonable grounds for believing&rdquo;.  I welcome the Minister's baby step on the road to libertarianism and I would ask him to consider this amendment put forward by Deputy Woods.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy <Col N="1682" /> Woods on this amendment.  This has been agreed to be an abhorrent section.  I believe it is a dangerous section.  I would describe some of the sections as a lawyer's paradise.  The Minister argues against the amendment as adding to the bureaucratic nature of the section.  As it stands, it is one of the most bureaucratised sections in the Bill.  That would be one of the minor arguments against it. All the amendment proposes to do is to give support to the original argument about the first six-hours detention.  In relation to the second six-hour detention period the amendment proposes to set out a list of offences.  That is not unreasonable in view of the dangerous nature of the section.  The Minister states that they may be a minor drafting problem in regard to the amendment.</P>
      <P>I would question the efficiency with which the section would work.  I understand that the Minister intends to hold courses in the operation of the Bill for the Garda force.  These courses will be comprehensive and will be conducted by people who understand the nature and philosophy of the Bill.  These lecturers of attending Garda will comprehend the message they are imparting to their listeners. That is the only way I can foresee the provisions of this Bill operating, and particularly those of this section, which is an extremely complicated and extensive one.  I say, with respect to the Garda Síochána, it would take a lot to convince me that an ordinary member of the force would comprehend the section and its terms, or that he will understand the implications of its operations, as at present worded.  That applies also to the other controversial sections we have pointed out to the Minister in the course of this debate.  Those are the problems I foresee in connection with the operation of the provisions of the section itself.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods' amendment No. 11 goes a long way to lessening the impact of the second six hours detention.  The Minister might reconsider his outright refusal to accept the amendment, as drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minor drafting amendment raises the spectre of the inefficiency of the system <Col N="1683" /> to which the Opposition Parties are exposed.  We have raised the point before that we do not have a proper technical back-up service available to us. I do not concede that we have not properly debated this Bill, but there may be other Bills not properly debated in some circumstances.  Perhaps the Minister would bring the message back to the Government &mdash; I consider it a worthwhile one &mdash; that we should have technical advice available to us, even from the civil service.  It must be conceded that when one is out of government, one is out of government and in a democracy that is how it should be.  But there should be some system devised by a pioneering thinking Government of some form of back-up service being available to the Opposition spokesperson and those others in Opposition who will support that person in debates.  There should be some system devised in order to guarantee worthwhile investigative debate even from the point of view of proposing amendments to Bills before the House. It is a problem with which the House should concern itself, perhaps not today but at some point in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is a controversial one whose provisions I believe will be very difficult to implement.  I believe the Garda will experience extreme difficulty in implementing the provisions of section 4 and other controversial sections, subsection by subsection. If it cannot be implemented subsection by subsection then the lawyers will have a field day and the object of the Bill will not be achieved.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said already that he will be introducing statutory regulations.  What Deputy Woods is attempting to do through his amendment, to a very difficult and controversial section, is to introduce some kind of regulation of this section also.  Amendment No. 11 attempts to establish a certain standard or discipline that should render interpretation easier.  The seriousness of the second period of detention worries all of us. Taking into account the whole drafting <Col N="1684" /> operation in process in regard to the whole of the Bill the Minister might ascertain if it could be reconsidered because the wording: &ldquo;and the offence is one of treason, murder, rape, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit any such offence ...&rdquo; would cover what we would consider to be serious crimes.  While all of us are reluctant even to contemplate a second detention period Deputy Woods' amendment would go some way towards alleviating the fears of people that it might not be properly interpreted, so that that second period of detention would not be imposed except in the most grave circumstances.  This amendment attempts to spell out those circumstances, and the Minister might reconsider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I might conclude in relation to my amendment, No. 8, and make a number of points.  This is an amendment about which I feel strongly and which I intend pressing.  I regret that the Fianna Fáil spokesman has indicated that he does not support it.  While there is some merit in Deputy Woods' amendment I feel it would be seen to be unnecessary if this second detention period did not exist in the first place.  Most of the case in support of detention is made on the ground that we must be seen to tackle serious crime effectively.  Statistics are trotted out in relation to detection rates which indicate that there is a detection rate of as low as 30 per cent for crime generally in this State.  That is true if one takes all types of crime together.  However, in the 1983 report of the Garda Commissioner it is said that the detection rates for serious crime are much higher. For example, in respect of offences against the person the detection rate in 1983 was just short of 83 per cent.  For offences against property with violence the detection rate was quite low, 31½ per cent only, while that for larceny was quite low also, at 31.7 per cent.  But in respect of other indictable offences there was a detection rate of 77.4 per cent.  Other indictable offences, of which there were less than 500, included indecent exposure, false imprisonment, public mischief, conspiracy and other offences of which there is no breakdown.  Therefore <Col N="1685" /> the House will see that, in respect of serious offences against the person, there is quite a high detection rate, that without any period of detention.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of this Bill we are affording a detention period of six hours, with its extension for a further six hours, plus, of course, the eight-hour rest period, giving a total of 20 hours.  I have not heard any argument supporting the need for a second period of six hours detention, particularly if we take the incidence of indictable offences in the current report of the Garda Commissioner where it is reported that serious offences against the person are detected at a high rate.  That should be considered along with the point made by Deputy Woods, who argued that in non-serious cases the detention lasted for no more than two hours in most cases, I think in 60 per cent of cases.</P>
      <P>The other point I should like to make is that, in detaining a person for six hours, the Garda are not limited in any way in the length of time during which they may question a person in the course of those six hours.  They can commence questioning a person from the time of arrest and can continue to do so, if they so wish or see the necessity, for the full six hours. There is no requirement in the Bill to limit that in any way.  Again, if the person is detained for a further six hours there is no limit to the questioning of that person which may take place for the full 12 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in answer to Deputy Woods' case for not accepting the list of offences said that under the Offences Against the State Act, a garda before he arrests a person must be sure that the offence that he suspects the person of is listed under the Offences Against the State Act.  That is so, provided the person appears before a court, but we know from statistics available that 90 per cent of those arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act do not appear before a court.  A garda arresting a person under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act is not required to tell the person the offence for which he is being arrested, simply that he is being <Col N="1686" /> arrested under the Offences Against the State Act.  That detained person, if he comes before a court, cannot challenge the garda for false imprisonment because he was never informed of the offence of which he was suspected, therefore he cannot know if it was one of the offences listed.  I see no grounds for the second six-hour detention period.  The gardaí at the moment are quite successful, without detention, in detecting serious crime against the person, including murder, rape and so forth.  I feel very strongly on this matter and I intend to press my amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are a number of factors in relation to this amendment.  First, there is the point to which I referred earlier, that is, that a further list in the Bill followed by a subsequent list of crimes to be introduced by way of regulation would bring about a situation where the Garda at an operational level would be dealing with six or seven different lists of crimes.  Secondly, if the Minister wished to evade the intent of the amendment, since there is no bar on him in the amendment as to what he could introduce by way of regulation, he could simply bring about the same situation by having certain crimes specified in the amendment and listing the rest of them in the regulations subsequently, those that would carry a five-year sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a matter of a Minister deciding to play fast and loose with the intent of the amendment.  There could arise a position whereby the Minister would not risk excluding any offence because there would be the danger of leaving himself open subsequently to criticism by the public in the event of someone who was believed to have committed the offence in question in an aggravated form not being properly dealt with as a result of <Col N="1688" /> the exclusion.  Either the initiating Minister, myself, or a subsequent Minister by way of regulation could extend that right up to the situation I am suggesting in the Bill where it would apply to five-year offences.</P>
    <P>A third objection I would have to the amendment is that if the Garda are not given adequate time under the provisions of section 4 of this Bill &mdash; I consider six hours plus six to be an adequate time &mdash; there will be a strong temptation for them to use section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  If there is a doubt in their minds that a short period initially might not be sufficient, they might be tempted to arrest under the powers of the Offences Against the State Act, thereby allowing for a much longer period of detention.  In addition, it is difficult to draw up a two-tier system on the basis of the seriousness of the offence.  It would be easy to envisage a situation where the investigation of a very serious crime could be dealt with in a short period as a result of the crime not being complicated but there are certain forms of larceny offences &mdash; forgery, fraud and embezzlement, for example &mdash; which could be very complicated and which would require a much more lengthy period of questioning than would be necessary in the case, say, of some offences of rape or murder. Therefore, the question is not only one of the more serious offence being the one that always require the greatest amount of time for questioning.</P>
    <P>In effect we are discussing, as we have already done on Committee Stage also, the scope of section 4 and the question of the circumstances in which the second moiety of six hours could be availed of by the Garda.  While I realise the intent of the amendment tabled by Deputy Woods, I do not think it serves any special purpose and therefore I would ask him to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the question of various lists but at an operational level those lists would be put together so that they would form one list only.  It would be possible always to have, say, a pink list which would be the one dealing with this area.  In other words, by <Col N="1689" /> way of colour coding one could have the lists available readily.  Therefore, I do not visualise any real problem in that regard.</P>
      <P>So far as trust in the Minister is concerned we were intending by way of this amendment to repose trust in the Minister since he is the one who is responsible to the people and who, by way of this amendment, would have the flexibility that would allow him to make the appropriate alterations at certain stages.  We were trying to be helpful to him.  We are anxious, too, to have carried through the principle that the second six hours would be related only to very serious offences which required this additional time in normal circumstances but the Minister is introducing a new element by suggesting on the one hand that in having to decide what the list would be he would be exposing himself to certain risks.  In other words he would prefer that the House decided on what the list should be and that he would merely have to operate it or else leave it completely open and allow the Garda to decide on the grounds that the full scope of all offences coming within the five-year sentencing policy would be included and that consequently the Garda would have to decide whether there were reasonable grounds for proceeding. Presumably they would be deciding also whether it was reasonable in any case to proceed to the second detention period of six hours.</P>
      <P>The question of the exposure to risk of the Minister in the making of such regulations or in the implementation of them is another aspect.  I appreciate his saying that someone may then come back and say that he has the power to include X offence and that he should include it. In such circumstances I presume the Minister would include the power if it became necessary to do so or if it were indicated to him that it was necessary to bring in a regulation covering certain offences which have not been included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the suggestion that section 30 might be used instead.  This tends to indicate that powers sanctioned by the House are being used for purposes other than those for which they were intended. That is what we are trying to get at, to <Col N="1690" /> limit the second six hours to circumstances that are very serious.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty of spelling out any list but it is possible to do so, even to select those additional areas that the Minister might consider necessary.  I still say that this amendment essentially is good.  I admit that it would require homework on the part of the Minister, the Department and the Garda to try to spell out those areas which are most important.  If it transpires in the long run that that means that all the different offences are covered by the five years &mdash; there is no way in which that should be the case &mdash; then the Minister would of course be entitled to extend and we always recognised that.  I recognised in putting down the amendment, that it was leaving the Minister in a position where he could extend it to the full extent.  It was also an attempt to be helpful to the Minister, accepting that he would have the genuine interest of the people at large in mind when he would decide on any list in relation to the second six hours.</P>
    <P>On the one hand I want to make the point very clearly as to what and how we feel about this; on the other hand I accept that the Minister has come a long way to meet us by inserting the reasonable grounds which we put down as an amendment on Committee Stage and that by so doing he has been very helpful in adding in that amendment and has met many of our objections in this respect.  So, given the Minister's concern and his views on it, I would be reluctant to press him further. In any event, I know that the ultimate outcome of the situation if we vote on it now is just a matter of going through the procedure and having the matter voted down.  I want the Minister to realise that the intention here is to be helpful, to limit the use of the second six-hour period to serious crimes.  We are in the position of not having any background information to go on in that respect and we are obviously not in a position to give the Minister any greater list at this stage.  I assume the Minister would be able to add to that list through his experience as he will be dealing with the situation as it develops and as the experience of the <Col N="1691" /> applications come into being.  In view of the Minister's steps and particularly his introduction of the amendment proposed on Committee Stage in regard to the second six-hour period being based on reasonable grounds I am withdrawing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) When a person so arrested has been taken to a particular Garda station, he shall not be transferred to more than one other Garda station during the period of detention.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to restrict the possibility of moving detained persons from station to station.  On Committee Stage the Minister introduced an amendment which enabled persons detained under section 4 to be moved to a station other than the one to which they were brought when arrested.  It is our opinion that this gives power to the Garda to move people <Col N="1692" /> from one station to another.  Our amendment is intended to restrict that.  I know the Minister's intention in introducing the amendment was simply to ensure that a person could be brought to a station where proper facilities would be available. I know his intention was not to facilitate moving prisoners from place to place.  Our amendment is aimed at ensuring that this is made clear in the Bill.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): This amendment would confine the investigating gardaí to the use of two Garda stations for the holding of a detained person &mdash; the station to which the person was first taken and one other. While the idea behind this might appear to be reasonable in that two Garda stations or, indeed, one ought to be adequate in the vast majority of cases, it would be unwise to tie the hands of the Garda in this way.  It could have unfortunate results.  A person might be arrested and taken to the local rural one-man station to enable his identity to be checked out.  There might be no proper facilities there, such as interview rooms, refreshment facilities and so on. If it was necessary to detain the person for any length he would be transferred to a large station such as the local district headquarters where proper facilities are available.  Suppose that on the way the Garda car broke down or was involved in an accident and the person had to be taken to another station to await the arrival of another car, this would mean that he could not be transferred to the district headquarters because the allotted number of garda stations would have been used up.  We cannot reasonably accept this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another reason why the House should reject this amendment.  I believe that acceptance of it would imply that the Garda cannot be trusted not to play cat and mouse with a detained person and take him from station to station so as to prevent solicitors and relatives from getting in touch with him.  All the safeguards already written into the Bill providing for notification of solicitors and relatives and <Col N="1693" /> access to the detained person would be meaningless.  In any case, apart from the fact that moving persons around like that would be a manifest abuse there would be nothing to be gained from it.  The period of detention runs from the time of arrest.  The member in charge of each station would have to notify the solicitor and the named person.  As I have said, I will provide in the regulations that the member in charge at the first station will tell the solicitor and the named person where the detained person is being transferred to.  In the case of small stations this will be done simultaneously.  As district headquarters is where suspects are normally detained, there should be no difficulty in providing information about persons detained in the district.  The amendment is unnecessary and if it is being put down for the reason which I suspect, it is undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have put down an amendment which relates to this one, amendment No. 20 relating to the provision of information about where people are kept, which we shall come to later. Our belief is that the information should be readily available within a Garda division as to where a person has been detained and moved to.  If this information will be available we shall be satisfied with the position as it stands.  I understand the intention of Deputy De Rossa. Nevertheless, his amendment would restrict the Garda in certain circumstances where it may be necessary for practicial reasons to make more than one move.  We would not want to restrict the Garda but would want to have the information about where a person is moved.  Hence our amendment No. 20.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, as Deputy Woods has said, is well intentioned. On reflection Deputy De Rossa will probably withdraw the amendment, particularly having regard to the fact that the Minister has set out clearly his views. There are undoubtedly safeguards against the proposition outlined in the amendment.  The suggestion that in some way the Garda would course an accused from station to station does not bear <Col N="1694" /> examination.  It is even unworthy to suggest it.</P>
      <P>The safeguards are contained basically in the next section, as I understand it, &mdash; the section about access to solicitor and notification of detention.  The solicitor and the named person would be a cure for the proposition that the Garda would transfer an accused from station to station.  I do not believe that Deputy De Rossa is for one moment suggesting that the Garda would abuse their position. Nevertheless, that proposition is contained in the amendment.  On the basis of certain sections such as this, it is a dreadful Bill.  While we do not support Deputy De Rossa's amendment, nevertheless it was well intended and it has one effect with regard to this Bill.  I believe this legislation is going too fast.  It should have been left over until next term to give us more time to reflect and to let other organisations outside the House reflect on the amendments and the discussions which we have had on Second Stage, Committee Stage and now on Report or Fourth Stage.  One merit of Deputy De Rossa's amendment is that it gives us time to reflect on what section 4 &mdash; the detention section &mdash; proposed to do.  If for no other reason, it provides a service to the House in the context of the debate generally and we should be grateful to Deputy De Rossa for raising it.  I do not accept the amendment because I do not believe that the Garda will abuse their position.  If they do, they will have to answer to the law and to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that everybody has said that the amendment is well intentioned.  Indeed, all the amendments which I have put down have been well intentioned.  However, a number of points arise from what has been said.  It has been suggested that I have in some way made insinuations against the Garda in putting down this amendment. Like most and perhaps all Deputies in this House, I have the greatest respect for the Garda in the job they do and the difficulties they face.  However, the whole thrust of our argument in trying to safeguard the protections is that the powers being given in this Bill are very wide <Col N="1695" /> ranging.  Given that there is a majority consensus in the House in support of the major sections, I have seen my responsibility as being to push as hard as I can to restrict so far as I can the possibilities of abuse.  I put it no stronger than that. The Minister has promised to introduce legislation and regulations also to restrict the possibilities of abuse.  That is the purpose of my amendment.</P>
      <P>I have, at times, had occasion to make complaints about the activities of a number of gardaí, just as I have had occasion to praise the work of the vast majority. For that reason I would deprecate and disown any insinuation that I am critical of the vast majority of gardaí.  In the course of this Bill going through the House we must ensure that the possibilities of abuse are restricted in so far as is humanly possible.  That is my reason for the amendment and my reason for pressing it.</P>
      <P>The Minister argued that the amendment would restrict unduly the capacity of the Garda to cope with the situation. The example which he gave was of a squad car breaking down on the way from one station to another when the prisoner might have to be brought to an intermediate station.  One could argue that the car which comes to collect the gardaí from the broken down squad car could continue the journey to the original destination. There is no great problem there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the Minister's reluctance to accept the amendment if he reads into it a criticism of the Garda.  That is not my intention.  My amendment is intended as a protection for the detained person.  We must accept that if gardaí have detained a person who they are convinced from knowledge available to them is guilty of a serious crime, there will be pressure on them to use to their utmost the powers available to them.  If this permits legally keeping a person from access to those who are entitled to see him, either a solicitor or a relative, I fear that that opportunity could be used.  Even if used only once or twice over the next four years, it would in my opinion be an abuse. It would be to the advantage of this House to close off this loophole.  I ask the <Col N="1696" /> Minister to reconsider his refusal to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  (a)  Subject to paragraph (b), subsection (2) shall not apply to a person below the age of twelve years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) If the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station in which a <Col N="1697" /> person is detained has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is not below the age of twelve years the subsection shall apply to him as if he were of that age, provided that, where such member ascertains or has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is below that age, he shall be released from custody forthwith unless his detention is authorised apart from this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of amendment No. 15 provides for the exclusion of children below the age of 12 years of age from the scope of section 4 of the Bill, that is, detention after arrest, and consequentially from the scope of the related sections conferring new powers on the Garda in relation to persons detained under that section.  The amendment takes account of the concern expressed within and outside the House that the powers of detention being conferred on the Garda were applicable &mdash; on the face of the Bill &mdash; to children of seven years of age and upwards.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;on the face of it&rdquo; to emphasise again what I said on Committee Stage that we are dealing here essentially with theoretical possibilities and not in any real sense with probabilities or likely possibilities when we visualise children of very tender years being arrested and detained in Garda stations.  I remain firmly convinced, therefore, that the campaign against this Bill deliberately exploited this matter and did so in a very emotive and I think quite unfair manner to secure support for its cause.  It succeeded in gaining support from sincere people.  Deputies in this House expressed concern here and as a result I brought in this amendment.  A similar amendment suggesting the age of 12 years was introduced by Deputy Woods on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I hope that the effect of this amendment will not produce any unfortunate results.  As I said before, the fact is that children under 12 years are involved in serious crime from time to time.  It is noteworthy that the Report on Crime for 1983 shows that in the five-year period 1979 to 1983 there were 3,371 indictable offences of which children under 14 years <Col N="1698" /> of age were convicted or had charges proved against them.  It may well be that many of these offences were committed by children under 12 years of age.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the amendment will not affect the general age of criminal responsibility or the existing powers of the Garda to arrest and charge children suspected of crime.  The question of the age of criminal responsibility of children is a matter that will be dealt with in the Children Bill which is at present being prepared by the Minister for Health.  If that Bill provides that some age other than 12 years will be the new age of criminal responsibility it may be desirable to include in it an amendment of this Bill to bring the two into line.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of amendment No. 15 provides for the position where the member in charge of a Garda station authorises the detention of a child whom he bona fide believes to be 12 or over.  It will be appreciated that this could quite easily happen either because the child looks to be about that age or above, or he might say that he was and there might be no on the spot way of checking.  So long as the member concerned has reasonable grounds for his belief, the detention will be lawful and the member will be protected from an action for false imprisonment.</P>
    <P>However, as soon as it becomes known to the member in charge that the child is under 12, or as soon as the reasonable grounds for his belief cease to exist, the child must be released immediately, unless there is other lawful authority for detaining him, for example, in order to charge him and bring him before a court, or where a bench warrant has been issued for his arrest.  Apart from any such exceptions, if the child were detained beyond the point at which his correct age became known his further detention would be unlawful.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 covers a point adverted to when the exclusion of children under a certain age from the scope of section 4 was being discussed, that is, that provision relating to proof of age would also be necessary in section 5 in relation to children under 17 years of age. It caters for the difficulty that could arise <Col N="1699" /> where a young person who is being detained appears to the Garda to be over 17 when he is, in fact, under that age.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that, if and so long as the member in charge of the Garda station where a person is being detained has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is 17 years or over, he will be entitled to treat the person as if he were over 17 and notify him of his rights in accordance with subsection (1) of section 5.</P>
    <P>The critical words are &ldquo;if and so long as&rdquo; he has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is 17 or over.  That means that if at any time during detention the Garda ceases to have reasonable grounds for so believing, or receives information that the person is under 17, he will be obliged to apply subsection (2) of the section and notify the young person's parent or guardian of his detention and whereabouts and of his right to consult a solicitor.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa suggested that the age of 12 years should changed to 15 years.  The effect of their amendment would be to increase from 12 years to 15 years the age below which a young person could not be detained pursuant to section 4.  The Deputies sponsoring this amendment did not, in my view, make a convincing case on Committee Stage.  Perhaps they will have something more substantial to say now.</P>
    <P>We are also taking amendments Nos. 2 and 4 to amendment No. 15.  I accepted the spirit of the amendment moved by Deputy Woods on Committee Stage when he advocated that we should bring in an amendment to ensure that children under 12 years of age were excluded from the provision of section 4.  The effect of the amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 15 in the name of Deputy Woods is to raise it from 12 to 14.  If there are any other points I can take them up when I am replying.</P>
    <P>There are two points of conflict on the age question.  There are three elements in my amendment.  The first is that children under 12 years will be excluded from the detention provisions of the Bill.  That <Col N="1700" /> presents the Garda with a difficulty in establishing who actually is or is not 12 years of age.  The second part of the amendment deals with that.  The same consideration arises at 17 years of age, not as to the lawfulness of the detention but as to whether the person is 17 or not with regard to notification of a parent, etc.  and amendment No. 18 meets this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment which brings the minimum age for children up to 12 years of age.  At 12 years of age they come within the provisions of the Bill.  We had a fairly lengthy discussion on this.  As reported at column 1868 of the Official Report of 11 April the Minister said:</P>
      <P>On Report Stage I will come back to the House with a proposal that I hope will satisfy Members.  Perhaps the age of 12 years suggested by Deputy Woods is right: it seems to be about right.</P>
      <P>As reported at column 1864 of the same volume I said:</P>
      <P>We are prepared to talk about whether we want 12, 13 or 14 years of age or whatever, but we are not prepared to accept it as applying to under 12.</P>
      <P>What the Minister has said is quite fair and quite right.  It was quite clear that these special additional measures should not apply to children under 12 years.  As we discovered at the time they did apply to children from the age of seven years up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down an amendment at the time suggesting 12 years of age.  I welcome the step the Minister is taking in bringing it up to 12 years.  I put down the figure of 14 years because that was back in April. We have been trying to think what is the right age, and I put down the amendment to have this question aired again on Report Stage.  There is a relationship to the age of 14 years in that the incapacity of infants to commit crimes ceases on their attaining the age of 14 years.  At that age they come under the full capacity <Col N="1701" /> to commit crimes.  This brings us back to our <i>doli incapax</i> and <i>doli capax,</i> and the question of being incapable of committing crime with a rebuttable presumption between the ages of seven and 14 years.  The age of 14 years really means 13 years up to the day on which the child becomes 14 years.  From one's knowledge of children one would be very reluctant to have these measures apply to a 12-year old or a 13-year old.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal to exclude children from seven years to 11 years but I still have reservations about the period between 12 years and 14 years. However, I accept that a greater number of crimes will be committed at that stage and, in fact, the Minister has quoted a figure of 3,371 indictable offences.  As the Minister has said, if the age of criminal responsibility in the Children Bill is 14 years, presumably that should apply to the special measures here.  I welcome what the Minister is proposing in raising the age to 12 years but I have reservations about the period between 12 and 14 years.  In the vast majority of cases children are quite innocent at that stage and have a reduced capacity to commit crime.</P>
    <P>In amendment No.  15 subsection (7) (b) the Minister has taken a practical step to safeguard the gardaí.  That subsection states that where a garda has reasonable grounds for believing that the person concerned is not below the age of 12 years but finds subsequently that he is under 12 years he shall be released.  The Minister has introduced a similar measure in subsection (3) to amendment No. 18 which refers to a person of 17 years.  In this connection I have put forward amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 15 which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>To add a new paragraph as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) Nothing in this section shall render admissible at the trial of an accused person any statement, oral or written, made by him when arrested or detained pursuant to this section, if at the time of said arrest he was below the age of fourteen years.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If a garda arrests and detains a child who <Col N="1702" /> is under 12 years but who looks more than 12 years, as soon as the garda discovers his correct age the child will be released and will not be treated under the special powers in this Bill.  However, the garda might have got some evidence, statement or admission from the child before that time and to make the position quite clear when the matter comes to court, the Minister should have an amendment along the lines I have suggested. While it is fair to say that a garda might make a mistake in relation to the age of a child, and we want to cover the garda in such event, obviously as soon as that fact is discovered the person will be released from custody and the information or evidence taken at that stage will be taken outside the powers of the Bill. It would then be reasonable to suggest, as we have done in amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 15, that nothing gained in that period will be admissible at the trial of the accused, whether it be an oral or a written statement, during the time they were mistakenly detained.  That will make quite clear that there would be no benefit in taking in persons by mistake and detaining and interrogating them if they are under 12 years of age.  I should like to hear the Minister's reply to that suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal to increase the age in respect of detention but it will be clear from the amendments we have tabled that we are not satisfied he has gone far enough.  On Committee Stage we proposed 16 years as the age below which a person could not be detained.  As we were not permitted under the rules governing Report Stage to resubmit 16 years we had to propose 15 years.  Our argument in relation to the age of 15 or 16 years is that the <Col N="1703" /> vast majority of young people of that age are still immature.  One of the points I made on Committee Stage was that the courts treat a person under 16 years as a child and, for instance, such a person is not liable to be sentenced to imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The capacity to judge if a person is ten, 11, 12 or 14 years if very subjective and the older we get the more liable we are to err in this area.  Quite often when I assume young people are of a certain age they get very offended when I think them younger or older than their actual age. This holds for the Garda as much as it does for anyone else.  The question of how to judge a person's age is subjective and it is difficult to set down guidelines for it.  It is even more difficult in the age range between ten and 15 years because children develop in different ways and at a different rate.  A garda may decide that a child is 12 years because he happens to be tall.  Would that be reasonable grounds for assuming that the child was 12 years?</P>
      <P>I know of one child of ten years of age who would pass for 13 or 14.  A garda could not judge that child's age unless there was documentary evidence available. The responsibility must be on the Garda to take active steps to establish the age of the child they wish to detain.  For that reason, as well as wanting the age to be increased to 15, we have also put down an amendment to the effect that the Garda must not only have reasonable grounds but has taken reasonable measures to establish the age of the young person.  That also relates to the other section which deals with persons under 17 years of age who, before they are questioned, must have a parent present. If the Minister is not prepared to accept the proposed age of 15 years, he should at least ensure that the Garda must take reasonable measures to establish the age of the detained person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the amendments and I am glad that the Minister recognises the need to establish an age.  The question now is whether the age <Col N="1704" /> of 12 is suitable.  I think it is too low and I would be more inclined to think it should be 14 or 15.  Therefore, the amendments to amendments No. 15 which have been suggested by The Workers' Party and Deputy Woods should be given serious consideration, even to the extent of introducing the phrase under amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 15 that a garda has taken reasonable grounds to establish the age.  That may seem to be duplication and unnecessary in that it is expected that the garda must have reasonable grounds for believing and, if that is a judgment which will be established by a court, there is a fair measure of protection in it.  However, because we are dealing with such young people and because it is crucial that we should not, inadvertently or on purpose, abuse a person of that age, we should put in a watertight protection in this area.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult for a garda to judge a child's age.  Recently I was out when a garda called to my home at 10.30 p.m. in regard to a routine problem.  He had a discussion with my daughter who is only 13 years of age.  From the conversation reported to me later, he obviously assumed that she was older and this is likely to happen all the time.  If this happened to a person in detention it would be much more serious because the atmosphere in a Garda station would be very upsetting for the child and also for the parents.  The onus is on us to make sure that that cannot happen.  The Minister assured us on Committee Stage that this is not likely to happen because the Garda would not have reason to detain or question very young children.  Nevertheless, he said earlier today that there are very young criminals.  The balance must be towards the protection of the innocent, especially those who are very young.  I am in favour of increasing the age to at least 14 if not 15.  When the Minister for Health introduces his Bill I will also be impressing on him the importance of that age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can and should take steps to get expert advice which was not sought when this legislation was introduced.  We should also have a public debate regarding the age of criminal responsibility <Col N="1705" /> before the Minister for Health introduces legislation in this regard shortly.  We have the summer recess to initiate that and I urge Members to do so.  The intentions of Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa were laudable in introducing this obvious protection.  Like the amendments introduced by Deputy Woods, they have shown that further refinements can be brought to this legislation even at this stage.  That was also referred to by Deputy Andrews and Deputy O'Dea and it is unfortunate &mdash; and I regret it very deeply &mdash; that this Bill is going to be guillotined at 10.30 p.m. and that we will not be allowed to tease it out to the last degree.</P>
    <P>We have got through 15 amendments today and, even if it meant two days' extra sitting, it is a shame that we are not allowed to debate it fully.  If necessary, as Deputy Andrews said, if we had to postpone the Bill until the autumn, so what? Even if we had to spend another week or month here, so what?  If civil servants had to stay up until 4 o'clock in the morning, so what?  This Bill could affect innocent people and those as young as 12 years of age.  So who cares if we have to spend all day, all night, all month, all summer or all year to get it right?  It is a blot on the House that this Bill will be guillotined at 10.30 p.m. and that we have to vote on it without discussing the Fifth Stage. Against great odds, the Members who have contributed have succeeded in a painstaking way in extracting some small measures of safeguards and protection. We have also underlined the importance of getting the legislation right and have put future Members of the House on notice that if, after a certain period of time, the sections are not working, they will lapse.  Because of the approach we have taken to this legislation the obligation would be on those Members to give the same weight of consideration to them as we are giving to this legislation.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see the age limit raised and we will soon have another opportunity to examine this when the Minister brings forward the necessary legislation.  I welcome the part of the amendment which says that a garda has to have reasonable grounds for believing <Col N="1706" /> a person is not below the age of 12 years. I also welcome the double protection in Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment to insert the words &ldquo;and has taken reasonable measures to establish that a person is not below the age of 12&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods's amendment provides protection which should not be ignored. Even after taking reasonable measures to establish a person's age, if he is below the age of 12, the oral or written evidence should not be admissible at his trial.  That is an important safeguard and I cannot see why anybody should object to it.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment. I do not think it is necessary to comment on amendment No. 18 because it applies to people of 17 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Skelly supports my view that we are unnecessarily rushing this legislation through the House, unless the Minister can put forward persuasive arguments to suggest otherwise.  We have already propounded the proposition that the Garda Complaints Tribunal is dependent on a number of sections in this Bill as drafted. What is the hurry about passing this legislation? I have already gone over that ground on a number of occasions and there is no point in doing it to death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may appear to the Minister that there has been a change of mind on the part of the Opposition in extending the age limit from 12 to 14 years but, as the Minister said on other occasions, people should not be ashamed to be seen to be changing their minds.  Last Monday we had a very long debate on this subject and the point the Minister made was anticipated by Deputy Woods, Deputy O'Dea and by myself.  In fairness to the Minister it must be said that he was not very critical of our change of view and we are pleased about that but we felt that our amendment might be seen as opportunistic.  As other Deputies said, this is a very serious matter. It must be said that we were not firmly fixed on 12 years.  I do not have the Committee Stage debate here, but it is only fair to say that we have changed our attitude and feel it would be better to have the age increased to 14 years.  With the permission of the Chair, I would like <Col N="1707" /> to quote from a document entitled &ldquo;Campaign for the care of deprived children&rdquo;. It is important that we place on the record of the House the views of concerned individuals and organisations because they may help to crystallise one's views on important topics.  The CARE document reads:</P>
    <P>CARE views with grave concern and disappointment the failure of the Minister for Justice to bring forward to the Dáil an appropriate amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill to absolve young children of fourteen years and under from the powers granted to the Garda in the Criminal Justice Bill to arrest, detain, search, photograph and question suspects.</P>
    <P>CARE considers that the amendment to the Bill proposed by the Minister to remove its application to children up to and including 11 years of age is inadequate and seriously calls into question the existing presumption of law in favour of children under 14 years of age.  More particularly CARE considers this to be an inadequate response by the Government to the widespread concern voiced by many organisations... about the Bill and its application to children.</P>
    <P>CARE further fears that the Bill calls into question the commitment of the Government to raise the age of criminal responsibility to a realistic level in response to the Task Force Report on Child Care Services published in 1981.</P>
    <P>CARE considers that while changes may be necessary in the criminal law to tackle serious crime carried out by hardened and sophisticated criminals, no case has been advanced for the need to apply the extensive powers contained in the Bill to children and no case has been advanced to show that the present law is so inadequate to deal with the activities of 12, 13 and 14 year old children.</P>
    <P>CARE, therefore, calls upon the Government to further amend the Criminal Justice Bill so as to ensure that the powers of detention, search, <Col N="1708" /> and fingerprinting of children under 15 years of age will be removed from the ambit of the Criminal Justice Bill as a necessary step to ensure that confidence exists in the Garda and that where good relations exist at present they will not be irreparably damaged in the future by the application of such extensive powers to young children, and as an indication of the Government's commitment to raise the age of criminal responsibility in Ireland to a realistic level.</P>
    <P>We need not be bound to that point of view but it is important that it be placed on the record because this organisation over the years has done so much for deprived children.  In this case they have articulated a responsible point of view. There were occasions when I did not agree with them, and I said so, but I am neither agreeing nor disagreeing with their point of view as set out in this document.</P>
    <P>One of the traps into which politicians sometimes fall is that they are hogbound by the views of an organisation and that restricts their freedom.  That is a wrong principle.  In my view, the signing of commitments by politicians pre-elections is very wrong and irresponsible.  If organisations demand a politician's signature on a particular proposition pre-election, they should be told that the politician will consider the matter and will give a commitment after the election.  I see that as a form of blackmail, it is unnecessary, unreal and irresponsible, and more or less reflects the views of Deputies who have been so assiduous in their research into this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never the intention that the Bill would apply to very young children of between six and ten years but there was the possibility, and many contributors to the debate came up with the age of 12 years.  We cannot be totally dogmatic about the age of criminal responsibility, whether it should be 12, 14 or 15 years.  This matter will be reviewed later in a Bill to be introduced by the Minister for Health.  Various arguments <Col N="1709" /> could be made in relation to the age of criminal responsibility.</P>
      <P>The main Opposition Party have tossed around ages and have come down on 14 years now.  As I have said, it is not easy to fix the age at which children should be held responsible for crimes.  I have no doubt this debate will be continued over the months to come.  We all know that many of the initial contacts with crime are by children between the ages of 11 and 14 years.  Much work has to be done in considering this matter.  It involves accountability by parents.  Serious crimes can be prevented before children go into their later teens.</P>
      <P>I am sure all these arguments will be reviewed in consideration of the forthcoming legislation.  One cannot be definite about the proper age of criminal responsibility.  Twelve years has been proposed by the Minister but an equally valid case could be made for 14 or 15 years.  In the light of legislation to come, the Minister's amendment is reasonable. The whole question of juvenile crime must be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We thank the Minister for having raised the age.  It was reprehensible on Committee Stage to hear that children of seven years and over could become subject to the provisions of the Bill.  Our earlier amendment referred to children of 12 years &mdash; we suggested that children of that age should not be subjected to the provisions of this legislation. That did not mean we agreed that the provisions of the Bill should apply to children of 13 or 14 years of age but I think 14 years is a reasonable age.  There is a lot of medical and other opinion for that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Minister to our amendment to amendment No.  15.  Our suggestion of 14 years is a logical extension to the Minister's proposal.  A person of the age of 12 or under cannot be pulled in under the Bill but if a garda brings in somebody whom he reasonably believes to be over the age provided for in the Bill the Minister has provided protection for the garda.  That is fair enough, but what about the position if the person brought in who is below that age, makes a statement <Col N="1710" /> and signs documents?  If that person is under the age of 12 he has been subjected to an injustice because the garda has acted in a way which he is not permitted to do.  If the mistake is reasonable and genuine the garda is protected.  However, the case may come to trial and if the age issue is raised everybody will know that a mistake had been made and that a wrong had been done.  Our amendment to amendment No. 15 accepts that wrongs may be done by mistake but that wrong could be perpetuated or extended. Therefore, our amendment to the amendment affords reasonable protection for the garda who makes a mistake, and the Minister should accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment because there has been a great deal of debate about the matter of an age limit.  Many Deputies have been concerned about it.  Somebody suggested the age of 12 years, which is the age the Minister has finally proposed.  Deputy De Rossa suggested 16 years.  The point is that we are still dealing with the age of criminal responsibility laid down over a century ago in English legislation.  It is a matter of some concern to me and was, even when I was chairman of the organisation Deputy Andrews referred to, CARE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern was expressed many years ago that the age of criminal responsibility was remaining at seven years.  In dealing with detention problems we must remember that the Bill is not concerned with the juvenile justice system.  Many Members, including myself, are disappointed that the Minister for Health has not introduced a children's Bill.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Health has not produced legislation to reform the entire juvenile justice system.  We should have dealt with the age of criminal responsibility and fixed a new age.  There is a consensus in all parties, and throughout the country, that it is a nonsense that the age of criminal responsibility is seven years.  Had the Minister for Health introduced his children's Bill we would have an agreed age as to the age the detention provisions should apply to.  Our problem is that we are discussing something we <Col N="1711" /> cannot deal with fully.  The Garda will continue to have their existing powers in regard to those aged between seven and 11 years.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the House has not been presented with a Bill to reform the entire juvenile justice area and fixing a new age of criminal responsibility.  That cannot be done in a vacuum but in the context of a children's Bill.  That Bill will have to provide new legal mechanisms for dealing with children under the age of criminal responsibility who commit antisocial acts, who may need care and attention or be required to do some form of community service.  In a sense we are putting the cart before the horse but we must deal with it because it arises in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the next Dáil session a Bill will be introduced to deal with the criminal justice area as it affects children and that we will be providing for a new age of criminal responsibility.  I understand the concern expressed by CARE in the document Deputy Andrews quoted from.  In a sense it could be taken that the new age of criminal responsibility is being fixed at 12 years but that is not what the Bill states.  There is a danger, however, that it will be misinterpreted in that way. The Bill restricts detention in the context of young people.  To some extent I have a preference that the age should be higher than 12 years and that we should be considering the age suggested by Deputy De Rossa, 15 years.  I accept that the Minister is in a predicament in that if he puts in a higher age than 12 years he is predetermining the new age of criminal responsibility outside the provision of a new children's Bill.  The Minister does not have any choice but to fix the age at 12 because that is the absolute minimum age of criminal responsibility although I hope it will be higher.  If a children's Bill introduced in the autumn sets 14 years or 15 years as the new age of criminal responsibility no children under that age can be detained under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In a sense we have two problems but we can deal only with one of them in the Bill.  I welcome the Minister's flexibility in providing a minimum age but I regret <Col N="1712" /> we do not have a children's Bill dealing with juveniles who come in contact with the law and commit crimes.  It is my hope that before the end of the year the House will fix a new general age of criminal responsibility in excess of 12 years.  We all have difficulty with the age limit.  It is easy to criticise Deputy Woods in regard to this.  He put in 12 years as the minimum age but when the Minister put in 12 years he hopped in and suggested 14 years.  I do not know why he has done that although I accept his bona fides in the same way as the Minister's.  Deputy Woods is entitled to the same degree of flexibility in his conclusions about the Bill as the Minister is.  However, it seems a little opportune that after the Minister had virtually accepted Deputy Woods's proposal that 12 years be the minimum age he should insert 14 years.  In my view Deputy De Rossa is correct in suggesting that 15 years should be the age of criminal responsiblity.  It is unfortunate that our problem is that to some extent we are plucking ages out of the heavens without having an ideal age when a young person should be regarded as criminally responsible. It is a subjective decision.</P>
    <P>All moves in regard to the age of criminal responsibility depend on the Minister for Health who has made long speeches and promises about producing a children's Bill.  He should stop making speeches and promises and produce the legislation.  Some of us are a little tired of hearing such speeches and promises.  We want to see that legislation through the House.  It is a long overdue reforming measure that successive Governments have failed to tackle.  The Government are committed to tackling it and I hope that is done before the end of the year. I accept the Minister's point that he does not have any choice but to leave the options open so that the House can deal with the age of criminal responsibility under the children's legislation.  We cannot deal with it indirectly in this legislation. I hope organisations such as CARE do not take it that because the age of 12 years is inserted in the Bill it will automatically be the age of criminal responsibility because we are not making that decision today.  I thank the Minister for <Col N="1713" /> his flexibility in introducing this amendment which has been welcomed outside the House.  He should call on his colleague, the Minister for Health, to deal with the juvenile justice area comprehensively.</P>

      <P>Throughout the debate regrets have been expressed that this legislation is being dealt with without any reference to reform of the penal or judicial system.  There is another example of that in this provision which deals with the most vulnerable group in our society, our children.  Flexibility has to be introduced because a children's Bill has not been introduced.  I regret that more time has not been spent reforming legislation.

      <P>I am happy an age has been inserted in the Bill because, like Deputy Shatter, I have been pursuing the need for a children's Bill for some time. We were told it would be introduced after Easter and then in the summer but, hopefully, this will be the last delay and the Minister for Health will introduce it in the autumn.  Given the fact that we do not have a definition of the age of criminal responsibility we must pick some age. The Minister's choice is not unreasonable given the circumstances our communities find themselves in.  The amendment states that where a member in charge of a Garda station has reasonable grounds for believing a person is not below the age of 12 years the subsection shall apply to him as if he were of that age.  Suppose that section is abused and a child of eight or nine is detained on the basis that the garda was &ldquo;of the opinion&rdquo; will such an abuse be a suitable matter for consideration by the proposed complaints tribunal?</P>

      <P>I have a concern about deciding on a particular age and I would hope that it would be higher rather than lower.  In the educational system there is an acceptance of the fact that any two boys or girls at the age of 12 are not equally responsible and because of that <Col N="1714" /> we have special schools.  I understand that a member of the Garda will have some right to decide whether a young person who is in excess of that age is the kind of person with whom we are here concerned.  My difficulty is that members of the Garda show a reluctance to take any chance at all.  Is it possible that this section could apply to a young person over the age of 12 who was retarded, either mildly or profoundly handicapped? Bearing in mind the reaction of the Garda to certain of these measures already, I am not sure that there is sufficient protection for that type of child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been strongly made that while generally people are pleased that the Minister has raised the age from 7 years, they are not happy that he has gone far enough.  I am one of those persons.  The age of 15 is a reasonable age below which a person should not be detained under this section.  The Minister said that more than 3,000 young people under the age of 14 had been engaged in offences or convicted in 1983.  My reading of the crime report is that 442 such children were engaged in crime.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.  There is a huge difference in the figures.</P>
      <P>The important point to keep in mind is that when we set the age of 12, any young person over that age, and some younger children who may look to be that age, will be subject to the rigours of this section, enabling them to be detained for up to 20 hours, enabling fingerprints to be taken, questioning and so forth.  Given our experience and knowledge of how detention has been used in the past, we can expect that most of those detained will not be guilty of any crime.  I would caution against any acceptance of the age of 12 and would urge the Minister to reconsider this and raise it to 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point in relation to these three amendments is that the Garda should be obliged to take reasonable measures to establish the age of the person <Col N="1715" /> being detained.  That is a reasonable request.  Young persons develop at different rates, particularly when they are beginning to enter into adolescence.  I would appeal to the Minister not to confine it to 12 years of age and to accept the amendments relating to the responsibility being placed on the Garda to take reasonable steps to establish age.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter unfortunately missed the beginning of the debate on this section and did not hear what I had to say.  It was similar to what he said himself &mdash; that the absolute minimum was 12.  The Committee Stage debate on this section took place in April and we had to put down these amendments.  It is now July and we are now a lot wiser, having discussed the Bill widely.  I also said we were prepared to talk about whether we wanted 12, 13 or 14 but were not prepared to accept it as applying under 12.  That was the minimum possible. We appreciated the difficulties in deciding between 12, 14 and 15.  I mentioned <i>doli incapax</i> and <i>doli capax</i> and said that it raised the question of criminal responsibility.  We are taking a political risk because somebody who wanted to make a political issue of it could say that we got the Minister to go up to 12 and that therefore we should not be talking about anything beyond that.  I considered that point but I put down 14 in order to have the question aired and discussed. We are not in a position to discuss a section unless an amendment has been put down.  I appreciate that the Minister for Health is to come forward with a measure dealing with the age of criminal responsibility.  I note the attacks that have been made on the Minister for Justice this afternoon in relation to that matter. I want to get the record straight because people keep blaming successive Governments or whoever.  I might point out that I managed to get the task force report published at the time with considerable difficulty &mdash; there had been <Col N="1716" /> much delay over a number, of years &mdash; but immediately on its publication we drew up a draft Children Bill which was circulated in October 1982.</P>

      <P>The draft Bill had been prepared at that time but it had not been debated at Cabinet level or anything else done.  The Minister says now that he will introduce three separate Bills.  I want to make it clear that the groundwork in order to arrive at a stage at which one would take decisions on these matters was done in quite a hurry at that point. Having just received the task force report I spent the summer of 1982 working on it.  Ultimately the only way I could get that task force report was to say to them, &ldquo;bring out as large a minority report as you wish; if you agree on various elements, just issue the various minority opinions and let us have a report which can then be considered by the legislators&rdquo;. There are various contentious elements in that report.  But as far as we are concerned we should like now that consideration be given to a higher age. We welcome the Minister's move from age 7 to 12, which is appreciated, but that is the absolute minimum in our view. However, we are happy he has taken that step.  Also we should like early consideration to be given to the position between ages 12 and, say, 14, particularly in relation to the provisions here.  I would welcome that aspect coming before the House at as early a date as possible.</P>
      <P>There have been various contributions in relation to the dangers of children being brought in who are under the age of criminal responsibility.  That is the reason I put down this amendment and, though I say so myself, it is a fairly good one.  If we were not in this rush situation it is one that perhaps the Minister could take on board, be considering and even do so in the Seanad.  I might read the new paragraph 14 proposed:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) Nothing in this section shall render admissible at the trial of an accused person any statement, oral or written, <Col N="1717" /> made by him when arrested or detained pursuant to this section, if at the time of his said arrest he was below the age of fourteen years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Twelve is the age the Minister is proposing whereas my amendment proposed 14. That is an important amendment because it renders it less attractive for anybody to take someone in, carry out an interrogation and then discover later that the person interrogated was under the age of criminal responsibility, then saying: &ldquo;we will let you go but we do have certain evidence at this stage&rdquo;.  It would tend to preclude that type of situation evolving and, rendering it less attractive.  If the Minister cannot consider it now perhaps he would do so in the Seanad.  Having listened to the discussion here perhaps the wisdom of that kind of approach is highlighted all the more.  The Minister might consider that as a potential safeguard.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are three outstanding issues on the amendments themselves and a number of points raised by various Deputies.  First of all there was a discussion on what is the appropriate age under which children should be excluded from the provisions of section 3 and we have a variation from 12 to 15.  Secondly, there is amendment No.  3 to amendment No.  15 to paragraph (b) of my amendment put down by The Workers' Party.  Then there is amendment No. 4 which would have the effect of inserting an additional paragraph &mdash; (c) &mdash; tabled by Deputy Woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In selecting the age of 12 I was certainly influenced by the amendment put down by Deputy Woods on behalf of his party on Committee Stage, which also provided for the exclusion from the scope of section 3 children under 12 years of age. I was also influenced by the fact that I did not want to pre-empt the debate on the age of criminal responsibility in which I am sure the House will engage before very long.  I could foresee a situation in which, say, if I selected the age of 15 or 14 that would place the Minister for Health in a position in which he would find it very difficult to argue for any other <Col N="1718" /> age even though the question of age here applies only to the detention provisions of the Bill, and is not relevant to the age of criminal responsibility.  This amendment is not relevant to the age of criminal responsibility.  The way in which the debate has been conducted on Second and Committee Stages, and again here today, has formed a link in the minds of Deputies as well as in the minds of the public who read the debates, between this age here which we are applying and the age of criminal responsibility.</P>
    <P>I do not want to open the debate on the age of criminal responsibility here.  It is important to point out that, whatever age we select as the age of criminal responsibility, we are giving an immunity from prosecution under that age.  If one thinks it should be 16 years old or 15 years old, one should remember what one is talking about, that people under that age would be immune from prosecution. Many Deputies here represent urban constituencies and know what is the situation on the ground.  It is something one would not rush into.  I would hesitate to be dogmatic about the age of criminal responsibility.  Certainly it is too low at present at seven years of age.  The amending legislation in Britain brought it to ten years of age.  I am talking about 12 years of age in this Bill but that is not the age of criminal responsibility.  The Minister for Health should be in a position in which he can evaluate the situation and come forward with his proposals.  If it transpires subsequently that there is a recommendation to this House, under a Children Bill that the age of criminal responsibility should be 13 or 14 years, for example, then this amendment I am moving here will no longer be relevant. For those reasons I am staying with the age of 12 here.  I thought there was reasonable consensus in the House on Committee Stage that 12 was the appropriate age.  I appreciate that Deputies are free to change their minds and we have all had second thoughts about certain aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another general point I should like to take up is the suggestion that we are rushing the Bill.  Whatever can be said about this Bill, I do not think we have <Col N="1719" /> been rushing it.  It was published in October last and, if Deputies engaged in some comparative study, they would probably find that we have had one of the longest Second Stages ever, together with a very long and intense Committee Stage.  I thought Report and the Final Stages could be debated here today over a full day, and we have agreement between the two main parties to do that.  I think we can give it adequate discussion.  I know people have concerns about this area, which has taken a considerable amount of time.  But there are other amendments on which I think we shall have agreement and which will not require a lot of discussion. As the day progresses, by the time we come to 10.30 p.m., I think we shall have given it fair discussion.</P>
    <P>The other two matters to which I should like to refer is Deputy De Rossa's amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 15 to paragraph (b) of my amendment. This would go farther than requiring the member in charge of the station to have reasonable grounds for believing that a person is not below the age of 12 years.  He would also have to take reasonable measures to establish that the person was not under that age.  Strictly speaking I do not think it necessary to go this far because once he must have reasonable grounds for believing it follows that he must act reasonably in arriving at his belief.  I do not think mere observation of a child would be sufficient.  It should be remembered that there is also an obligation under the Bill to notify parents.  They must be allowed attend any questioning if somebody is under 17 years of age. Deputies seem to have forgotten this.  If people under 17 years of age are detained their parents must be informed.  I quoted on Committee Stage the relevant case law which makes it impossible for them to be questioned unless their parents or guardians are present.  If the parent or guardian has to be present during the questioning of a young person whether he is 11¾ years of age and detained by mistake or 13½ years of age the parents have to be there.  It seems to me to be a relatively easy matter to check the age <Col N="1720" /> provided that the parents give a truthful account of the age.  Therefore, this amendment is not necessary and I am opposed to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods's amendment No. 4 to amendment No.  15 would cut across paragraph (b) of the amendment I am introducing. The amendment I am introducing validates detention where the Garda act bona fide and on reasonable grounds but it transpires that the child is under 12 years of age and has to be released and the fact does not come to light until afterwards. Deputy Woods's amendment does not alter that but it rules out any statement made as being inadmissible, no matter if it were completely voluntary, obtained with parents present and so on. There is no compelling reason for this as the Garda would have acted properly in that situation.  The original <i>raison d'etre</i> of the rule of non-admissibility was to deprive the police of their ill-gotten gains when they had acted unlawfully on the basis that they acted incorrectly and obtained a statement but should not benefit by that.  Therefore, that statement would be ruled inadmissible.  That is not the situation here.  Here the Garda are acting in a bona fide way and a statement would be made and then we are saying that that statement, regardless of culpability, would not be admissible in evidence. I am not sure that that is the correct approach.  It is not right to deprive the community of the possibility of a conviction in a case like this unless there is good reason for it.  If it was to discipline the police, to rap gardaí on the knuckles and say, &ldquo;What you did was wrong, therefore, what you gained by it cannot be admitted in evidence, so you lose your conviction&rdquo;; that would be a valid line of argument.  The situation here is not a question of the Garda acting incorrectly, it is the Garda making a bona fide mistake, and for that we are ruling out a statement which could be of benefit.  The police would not have acted improperly in this situation.  I share Deputy Woods's concern and I will look at this between now and when the Bill goes to the Seanad.  Those of us who talk about rushing the legislation through should <Col N="1721" /> remember that there is another House in another place.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In regard to Deputy Mitchell's question, yes, of course it would be an appropriate matter for a complaints procedure but it would be even more appropriate for a civil case because it would be unlawful detention. Deputies raised other points but I dealt with most of them either in my introductory remarks or on Committee Stage because we had in effect the same type of debate on the age whether it be ten, 11, 12, 16 or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tunney talked about the difficulties that arise from not differentiating between mental age and chronological age.  That is a problem all the time. That would be a very relevant factor in court.  The capacity of the child to commit a criminal offence would come into question in court and then the question of mental age rather than chronological age would be very relevant.  For the purposes of the Bill I do not think there is any way whatsoever that it could be drafted in terms of mental age rather than chronological age.  Another difficulty is that <Col N="1722" /> there is no exact correspondence between mental age and maturity.  Children with a reasonably low IQ might be quite mature and people with a high IQ might not be mature.  I do not think that there is an easy solution to that but the court would certainly take into account the capacity of anybody, of any underage person, any adult, to perform a criminal act.  The voluntariness of their action and the full knowledge of what they were doing would be taken into account in court.</P>

      <P>The intention of this amendment is to enable a citizen or his solicitor to have sight of the records which relate to a case being pursued against the citizen.  The reason for suggesting the amendment is to ensure that there is a balance of justice.  There is a principle known as the equality of arms whereby the parties should meet on fair terms, one party not being in a stronger position than the other.  Citizens will now be bound to disclose information which they were not bound up to now to disclose or to comply with requests that they were not bound to comply with up to now. Therefore, it is only reasonable that they should have the opportunity of having sight of the records which relate to their detention or arrest in circumstances in which those records are relevant or are needed by the person concerned.  The European Convention on Human Rights provides that this should be the position.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 17 is to ensure that the relevant information should be available to the complaints procedure body so that in the event of someone wishing to bring a complaint to that body he should have the right to have sight of the documents which relate to the complaint being made.  Certainly that should be available to the people who are conducting the investigation.  For that reason they would need to be preserved until such time.  So where a notification has been given that a complaint is being made the records should be kept and maintained for the purposes of that investigation.  That is the intention of No. 17.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am opposed to amendment No. 16 which I think is potentially a very dangerous provision and one that I would not accept without very careful consideration.  The implications of it seem to be quite far reaching.  It would mean that a person in any of the categories mentioned could walk into a Garda station and demand to <Col N="1725" /> see any records relating to his detention. These might be confidential reports, for example, affecting security.  They could be anything once they are related to the person.  This seems to be unacceptable and there seems to be no need to go beyond paragraph (e).  If a person charged with an offence disputes any evidence relating to subsection (6) in court the records can be produced in court as evidence.  And in relation to civil proceedings there are procedures such as an order for discovery of documents whereby relevant records held by the other side must in certain circumstances be disclosed.  I would not contemplate at this stage going further than that.  I do not see the need for it.</P>
      <P>I think amendment No. 17 is more appropriate to a Complaints Bill.  It deals with matters relevant to a complaints investigation.  Accordingly, if it is to be made part of law it is relevant to the proposed Complaints Bill and not to the Criminal Justice Bill.  I am sympathetic to the idea behind it and I shall examine it in the context of the Complaints Bill but I could not accept it for this Bill and I would ask the Deputy to withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is considerable merit in at least part of amendment No. 16.  Possibly the wording of it goes too far when it speaks of all other records kept in a Garda station pursuant to regulations.  I think it would be quite unreasonable to deny any person information entered in the Garda station records pursuant to paragraph (6) (d).  In my view there should be an openness about records of a formal nature of that kind kept pursuant to statute.  It is a well-known, traditional fact that in official circles, Government Departments, Civil Service, Garda or any official circles there is and always has been an incredible reluctance to open to the public view matters that they like to regard as within their own private preserve of officialdom. They will resist to the last to the utmost of their ability openness and access of the public to what they like to term official documentation.  It is a situation much beloved of the Civil Service.  It is not a new phenomenon; it goes back hundreds <Col N="1726" /> of years to the old days of the British Civil Service and we have inherited it unfortunately to far too great an extent.</P>
      <P>The courts on occasion do breach that through the discovery of documents procedure but even then there are situations where if the Minister gives certificates in respect of certain documentation the courts are precluded from and will not look behind them.  I would urge the Minister to think again about this, particularly as regards paragraph (6) (d) which refers to the formal entries in the Garda records when a person is detained.  I can see no basis for not having those freely available to the legal representatives of a person who would be aggrieved by them.  The purpose of bringing in a provision that these records have to be entered up in the Garda station is to ensure that the matter be dealt with in a proper manner and that the requirements of the Act should be complied with. Surely that is the purpose of the provision in the Bill.  If so, why should there be any reluctance to have such items open to public view so that the legal representative of a person who says that something was not done in a proper manner should have this information available to him for checking?  We all talk about open Government and having things on a full and free basis.  This is a classic example of this kind of situation where there is no reason to deny openness and freedom of access.  There can be nothing in these records that would put the security of the State at risk.  All it is directed to is ensuring that the formalities required in the interests of a detained person have been complied with.  A person should be entitled to ensure that that has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in regard to amendment No. 17, I welcome the Minister's sympathetic approach.  I realise that since we are not having the complaints procedure at this stage there is difficulty in relation to the inclusion of this amendment which relates to references which would be required by the Garda Complaints Commission &mdash; and we do not know at present what exactly it will be called.  It will not be Garda Complaints Commission but a different name.  On <Col N="1727" /> that basis I am prepared to withdraw that amendment since the Minister is prepared to consider it for the complaints procedure.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 16 is to ensure that sight of these formal records or any of the records necessary under the regulations will be available to the individual concerned or his solicitor. It was my intention that an individual should be able to have sight of these and that they would be preserved in the event of such proceedings taking place.  The Minister says an individual is entitled to seek an order for discovery of documents. Why should he have to do that? When we are setting up the system why can we not build into it the fairness and equity that we believe to be appropriate? If there is something in the drafting that should be altered why not suggest that the Minister is not against this in principle but that he would like to consider redrafting it?  Take, for instance, paragraph (6) (d) where the records prescribed are the time of the giving of a notice under paragraph (a) and the time specified therein as the time up to which the questioning is being suspended: whether the person being detained acknowledged that he received the notice and the time of the giving of any notice under paragraph (b). Paragraph (b) refers to the fact that a notice under paragraph (a) may for serious reasons be withdrawn by a subsequent notice given in like manner and in that event any time subsequent to the giving of the second notice shall not be excluded under the paragraph.</P>
      <P>These are all part of the mechanics of the legislation which we are debating now.  I can see that the Minister might say in relation to certain information that he would not want to make certain kinds of information available.  The intention was to have records kept pursuant to regulations which the Minister will bring in.  If that is too broad why does the Minister not say that he appreciates the point in principle but feels it needs to be clarified?  We had very little time to consider when we drafted this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic principle is a sound one.  The Minister often spoke about the importance <Col N="1728" /> of getting the balance right and this would ensure that the balance was right. Formal records should be available and they should have sight of them.  As we saw on &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; last night the documents are very straightforward and simply state at what time something began and at what time it finished.  There is nothing very secretive about the documents. It is just, as Deputy Taylor said, that they belong to the bureaucracy. They are hard to get at subsequently but they could be very helpful to the individual in this unhappy position.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the question in principle and see how it could be advanced.  I know we are finishing the Bill this evening and that there will not be another opportunity to come back with a redraft but the Minister will have an opportunity to look at it in the Seanad. I ask him to look at it again and change his attitude towards it.  Perhaps he might see if it could be redrafted to keep it within particular limits.</P>

      <Col N="1730" /> I ask the Minister to accept this amendment. It is necessary to protect what I believe is a large number of people who would not be in the position to name a solicitor.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 21 states that the Minister shall make regulations providing for a scheme of legal aid for persons detained pursuant to section 4 so that persons who do not have the financial means to engage a solicitor shall be able to do so.  The Ó Briain Report dealt with the question of duty solicitors. At paragraph 62 they stated:</P>
      <P>The Law Society delegation which appeared before us regarded as feasible a scheme whereby a panel of &ldquo;duty solicitors&rdquo; could be maintained.  Solicitors on the panel for any given day would be available to attend at a local Garda Station when a prisoner requests the advice of a solicitor but is unable to name a solicitor of his own. A feasibility study of the subject should be undertaken forthwith.  We so recommend.</P>
      <P>Our intention was to empower the Minister to make regulations to provide for a scheme.  There is a major problem in relation to those who are on lower incomes.  We made it clear on Committee Stage that the legal aid scheme does not come into operation until one is charged. In the period before free legal aid would apply, that is before the person is charged, if the person has an income they can call on a solicitor who could make some recommendation on their behalf. Those who do not have an income cannot do that and they would be at a disadvantage compared to those who are better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the fears has been that those who are less well off will be disadvantaged because of their inability to protect themselves and take whatever remedies are available under the legislation.  This is an instance in which they would be at such a disadvantage.  The kind of scheme is a matter for consideration.  For periods of one or two hours there would not be a need for a solicitor to be present.  However, <Col N="1731" /> when a detainee reaches a stage when he feels the need to have a solicitor present, it should be possible to consult one.  That will not be possible through the present legal aid system which operates only from the time at which a person is charged.</P>
    <P>In this amendment we are leaving it to the Minister, to say that he shall make regulations providing for a scheme of legal aid for people who are detained under section 4, which is detention on suspicion.  This difficult problem must be faced up to somehow.  The Incorporated Law Society appear willing to participate in discussions on the feasibility of a scheme providing duty solicitors.  Even if it were only that a solicitor would be made aware of the fact that a person was being detained, that would be something.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments in the name of Deputy Woods are eminently reasonable and I hope that the Minister will give them reasonable consideration. The problem to which he referred arising from the legal aid situation is quite obvious.  There is not much use in having a provision in legislation which makes it obligatory to allow a detainee to inform a solicitor that he is being detained in a particular Garda station when the reality is that many of the legal profession respond only where there is an obvious financial reward at the end of the day.  If the detainee is not in a position to afford the services of a solicitor, it will be useless telling a solicitor that he is being detained, because the solicitor will not respond.  That is the first and very logical point arising in Deputy Woods's amendment. The Minister will have to deal with it immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the legislation as it stands is seriously deficient.  The provision is there that the detainee must be informed of his right to have his solicitor contacted.  The situation is akin to a lucky dip.  If the detainee picks the right solicitor, who can be contacted and will respond, he is well away, otherwise he is doomed, deprived for the entire period of questioning from access to a solicitor.  Surely that cannot <Col N="1732" /> be right?  What is the fallback provision? The gap in the legislation is so obvious that I hope the Minister will forgive my being suspicious that it is deliberate.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, various questions arose on Committee Stage about the right of a detainee to be questioned only when a solicitor arrives, particularly if the Garda are aware that the solicitor is on his way. I am not happy with the Minister's response to that suggestion.  I hope that he will give a more adequate response at this stage, having more fully considered the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Dea pointed out &mdash; and I absolutely agree &mdash; it is a noble and fine gesture to include a provision in a Bill saying that a person detained has the right to send for a solicitor. One must consider in how many cases that noble intent is likely to be fulfilled &mdash; in precious few, I would think. I have heard it said that the standards in both the legal and medical professions, in so far as they show a degree of service and responsibility towards the community generally, have been decreasing sadly in the past decades.  To take the medical profession, for example, it was the standard years ago that any doctor was quite happy to do night calls but it seems that the position now is that even fewer are prepared to do night calls and the situation in the legal profession also has deteriorated in like manner.  There is even less of a feeling of service toward the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those who are well connected and have their own family solicitor, there is no problem.  A solicitor will be readily on call and will come out.  For those who are not well connected &mdash; and most people who would be detained under this Bill would fall into that category &mdash; I would say that they would have great difficulty in getting a solicitor to come out.  Even if they did, the calibre of the solicitor with regard to the degree of his skill in criminal matters would be lower.  One who was very skilful in criminal matters obviously would be a very busy person who quite likely, and almost certainly, would be engaged elsewhere in one court or <Col N="1733" /> another if it were during the day, or would have possibly an understandable reluctance to come out at night. Although the intent is there to provide this service for a person detained &mdash; and it is very laudable that it should be there as an intent &mdash; the capacity to achieve fulfilment is not great, unless something more is done about it.  Reasonably, we could expect something more to be done about it.  Both amendments could be regarded as a minimum towards that end.</P>
    <P>Very many lawyers, both solicitors and barristers, do extremely well out of the present legal aid system.  We have seen lists published from time to time giving the earnings of solicitors and barristers. Quite a few do very well, indeed, out of that free legal aid service.  Would it be that unreasonable to expect those solicitors who are at least in the upper echelons of earnings through that scheme, and there are quite a few, among themselves, in consultation with the Law Society and the Department of Justice, to organise a duty scheme of some sort that would provide a basic on-call service, even if given no more than some token addition for providing this service?  If the provision for calling a solicitor is to have any meaning at all in reality something of that nature will have to be done.</P>
    <P>Let us not delude ourselves by saying that we are doing a good day's work here in the interest of civil liberties by putting in a provision that a solicitor can be sent for and all be satisfied and go home in the reasonable expectation that in all, or even most, cases it will be fulfilled.  I would say not.  I suggest that the Minister might consider, between now and the Seanad debate on the Bill, making approaches to the Law Society, which approaches I am sure would be welcomed, to see if some scheme could be devised under which those solicitors &mdash; who do very well, thank you &mdash; on that panel would be prepared to give that little bit to enable a basic right given under this Bill to be fulfilled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain pleas were made at that time to remember the detainees who would not have access to a solicitor. We have to educate some Members of the House.  Well-heeled Members of the House stuck adamantly to the point that people could easily ask for a solicitor. They were surprised when it was pointed out that in most cases they would not even know a solicitor.  As reported at column 1920, volume 350, of the Official Report, I said:</P>
      <P>... Deputies stand up here and betray their sheltered backgrounds when they talk about people who come to Garda stations and can contact a solicitor, know a solicitor, can telephone home or get in touch with somebody.  The chances of that happening normally are very slim because these people do not know solicitors.  They certainly will not be their pals nor will they have gone to school with them, and they would not be able to name a solicitor off the top of their head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to paragraph 62 of the Ó Briain Report where there is a reference to a duty roster of solicitors.  I reminded the House that doctors provide such a service.  Doctors are on call to Garda stations and a person who is suspected of being drunk can get a doctor at any hour of the night to come and take samples, and not for an exorbitant fee.  We could set up a duty panel of solicitors.  Being a solicitor Deputy Taylor is in a position to verify what he has just said.  Medical doctors could be regarded as well-heeled members of the community.  With all their expertise, their education, their commitment and responsibility to the community, if they can provide the <Col N="1735" /> service they do provide to the population at large, I do not see any reason why solicitors could not provide a similar type service without looking for fees of several hundreds of pounds.</P>
    <P>I do not see why it is not possible to have a duty panel of solicitors.  We have many unemployed people.  I understand we have unemployed solicitors, even though the number admitted to the profession is very restricted.  This would be one way for them to allow an increase in the numbers admitted to the profession. People could make a living out of this, and then go on to better things.  A medical consultant does not come out to take a sample from a person in a Garda station suspected of being drunk.  Neither would we expect a senior counsel or a very senior solicitor to provide this service for a detained person.</P>
    <P>That point was made very forcibly and I am surprised it was not taken on board and that it was necessary for Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa to put down an amendment again.  I have not put down any amendments.  I am on the wrong side of the House for doing that. The Minister puts down amendments. The contribution from Fianna Fáil and The Workers' Party on the Report Stage of the Bill is another example of their commitment to ensuring that we get maximum possible protection in this legislation for people affected by the Bill.  After the Committee Stage debate I did not hear anybody disagreeing with the contention that solicitors are not known and are not available to the type of people who will be affected by this section. Therefore it is reasonable to suggest that this should be corrected.  I do not see any administrative difficulty in doing that.</P>
    <P>On the question of costs and fees, the legal profession cannot put themselves on a pedestal and remove themselves from reality and from the rest of the population.  We all have a duty to the community.  Their duty is no less than the duty of anybody else.  Who would argue that solicitors and barristers are better educated or more qualified than the medical profession?  The medical profession <Col N="1736" /> provide a service for all the people.  They get very small fees and have to get a very large number of fees to give them a respectable salary.  With very few cases, or even with one case, a solicitor can get the same remuneration as a doctor gets from treating 20, or 40, or more patients.</P>
    <P>The law society have made it known that they would be willing to examine this suggestion and perhaps provide such a service.  A service could and should be provided.  Amendment No. 21 in the name of Deputy Woods reads:</P>
    <P>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Minister shall make regulations providing for a scheme of legal aid for persons detained pursuant to Section 4 so that persons who do not have the financial means to engage a Solicitor shall be able to do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This brings me back to what I was saying about solicitors bring available and to other sections of the Bill which will affect the less well off members of our community. Some people are so poor that they would not even dream of asking for a solicitor, or any professional person, or anything that would cost money.  They are used to doing without.  In this case the poor unfortunate souls will know it will cost them money which they have not got, or their parents, brothers, sisters or friends.  They will feel so hopeless that they will throw up their hands and suffer as a result of this type of sectional legislation. If we want to have this convenient form of sectional legislation we will have to pay a price.  If the price is that we have to give us some of our liberties, other people say we will have to pay it.</P>
    <P>We will also have to put our hands in our pockets and pay for this.  As has been demonstrated beyond question during the course of this debate, in more than 90 per cent of the cases we will be dealing with innocent people and young people under the age of 12 years who will not be able to afford any kind of professional advice.  I would support both amendments if they could at least ease the deprivation <Col N="1737" /> and the punishment that innocent people may suffer under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>We spent much time on this matter on Committee Stage but we must spend more time reiterating what we said because of its importance.  The reality of the situation is that many young people and their parents do not know solicitors and are intimidated at the very thought of having to seek one.  Many of them do not even have enough information on how to go about getting a solicitor. We will not go over all that was said on this matter except to establish the reality of the situation.</P>
      <P>What we have done here today is to move forward a practical step.  In the long debate we had on this matter the Minister referred to the high cost of the criminal legal aid being afforded at the moment. However, the question must be asked, can we afford not to give this help in terms of justice and equity?  This Bill cannot go through this House and the other House if we do not make available the legal advice and support of solicitors. We have been lobbied by several branches of the legal profession.  I ask them to help in this matter, as Deputy Taylor and Deputy Skelly requested also.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 19, Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa have referred to the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1982.  All of us hope that people will not be in detention for long enough to need help.  The question must be asked if there is an appropriate network in rural areas to enable the suggested panel of solicitors to operate within easy access of a detention centre. In Dublin we are inclined to regard this city as the centre of the world but there are Garda stations outside Dublin and we must ask if there will be a network of free legal aid centres operating in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must give people equality of opportunity to be represented when they are detained and this Bill will not do that unless we have available a panel providing free legal aid.  It is pointless to talk about regulations now.  In the future debates we will have on regulations, attention will be focused on this area and I hope that by the time the regulations <Col N="1738" /> are discussed and agreed here the network we are asking for will be established. We cannot have a situation that a citizen will be denied his legal rights and support, as mentioned by Deputy Skelly. We should never base our system of justice on whether people can afford legal aid.</P>
    <P>We have referred already to the sense of alienation, fear and disorientation experienced by people when detained. The most reassuring presence such people could have is some qualified person whom they know will be able to represent them properly in an area of which they know very little and of which they may be fearful.  We cannot emphasise too much the special circumstances and the psychological pressures of people in such situations.  Equity and justice demand that they get the necessary support at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome both amendments. I and other Deputies raised this matter on other Stages and we spent some time discussing it on Committee Stage.  Perhaps the amendment of The Workers' Party was pinched from an idea I had, or it may be that we were thinking on the same lines.  Amendment No. 19 is unexceptional in that what it is asking is that if a person is detained in a Garda station and if he cannot name a solicitor he should be given a list of solicitors on the legal aid panel.  I do not see any strong reasons for objecting to that.  The Minister has a different problem having regard to the way the legal aid system stands at the moment.  Under the 1962 Act the criminal aid legal scheme does not extend to people detained, they have to be charged with an offence.  The amendment tabled by The Workers' Party would make available to a detained person a list of solicitors, presumably with addresses and phone numbers.  In this way a solicitor could be contacted by the person detained in a Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is suggested is desirable but it would not extend free legal aid or criminal legal aid to the person detained because the solicitor concerned would not go to the Garda station as a member of the criminal legal aid panel because no <Col N="1739" /> fee would be paid to him.  The difficulty referred to by Deputy Skelly would still exist, namely, whether a solicitor would attend at a Garda station in those circumstances if the criminal legal aid scheme was not extended.  I do not know but I anticipate that the majority would attend.  I hope the Minister will consider seriously this amendment.  His original worry in this area was with regard to the financial problems concerning the scheme.  Acceptance of the amendment would not extend the scheme financially but would merely provide a facility to make available a list of names of local solicitors who practise in the area of criminal law.  I hope the Minister will consider seriously accepting the amendment but it still leaves the problem because it does not extend the criminal legal aid scheme as such.</P>
    <P>Members who spoke here this afternoon and in previous debates on the Criminal Justice Bill have pointed out that the problem is that for some people the right of access to a solicitor is more theoretical than real because they may not have the wherewithal to pay for a solicitor.  I suggested to the Minister that he would consider on Committee Stage the possibility of extending the criminal legal aid scheme specifically to deal with the position where somebody is being detained, so that they could get assistance under that scheme.  However, I see a problem in that area as the criminal legal aid scheme is based on a means test and is not available to those who can fully and properly afford to pay for legal advice.  I can see the Minister having a problem in extending it to anybody who is detained. If that was done without a means testing mechanism, many people who could afford to pay for legal aid would benefit under this scheme.  Of course that would apply to a very small proportion of people; the majority of criminal prosecutions take place with people being represented through the criminal legal aid system.  It is important to ensure an equality of justice and protection in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods's amendment regards it as a charging section although I do not <Col N="1740" /> think you can formally table amendments that would be regarded as a charge on the Exchequer.  I am not sure about the technicalities but I think he intends, through his amendment, to extend the legal aid system to people in detention. This is a lacuna in the law which can cause a problem.  If we provide for the right of access to people in detention and for an obligation on the Garda to telephone or make contact with a solicitor named by someone, that is fine for those who know solicitors and can afford to pay their fees but it is no help to those who do not know solicitors and cannot afford their fees.</P>
    <P>Initially, I would like to see the Minister adopting Deputy De Rossa's amendment.  I do not know if the Minister can accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Woods because it is somewhat vague and does not seem to be in the context of the Criminal Legal Aid Act, 1962.  It seems to be a separate provision under this Act.  He is talking about making regulations and the Minister should seriously consider this area.  I understand his reservations and concern but there is also concern that there will not be equality of justice or of access to the law in the context of people being detained and that if we provide that equality at the charge stage, we will not be providing it at the detention stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that these amendments have given us an opportunity to voice our concern in these areas and possibly given the Minister another opportunity to hear them being aired and to consider them with a view to looking again at the Criminal Legal Aid Act, 1962, to see how it can accommodate the new situation which arises with the detention provisions in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputies who contributed here moved from a premise that the Bill is providing for access to a solicitor for detained persons as one of the safeguards in the Bill.  Of course that is not so.  This Bill is not providing for the right of access to a solicitor because this right exists already and case law has established that.  What is being provided here is the right to be informed of one's right of access to a <Col N="1741" /> solicitor, which is a different thing.  I make that point because Deputies are carrying the argument forward on the basis that I am willing the ends but that I am not willing the means to those ends. I am not; I am putting an explicit provision in the Bill that people will be informed of their existing legal right of access to a solicitor.  The debate on Committee Stage covered the same ground.  I refer Deputies to columns 205, 207, 228 and 229 of the Official Report of 6 June 1984 when we discussed these matters.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendments put forward by Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Mac Giolla, I do not think it necessary to have such a provision in the Bill.  This is a matter of detail and it can be dealt with adequately, if it needs to be dealt with, as many Deputies think it does, in the regulations relating to the treatment of persons in custody.  What is at issue essentially is that a person who has no solicitor and who does not know one but wants to consult a solicitor should be given the names of solicitors who would be available to attend the Garda station.  However, the amendment refers to solicitors who are on the list drawn up by county registrars under the Legal Aid Act.  These are solicitors who have agreed to provide legal aid for people who are granted legal aid certificates in the courts.  It is not simply a matter of the Garda handing the detained person such a list.  The people on the list would not have agreed to provide services in Garda stations.  Accordingly, there would have to be agreement in advance on the part of the solicitor that they were willing to attend in these cases.  Some prior arrangements would have to be entered into with the law society and the local Bar association.  I will see what can be done in this regard but I do not think it necessary to write it into the Bill.  It can be done adequately if the legal profession are willing to co-operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no question, in the present financial circumstances, of the State paying out of public funds for the services of solicitors in these circumstances.  It is a very difficult issue and raises questions of principle and the relative priorities in Government spending.  The idea which <Col N="1742" /> was mentioned on Committee Stage and put forward here by way of amendment by The Workers' Party can be achieved in the regulations but it will need the co-operation of the legal profession. Deputy Taylor talked about the noble and fine gesture of the Minister in putting the right of access to a solicitor into the Bill.  Of course I did not but it may be a noble and fine gesture to inform people of the right of access to a solicitor.  Could we not have a noble and fine gesture from the legal profession?  On the question of access to law in general, people below a certain level of income have access to the law because they have civil legal aid and criminal legal aid if they get into trouble. People above a certain level of income can choose to spend that income on legal advice if they wish to bring cases to court but the middle income people are terrified of bringing anything to court on the civil side because they would be liable for enormous legal fees, especially to barristers, and they would not be able to afford it.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 21 which Deputy Woods tabled, as I have said with regard to amendment No. 19, in the present financial circumstances there is little prospect of new services like this being introduced.  Even if financial circumstances were otherwise I do not want to give a view on whether the State should supply this but certainly it is arguable. It is unrealistic, however, to think that there is any real prospect of solicitors giving their services free of charge under such a scheme.  They would be required to attend in uncongenial circumstances and at different hours of the day and night.  I am sure the Incorporated Law Society will take note of the views of Deputies and if the Incorporated Law Society come forward with a scheme, I will give it very careful consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has treated these two very worthy amendments properly.  This is a dreadful Bill and additional safeguards couched in simple language should be put into it.  The Minister has not presented a reasonable argument as to why these two amendments should not be included. <Col N="1743" /> This is a lousy Bill in so many ways and is open to the prospect of abuse.  I support the Garda 100 per cent and what I am saying here is in support of the Garda, but we have to balance the right of the individual and his liberty.  We have an obligation, within our competence as lay people dealing with this type of legislation, to reach perfection in drafting these sections.  I consider this to be one of the dangerous sections where the ordinary citizen will find difficulty both in its interpretation and its operation.</P>
      <P>The Minister draws a very fine line between the suggestion that the section seeks to inform people of their rights and the fact that people are already entitled to representation, but if the Minister is prepared to enshrine in the Bill the fact that people are entitled to information about access to solicitors, is there any reason why he does not accept amendment No. 19 where a solicitor named by a detained person is not available or when the detained person is unable to name a solicitor, the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of the station shall be required to provide him with a copy of a panel of solicitors maintained by the county registrar for that area?  That appears to be a very simple requirement, unless there is a sinister intention behind the amendment which I cannot comprehend at this stage.  If the Minister is prepared to inform the average citizen, surely he is prepared to allow the presiding garda, a servant of the State, to provide him with a copy of a panel of solicitors?</P>
      <P>As Deputy Barnes said in her very worthy contribution, we are dealing with people who are in awe of the law, who are terrified at the prospect of a garda calling to their homes.  Innocent people may be brought to a Garda station in a state of mental trauma.  That is the reality. We should give these people any help we can by providing the information amendment 19 seeks to give.  That amendment is as important and as relevant as section 5 (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Deputy Woods's amendment the Minister shall make regulations providing for a scheme of legal aid for persons <Col N="1744" /> detained pursuant to section 4 so that persons who do not have the financial means to engage a solicitor shall be able to do so.  Of course there are people who can afford to defend themselves. The lower income group and the middle income group, the new poor, would not have the money to defend themselves. The middle income group do not have a buck.  They are put to the pin of their collars to maintain their homes, which are under attack by a spurious house tax proposed by the socialists who contributed damn all to this debate, with the exception of the fleeting, but very worthy contributions of Deputy Mervyn Taylor.  Some form of free legal aid should be available for these people, but if we take social justice into account we may deny them the right of access to legal aid.  There is no way the lower income group can provide for themselves.  The Minister should accept this amendment to improve this dreadful Bill and to make it more comprehensible and more human, if one can use those terms.  We are very concerned about this section and the Minister's attitude to these two amendments.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge our spokesman to support his own amendment because it is very important and, if possible, to support Deputy De Rossa's amendment.  I do not think we should politicise this debate.  We are here to do the best we can, attempting to make this Bill as perfect as possible.  I would prefer not to discuss this Bill but we are stuck with it and we must do what were elected to do, legislate.  We will do the best we can, but the Minister should not come in here with weak arguments.  These two amendments can only do good because they are giving additional information to people who are genuinely afraid of the law.</P>
    <P>I do not go along with the suggestion that the legal profession will not operate this scheme.  There is a very strong tradition at the Bar that where a deprived person does not have the wherewithal to pursue his or her case, more lucrative cases are handed on and that person is given representation.  I have seen this operate.</P>

I am not suggesting for one moment that barristers should be given credit for doing that because they must do it, and they should be seen to be doing it.  Sometimes they do not proclaim their goodness in that regard.  Perhaps the Bar needs a public relations officer to do the job of proclaiming their goodness in helping the deprived in our society.  I have seen barristers representing accused persons day in day out much to their financial embarrassment.  It is not my function to comment on that but I am asking the Minister to reconsider his position in relation to these amendments. He has been extremely reasonable on other sections of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a number of the points made on these amendments. The purpose of our amendment is to ensure that a person in detention would have access to a solicitor.  We were anxious to table an amendment that legal aid would be provided but were of the opinion that it would be ruled out of order and we were anxious to have a debate on the section.</P>
      <P>The important thing is that the panel of solicitors under the 1982 Act is readily available in regard to criminal law.  I said on Committee Stage that most of the solicitors known to the majority of people who will be detained under this Act are experienced in conveyancing, house purchase and so on and do not have interest or experience in the practice of criminal law.  Such solicitors would not be expected to respond to calls for assistance under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by the Minister to the effect that he is not creating anything new here in relation to access to solicitors is not very valid.  Section 4 gives power of <Col N="1746" /> detention and the fact that it exists in the Act will have fairly wide effects.  Therefore, it is only reasonable that we should include in it as much protection as possible for ordinary citizens.  It has been said that Deputies are not here to defend hardened criminals but the rights of innocent persons who become caught up in the procedure of this law.  Habitual criminals will be well acquainted with solicitors who would be available to act for them and will not be affected one way or the other by our amendment.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to ensure that persons brought to Garda stations for the first time under the provisions of the Act will not be at a loss to know whom to contact and therefore the Garda should have a list of criminal lawyers which can be handed to such persons.  I do not accept that the Minister must have an arrangement with the Bar Council or whichever society run these things.  The list is there under the 1982 Act and the solicitors on it are active or they would not be on the list.  Therefore I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.  Its proposals could be included in the regulations, but the Minister has not given us an assurance that it will be so included, he said he will look at it.  I would be happy if he had said he would include it during the debate in the Seanad.  I will be pressing my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this is a matter for the regulations, but as Deputy De Rossa has said, one would have liked a firmer assurance on that.  The purpose of amendment No. 21 is to require the Minister to make regulations.  We put it down because we realised it was a matter for the Minister to make some arrangements and we did not want to tie him down in the Bill. However, we want to require him to make regulations for a scheme of legal aid for persons caught up in this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have prepared his possibilities for the scheme he will adopt and we know that the Law Society have said they will co-operate with the Minister in the making of arrangements under the Act.  This is not necessarily something that should cost a great deal of money. <Col N="1747" /> There are to be a limited number of centres throughout the country in which this type of interrogation will take place. The Minister has to designate them in due course and that should facilitate the making available of solicitors when they are needed at such centres.</P>
    <P>Persons detained may say they are prepared to answer questions but the matter might become serious for them and in that case they should be able to call in somebody.  There is a gap here to the disadvantage of people on lower incomes and it is not fair to say that we will ignore that part of the population in the powers <Col N="1748" /> we are giving.  The Minister did not attempt to deny that but he pointed out that the State cannot consider these matters. We are the State, we make laws for the State and the State will have to do what we say.  We know we have to deal with bureaucracy and that is a problem in our democracy, but it is our duty to try to offset and manage a balance by trying to find arrangements to meet these situations. That is why we could not allow this occasion to pass without looking seriously at the preparation of some sort of scheme.  It is open to the Minister to decide on the form the scheme will take.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) In each divisional area of the Garda Síochána there shall be a Garda Síochána Station designated as a Central Information Office in respect of the detention of persons pursuant to this section.  The Minister shall by regulation make provision for the following matters in relation to such central information offices:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The designation of a Garda Síochána Station in each Garda Division as such office, its functions and administration.</P>
      <P>(b)  The procedures to be followed so that a member of the Garda Síochána concerned with the carrying out of the functions of such office is informed as soon as practicable of the detention or release of a person pursuant to section 4 and the Garda Síochána at which he is detained whether it be the same Garda Station or not.</P>
      <P>(c)  The communication to the Central Information Office by the members concerned with or responsible for the detention of a person under the said section such other information relating to the said detention as the Minister may specify.</P>
      <P>(d)  The keeping of records in the said Central Information Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  The circumstances in which information in respect of the place of detention or any other matter concerning the detention of a person <Col N="1751" /> pursuant to section 4 may be disclosed to other persons and the persons to whom any such information may be disclosed.</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section or in regulations made hereunder shall affect any existing duty or obligation which may exist in law to furnish any such information.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that there will always be information available about anyone who is detained.  We had the suggestion earlier that persons detained should not be moved more than once, that they should not be moved to more than one other station.  This amendment proposes that whatever moves take place for whatever reasons information on the people detained should be available at a central information office in a division, that office to be designated by the Minister in each Garda division.  There have been cases in the past where it was claimed that a person detained was moved from one place to another and that those who were trying to get information had considerable difficulty over a number of hours.  This measure is designed to ensure that the information will be supplied to a central office in the division.</P>
    <P>In any event it will be necessary because the Minister will be gathering statistics about the numbers of persons detained, where they have been detained, the length of time they have been detained and so on.  Certainly this would make quite clear where everybody was and there would be no question of anybody being upset by the fact that they could not find the person involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This amendment proposes to set up a central information office in each Garda division to provide information about detained persons.  The idea is that arresting or detaining Garda would pass on information to the central office about the location of persons detained.  Records would have to be kept, relatives informed and so on.  On Committee Stage I indicated <Col N="1752" /> that I would consider the basic idea in the treatment of regulations I would be introducing. Basically the idea is sound but it is more proper and appropriate to the regulations.  As a matter of fact it is something that operates at present under the internal Garda regulations and is working quite effectively.  It was introduced as a result of a recommendation of the Ó Briain Committee.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy not to press this amendment for inclusion in the Bill. For one thing the drafting will have to be looked at.  I accept its spirit and will certainly consider it for the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>From as much as I could hear of the Minister with the noise in the division lobbies and so on, I understand he has given an undertaking that he will embody Deputy Woods' amendment in the regulations.  From any point of view I expect that that is relatively satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have thought that this was the type of Bill requiring as much information up front as was possible, that it would require comprehensible information readily accessible in the substantive Bill itself rather than having to refer to these regulations.  The amendment is a very reasonable one.  It seeks to ensure that in each divisional area of the Garda Síochána there shall be a Garda station designated as a central information office in respect of the detention of persons pursuant to this section and that the Minister shall by regulation make provision for the following matters in relation to such central information offices and so on.  That appears to me to be eminently sensible, reasonable and practical.  Again it is merely a matter of will.  While the Minister has given undertakings I feel we should stick by our last in this regard and that we should press this matter to a vote. This is another of those amendments which occasioned considerable soul-searching in its formulation in recent days &mdash; I am not taking any credit for that &mdash; but Deputy Woods, Deputy O'Dea and myself spent a considerable period of time together gathering, with the limited services available to us, as much information as we could in order to give some <Col N="1753" /> credibility to our amendments.  With all the defects and inefficiencies of the services available to us in Opposition we have given considerable credibility to the amendments drafted.  We do not have any special knowledge or expertise.  If some amendments appear to be drafted defectively that defect should not devalue our effort at drafting.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister might re-examine Deputy Woods' amendment giving it effect by proclaiming it in the Bill itself.  I do not think it unreasonable that he should do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I heard the Minister say that it was more a matter for regulations but I do not think I heard him give a definite commitment to include this in the regulations he will be introducing. The obligation to allow a person's relatives to establish where he or she is being detained should be central under the powers given in this Bill.  The basic obligation should be contained in the Bill.  The mechanism of how it is to be implemented can easily appear in regulations but the basic obligation should appear in legislation.  If it appears in regulations then a situation could evolve in which a person is taken away for perhaps six or 12 hours without anybody being able to contact him or knowing where he is, nobody being able to locate him.  Even if that obligation appears in regulations the fact that the Garda deliberately bring about a situation in which he or she cannot be contacted will not render any evidence thereby obtained by them inadmissable in a court of law.  The basic obligation on the Garda to make information available as to where a person is being detained should be contained in the primary legislation and the means and mechanism by which it is to be carried out in practice would be more appropriate to regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea has put his finger on the point: that all we are here requiring of the Minister is that he shall make regulations.  This is a central issue and one which, as Deputy D. Andrews has said, has caused us much soul-searching. <Col N="1754" /> In bringing in these new powers and powers of detention and in agreeing with the Minister, as we did earlier, that he may shift a person from one station to another, it becomes crucial then that there be a central information office in a division to which people could apply to find out where a person is and that there would be an obligation to provide the inquiring individuals with that information. That would overcome this problem which admittedly arises only from time to time; I accept that it is an occasional problem only.  But we are here requiring and empowering the Minister to make regulations and showing that it is the view of this House that the Minister should be making regulations.  On a matter as central as this we have no alternative but to press it to a vote.</P>

      <P>In page 6, after line 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where a member of the Garda Síochána proposes to exercise any of the powers conferred by this Section he shall, before doing so, explain to the person concerned in ordinary language the effect of the section including the penalties which the person may incur through failing to comply with a demand for his name and address or for obstructing or attempting to obstruct any members acting under the powers conferred by this section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Basically this amendment proposes that there be provision for a warning in respect of the new penalty of 12 months imprisonment or a £1,000 fine in the event of a person failing to give his name and address.  It would be important for people to know that they could incur such a penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is not easy to argue against the reasonableness of the amendment in principle.  It is, after all, very similar to the &ldquo;ordinary language warnings&rdquo; required to be given under sections 15, 16, 18 and 19.  Indeed it is probable that some gardaí exercising like powers at present would inform persons that they were obliged to comply &mdash; although some might not.</P>
      <P>There are differences, however, between this and the other sections mentioned that I should perhaps allude to.  The sections mentioned are introducing new concepts or at least concepts that have few precedents in law and, accordingly, a person could not reasonably be expected to know that, for example, an inference of guilt could be drawn from failure to account for a mark.  It would be important that communication of this fact would be necessary as we have provided in the Bill.</P>

    <P>Here we are dealing with provisions that have counterparts in other areas of law.  Section 6 is similar to section 7 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, which <Col N="1759" /> applies to section 30 cases.  Therefore, the case for giving this warning is not compelling.  This provision in relation to section 30 cases has applied since the coming into operation of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, and does not appear to have given rise to any difficulties.  The Deputy's proposal would create a precedent for all other areas of law where new offences were being created or new powers given.  For example, in the Bill there is the power to take fingerprints of convicted persons.  To be logical, something similar would have to be included in that respect.  While I would not like to see such a provision included in the Bill but while I can see that a logical case can be made for its inclusion and I will look at it again without commitment between now and the Committee Stage in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been very forthcoming in relation to this section.  We accept his bona fides but at the same time he should not consider himself to be bound by precedent.  It is one of the tragedies of this House that we are so often bound by precedent.  While in some instances precedent may be important it can also make for inflexibility. There is an opportunity for the Minister here to abandon precedent, even if it may be a good precedent, but in order to be consistent the proposed provision should be included in the Bill.  The Minister admits very fairly that it is difficult to argue against the amendment but though he agrees to reconsider the matter between now and Committee Stage in the Seanad, he is saying that he will not commit himself to the proposal.  That is a very honest approach and it is consistent with the Minister's attitude generally to this dreadful Bill.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's undertaking to consider the matter before the Committee Stage is taken in the Seanad.  Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act relates to serious crime, for which there are very special powers.  There was also a schedule of the offences in that case but in respect of this <Col N="1760" /> Bill we are talking about a very wide range of crime and about many people, including very young people, so it would be reasonable to warn people of the new departure whereby they can incur the penalty by failure to give their names or to obstruct the Garda in relation to the other operations outlined.  If a simple warning is given people will know where they stand.  They should be aware that if they are not prepared to give their names and addresses or that if they give false information in that regard they may incur a penalty of 12 months imprisonment or of a £1,000 fine.  I submit that it would be reasonable to include such a warning at some stage so as to ensure that in practice the warning would be given but in the light of the Minister's undertaking I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5) A draft of every regulation proposed to be made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage debate, Deputy Shatter and other Deputies made the suggestion that it would be desirable for these Houses to have an opportunity to consider and debate the proposed regulations regarding the treatment of persons in custody before they were brought into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agreed to consider whether it would be possible to replace the usual procedure whereby regulations are made and continue to have effect unless annulled by a motion passed in either House &mdash; what might be termed the &ldquo;negative&rdquo; form of approval &mdash; by a more positive <Col N="1761" /> mechanism.  What I am now proposing is that the regulations shall be laid in draft form before each House and that they will not be made until each House has passed a resolution approving the draft. Both Houses will therefore be given an opportunity of debating the proposed regulations before they are made.</P>

    <P>It was Deputies Woods and Taylor I think who pointed out during the Committee Stage debate that the original draft was open to a different interpretation in <Col N="1762" /> the case of a person successfully appealing a District Court conviction or where the prosecution had entered a <i>nolle prosequi.</i> I am satisfied, having re-examined the provision that the original draft did not provide for destruction in those two cases.  These are now covered and fingerprints or photographs will have to be destroyed in the same way as on acquittal.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) Where a person is the subject of an order under subsection (1) or (2) of section 1 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907, the destruction shall be carried out at the expiration of three years from the making of the order provided that he has not been charged with an offence during that period.</P>
      <P>(b) Paragraph (a) shall not apply to an order under section 1 (2) of that Act discharged on the appeal of a person against conviction if on appeal his conviction is affirmed.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment takes account of the views expressed by several Deputies during the Committee Stage debate that photographs or fingerprints of a detained person who is dealt with subsequently under the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907, should not be retained indefinitely but should be destroyed if the person did not come before the courts again during a certain period.  Statistics obtained from the Garda show that the level of recidivism among persons dealt with under the Probation Act is high.  For example, out of 4,771 persons dealt with in this way in 1980 some 36 per cent reappeared in the court within three years.  Accordingly, it is my view that the Garda should have these records available to them for at least three years to enable them to deal effectively with crimes committed by persons who are the subject of probation <Col N="1763" /> orders.  Three years is also the maximum period for which a person can be put on probation under the Act.  This is an additional reason for selecting that period.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of the amendment therefore provides that the record must be destroyed at the expiration of three years after the making of a probation order if a person has not been charged with an offence during the period.  The paragraph refers to two subsections of section 1 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907. Subsection 1 relates to probation orders made in respect of a person dealt with summarily against whom the facts of the case have been proved without proceeding to conviction.  Subsection 2 relates to a person who has been convicted on indictment but is given the benefit of the terms of the Act because of the relative triviality of the offence or other extenuating circumstances.  Paragraph (b) of the amendment caters for the position where a person in the latter category appeals against his conviction and the conviction is confirmed by the court of appeal and a penalty of a fine or imprisonment is substituted for the probation or other order made under the Act.  In such a case the records will not be destroyed since the person will have been convicted and punished.</P>

      <P>We welcome this amendment. In the discussions earlier we suggested a two-year period but we accept that three years is a practical gesture on the part of the Minister.  He has given good reason for it in the fact that the maximum probation period can be three years.  It is very welcome to have a stated period after which destruction will take place and that the person who has got the benefit of the Probation Act after that will be taken out of the records.</P>

    <P>This amendment takes account of points made by Deputy Woods on Committee Stage.  It provides for the possibility that photographs or fingerprints taken under section 6 and required to be destroyed may be required by a party to civil proceedings.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In our amendment No. 28 we are concerned with the case where a person who has been arrested and <Col N="1765" /> detained under section 4 in connection with an offence, is within a period of 48 hours subsequently arrested or detained pursuant to section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  The Minister has taken great pains to ensure that there would not be multiple arrests under these sections.  We recognise that fully but there seems to us to be a gap in that when a person has been arrested under section 4 and is subsequently arrested in connection with the Offences Against the State Act, the period combined could go beyond the 48-hour total.  It could be 48 hours plus six or plus 12 or plus 20 depending on what the case might be. This would apply in connection with the first-mentioned offence or, as our amendment No. 28 says:</P>
      <P>(b) in connection with any other offence of which, at the time of his arrest for the prior-mentioned offence the member of the Garda Síochána by whom he was arrested suspected him or reasonably ought to have suspected him,</P>
      <P>the period for which he was detained pursuant to section 4 of this Act shall be taken into account in determining the permissible period of detention pursuant to the act of 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want allowance to be made for the fact that the person had been detained for six hours or 12 hours in calculating the total time detained under the Offences Against the State Act.  This brings us back to the basic contention that no person should be detained longer than the maximum which applies at the moment, 48 hours.  The provisions we are involved with in this Bill allow for different kinds of offences, a wide range of offences having nothing to do with Offences Against the State Act and they should not be related to them.  We accept that in certain circumstances it may arise that information is obtained in the course of a section 4 detention and interrogation which would lead to an arrest subsequently under section 30 of the Act.  We are trying to ensure that if this happens the total number of hours involved in the <Col N="1766" /> detention and interrogation would not exceed 48.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Amendment No.  27a will obviate the need for Deputy Woods's amendment on which I should like to say a few words.  The amendment would seem to be based on a particular interpretation of subsection (1) of section 10.  The interpretation is that it is permissible to arrest and detain a person under section 30 notwithstanding that he may previously have been arrested and detained under section 4.  I think that is wrong because section 10 makes it clear that a person arrested under section 4 and released without charge cannot be arrested again.  This is unqualified and does not refer only to section 4.  It applies to all arrest provisions, to common law provisions, section 30 provisions or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it may be argued that the procedure for rearrest on new information in section 10 could be used to effect the arrest of a person and that he then could be detained under section 30.  This would be based on an interpretation of the last line of subsection (1) which says &ldquo;a person arrested under that authority may be detained pursuant to section 4&rdquo;. On a particular interpretation of &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; it might appear to some Deputies that it opens the possibility for the person to be detained under section 30.  This difficulty about the combination of section 4 and section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act would arise.  The implication would be that he might be detained under section 30 because it is not explicitly prohibited in the form of words used.  I think that is an erroneous interpretation and there is no authority for detaining a person under section 30 to whom the procedure under section 4 has been applied but I think it is better to remove any doubt.  The amendment I am proposing here in page 8, line 33 to delete &ldquo;may be detained&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall be dealt with&rdquo;.  This will make it clear that a person whose arrest is authorised by a district justice under section 10 on new information being provided must be dealt with under section 4.  This prohibits the person being <Col N="1767" /> dealt with under section 30 so that the idea of a possible 48-hour period of detention being additional on a 12-hour period of detention could not arise if the House accepts the amendment.</P>
    <P>One might ask what does &ldquo;dealt with&rdquo; mean.  It means taken to a Garda station and, if appropriate, detained there for the purpose of the investigation.  &ldquo;May&rdquo; is mentioned in the present draft rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It could happen that a person who was rearrested on the authority of a district justice might not be detained under section 4.  It could happen that when rearrested he would say he committed the offence and when taken to the station the member in charge would decide there were no grounds for detaining him for the purpose of the investigation. In that event he would be charged straight away and brought before a peace commissioner or district justice.  That is why &ldquo;may&rdquo; was in the original draft.  It was not an attempt to give alternatives to the Garda to use section 4 or section 30. It was to allow for the possibility that a person could be rearrested, taken to a Garda station and immediately charged. He would not have to be dealt with under section 4 because no investigation process would be involved.  This amendment removes any doubt there may have been in relation to the section and it obviates the need for Deputy Woods's amendment which is intended to achieve the same result.</P>

      <P>In page 9, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) Where a person has failed to appear before a Court in answer to his bail and the Court has directed that a warrant be issued for the arrest of that person by reason of his failure to <Col N="1769" /> answer his bail, a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest such a person notwithstanding that he does not have the warrant in his possession at the time of the arrest.</P>
    <P>(5) Where a person is arrested pursuant to subsection 4 the member arresting him shall as soon as practicable produce and serve on said person the said warrant.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is something the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors were keen on.  It deals with someone who has refused to turn up to answer bail.  They are already within the court system.  They know their position very well and know that it is their duty to turn up in response to bail but refuse to do so.  If a Garda on the beat sees the person, he must get the warrant to serve it on the person in order to comply with the law.  The person may abscond or not be available when the Garda comes back for him.  Another garda might see him in a different part of the country or city and would not have the warrant.  In those limited circumstances it seems reasonable that a garda should be empowered to arrest the person without having the warrant in his possession.</P>
    <P>I have heard of gardaí being told that a warrant was ready for such-and-such a person.  They often hear this on their car radios and are asked to collect it.  That is fair enough if it is in the first instance where a person is being arrested but if a person has been through the system and refuses to answer bail it would seem reasonable that gardaí should be able to arrest him and then serve the warrant as soon as practicable.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is a provision which was advocated by the AGSI and is acceptable in principle.  It would be better to have a general provision to cover any case where a garda knew there was a warrant in existence for a person's arrest but did not have it in his possession when he came across the person concerned.  My intention was to include it in a Miscellaneous Provisions Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> This amendment does not go far enough to meet the general problem. There are examples of other cases where the problem would arise, for example, if an extradition warrant was out for a person or a warrant was granted on the basis that a person was about to abscond.  The amendment is confined to cases where a person fails to answer bail and the court issues a bench warrant.  There are other cases which need to be covered.</P>
    <P>It has not been possible to check out the Deputy's draft with the draftsman. We have had good co-operation throughout the debate.  I will accept the amendment as drafted on the understanding that I will replace it with a more general amendment in the Seanad to take account of the other cases I have mentione.</P>

      <P>In page 9, before Section 14, to insert the following new Section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.  &mdash; Section 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, is amended by the addition of the following subparagraph (g) to subsection (1) of the said Section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g) an offence under section 15, of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, and of an offence of conspiring or attempting to commit any such offence under the said Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose here again is to ensure that where bail applies the persons concerned <Col N="1771" /> under this section, which deals with distribution of, pushing and dealing with drugs as at present defined who are brought to court for such offences must apply to the High Court for bail.  This is reasonable because we are dealing with bail and with the revision of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  There have been a number of instances where bail applications have had to go to the High Court. There was a long discussion on this subject on Committee Stage and we are fairly agreed that we should look fairly closely at cases which involve distribution of, or dealing in drugs.  This amendment would ensure that the godfathers and big dealers would go to the High Court before obtaining bail.</P>
    <P>As the Minister saw it earlier, the problem was that people pushing drugs at a lower level would be drawn into this net but there does not seem any way over that difficulty.  The definition is that which applies under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  That is there, obviously, for a good reason and is an appropriate definition. Perhaps there would be nothing wrong in the lower distributors of drugs having to come before the High Court. In any event, when looking at the question of bail this is one aspect which could be re-examined.</P>

I accepted that there was some merit in it but thought that it would be more appropriate to the Misuse of Drugs Bill before the House.  Since then we have been in communication with the Department of Health.  We referred to the debate and asked them to consider the matter.  The response of that Department was that their Minister would not be moving an amendment to deal with this on Committee <Col N="1772" /> Stage.  They had taken legal advice and could see no way of separating the more heinous offences under section 15 from the less serious.  That is the real difficulty with this amendment.  Section 15 creates what are known colloquially as hybrid offences &mdash; that is offences for which people may be tried summarily or on indictment.  Section 27 (3) specifies the penalties.  It is the DPP who decides whether to prosecute summarily in the District Court or on indictment before a judge and jury, depending on the seriousness of the case.</P>
      <P>The maximum penalties for an offence under section 15, when it is tried summarily, are at present £250, or 12 months' imprisonment, or both.  This is being increased under the amending Bill to £1,000, or 12 months' imprisonment, or both.  I understand that in practice quite a number of these cases are tried summarily in the District Court.  It would seem to be incongruous that a person charged with a summary offence in the District Court should have to go to the High Court for bail.  It appears wrong to classify a summary offence with that of murder or treason in this way.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that at the other end of the offence one gets the godfathers of the godfathers of the drugs market and serious offences are involved.  The difficulty arises from the fact that quite a number of offences under section 15 are tried in the District Court and the summary offences about which I am speaking are those which carry a 12 months maximum sentence.  I shall examine the matter if anyone can come up with a useful suggestion as to how we could separate the more serious drug pushing from the less serious offence.  At the moment I must reject the amendment for the reasons which I have outlined.  There is a real problem in trying to find a solution to the genuine concern expressed by Deputy Woods.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says in this respect.  The definition is the current one under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  I agree that it would require more time to look for a suitable definition to take out the major dealers and distributors <Col N="1773" /> and to ensure that these, who are often thought of as godfathers, would go before the High Court.  We are caught with the difficulty of a definition which has gone before us and which perhaps needs reconsideration.  I have not had sufficient time to consider it now, but I agree with the Minister that the best way to approach the matter would be to look at that definition.  It is appropriate to this Bill because we are talking about criminal procedure and the question of bail.  We should try to reach a definition which is tenable and which meets the requirements of both sides of the House and would have the support of both sides.  It would be our objective that those who are dealing in any major way in drugs would have to go before the High Court and would come under the most stringent assessment before being granted bail.  I accept what the Minister has said in this respect and withdraw amendment No.  30 in view of that.</P>

      <P>It is agreed.  I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 15, after &ldquo;he may require&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;subject to subsection (2)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This involves inserting &ldquo;subject to subsection (2)&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;he may require&rdquo; in relation to the withholding of information.  Amendment No. 32 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Nothing in this section shall require the person referred to in subsection 1 to give information concerning his spouse.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter on Committee Stage. As it stands, the section requires a spouse <Col N="1774" /> to give information under penalty. Admittedly the penalty has been reduced.  We regard this as an unnecessary intrusion into the privacy of the married relationship.  We feel that it is undesirable and unnecessary.  This section deals with withholding information regarding firearms or ammunition.  It is giving the Minister considerable power and it is unnecessary to enter into the husband and wife relationship.  We know the information cannot be used, that the husband cannot give evidence against the wife.  That is still the position, but this section would require the spouse to give information under penalty of 12 months in jail or £1,000 fine.  This is a very undesirable development and a retrograde step.  The Minister will get a great deal of information in other ways as we will see under section 16.  We are not in favour of this development.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 37 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 11, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Nothing in this section shall require the person referred to in subsection 1 to give information concerning his spouse.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This relates to the withholding of information regarding stolen property and will have a much wider application.  The individual will be required under pain of similar penalty to give information about the spouse.  The section makes it an offence to withhold information regarding stolen property.  We go along with that, and welcome it.  The fact that it also applies to the husband and wife relationship is undesirable, and we feel we should not be intruding into the privacy of marriage. The law does not support that in relation to the giving of evidence in general. We should not do it here either.</P>
    <P>Information might be given falsely to make mischief and difficulty.  Elsewhere in the House we have been discussing the problem of broken marriages which has developed enormously and grown very extensively.  One spouse might have a grudge against the other, but the fundamental principle of an intrusion into the <Col N="1775" /> privacy of marriage is repugnant and I do not think we should go so far as to create a penalty in that instance.</P>
    <P>We welcome the other amendments and the effect they will have.  The Minister has two amendments, No.  33 and No.  39.  The sentence was five years and the fine was £10,000 for not supplying information about a spouse.  The five years brought it within the category of section 4 and arrest on suspicion and detention for a number of hours.  The Minister is removing that from the provision in regard to withholding information regarding firearms and ammunition and withholding information regarding stolen property.  Presumably when he is speaking he will tell us why he is taking this step.  It will take it out of the area of arrest and detention of suspicion.  That is desirable in the husband and wife relationship. The Minister will tell us more about it when he speaks on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to take amendments Nos.  33 and 39 first and then come back to the amendments in the name of Deputy Woods &mdash; Nos. 31, 32, 36 and 37.  The amendments I am proposing make the offence introduced in both sections purely summary offences.  It will be a summary offence to fail or refuse to give information when required about the source of illegally held firearms or stolen property.  The amendments arise out of the discussion we had on Committee Stage.  I am sure people have a clear memory of that discussion on sections 15 and 16 as they are now numbered.</P>
      <P>On that occasion a number of points were raised of which perhaps the most important were: first, that the sections could compel spouses to disclose, under threat of very severe penalties, communications made during marriage whereas they cannot be compelled to do so in criminal proceedings in court.  Second, because provision is made for a penalty of five years imprisonment on conviction on indictment, the person concerned could be detained under section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the possibility of disclosure <Col N="1776" /> of communications made during marriage, I appreciate the concern expressed by Deputies about this.  However, there are at least two precedents for such a provision, as I mentioned in Committee. Under section 17 of the Official Secrets Act, 1963, the Garda can be authorised to require a person to give information relating to an offence or suspected offence under section 9 of that Act.  Failure to comply with the requirement or knowingly to give false information is an offence punishable on summary conviction. Section 107 (4) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, is another example.  The registered owner of a vehicle may be required by the Garda to say who is actually using the vehicle at the time an offence under the Act involving the vehicle is reasonably believed to have occurred.  That could be a minor driving offence or a charge involving the death of one or more people.  It could be a manslaughter offence, in effect.  Again, it is a purely summary offence not to give the information. In neither case is there any exception or other special provision so far as a spouse is concerned.</P>
    <P>Another example which I referred to on Committee Stage was section 2 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, which dealt with the power to question a person found near the place of commission of a scheduled offence but that may not be as appropriate a precedent as the other two I have mentioned.  By making the offence under sections 15 and 16 a purely summary offence I am bringing the sections into line with these provisions.</P>
    <P>Moreover, there is no question of any interference with the provision in the existing law that a spouse cannot be compelled in criminal proceedings to disclose any communication between the spouses during the marriage.  Indeed there is a specific provision prohibiting information given by a spouse in compliance with these sections being used in evidence against either spouse in any criminal proceedings except, of course, proceedings for the offence of knowingly giving false or misleading information.  I should mention also that the non-compellability of spouses to disclose in court communications <Col N="1777" /> made during marriage does not extend to information otherwise acquired by them about each other.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I referred to the broader implications of this question and it may be no harm to mention them again. The problem is to keep a reasonable balance between two important principles: the need to get information about suppliers of firearms and dealers in stolen property and, on the other hand, the reasonable need to protect marriage. There is a conflict of principles between the sanctity of marriage and, in the case of firearms, the sanctity of human life. Larceny and trading in stolen goods can frequently become a family business. Where does one draw the line?  The sections require information to be given unless there is a reasonable excuse.  What is a reasonable excuse is a matter for the courts to decide and they will decide it in the particular circumstances of each case.</P>
    <P>The second main point made on Committee Stage was that liability to a penalty of five years imprisonment would make a person liable to be detained under section 4.  That is not the case because detention applies only where a person has been arrested without warrant and there is no power to do so under sections 15 and 16.  However, making the offence purely summary will remove any practical possibility that they could at any future time attract the detention provisions. By making the maximum penalty 12 months, any fears of any Deputy that the detention section would apply have been removed.</P>
    <P>I repeat the objective of sections 15 and 16 is to help to trace the source of supply of illegally held firearms or ammunition and to do something effective about enormous trade in stolen goods which is nothing short of scandalous at the moment.</P>
    <P>What I have said when moving my amendments is appropriate.  I am making the offence purely summary.  It is lining it up with other information-gathering provisions in the existing law where there is no such exlusion for spouses or exception for information involving spouses. This has caused no problems in the laws I have enumerated.  The one most <Col N="1778" /> frequently invoked is the road traffic legislation but I have never heard an argument that the provisions to disclose information which does not exclude a provision about one's spouse has put any particular strain on the institution of marriage.</P>
    <P>The sections here prohibit the use of information in any criminal proceedings against a spouse, apart obviously from the offence under the section.  We have to protect the institution of marriage and I share the concern of Deputy Woods on that point but we have a constitutional obligation placed on us also.  By its laws the State must protect as best it can every citizen from unjust attack and in the case of an injustice done it must vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.  There is the conflict here between the sanctity of marriage on the one hand and the right to life and property which are guaranteed under the Constitution.  It is up to us to make the choices.</P>
    <P>The main difficulty regarding the amendment tabled in the name of Deputy Woods is that it nullifies the two sections in so far as they relate to a married person. If I accept the amendment, a husband has simply to say to the garda, &ldquo;If I give information about that gun or about that stolen property I incriminate my wife&rdquo;, and the same could apply to the wife.  In effect, the sections would be useless in relation to married people.</P>
    <P>In the light of Committee Stage debate, I have made these offences purely summary in the hope that this may help Deputies to decide on the matter. We have to make a choice.  There is an obligation under the sections to provide information and that obligation is to provide it <i>simpliciter.</i> There is no immunity given to the person providing the information. A person can give information about himself.  There is no immunity given either with regard to giving information about one's spouse, children or parents. This raises another question, whether we should extend it to family relations.</P>
    <P>If I accept the amendment the sections will not work because there would be too easy an excuse for the person involved. <Col N="1779" /> This is especially so in the case of stolen goods.  We all know that frequently it is a family racket, where husband and wife are involved in the trade in stolen goods. It must also be pointed out that the statement made is not admissible in evidence against a spouse.  While one is required to give information about a spouse, that statement is not admissible in evidence if a charge is taken against a spouse.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can go beyond what I have done.  I have listened carefully to the debate and I have given the matter much thought.  The reduction in the penalty is the best I can offer and I hope it satisfies the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister has gone a long way in what he has done. That aspect was the most obnoxious part of the Bill as it stood in that the offence carried a sentence of five years and it brought the whole matter into the area of arrest and detention on suspicion.  Once a garda had information he had the basis for such arrest and detention on suspicion and in a marital situation that could cause much difficulty.  We made that point on Committee Stage and the Minister accepted it.  He has taken much of the sting out of the provision.</P>
      <P>Of course the section would work without taking in the husband-wife relationship because as far as they are concerned all other relationships would be open to the provision and the penalty being introduced. Section 1 (c) of the Criminal Justice (Evidence) Act, 1924, states:</P>
      <P>the wife or husband of the person charged shall not, save as in this Act mentioned, be called as a witness in pursuance of this Act except upon the application of the person so charged:</P>
      <P>Section 1 (d) states:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall make a husband compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during the marriage, or a wife compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during the marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has been the law since 1924.  We are <Col N="1780" /> changing that position and making it an offence not to give information regarding the wife or husband, as the case may be. I accept that the Minister has lessened the impact greatly by making it a summary offence but I still feel uneasy about it because it is an intrusion into a wide-ranging area.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Official Secrets Act and we know that there are not many cases where this applies although perhaps nowadays they are increasing. The Road Traffic Act and the Offences Against the State Act are very specific but this relates to the wide area of information regarding stolen property, firearms or ammunition or parts of firearms or ammunition.  It is very far-reaching and we must be concerned in case it leads to difficulties.  However, I accept that the Minister has difficulties and appreciate the point he is trying to make. He has our full support in these two sections and in relation to firearms, I was a little concerned about removing the five-year sentence in relation to firearms information.  I mentioned on Committee Stage that if it was a four-year sentence it would remove out of the special provisions of this Bill and enable it to be dealt with in another way and avoid the arrest on suspicion.  In that respect in relation to firearms it may have been better to do what I suggested &mdash; to exclude the husband-wife relationship and to leave a fairly stiff penalty there otherwise.</P>

      <P>In page 10, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Before complying with a requirement made under subsection 1 the person concerned shall be entitled to consult a solicitor provided he takes reasonable steps to do so as soon as practicable&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This applies to the question of withholding information of either firearms or stolen <Col N="1782" /> property.  Under subsection (1), if a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence consisting of stealing, fraudulent conversion or embezzlement or unlawful obtaining or receiving of money or other property has been committed and finds any person in possession of any property and has reasonable grounds for believing that the property referred to includes or may include property referred to in paragraph (a) and informs the person of his belief, he may require that person to give him an account of how he came by the property.  We are suggesting that if a person wishes to consult a solicitor before giving the account he should be entitled to do so provided he takes reasonable steps to do so as soon as practicable and that it is not a device to delay.  That relates to amendments Nos. 34 and 38. Amendment No. 35 is another way of coming at the same problem, that where a request is made it will not be regarded as a failure or refusal to give information. We are also trying to ensure that it would not be regarded as failing to give information if you ask to see a solicitor and take reasonable and practicable steps to do so quickly.  Amendment No. 40 is similar to amendment No. 35 regarding the withholding of information regarding stolen property.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 43 reads: &ldquo;In page 12, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following&rdquo;.  This refers to the inferences from a failure or refusal to account for objects, marks and so on and to a person's alleged refusal to account for an object or a mark under the inferences section.  In our view, it should not be considered a refusal if the person says he is prepared to tell about the mark or the object but wants to consult his solicitor before giving that account.  We think this is reasonable because people will not wish to incriminate themselves or others by giving a wrong impression.  If one consults a solicitor before giving the account one is advised of one's rights, the type of account one should be giving and what is required.  A person of whom a request is made should be entitled to consult his solicitor before giving the account requested.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment is similar.  It suggests that in page 12, between lines 13 and 14, the following be inserted:</P>
    <P>(4) A request to consult a solicitor before replying shall not be taken as failure or refusal to comply with this section.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 48 deals with a new subsection (2).  One amendment deals with accounting for a mark and the other is accounting for the accused's presence at a particular place.  Before giving an account of why he was in a certain place at a particular time, the accused should be entitled to consult his solicitor and this should not be regarded as failure to give an account.  Amendment No. 49 is also tied into this area.</P>
    <P>Our intention in putting down these amendments was to ensure that, if someone says he wants to speak to a solicitor before giving an account, that will not be regarded as either withholding information regarding arms or stolen property or as failure or refusal to account for a mark or an object or for being at a particular place at a specific time.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 35 and 40 are to sections 15 and 16.  Section 15 deals with withholding information regarding firearms or ammunition and section 16 deals with information regarding stolen property.  Amendment No. 44 refers to section 18, the section from which inferences will be drawn if a person refuses to give information or fails to reply to questions relating to objects or marks of clothing and so on.  Amendment No. 49 relates to section 19 which refers to inferences which can be drawn for a person's failure to reply or refusing to give information about his presence at a particular place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of our amendments is to ensure that a person is aware of his right not to incriminate himself.  On Committee Stage the Minister indicated that a person was entitled not to incriminate himself.  He also indicated that he would consider including a reference in the caution <Col N="1784" /> given by the Garda in these circumstances indicating that a person had the right to consult a solicitor before replying. We put down these amendments to enable us to raise this matter again, to find out if the Minister has made any progress in this area and if not, if he intends to proceed with the suggestion made.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 relate to the original section 16 which was withdrawn from the Bill because it was a major attack on a person's right to silence.  Sections 15, 16, 18 and 19 retain this diminution of a person's right to silence.  It is important that a person is aware of his right to consult a solicitor and not to incriminate himself.  I hope the Minister will take steps to ensure that that is the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Some consideration should be given to meeting the proposals in the various amendments having regard to the fact that the sections sought to be amended are so wide ranging in extent that an innocent person in certain circumstances could reasonably require guidance from his legal adviser as to what his position would be.  Take, for example, a section 16 situation.  In theory there could be an appalling infringement of a person's basic rights.  The section talks about a member of the Garda Síochána having reasonable grounds for believing that an offence was committed and that a person was in possession of stolen property.  A garda arriving on the doorstop of your home with reasonable grounds for believing an offence was committed and the goods were stolen will ask you to account for all the property in your home.  Would a person be held, within the meaning of subsection (2), to have a reasonable excuse for not giving an account?  It might be quite a troublesome matter to give a proper account of how and where you got all the property in your house.  It could require some considerable research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would that be a reasonable excuse within the meaning of the subsection? That is what is involved in the expression &ldquo;if that person fails or refuses without reasonable excuse&rdquo;.  I should like to be told about what a reasonable excuse envisages.  A person may be completely <Col N="1785" /> innocent and know nothing about stolen property and he might be forgiven for thinking he would have a reasonable excuse for sending the garda off about his business &mdash;&ldquo;What are you doing here?  I am innocent, I am not involved, some mistake has been made, some false information has been fed to the Garda.&rdquo; Would that be a reasonable excuse?  Very likely it would not be and such a person, who has done nothing, conceivably could find himself held.  For failing to give a reasonable excuse he has committed an offence, not of stealing or receiving property but of refusing to give information.</P>
    <P>Surely such a person in those circumstances must be allowed legal guidance as to what his position would be.  Indeed the legal adviser might well find himself in difficulty in interpreting the extent of the subsection.  The sections are very wide-ranging and in certain circumstances that could constitute a very serious infringement of the right to liberty of the individual.  Obviously it is felt that measures of so draconian a nature are necessary, but at least it should be open to a person who is faced with new situations of this nature to get advice as to what his exact position is, as to the extent to which he is obliged to give an explanation of where and how he got his property. Understandably, a person might have great reluctance to do that.  He would feel it is his own affair.  He might have some confidential reason for not wishing to have to disclose to a garda he had never seen before where he got the items in his house.  In most situations there could be a guilty element involved but in some cases that would not be so.  We have to apply our minds to cases in which innocent people would be involved.  Such persons would resent being called upon to explain where they got their own property and would reasonably feel it was nobody's business but their own.</P>

      <P>Taking a summary of amendments Nos. 34, 35, 38, 43, 48 and 49, it seems a request for legal aid would be reasonable, barring what the Minister said in relation to families in crime.  There are many families in crime and perhaps it is those we are talking about.  I suggest <Col N="1786" /> to the Minister that it is families involved in crime who would be best able to answer when confronted with such a situation. They would be the ones most likely to have prepared alibis if alibis were necessary.  If they were involved regularly in crime such a situation would not be unexpected and they would not be unprepared for a visit from the Garda and would be quite adept at answering.</P>
      <P>I am not shocked to learn there are families in crime but I am surprised at the suggested extent of it.  The Minister did not give any details of the involvement of families in crime and I should like to know if he has any information available. That would leave out the instances suggested by Deputy Taylor.  One can think of many situations when it might be advisable not to say anything that might incriminate when there would not have been a crime committed or when the Garda were investigating something which turned out not to be a crime but where some information had been found. It is in such situations that one should be able to get legal advice and I do not see any objection to that being possible.  In Ireland wives often do not know the business of husbands, or <i>vice versa,</i> and one could be completely innocent.  Given the history of husband and wife relationships in Ireland, with the wife being kept in the dark to a great extent &mdash; I find it difficult to believe that that has changed much in the last few years &mdash; I would be interested to hear the Minister's response.  This is a request for the fundamental right to get legal advice unless there are extenuating reasons.  We have the Minister's suggestion that there are many families in crime and this in itself could be a very special problem.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not propose to accept these amendments mainly because I do not believe they are necessary and in some circumstances, given the nature of the sections to which they relate, they could cause insurmountable practical difficulties for the Garda which could defeat the ends for which the provisions in question were designed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These four sections &mdash; two of which, sections 15 and 16 relate to withholding <Col N="1787" /> information and two, sections 18 and 19 to inferences from silence &mdash; are intended to enable the Garda to put questions to people who are found in different kinds of suspicious circumstances.</P>
    <P>Each of these sections, especially sections 15 and 16, are designed to enable the questions to be put &ldquo;on the spot&rdquo;. The particular language used in the sections makes that very clear.  Section 15, for example, deals with persons found in unlawful possession of firearms.  When a garda finds a person in unlawful possession of a weapon more often than not that will be in some place other than a Garda station, in a car at a side of the road or at the scene of a crime.  The same is true of section 16 which is structured similarly but deals with stolen property.</P>
    <P>It makes no sense to give the Garda a power to seek information from persons found in very suspicious circumstances if, at the same time, the person can refuse to answer a question until he consults a solicitor.  The purpose and object of the sections could be completely negatived and rendered ineffective if that were the case.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 impose a legal obligation on a person to give certain information. He must give the information unless he has a reasonable excuse for not doing so.  What would constitute a reasonable excuse is not and cannot be defined but must be judged in relation to the circumstances of each case.  Deputy Taylor put the question to me, what is a reasonable excuse?  A reasonable excuse is an excuse that the court would find reasonable if charges are pressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not prepared to attempt to define.  It is a matter I want to leave to the courts because they can assess the situation in the light of different circumstances.  If one tried to enumerate reasonable excuses they could be taken out of context. An excuse which would be reasonable in one set of circumstances might not be reasonable at all in a different set <Col N="1788" /> of circumstances.  The court will decide on that.  I presume after some initial decisions somebody will be in a better position than I to decide what the courts will take into account.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to envisage circumstances in which it would be reasonable to refuse to give information before consulting a solicitor &mdash; certainly in circumstances where the person was found on the spot with a weapon and where there might be urgency about finding out about it and great delay in getting a solicitor a court might well conclude that it was not reasonable to refuse and, accordingly, that the information should have been given.  It seems to me, therefore, that it would be wrong to say that a refusal to give information before consulting a solicitor should always be treated as excusable and not amounting to a failure or refusal.  There would be bound to be a case where it would be so and, correspondingly, there might well be cases where it would not.  I believe, therefore, that we should not tie the hands of the Garda in this way and pre-empt the role of the courts.  It is far better that the matter should be decided on the basis of the circumstances of each case.  If the person is charged with the offence of failing or refusing to give the information it will always be open to him to put forward as part of his defence that he asked to consult a solicitor and that, therefore, he did not fail or refuse within the meaning of the statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the last amendments were accepted we are talking now about offences that carry a maximum of 12 months rather than the original proposal in the Bill which carried a maximum sentence of five years.  That may colour Deputies' attitudes to these amendments.  Somewhat different considerations arise in relation to sections 18 and 19 although broadly the effect of the amendments to these sections is the same.  The essential difference, of course, is that there is no legal obligation in sections 18 and 19 to give information or to answer questions. Under sections 18 and 19 a person does not have to answer.  All that is at issue is that inferences could be drawn in court if the judge decided it was proper to do <Col N="1789" /> so from the silence of the individual. There is no obligation to give information or answer questions there but there is an obligation to account for illegal firearms or property if a person is found in possession of goods believed to have been stolen.</P>
    <P>What is at issue here is whether a failure or refusal to account for some matter ought to give rise to an adverse inference &mdash; whether, in the words of the sections, it would be &ldquo;proper&rdquo; to do so.  Here again, in my view, the argument is the same as that which I have just outlined in relation to sections 15 and 16.  It would be for a court to decide, first of all, whether a refusal to account for some matter before consulting a solicitor was a refusal within the meaning of the section, and if it was, whether, in the circumstances, it would be proper to draw an inference.</P>
    <P>We have to bear in mind that a person in custody has a right to consult a solicitor and, obviously, that would be a factor that would be taken into account.  Moreover, it could happen that, following consultation with a solicitor, the person would be advised to say nothing.  In the end the jury would, subject to the judge's directions, be faced with the question of deciding whether failure or refusal to account for the matter at issue could properly give rise to an inference.</P>
    <P>But there could clearly be circumstances in which it would be open to the jury and proper for them to draw an inference notwithstanding that the failure or refusal was due to a request to consult a solicitor and consequently I would not be prepared to accept the amendments.</P>
    <P>The amendments tabled by Deputy Woods are similar.  Basically, the objection to the amendments is that there would be little point in giving gardaí the power to require information about guns and stolen goods if they could be fobbed off with a reply that the person concerned cannot give the information until he or she consults a solicitor.  The person must give the information unless he or she has a reasonable excuse.  It is possible that the court would decide if a person said he must consult his solicitor in certain circumstances that would be a reasonable <Col N="1790" /> excuse.  I am not ruling out that possibility at all but I would hope that in many other circumstances a court would decide that a person saying he was consulting his solicitor when found in possession of an illegal firearm would not be considered to be a reasonable excuse for not giving the information.</P>
    <P>The question of what constitutes a reasonable excuse &mdash; Deputy Taylor drew attention to this &mdash; is an imponderable in the section.  If I was to accept Deputy Woods's amendments I would be introducing a further imponderable into the section.  Elements of it could make it virtually impossible to prosecute anyone for the offence.  The prosecution would have to prove what point in time was &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  This can vary according to the particular circumstances and usually only the defendant can decide how soon it would be practicable to consult a solicitor.  The prosecution would also have to prove that &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; were not taken.  This would introduce imponderables into the sections which might have the result of demolishing the effectiveness of the section.  The two sections are being introduced into the Bill for two specific and serious purposes. First of all, there is the trade in firearms and, secondly, the problem of stolen goods.  Members are aware of those problems.  Anything which could negative the sections completely would not be acceptable to me.</P>
    <P>On the question of the sections dealing with inferences, that is a different matter. There is no obligation on someone to answer questions.  A person can legitimately remain silent.  Whether it would be proper for an inference to be drawn in court or not would be a matter for the judge.  There will be situations where a person remains silent and an inference would not be drawn.  We have already discussed the right of a person to access to a solicitor.  I quoted case law showing that that access to a solicitor can be exercised by a person in private.  A person is entitled to have confidential conversations with a solicitor out of the hearing of the Garda Síochána.  A person detained for six hours and questioned about a particular matter may refuse or fail to give <Col N="1791" /> information required under the sections. The solicitor may arrive one hour or more later and the person may have a confidential conversation with the solicitor. One or two things may happen then.  The solicitor may tell the person that he or she has an obligation under the section to answer the questions or give the information or inferences could properly be drawn in court.  If a solicitor gave that advice he would probably advise the person whether to answer or not.  The solicitor may tell the person that he or she may answer the questions and no interence may be drawn or, on the other hand, in answering the questions the person might incriminate himself, might be better off saying nothing and risk the inferences. The solicitor will certainly enter the scene if a person is detained under section 4.  Whether a court would draw an inference or not is difficult to say.</P>
    <P>Maybe a court would decide that it would not be proper to draw an inference if somebody was advised by a solicitor not to say anything.  That remains to be seen.  Regarding the earlier sections relating to firearms and stolen goods, the amendment suggested by Deputy Woods would provide an excuse whereby the person being questioned could fob off the Garda and not give the information required.  It would be very difficult to prove that the person had committed any offence in doing so.  A solicitor would be available in many cases where a person detained under section 4 would refuse to answer questions.  If someone refused initially and then complied following consultation with a solicitor I do not see how an inference could properly be drawn in court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">

      <P>The Minister said that my amendment if accepted would render useless the requirement on a person to answer certain questions.  The amendment is designed to ensure that where a person responds to a question with the reply that he wishes to consult his solicitor it should not be regarded as a refusal to give information.  Having consulted his solicitor and clarified his legal position, clearly the section would operate if he <Col N="1792" /> continued to refuse.  In my view the amendments I have put down do not negative the effect of the section but protect a person who may be ignorant of the law by giving him the option of consulting a solicitor before replying to questions. The fact that a person would opt to consult a solicitor before replying should not be taken as a refusal or a failure to give information.  The section would continue to operate if, having consulted a solicitor, the person adopted a particular attitude to the questions and an inference could be drawn in relation to sections 18 and 19 if the judge saw fit.  Presumably the Garda can prosecute under sections 15 and 16 if the person fails to give information. I would ask the Minister to accept the amendments because they do not in any way restrict the effectiveness of sections 15, 16, 18 and 19.</P>

      <P>The Minister is on the horns of a dilemma.  The more I listened to what he had to say the more I realised that the section may be unworkable.  We are only trying to provide that a person may ask to see a solicitor so that he can be advised before giving information. The Minister has said it would be up to the courts to decide whether a request to consult a solicitor is reasonable.  Under the law as it stands it probably would be fairly likely that the courts would in such situations regard it as reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to cover that by stating that it should be as soon as practicable. I appreciate the point.  Immediate steps should be taken to consult a solicitor.  In many instances it would be a wise thing to do but in other instances it might not be necessary.  The fact that the sentence has been reduced has a major effect.  We are not talking about arrest on suspicion now, in the five-year instances in any event, for witholding in relation to arms and ammunition and witholding in relation to stolen property. That is very considerably reduced. <Col N="1793" /> The Minister's intention is to enable the Garda to put questions on the spot and to get answers on the spot.  If a person says he will give the answers following consultation with his solicitor, it would seem that such a person would be covered in the courts.  We will have to wait and see how it works in practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 41 to 45, and on page 12, lines 1 to 7, and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;such failure or refusal may be given <Col N="1794" /> in evidence against the accused in any subsequent prosecution against him, in relation to which the failure or refusal is material.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under section 18 (1), where a person is arrested without warrant by a member of the Garda Síochána and there is on his person, clothing, footwear, or otherwise in his possession in any place in which he is at the time of the arrest any object, substance, mark and so on and the member informs the person arrested that he so believes, and requests him to account for the presence of the object, substance or mark, and the person fails or refuses to do so, it is provided:</P>
    <P>then if, in any proceedings against the person for the offence, evidence of the said matters is given, the court, in determining whether to send forward the accused for trial or whether there is a case to answer...</P>
    <P>instead of that wording, our amendment proposes the following:</P>
    <P>such failure or refusal may be given in evidence against the accused in any subsequent prosecution against him, in relation to which the failure or refusal is material.</P>
    <P>This is simply to enter in a positive way the fact that the person has failed or refused to give this information.  On Committee Stage I know that the person has failed or refused to give this information. On Committee Stage I know the Minister said he did not consider that to be adequate, that he wanted to go further with the inferences which could be drawn therefrom along the lines of the section as at present worded.  If the Minister is planning to go further along those lines then my amendment No. 45, which encompasses the safeguards, comes into operation and reads as follows:</P>
    <P>In page 12, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) Any request made pursuant to this section shall be made in writing and given to the arrested person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> (b) The arrested person shall then be informed by the member that he may give his reply in writing or orally and if the latter, his reply shall be taken down in writing.</P>
    <P>(c)  If the arrested person fails or refuses to give any reply to the request made of him, the fact of such failure or refusal shall be recorded by the member in writing.</P>
    <P>(d)  When the reply of the arrested person is recorded in writing, or, where there is no reply, the fact of his refusal or failure to reply is recorded, he shall be invited to sign his name on the sheet or sheets containing the written request and written reply or the written record of his refusal to reply, as the case may be, and if he refuses to sign such written record such refusal shall also be recorded by the member concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these safeguards is to ensure that there will be a proper record of what took place, that there will not be difficulty experienced later, when cases come before the court, in saying that a person failed or refused to account, or gave an account which was inadequate or whatever.  The case I am making now would refer equally to amendments Nos. 46 and 50 which are related in that they are similar but they deal with the next section which relates to the presence of an accused at a particular place.  Therefore, we have the accounting for the object, substance or mark and presence in a particular place and a series of safeguards to be included.  In accounting for a person's presence in a place I had said earlier that if a person said, for example: &ldquo;I was one of those,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I was only one of those who was in the place&rdquo;, or something like that, but later claimed that what he actually said was: &ldquo;well, I was not one of those who was there&rdquo;, or some other variation of those words, there would be very close linkages between statements that might be made at a time like that.  It would be important that there <Col N="1796" /> be clarity on both sides if the Minister is going ahead with this section.</P>
    <P>These are what I would term the safeguards, that the request should be made in writing and given to the arrested person so that they would know what they were asked and refused to answer, or what they did actually answer; that they should be informed by the member that they may give their reply orally or in writing; and that the reply should be recorded in writing so that there is no doubt about what has been said.  There will be a need to have some record, some safeguard in relation to what is said in either of those two cases because of the importance of the inferences which may be drawn subsequently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering if amendment No. 41 places the accused at a disadvantage in all cases because it suggests that the refusal is made material in the subsequent trial whereas under the section, as worded, the court may draw such inferences from failure or refusal as appear proper.  On the other hand they may decide not to do so and that affords an option which is a proper one.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 45 I should like to see as many safeguards as possible incorporated in the Bill because there will be many challenges as to what took place, what was said and what was not said in the case of somebody who is detained, where the provisions of section 18 apply and when inferences can be drawn.  If possible it would be a good idea to tie down these provisions and if that is the intention of the amendment, which I think it is, it seems to be a good one, unless the Minister has some good reason for not wanting that to happen.  The same would apply to amendments Nos. 46 and 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Deputy Woods's first proposed amendment is concerned, on balance, I would prefer the original wording of the section because his amendments Nos. 41 and 46 leave it open to a court to convict a person merely on the evidence of refusal to account, whereas the original wording of the section specifically precluded the court <Col N="1797" /> from obtaining a conviction on that evidence alone and limits it to the possibility of corroboration of other evidence, which the amendments, as proposed by Deputy Woods, would not do.  Therefore, the original wording of the section is sufficiently severe without taking the matter further, as Deputy Woods's amendments would appear to do, possibly unintentionally.</P>
      <P>So far as the second pair of amendments is concerned, they are reasonable. They do purport to bring a degree of control, formality and record into the operation of this series of sections which are new and far-reaching.  They make some attempt at least to get over what is the hallmark not only of these two sections but also of sections 15 and 16 and equally sections 18 and 19.  There is there a particular combination of words repeated remarkably frequently, that is, in reference to a member of the Garda Síochána having reasonable grounds for believing.</P>
      <P>That constant theme repeats itself throughout all these sections.  A member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing this, that and the other.  It may say that, but when one gets down to ground level in a court of law it amounts to, not that a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing but that the member of the Garda Síochána says that he thinks such and such.  Courts do not follow the practice of having any incisive decision-making as to whether a garda had or had not reasonable grounds for believing such and such.  If he says so, for a court's purposes the practice is that that suffices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it leaves the matter very wide open and imposes a very high degree of power and consequently of responsibility on the members of the Garda Síochána.  They would not be questioned in regard to the basis of their reasonableness in coming to that conclusion. A garda gets into the box and says that he has grounds for believing that such and such a piece of property was stolen, and in practice that is taken as adequate.  Apparently, the House has decided that that is the way it must be. <Col N="1798" /> At least perhaps some measure of formality should be introduced into the organisation of the procedure, and to that end Deputy Woods's second pair of amendments requiring that one should write down exactly what was said, what the response was and so on, is of some value.  The notes taken and the records kept should at any future time be made available to any accused person or his legal representatives.  It is some small safeguard that would in some small measure only, but at least in some measure, balance this very new wide-sweeping incursion into the liberty of the individual. It is the least we could do to try to balance that to some small extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points made by Deputy Taylor and Deputy Skelly regarding amendments Nos. 41 and 46. I would hope that these amendments would give the minimum of safequards at least because of the wide-reaching measures in these sections.  With no fault on either side, grounds for believing could quite easily become a formula that would be so accepted that it might not be challenged. Therefore, I would support the safeguards as outlined.  We come back repeatedly to the question of the need for fairness on both sides, for both the accused and the Garda.  In order to avoid misinterpretation some record should be kept to safeguard the rights on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to refer to amendments Nos. 41 and 46 and then go on to amendments Nos. 45 and 50.  Amendments similar to amendments Nos. 41 and 46 were put down by Deputy Woods on Committee Stage and we had a long debate on them then.  I do not intend to over the same ground again.  The essential point is that the effect of Deputy Woods's amendments here would be that the Garda could give evidence that the accused refused or failed to explain a stain, for example, but no inference of guilt could be drawn from the refusal and the furthest the trial judge could go in commenting on the silence would be to say that it could take from the weight to be attached to an explanation given by the <Col N="1799" /> accused at his trial.  I want a provision in these sections that an inference could be drawn in a proper case, and sections 18 and 19 are needed to do that in the manner in which they are drafted.  Obviously, it would have to be a proper inference.  It would be up to the judge to decide what a proper inference was.</P>
      <P>Again, the question of corroboration was dealt with on Committee Stage and I refer Deputies to what was said on Committee Stage about the use of inference as corroboration.  It is worth pointing out that nobody could be convicted on inference alone.  It would be another piece of evidence which the jury would take into account if the judge thought it proper that they should take that piece of evidence into account when they were assessing some of the parts which made up the totality of the case against the accused.  My objection to Deputy Woods's amendments Nos. 41 and 46 is that they do not allow for an inference to be drawn.  They simply, as in the present situation, would allow a garda to give evidence that somebody failed to explain the stain or the mark.  The furthest a trial judge could go is to advise that it might take away some weight from the explanation given by the accused.  He could not advise that an inference could be drawn.  The common-sense reaction of a juror might be that clearly an inference in common sense was to be drawn and the judge would be in a position, as he is at the moment, to advise the jury to act against their common sense.  I ask Deputy Woods to withdraw those amendments for that reason.</P>
      <P>Regarding amendments Nos. 45 and 50, again on Committee Stage an amendment along those lines was suggested by Deputy Woods and Deputy Taylor.  Even though amendments were not down, we discussed the substantive issue.  I refer Deputies to the Official Report on 19 June 1984, columns 1221 and 1222, Volume 351.  In an interchange with Deputy Woods and Deputy Taylor I said, and I quote as at column 1247:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yes.  I see the point being made by both Deputies and it is quite valid.  I <Col N="1800" /> will give it consideration by including in the treatment regulations a provision which would require the garda to record in the custody records the fact that questions under these sections were asked of the suspect and possibly the nature of his replies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews mentioned the danger of turning gardaí into bureaucrats and said the Bill was bureaucratic legislation.  He referred to various instances where forms had to be filled and notices had to be served on people. This is another example.  However, I will look at the points made.</P>
    <P>That is still my position.  I gave a commitment on Committee Stage that the regulations would have a provision which would require the garda to record in the custody records the fact that questions under these sections were asked.  I pointed out the difficulty of any kind of formal exchange of forms.  The section could be invoked in the middle of the night outside a shop with a broken window or on the roadside.  Somebody could have blood stains on his shirt and a serious crime might have been committed in the neighbourhood.  It does not necessarily happen in the formal setting of a Garda station where forms are available and the formal interchange of documentation can take place.  I see the point the Deputies make.  I think that the better approach here is through the mechanism of the regulations and putting an obligation on the garda to record after the event if he has invoked these sections, and of course he would have to invoke these sections before an inference could be drawn.</P>

Deputy Skelly seems to think that what I am suggesting would tighten the situation but I do not agree, while the Minister tends to be of the opinion that my proposal would weaken his position. I would be more inclined to agree with the Minister but the intention was merely to have the entry made as evidence and to allow the appropriate inferences to be drawn.  However, the Minister is anxious that these inferences be available because they may be the element which tips the scalies in any case.  This is something we discussed at length on Committee Stage.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" />&ldquo;(2) References in subsection (1) to evidence shall, in relation to the preliminary examination of a charge, be taken to include a statement of the evidence to be given by a witness at the trial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These amendments are intended to meet a point made by Deputy Woods in the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>The point is that, in the preliminary examination of an indictable offence, normally the prosecution do not call for evidence to be given on deposition, although the possibility of doing so still exists.  Instead various documents are produced to the justice, including a statement of the evidence that is to be given at the trial by each of the prosecution witnesses, and it is on the basis of these documents that the justice forms an opinion as to whether there is a sufficient case to put the accused on trial.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 &mdash; the &ldquo;inference&rdquo; sections &mdash; require evidence to be given of certain matters before the court can take them into account in determining whether to send an accused forward for trial.  That is clearly a reference to oral evidence and, as Deputy Woods pointed out, it would not cover the statement of evidence contained in the documentation before the justice.  In other words, it would be necessary for the prosecution to have the arresting garda attend and give evidence on deposition about asking the accused to account for objects, marks and so on and his failure or refusal to do so.</P>
    <P>The amendments to these sections therefore provide that a statement of the evidence to be given by the Garda about these matters at the trial and produced at the preliminary examination can be taken into account by the justice when deciding whether to send an accused forward for trial, in the same way as he takes into account statements of any other evidence.</P>

      <P>In page 15, line 40, to delete &ldquo;may be served&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may, subject to subsection (10), be served&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments arise from consideration of Committee Stage amendments in the name of Deputy Woods in which he proposed that a document required to be served on the accused should be served personally and, if he were legally represented, by delivering it to his solicitor.</P>
      <P>Section 21, as it stands, allows a document to be delivered to the accused and his solicitor.  It does not require it to be delivered and it authorises other forms of service, including service by registered post.  However, there is no danger that an accused could be prejudiced by not having a document brought to his attention because subsection (5) gives him the right to apply to the court to require the person who made the statement to attend before the court and give oral evidence.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless I accepted that there was a need to have a requirement of personal service in any case where the accused was not represented by a solicitor, and this requirement is being imposed by these amendments.</P>

      <P>This relates to the question of proof by written statement.  The Minister has gone half way in meeting the proposal I made on Committee Stage and I welcome that.  He indicated then that he would do so but I still think that the document should be served on the accused personally one way or the other and if he is represented by a solicitor that the document should be delivered also to his solicitor.  We are talking about allowing a proof by written statement and with the time scales involved it is important that the person concerned know what is included in the written statement and be fully aware of what is happening.  I can see that from the bureaucratic point of view it would be desirable to send the documentation normally to a solicitor but to the individual when he is not represented. This is a big step ahead and would <Col N="1806" /> cover many instances.  However, I would ask the Minister to think further about it in the context of whether it is desirable in any event to serve such a notice personally on someone.  There can be situations in which the solicitor is not the fastest person to communicate with the individual, with the result that the person may not be fully aware of what is happening. I can appreciate that more difficulty might be created by serving the document both on the individual and on his solicitor but it would be a considerable saving of time so far as the courts are concerned.  We see these measures saving millions of pounds and being very worth while.  I welcome the Minister's two amendments and I appreciate what he is doing and how far he is going to meet the points we make.  I would, however, ask him to look again at the question of serving in all cases personally as well as on the solicitor in considering the matter in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am glad Deputy Woods has accepted my amendment. I shall certainly look again at amendment No. 56.  I think what needs to be pointed out is that the accused would be at absolutely no risk because subsection (5) provides the fail-safe device where the accused person can insist on the evidence being given orally in court which is a party to the proceedings and the court would grant that request. Even if there was some mix-up between the solicitor and the accused, and the accused was not quite sure what the solicitor had done, that would not put the accused at risk but it might reduce the efficacy of the section if it happened frequently.  The purpose of the section is in ease of many people who are party to court cases and it is also in ease of the public purse and will make trials shorter and consequently less expensive.  If the import of the Deputy's case on amendment No. 56 is not that the accused would be at risk but that the section may be less effective without this procedure, I shall look at it again in the Seanad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment of subsection (1) of the section is purely a drafting change and it does not affect the substance of the section.  It makes it clear that the power to take fingerprints will apply in the following circumstances: (a) where a person is charged with an indictable offence in the District Court and the facts are provided where a conviction is not recorded and the person is dealt with under section 1 (1) of the Probation Act, 1907, that is a case dismissed, a person bound to the peace or placed on probation; (b) where the accused is charged on indictment, convicted and is dealt with under section 1 (2) of the 1907 Act, that is where the person is bound to the peace or placed on probation; and (c) where the accused is convicted and is dealt with otherwise than under the Probation Act, for example, by fine, imprisonment or suspended sentence.  The difficulty with the draft as it stands is that it implies that persons dealt with under the Probation Act are not convicted whereas this is only <Col N="1808" /> the case with those dealt with under section 1 (1) of the Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 58 inserts a new subsection (3) applying the provisions of section 8 to fingerprints taken under section 28.  The result will be that fingerprints taken under section 28 from an accused who is dealt with under the Probation Act must be destroyed on the expiry of a period of three years from the making of an order under the Act if the person is not charged with an offence during that period.  Prints will not be destroyed if notice of civil proceedings is given to the Garda Commissioner before the date on which they would otherwise require to be destroyed.  The person or his solicitor will be entitled to witness the destruction of the prints.</P>

Especially on Committee Stage, the debate was a great help to me and in thanking all Deputies I thank Deputy Woods in particular for his co-operation and his contributions through all Stages.  I also thank various other members of the team &mdash; they have almost become a team &mdash; Deputy Barnes, Deputy Skelly and Deputy De Rossa and various other Deputies, Deputy O'Dea and Deputy Andrews who also played a major part in the debate.  Deputy Taylor paid us frequent visits and spoke most incisively.  He was not present as often as others but when he came he was worth listening to.  A number of other Deputies on the Fine Gael side and all around the House made contributions.  There was a lot of criticism of some sections but I think we have ended up with a better Bill than when it was first published.  Whatever the perception of us is outside the House we made an honest effort to do the job for which we are here on this occasion, to act as legislators.  I presume the procedure will continue when I go to the Seanad.</P>

The special measures cannot go anywhere until the autumn until these matters come before the House.  From the outset we supported this Bill in principle and throughout the debate we offered, as far as we could, our constructive views on the different sections.  I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for the way in which he has accepted and reacted to the Second Stage debate, the Committee Stage debate and for the many amendments which he made following those debates.  We saw quite a few further amendments on Report Stage when the Minister brought forward amendments in accordance with the spirit of the debate.  That has helped to make the Bill so much better.</P>
      <P>The Bill in many respects has been something of a classic.  It has received very detailed examination in the House and we have had substantial and sincere contributions from Members on both sides and these have been taken in the spirit in which they were offered to the Minister.  We have also seen the situation that should be noted by people outside the House: many groups outside made major contributions to the work on this Bill and provided us with views from various sides.  That was a very useful exercise in democracy.  We saw the system of pressure groups in the best sense of the word operating and bringing their views to the attention of the representatives in the House and these views then being debated on the floor of the House. We have our reservations but I think we have done the teasing-out of the Bill which it is our duty to do and we will await the complaints procedure and the regulations.  We will give all our time to them when they are brought in and will approach them in the spirit in which we have approached this Bill so that they will add to the Bill.

    <P>I do not object to this change because the present arrangement is cumbersome in that the number of stages through <Col N="1813" /> which the procedure must go take a long time.  If there is a case of irregular prescribing, it should be investigated with a certain amount of speed in the interests of the public generally.  What I am concerned about is that whereas formerly the registration authorities investigated the allegation against the person registered and so had an input into the investigation, now they will have no such input.  I am proposing an amendment which would give such authority an input into the investigation.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (1) of the existing Act states that the Minister may, after consultation with the registration authorities concerned, make regulations in relation to the constitution of procedure of committees of inquiry, advisory committees or advisory panels established pursuant to sections 8 or 9 of this Act.  I am now asking the Minister to change that subsection to read that the Minister may, with the agreement of any registration authority concerned, make regulations, and so forth, giving the registration authorities an input into such committees of inquiry.</P>
    <P>My main concern is to ensure that the committee of inquiry will have some input from the registration authorities or the representative grouping of the professional practitioner involved.  I am aware that at present while the registration authorities do not appoint members of their own authority to these committees of inquiry or to the panel from which the Minister selects the committee of inquiry, they submit to the Minister nominees from the organisation to which the member who is alleged to have prescribed irregularly belongs.  I would ask the Minister to consider that amendment.</P>

      <P>I will make three points to the Deputy by way of response.  First, I would suggest that it may not be necessary to enact this amendment because the existing provisions of section 12 of the 1977 Act are adequate.  Section 12 provides that the Minister of the day may make regulations relating to the constitution and procedure of committees of inquiry following consultation &mdash; and I would stress that &mdash;<Col N="1814" /> with the appropriate registration authority. The existing regulations which come under the Misuse of Drugs (Committees of Inquiry, Advisory Committees and Advisory Panels) Regulations of 1979 were made pursuant to section 12, following consultation &mdash; and I would stress that &mdash; and with the agreement of the Medical Council, the Dental Board and the Veterinary Council.  To that extent, the issue raised by the Deputy in respect of agreement is encompassed, in practice, under the regulations.</P>
      <P>Secondly, all provisions under this Bill as circulated which relate to irresponsible prescribing were, in fact, drafted by my Department in consultation with the three registration authorities which I have just mentioned, namely the Medical Council, the Dental Board and the Veterinary Council.  The provisions of the section were agreed to by them.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, I assure the Deputy that when I bring in the new regulations, which will have to be made under section 12 of the 1977 Act, these will be drafted and implemented in the same way as the 1979 regulations, namely I shall consult with and seek the agreement of the registration authorities concerned.  In that context, with the assurance given, perhaps the amendment may not be pressed at this stage.</P>

      <P>While I accept that the Minister says he will consult with the registration authorities, there is no obligation on him to accept the recommendation or, indeed, to have agreement with them.  The Minister said that himself.  He said the 1979 regulations were agreed with the registration authorities.  I have no doubt that the Minister will, in introducing regulations find agreement with the registration authorities, but we are legislating for a long time into the future and it is possible at some date in the future that a Minister would consult with the registration authorities but then go ahead on his own and introduce regulations which could exclude any input from such registration authorities. What guarantee is there in the future that there would be such agreement with the registration authorities?</P>

      <P>There is one further difficulty to which I wish to allude.  That is, that it has become apparent to us in our consultations with one registration authority, namely the Medical Council, that they are rather loath to be involved in a statutory way because it might, they feel, prejudice their own powers under the Medical Practitioners Act of 1978. There is a problem facing them in that if there is a prerequisite of seeking their agreement, then the legal proceedings relating to the manner in which their agreement was sought and all the evidence relating thereto might become part of consequential litigation in respect of the disciplinary power exercised by the Medical Council.</P>
      <P>The council were anxious &mdash; I should put this on record &mdash; to maintain an arm's length from the Minister of the day in respect of their powers exercised as a self-regulating profession under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.  That is another reason why it is important that we should not enshrine in the Bill a prerequisite for agreement as such.</P>

The Minister must consult them.  It could prejudice their responsibility under the Medical Practitioners Act if they were involved to any great extent. They are involved in consultation and by inseerting the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;, this would ensure that in future there would be agreement with the registration authorities.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 26, after &ldquo;for life&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or such lesser period as the court shall determine, or, at such discrection, to both such fine and such lesser period of imprisonment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a substantial drafting change.  It is necessary according to the advice of the legal advisers in my Department and the parliamentary draftsman.  They advised me that subsection (3) (b), as drafted, does not provide for the court to impose on a person found guilty of an offence under section 15, namely, drug pushing under the 1977 Act, both a fine and a term of imprisonment, or a lesser prison sentence than life imprisonment.  The amendment would allow the court the necessary discretion.  This is the important point.</P>
      <P>I am strongly advised that it would not be appropriate to provide for the imposition of both the fine and life imprisonment. There is no precedent for a measure of this nature.  To use an unparliamentary phrase, the imposition of a penalty of that nature in relation to drug pushing would be a complete overkill. It is not usual for a fine and a term of imprisonment to be imposed at the same time.  The greater penalty, imprisonment, is usually taken to cover more than adequately the lesser penalty of a fine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>Amendment No. 2 makes a change in section 27 of the Principal Act.  It is fundamental to the whole question of penalties.  We fully support the changes increasing the penalties for offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act. This section deals with penalties for drug pushers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I spoke about the seriousness of pushing drugs.  No mercy should be shown to those who push drugs for financial gain for themselves.  One has to make a distinction between them and those who sell drugs because they are <Col N="1817" /> already drug addicts.  We all recognise that they have a problem.  We should be looking at rehabilitation rather than punishment for them.  We must show people who make their livelihood by selling drugs to others and creating havoc and devastation amongst communities that we will not tolerate them in our society.</P>
    <P>My concern about subsection (3) (b) is that it is changing the prison penalty to imprisonment for life rather than a maximum of 14 years which is the penalty for pushing drugs under the present legislation. The problem is that, over the past number of years, a life sentence in practical terms has been anything from eight to ten years which, in effect, is less than the existing penalty.  We want to ensure that anyone who thinks of pushing drugs will see that the penalty we are imposing is much more severe than the present penalty which is a maximum of 14 years. While imprisonment for life is provided for, we should add in &ldquo;not less than 14 years&rdquo; so that people will see we are serious about dealing with this problem. Since life imprisonment is anything from eight to ten years, by changing to a maximum of 14 years to life imprisonment, it could appear that instead of introducing a much more severe penalty we are introducing a lesser penalty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a real danger that if we ensure that a person convicted on indictment of drug pushing under section 15 and sentenced to a term of imprisonment has to spend a minimum of 14 years behind bars, the courts would be sending a convicted person to prison for a minimum of 14 years.  That would have grave implications which Members of the House would be extremely reluctant to go along with.  I want to draw an analogy which may not be entirely popular. To take a popular conception of drugs which may be mythology in some respects, if a student is at a party and he passes a reefer or two of cannibis to a fellow student, if we were to go down the road of minimum mandatory sentences, the judge would have no option other than to sentence him to 14 years.  There is a difference under law in terms of severity of conviction between that student <Col N="1818" /> and the capture and convicting of a godfather selling heroin worth £500,000 to a network of pushers.  Society would have no sympathy for the godfather and would wish the judge to impose the full sentence of the law on him.  It is important that the courts should decide on the appropriate sentence.  The question of a minimum mandatory sentence is a different matter and it is not usual in our judicial system because it impinges on the discretion to be exercised by the courts in handing out sentences.  It is up to the courts to take account of all the circumstances in each case before passing sentence and, as I have pointed out, the circumstances can vary dramatically from case to case.</P>
      <P>The penalties for drug offences should continue to be a matter for judicial discretion within the limits of the legislation.  That is the best course and it is why I moved amendment No. 2 which provides that it shall be open to the court to determine a lesser period of imprisonment if it felt that is appropriate.  Nevertheless we are providing for the prospect of life imprisonment.  If a judge passes a sentence of life imprisonment the only way the person concerned can be released is at the discretion of the Minister for Justice. It is well established that after five or six years imprisonment most people become so institutionalised they are incapable of making any further contribution to themselves, their families or to society and that is a situation the Minister has to take into account.  It will be possible under this Bill to give a life sentence which could be indeterminate depending on assessment.  I would not favour a minimum mandatory sentence in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that in practical terms the average life sentence is ten years or less and that it might be seen we were going soft on penalties for drug pushers?  Selling heroin for financial gain is having a disastrous effect on society and on communities, particularly in this city.  When one considers the amount of crime committed because of heroin addiction one must <Col N="1819" /> give serious attention to this matter.  It is important that we be seen to set out sentences that will deter anyone who may be inclined to sell drugs, particularly heroin.</P>
      <P>I understand that if the Minister's amendment is passed my amendment may not be moved.  I ask the Minister at this stage if there is some other way in which we can make it clear to drug sellers that it will not be tolerated and that we are increasing the penalty from the present maximum sentence of 14 years.  For example, would the Minister consider introducing a penalty of 25 years or 30 years as a maximum penalty and then leave it to the discretion of the judge? Drug pushers know that a life sentence means ten years or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I stress the point that where a judge sentences a drug pusher to life imprisonment the sentence is indeterminate. At the moment a number of people are serving life sentences of an indeterminate nature.  It is true that people have been released after six, seven or eight years but this is done on the basis of a careful assessment.  Above all, it is done on the basis that the person concerned is not likely to commit a further crime similar to that for which he was sentenced and also that he is capable of reform.  If a drug pusher gets a sentence of life imprisonment it is inconceivable that the Minister of the day would allow him out after six or seven years if that Minister was of the view that he would resume drug pushing.  If a person commits a crime of passion or a murder and is sentenced to life imprisonment he may be released after six or seven years. That may be done on the basis that the person had no previous record of violence or he may be wholly reformed and unlikely to indulge in a further crime.  In the case of drug pushing the law would take great care not to release a person if it was likely that he would revert to drug pushing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The flexibility that is necessary is there in the section.  A drug addict may, in order to feed his habit, become a proficient drug pusher and he may get a sentence <Col N="1820" /> of life imprisonment for the destruction he has wreaked on his fellow citizens.  During the course of a lengthy term of imprisonment it may be possible for him to come off drugs and no longer be an addict and he may be released in five, six or eight years and become a reformed member of society.  If one were to have a minimum mandatory sentence of not less than 14 years that person might finish up, as would anyone, in my view, after 14 years in prison, in a psychiatric hospital.  It is well established that after ten or 12 years in prison a person becomes so institutionalised that he is not capable of being reformed or having any further involvement in society.  To that extent, this Bill very carefully lays down the discretion which may be exercised by the court in handing out such sentences. I stress that the 1977 Act did not allow for life imprisonment.  I am bringing in the option of life imprisonment for drug pushers.  That is a very serious thing to do but, in bringing it in, I cannot put it in such a draconian setting that the deterrent of life imprisonment as a result of a conviction would have no social and penal reform prospect built into it.</P>

      <P>The legal adviser and the parliamentary draftsman have advised me that that subsection which makes it an offence to instruct or impede a member of the Garda Síochána in exercise of a power conferred on him by this section is not necessary because of the provision of section 21 (4) of the 1977 Act which reads:</P>
      <P>Any person who by act or omission impedes or obstructs a member of the Garda Síochána or a person duly authorised under this Act in the lawful exercise of a power conferred by this Act shall be guilty of an offence and if, in the case of a continuing offence, the impediment or obstruction is continued after conviction, he shall be guilty of a further offence.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the provisions in section 21 (4) of the 1977 Act are more comprehensive than was proposed in section (1G) of this Bill and render the inclusion of the latter in the Bill unnecessary.</P>

    <P>(2)  This section applies to an offence against the Customs Acts in relation to the importation or exportation of a controlled drug.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am introducing this amendment so that a person convicted of an offence under the Customs Acts in relation to the importation or exportation of a court controlled drug may be liable to the appropriate penalties provided for in section 27 of the 1977 Act as amended by section 6 of this Bill.  The penalties provided <Col N="1824" /> for in section 27 (1) relate to possession of a controlled drug and section 27 (3) which relates to pushing drugs will apply, as appropriate, to offences under the Customs Acts in future.  I acknowledge the valuable role which customs and excise personnel play in the fight against drug abuse.  They are our first line of defence in that regard and it is essential that they are given adequate powers to tackle the problem at the point of entry. The need to have effective customs control in the fight against drug abuse has been highlighted by the special Government task force on drug abuse and by several Deputies, including Deputy O'Hanlon, who contributed to the Second Stage debate and stressed this point. I propose, in so far as it is possible by legislation in my own area of responsibility, to implement the measures recently recommended as being necessary for more effective customs control.  Accordingly, I am introducing amendments Nos. 5, 6, 6 (a) and 11 to the Bill, all of which are designed to enable customs personnel to play a more effective part in the fight against drug abuse and drug smugglers.</P>
    <P>A significant shortcoming in the Customs Acts which has been identified by the task force is the inadequacy of the penalties provided for dealing with persons convicted of smuggling drugs.  While the powers available to the customs and excise officers are adequate, according to the Revenue Commissioners, the penalties provided for offences under the Acts in relation to the importation or exportation of controlled drugs are completely outdated.  This has led to a situation where, instead of using their own powers which carry minimum penalties, the customs and excise personnel have had to call in the Garda in most situations involving illicit drugs because the suspects could then be charged under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, which carried much stiffer penalties.  My amendment will remedy that situation and will, in effect, also implement a recommendation of the task force which suggested that the penalties in the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, and the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, should be aligned.  This will be a major change for good.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Subject to subsection (4) of this section, in any proceedings for an offence to which section 7 of this Act applies, where it is proved that a person imported a controlled drug and the court, having regard to the quantity of the controlled drug which the person imported and to such other matter as the court considers relevant, is satisfied that it is reasonable to assume that the controlled drug was not intended for the immediate personal use of the person, then for the purposes of section 7 (1) (a) of this Act, he shall be regarded by the court, until the court is satisfied to the contrary, as having imported the controlled drug for the purpose of selling or otherwise supplying it to another in contravention of regulations referred to in that section.</P>
    <P>(2)  In any proceedings for an offence to which section 7 of this Act applies, the defendant shall not be acquitted of the offence charged by reason only of proving that he neither knew nor suspected nor had reason to suspect that the substance, product or preparation in question was the particular controlled drug alleged.</P>
    <P>(3)  In proceedings for an offence to which section 7 of this Act applies in which it is proved that the defendant imported or exported the relevant controlled drug in contravention of the Customs Acts, it shall be a defence to prove that:&mdash;</P>

    <P>I thank the House, the staff of the House and my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, for agreeing to amendment No. 6a.  This is another amendment which has been sought by the Revenue Commissioners.  Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, section 29, which relates to defence generally, applies to offences committed under section 3, possession, and section 15, pushing, of that Act.  As I propose to apply the appropriate penalties in section 27 of the 1977 Act, as amended by section 6 of the Bill, to offences under the Customs Acts relating to the importation or exportation of a controlled drug, it is necessary and desirable that similar provisions as are in section 29 of the 1977 Act should also apply to customs offences.  This is what I am providing for in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;Section 19 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the insertion in subsection (1) after `vessel' in each place in which it occurs of `or licensed premises'; and</P>
      <P>(b)  the insertion in subsection (2) after `vessel' in each place in which it occurs of `or licensed premises'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 19 (1) of the Principal Act states that &ldquo;a person who is the occupier or in control or is concerned in the management of any land, vehicle or vessel and who knowingly commits or suffers any of the following to take place on the land, vehicle or vessel, namely&rdquo;, and it goes on to list a number of offences such as the preparation of opium, the manufacture of controlled drugs, the importation and the sale of controlled drugs and so on. That section relates to anyone who is in charge of land, vehicle or vessel.  My amendment asked the Minister to include in that subsection and also in subsection 19 (2) the words: &ldquo;or licensed premises&rdquo; after &ldquo;vessels&rdquo; to ensure that a person who is in charge of a licensed premises used for any of these purposes, and particularly for the sale of controlled drugs, should also be guilty of an offence similar to those who are in control of land, vehicle or vessel.</P>

      <P>I have every sympathy with Deputy O'Hanlon and agree with the general import of his observations. When the point was originally raised I wondered why specific reference had not been made to licensed premises. However, on checking the matter with my legal adviser and the parliamentary draftsman it was put to me that the phrase &ldquo;licensed premises&rdquo; was not necessary because the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; is specifically used in section 19 of the 1977 Act. &ldquo;Land&rdquo; is defined in the Schedule to the Interpretation Act, 1937, to include &ldquo;houses and buildings of any tenure&rdquo;. <Col N="1830" /> On that basis licensed premises as such are included.</P>
      <P>May I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the definition of &ldquo;land&rdquo; is being extended in section 10 of this Bill to ensure that structures such as tents and caravans are encompassed but the traditional and conventional definition of &ldquo;land&rdquo; which includes houses and buildings of any tenure, and as such the concept of a licensed premises is encompassed in the original 1977 Act.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the insertion in subsection (1) after `Garda Síochána' of `or an officer of Customs and Excise';</P>
      <P>(b) the insertion in subsection (2) after `Garda Síochána' of `or an officer of Customs and Excise';&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section deals with what we see as the most serious defect in the Bill because it does not give effective powers to the customs and excise officers to play their part in preventing the illegal importation of drugs.  We all recognise that the vast majority of drugs sold on the streets are imported.  I know cannabis is grown here but heroin, which is the most used drug in this country at present and is very harmful to addicts' health and to society in terms of crime and illness, is imported. We do not manufacture heroin here.  The bulk may be imported in very minute amounts and it is obvious that if we have effective control at all points of entry to prevent the importation of heroin we would not have any problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept it is unrealistic that customs officers could detect all heroin imports but there is no doubt that if they had more powers they would be in a position to find more of the drugs being imported illegally.  There is no doubt that there has <Col N="1831" /> been an increasing amount of illegal importation of all drugs.  Whereas formerly the vast majority of drugs for illegal use here were stolen from chemists' shops there is now good security in that regard and in regard to hospital pharmacies and other places where drugs are stored.</P>
    <P>The problem has escalated in the past seven years not only here but throughout the world.  In 1977 here there was one seizure of heroin but in 1981 there were 170 seizures.  The cannabis seizures have risen from 107 in 1977 to 430 in 1981.  The traffic is increasing throughout the world. In 1982 as much as 560 tonnes of cannabis was seized throughout the world.  That indicates the size of the problem.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is important that we should look at all ways in which we can give more powers to customs officers to ensure that as far as is practically possible the importation of drugs illegally will be stopped.  For instance, the Minister for Finance has no responsibility in regard to the task force although it is an area in which there is a sharing of responsibility between various Ministers.  The Minister for Finance has responsibility for the Revenue Commissioners and Customs and therefore should have a major role to play in the matter of drugs.  If we are to deal effectively with illegal importation, most of which is through air and sea ports, we could make it much easier to have the problem dealt with if the Minister for Finance took a major role to ensure that Customs will have power and authority to deal with persons who import drugs illegally.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 in my name asks for the powers given to the Garda Síochána in section 9 be extended to customs officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered the amendment carefully.  We have consulted with the Revenue Commissioners and they are satisfied that the powers available to them now are adequate.  The general view was that the penalties needed to be updated and in amendment No. 5 I specifically provided for this.  I emphasise that customs officers already have powers of search and arrest.  These <Col N="1832" /> powers exist under customs legislation but they have not been able to avail of these powers because of the inadequate penalties.  This point was made very clear in a recent report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.</P>
      <P>That is why I arranged to apply the penalties of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 to offences under the Customs Acts. That will enable customs officers to avail of the updated penalty.</P>
      <P>There is a further and more serious reason why I would be reluctant to amend the section as suggested.  It would be a major policy change of an exceptional nature and possibly would create a doubt as to where ultimate authority exists.  If we give parity of powers there would be a doubt as to which agency had precedence over another and which agency would be the most appropriate in regard to enforcement in a given case.  So far, the Garda and the customs officers have been working in co-operation and we are not aware of any major problems between them.  However, problems could arise if we give parity of operation as proposed in the amendment.</P>
      <P>If a major drugs pusher was caught bringing in drugs and was arrested by a customs officer it could be part of his defence that the arrest should have been done by the Garda and a dispute could arise about who had authority to arrest the pusher in the first instance.  There are many smart senior counsels knocking around who could raise major hares of that nature.  This matter would come within the ambit of the Minister for Justice and would require a very special investigation in regard to law enforcement and constitutionality.  That is not to say that when it comes to their precise function, namely customs and excise &mdash; the control of the import of drugs comes under that &mdash; they do not have powere of arrest and search.  The powers of the Garda Síochána are much wider and to extend them to these officers would open up an area of considerable difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept what the Minister has said, that this would mean a policy change, we should not be afraid <Col N="1833" /> of a policy change if it is necessary because we are dealing with an exceptional problem.  If it is necessary to implement policy changes in relation to the enforcement of law and order that is what the legislation should be about.  We must ensure that controlled drugs are not imported illegally.  If we can do that effectively we will be dealing with the problem we face.  The only way we can achieve anything near success is to give powers to the officers of customs and excise.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism in the course of their report dealt with the role of officers of customs and excise and controlling the supply of illegal drugs.  That report, which was adopted unanimously, recommended that sections 23, 26, 27 (1) and (3), 28 and 29 should be extended to officers of customs and excise.  While I accept that the Minister tonight amended some of those sections, I do not think he went far enough to ensure that those officers have the power to deal with offenders.</P>
      <P>The Select Committee recommended at 5.2.3:</P>
      <P>Once the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 are extended to officers of Customs and Excise, they should be free to immediately arrest and charge a person found to be smuggling drugs at a point of entry to the country.  It will be necessary to ensure continued close co-operation and liaison with the Garda Drugs Squad as, in certain cases, it may be considered more appropriate not to detain and arrest a suspected smuggler so as to give the Garda the opportunity to catch other persons involved in the supply of drugs.</P>
      <P>We all agree that there must be close co-operation between those charged with ensuring that this problem is eliminated from our society.  The Select Committee went on to state at 6.1:</P>
      <P>They [officers of Customs and Excise] should have similar powers to those of the Garda if they are to have a realistic chance of trying to deal with the problems of drug smuggling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> Referring to section 23 of the 1977 Act the Select Committee pointed out:</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation officers of Customs and Excise do not have the necessary authority to search a person who has not landed from a ship or aircraft.</P>
    <P>That is another area where those officers should have power if they are to deal with the problem under discussion.  The Select Committee went on to make the point at 6.3:</P>
    <P>A Customs Officer may not legally attend or assist, in his capacity as an officer of Customs and Excise, at a search under such a warrant.</P>
    <P>That refers to a warrant given to a named member of the Garda Síochána under section 26.  At 8.1 and 8.2 the Select Committee stated:</P>
    <P>Section 186 of the Customs (Consolidation) Act, 1876 authorises officers of Customs and Excise to arrest and charge persons suspected of customs offences.  The Revenue Commissioners have issued a direction prohibiting the exercise of this power without their prior consent.</P>
    <P>If we want to deal realistically with this problem this is the best opportunity to improve the law to deal with the area of illegal importation of drugs.  In this legislation we are not going far enough.  My amendments suggest other ways and are in keeping with the report of the Select Committee who suggest that officers of customs and excise be given the necessary powers to deal with offenders found at the point of entry to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the wish of the House that the Bill be amended in the way suggested by Deputy O'Hanlon the way to do so is through the Customs (Consolidation) Act, 1876, the Act which details the powers of officers of customs and excise.  Any change in that Act must be done within the framework of the Garda Síochána Acts because clearly there is an inter-relationship.  As the person responsible on the Health side for drugs legislation &mdash; I am not shuffling off <Col N="1835" /> the point made or trying to evade any statutory responsibility on the issue &mdash; I have effectively updated the penalties. The Revenue Commissioners who were loath to see the officers exercising their full powers under their present statutory position are in a different position now because the Misuse of Drugs Act sets down a parity of penalty.  For that reason this opens up a whole new can of worms as it were; it opens up a major area.  I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment in spite of the excellent report produced by the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  Their report should be directed more appropriately at the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Finance.  I have very little function in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised a fundamental issue, the kernel of the problem as to why we are not dealing effectively with the very serious drug problem.  He has stated that it might be more appropriate for the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Justice to deal with this amendment under the Customs (Consolidation) Act and the Garda Síochána Acts.  The reality is that when our spokesman on finance put down an amendment on the Finance Bill it was ruled out of order because, he was told, it was not appropriate to the Minister for Finance.  The Government must find a way of ensuring that there are no loopholes in our legislation which will allow people to break the law in relation to the misuse of drugs.  The question of importation is fundamental.  Neither the Minister for Health nor the Minister for Finance accepts responsibility and, as far as I know, it has not come before the Minister for Justice.  If each Minister is able to say that it would be better for another Minister to deal with it, then we will never come to grips with the problem. I would ask the Minister to see if there is some way under this legislation to give the powers to customs officers which the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism want them to have.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to take account of advice recently received from my legal advisers.  I am advised that the paragraph as currently drafted is too inflexible. Section 26 (2) of the 1977 Act did not provide for anyone other than a member of the Garda Síochána to accompany the garda whose name was specified in the search warrant.  However, the Garda have found that in many cases where search warrants have been executed it has been felt necessary or desirable to have a scientific expert accompany them, very often somebody from the forensic science laboratory or a customs and exise officer.  When the garda applies for a <Col N="1837" /> warrant he may not know who the appropriate people are who will accompany him on a particular search.  Under the 1977 Act there was no need to specify the names of the accompanying gardaí in the warrant.  This amendment removes the need to specify in the warrant the names of the other persons accompanying the garda for these reasons.</P>
    <P>This provision will certainly facilitate the involvement of customs and excise personnel in searches for illicit drugs and it is a provision which has been recently sought by customs officers.</P>
