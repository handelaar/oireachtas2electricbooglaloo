      <P>I wish to raise again with the Taoiseach the question of the vote of no confidence in the Minister for Finance which we have put down and to repeat my request that it be taken today.  There are ample precedents for the giving of priority to motions of no confidence of this sort.  I should like to point out to you, a Cheann Comhairle &mdash; and I think you are already aware of the fact &mdash; that long and arduous discussions took place about the arrangements for the visit of President Reagan to the country and to this <Col N="2405" /> House.  Arrangements were agreed between the parties.  Part of that agreement was to the effect that the House would not sit tomorrow in order to facilitate the arrangements.  It now transpires that unilaterally the Taoiseach has broken that agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the laughing hyenas over there would let us conduct our business in a proper manner.  I did not agree to the Order of Business.  You asked me would I agree to a particular proposal about Private Members' Business and the taking of item No. 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked were the arrangements I read out agreed to subject to the addendum and I understood Deputy Haughey to say yes and I said agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Order of Business which I have before me and which you read out has been amended by you verbally. I think that is unusual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but it was agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to point out that item No. 7 was put in here at the last minute and we were asked to agree to it informally which we did.  I do not think the Government are behaving very satisfactorily in presenting the Order of Business to the House in this way. Surely I am entitled to make a point on <Col N="2406" /> the Order of Business, and my point is that we are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I read out what the Taoiseach read out with an addendum about item No. 12.  That represented the arrangements for today's business.  I looked in Deputy Haughey's direction and asked was that agreed and I clearly understood him to say yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely clear that the Chair asked me specifically if this arrangement about item No.12, which is not clear from the Order of Business the Chair read out, was agreed and that is what I agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Once that was agreed it followed that the Deputy was agreeing to the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements about item No. 12 were added to by the Chair verbally, a most unusual procedure. I was being helpful by agreeing to the Chair's verbal amendment but now the Chair is trying to turn that against me and prevent me making my case.  My point is that the arrangements were all agreed between the parties.  They have now been unilaterally broken by the Taoiseach in regard to our motion of no confidence and I object to that.  Again I ask the Taoiseach to provide time today for that motion of no confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is talking about.  The Whips discussed this yesterday and agreed to the discussion on Thursday.  I do not know what on earth the Deputy is talking about.  He should talk to his own Whip occasionally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach to repeat what he said because it did not make any sense to me.  Will he <Col N="2407" /> please reply to my point that he has unilaterally broken arrangements entered into by the parties?  We are pressing for the taking of this motion today.  If the Taoiseach is afraid of the motion I can understand that, but surely it is something of importance that should be taken at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We agreed to give time tomorrow for statements on this subject. That was agreed by the Opposition side through their Whip and I do not have any idea what the Leader of the Opposition is talking about and neither does he, obviously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is appropriate for the Taoiseach to say that I do not know what I am talking about. That may be the way that the Fine Gael Party wish to conduct the business of the House.  I know precisely what I am talking about.  I am pointing out that the Taoiseach, not for the first time, has broken arrangements entered into between the parties in regard to the non-sitting of the House on Thursday.  I am asking that he give us time for this important motion today.</P>

      <P>I should like to make it clear that we did not finalise our discussions. I am not going to start breaching by giving a strike by strike account of what happened between the Whips.  I do not think it is appropriate that the Taoiseach should either.  However, it was not agreed that the statements would be tomorrow.  We were in discussion and last night having spoken to the Minister's office I left saying that we would finalise those discussions today.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the terms of the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources, commonly known as the Paris Convention, was concluded in that city on 21 February 1974.  The convention was drawn up having regard to the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm in June 1972 and in recognition of the need for concerted international action to protect the marine environment.  The convention has already been signed by Ireland and by 12 other countries and it has been ratified by ten countries and by the European Community. By reason of Article 29.5 of the Constitution, the convention must be approved by Dáil Éireann before the State can be bound by it.  Approval of the <Col N="2412" /> present motion will allow the formalities for ratification by Ireland to be completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Paris Convention requires the contracting parties to take action under a number of headings.  There is a general obligation to take all possible steps to prevent pollution of the sea from land-based sources, including man-made marine structures, through the introduction by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy which cause hazards to human health, living resources and marine ecosystems, or cause damage to amenities or interference with other legitimate uses of the sea.  In particular, measures are required to be taken by each contracting party to achieve the elimination, if necessary by stages, of pollution caused by certain persistent and toxic substances which are listed in Part I of Annex A to the convention.  These substances are not readily degradable or rendered harmless by natural processes and may give rise to accumulations of dangerous materials in the food chain.  Substances included are organohalogen compounds; mercury, cadmium and their compounds; persistent synthetic materials; and persistent oils and hydrocarbons of petroleum origin.  Under the convention, measures must also be taken to secure the reduction of pollution by other less noxious substances which are listed in Part II of Annex A.  These include organic compounds of phosphorus, silicon and tin; elemental phosphorus; arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, nickle, zinc and their compounds; and substances which have a harmful effect on the taste or smell of fish.  Contracting states are also required to forestall and, as appropriate, eliminate pollution of the sea by radioactive substances, including wastes, which are covered by Part III of Annex A.</P>
    <P>In addition to the obligations I have just mentioned, there are provisions in the convention for consultation between contracting states for the purpose of negotiating agreements to control pollution from land-based sources in one state which is likely to prejudice the interests of one or more other contracting states. There are provisions, too, for the establishment <Col N="2413" /> of complementary or joint programmes of scientific and technical research, including research into the best methods of eliminating or replacing noxious substances so as to reduce marine pollution from land-based sources.  The convention also requires the contracting states to set up, progressively, a permanent monitoring system, allowing the earliest possible assessment of the existing level of marine pollution and of the effectiveness of measures taken to reduce pollution from land-based sources.  Finally, states are obliged to assist one another, as appropriate, to prevent incidents which may result in pollution from land-based sources, to minimise and eliminate the consequences of such incidents, and to exchange relevant information.</P>
    <P>The convention provides for the establishment of a commission, composed of representatives of contracting states, to supervise the implementation of its provisions. In addition to this general supervisory function, the commission has power to draw up measures for the control of pollution from land-based sources and to make recommendations on the amendment of the lists of polluting substances. They operate in accordance with its own Rules of Procedure and Financial Regulations which were adopted by unanimous vote.  The commission is serviced by a permanent secretariat and financed by means of an annual budget which also requires the unanimous support of delegations.  Each state contributes 2.5 per cent plus a balance proportionate to gross national product, to the budget.  Our contribution in 1984 is about £4,200.  The only other direct charges on Exchequer funds will arise through attendance at commission meetings and participation, as necessary, in working groups.  The amounts involved will be relatively small.</P>
    <P>The Paris Convention provisions also apply to those parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans which are north of Gibraltar and east of Greenland.  This is the same sea area covered by the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, which Ireland ratified in 1981. The London Convention on the Prevention <Col N="2414" /> of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter which Ireland ratified in 1982 is also relevant.  The provisions of this latter convention are generally similar to those of the Oslo Convention. However, the London Convention differs in that it applies to all the seas and oceans of the world.  It is, perhaps, best known for its prohibition on the dumping of high level radioactive waste which the International Atomic Energy Agency has declared to be unsuitable for dumping at sea.  Ratification of the Paris Convention follows naturally from our acceptance of the objectives of these other conventions and will permit full participation in the comprehensive framework of international measures aimed at preventing pollution of the seas from whatever source.  It is in the context of these international agreements that our interests, as an island nation, can best be protected.</P>
    <P>As a signatory of the Paris Convention, Ireland has already indicated acceptance of its objectives.  We have taken part in the meetings and technical working groups of the commission but our role will be enhanced by formal ratification of the convention.  At the level of the European Communities, the objectives of the convention are reflected in a Council directive of 4 May 1976 dealing with pollution from discharges of certain hazardous substances into the aquatic environment. The directive covers those substances to which the Paris Convention relates as well as other substances which are considered to constitute a pollution threat.  The directive adopts the same approach as the convention of the classification of substances under two groups or lists.  Those on List I, which pose the greater danger because of their toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation, are to be subject to controls so as to eliminate pollution, while the objective is to reduce pollution from substances on List II, which generally pose a lesser danger to the environment.  The directive requires that discharges of List I and II substances are to be controlled by a system of prior authorisation.  A number of subsidiary directives have also been adopted setting limit values for mercury and cadmium, <Col N="2415" /> and others are under consideration by the Council or being prepared by the Commission.  In due course, these will be given effect in this country by regulations.</P>
    <P>The pollution control measures necessary to comply with the Paris Convention will be enforced primarily through the provisions of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  In so far as discharges of radioactive substances are concerned, appropriate controls may also be exercised under the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1977 which is administered by the Nuclear Energy Board and which complements the licensing provisions of the Water Pollution Act.  Dumping from marine structures may be controlled, as necessary, under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>The Water Pollution Act contains a general prohibition on the entry of polluting matter to waters, including the sea, and is primarily enforced through the licensing, by local authorities, of discharges of trade and sewage effluents from point sources to waters and to sewers. By the end of December 1983 local and sanitary authorities had issued over 1,150 licences for such discharges compared with 14 at the end of 1979.  Where necessary, conditions are attached to these licences in relation to the nature, temperature, volume, rate, method of treatment and location of a discharge, the periods during which discharges may be made, and the effect of a discharge on receiving waters.  Licences may be reviewed after they have been in force for three years, or at any earlier time with the consent of the licensee.</P>
    <P>Apart from issuing licences, local authorities are empowered under the Water Pollution Act to issue notices requiring measures to be taken to prevent or control pollution of waters.  In 1983, a total of 243 such notices were issued.  In addition, local authorities carried out 1,960 investigations during the year under the general provisions of the Act and initiated prosecutions, where necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2416" /> Of particular interest at this time are the Paris Convention provisions in regard to the pollution of the marine environment through discharges of radioactive wastes.  Under Article 5 of the Convention, contracting states undertake to adopt measures with the aims of preventing, and, as appropriate, eliminating pollution caused by such substances.  In implementing this undertaking, states are required to take full account of the recommendation of the appropriate international organisations and agencies regarding disposal of radioactive substances, including safety limits and monitoring procedures.</P>
    <P>The action to be taken under the convention with regard to radioactive substances is under continuing review by the Commission. At the June 1983 meeting, the Irish representative expressed this country's concern to protect man and the environment from excessive levels of radioactivity.  We also expressed dissatisfaction with the absence of specific requirements under Article 5 for the control of radioactive waste discharges and questioned the adequacy of this article to achieve the desired protection.  We stated the Irish view that the best available technology should be used to minimise radioactive discharges, particularly from existing facilities dedicated to the processing of radioactive materials.  Ireland also requested the Commission to initiate further scientific studies into the general question of radioactive discharges to the aquatic environment.</P>
    <P>The issue of radioactive discharges will be further considered at a meeting next month of the Commission established under the convention.  Matters to be dealt with include a proposal from Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark that states should be required to take account of the best available technology at existing and any proposed nuclear reprocessing plants in order to minimise discharges. This proposal was first put forward at a technical working group meeting held in Dún Laoghaire last March.  On that occasion, Ireland supported the forwarding of the proposal to the main Commission meeting.  These <Col N="2417" /> efforts to protect the marine environment from pollution by radioactive wastes and other substances can be enhanced through the ratification of the convention and through full participation in the international forum which it provides.</P>
    <P>Provision is made under Article 9 for consultation between states with a view to negotiating a co-operation agreement where pollution from land-based sources in one state is likely to prejudice the interests of another.  Such an agreement may define the areas to which it is to apply, quality objectives to be achieved, and the methods to be used.  Where consultations fail to secure a satisfactory solution the Commission may be called upon to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the public concern about discharges into the Irish Sea from the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, formerly Windscale.  These discharges must comply with limits specified by the United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the United Kingdom Department of the Environment.  Our own Nuclear Energy Board conduct an independent monitoring programme which is designed to provide information on the distribution of radioactivity in the Irish Sea and estimates of the radiation exposure of the public.  The programme includes the sampling and analysis of fish, seaweeds, sediments and seawater.  In our case, the most significant source of public exposure to radiation arises from the consumption of fish.  However, the results of the board's monitoring programme indicate that the exposure level from this source is less than 1 per cent of the annual whole body dose equivalent limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.</P>
    <P>While the monitoring results are reassuring, the Government are nevertheless concerned about the higher concentrations of radioactivity in discharges from Sellafield compared with other nuclear reprocessing plants such as that at Cap de la Hague in France.  We are also concerned about the absence of conclusive scientific evidence which would allay fears as a possible cumulative effect of radionuclides in the aquatic environment. <Col N="2418" /> Our unease is increased by the evidence of inadequate management and operational controls found by an investigation undertaken by the Department of the Environment in the United Kingdom into the unplanned release of radioactive liquid late year which led to the closure of beaches in the vicinity of the plant.</P>
    <P>During the past year, Irish concern in the matter has been conveyed on several occasions to the appropriate UK authorities. At a meeting on 17 February 1984 between the Tánaiste and the United Kingdom Secretary of State for the Environment, the Tánaiste emphasised the Government's view that discharges should be discontinued as soon as practicable and that measures to reduce the present levels of discharge should be accelerated in the best interests of health and the environment.  He suggested that there should be a more extensive research programme on radiological hazards in the Irish Sea, that there should be an extension of official level contacts on nuclear matters and that the UK authorities should undertake to inform the Irish authorities immediately of any unplanned discharges that take place. Finally, he pointed out that any review of discharge authorisations for the Sellafield plant should take account of Irish concern in the matter.  The Tánaiste has already expressed his appreciation of the understanding and positive attitude adopted by the Secretary of State towards the Irish position and there is to be close co-operation in the future between the two countries on these matters of mutual concern.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the Tánaiste's presentation of the Irish position on the Sellafield discharges was made in his capacity as Minister for Energy, in which capacity he has responsibility for nuclear matters.  In this context, it might be noted that while the Minister for the Environment has a general responsibility to provide for the protection and improvement of the environment, Government policy requires each Minister to consider fully the environmental effects of policies and other activities for which his Department and related agencies are responsible.  In <Col N="2419" /> the case of the Sellafield discharges it is therefore appropriate that the Minister for Energy, who has specific statutory functions in relation to nuclear matters, should take the lead role but it is, of course, essential that the interests of other Departments, including Environment, Health, Fisheries and Communications are taken into account.  Accordingly, inter-departmental consultative arrangements, involving also the Nuclear Energy Board, have been established and these have permitted full input of environmental considerations in the determination of national policy on this issue. I intend that my Department will continue to be involved closely with this matter.</P>
    <P>While it does not arise directly under the Paris Convention, I might refer briefly to the general question of dumping at sea of wastes, particularly the dumping of low level nuclear wastes, which is at present permitted under the London Dumping Convention.  The Government are opposed in principle to such dumping of nuclear wastes and at the February 1984 meeting of the London Convention called on all signatory countries to consider strongly the disposal of any further low level radioactive waste on land.  The scientific and technical basis for the proposal made at the 1983 meeting to amend the London Convention to prevent the dumping at sea of low level radioactive waste is at present under review.  It is anticipated that the proposal to amend the convention will be considered at the September, 1985 consultative meeting when the findings of the review will be taken into account.  We are prepared to consider these findings but will not commit ourselves to accepting that they should be binding.  Our attitude will be determined by our concern to ensure the immediate and long-term protection of our population and environment.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already, ratification of the Paris Convention is consistent with our position as a contracting state to the Oslo and London conventions which are concerned with pollution of the marine environment from other sources. It is through concerted international <Col N="2420" /> efforts that such pollution can be tackled effectively.  In our case, as an island country, these efforts are particularly important because of the contributions made to our economy by our fishing industry and the high amenity and recreational value of our beaches and coastal waters for our own people and tourists alike. Accordingly, I have no doubt but that the House will approve the terms of the convention and so open the way to its ratification by Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil I welcome the motion before the House approving the terms of the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources and assure the Minister of our full support for the motion.  When one recalls that the Paris Convention was concluded in February 1974 it must make one wonder why it has taken Ireland ten years to ratify the convention. I believe that recent events in Cumbria hastened the Government's ratification of this important convention.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is very serious public alarm in this country at the fact that radioactive waste has been and continues to be discharged into the Irish Sea by the British nuclear reprocessing plant at Windscale.  The terms of this convention would seem the most appropriate way for Ireland to participate in making known this public alarm and the Government's concern at the continued activities of the plant in discharging these dangerous substances into the Irish Sea. According to some reports they may have been responsible for loss of life in England and interfered with the health of Irish citizens living on the east coast. I cannot produce any scientific or medical proof of this but the Minister and the House are aware of the concern which has been expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lack of scientific knowledge and the effects on marine and human life of the discharge of radioactive waste into marine waters is a matter of serious concern. Until scientific knowledge is advanced to a stage where all is known it is highly irresponsible of any Government to authorise the continued discharge <Col N="2421" /> of substances of this kind which carry with them such a grave threat to life.</P>
    <P>We have a particular interest in ensuring that the quality of the waters surrounding our coasts are maintained at the highest level of purity.  We are an island nation and our economy is supported through the industrial activities of our citizens which include efforts by our State to establish a strong seafishing industry. Anything which interferes with the quality of the water and results in contamination of the fish which are caught and brought to the marketplace is of great concern.  We are greatly dependent on revenue from the tourist industry and it is imperative that we do everything possible to maintain the cleanliness of our water and beaches so that our country will continue to be an attractive and safe place for people to come on holiday.  We must set the highest possible standards and take every action at international level to ensure that no other country will contaminate our fish.</P>
    <P>These dangers were recognised and led to the convention being adopted in Paris in 1974, as has been mentioned.  Ireland's delay in formally ratifying the proposal through the adoption of the motion in Dáil Éireann is a matter of regret.  I attended the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment in 1972 and listened to the fears expressed by people scientifically qualified to speak about the effects of radioactivity.  I saw the effects it had on some people who presented themselves for inspection there to warn the world about the need to be extremely careful about how we disposed of and use radioactive substances.  I was shocked at what I saw.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that world opinion has resulted in governments adopting conventions with the intention of introducing strict control on discharges of this kind. Until scientific knowledge about the bad effects of radioactive waste and the discharge of other materials into marine waters and the environment generally is fully developed there is need for great caution and the application of the strictest possible controls.  I am concerned about the controls we operate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2422" /> I recall that some weeks ago questions were put to the Minister for Energy about the location of monitoring stations operated by Irish Government agencies.  I understood from the reply given that no specific monitoring procedures were implemented by any Irish agency but that we were relying on information supplied by British agencies.  There was definite confusion in the minds of Deputies on that occasion.  It was at Question Time and that does not always present the best opportunity to tease out matters and get a full and complete answer.</P>
    <P>In replying to this motion I hope the Minister will tell us in great detail exactly what procedures are operated by Irish agencies to monitor the quality of the waters and establish whether any of these dangerous materials are present in the waters surrounding our coasts.  We must know this if we are to allay public fears. The best way to do that is to give details of whatever monitoring procedures are in operation at present and what proposals there are for extending these monitoring procedures in the future.  From the information we have been able to elicit from the Government those procedures seem to be minimal.  Many people were surprised and shocked to find that we were not more active in protecting our environment through applying the most modern monitoring procedures and having a regular analysis of the quality of the water and the air under our control. There is some confusion about which Minister is responsible.  We accept that it must become the concern of a number of different Departments.  I recognise that on occasion the Minister for Energy might be the appropriate person but on another occasion the appropriate person might be the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of protecting our marine environment it would be worthwhile, indeed necessary, to establish a committee consisting of persons actively interested and involved in this area; on the one hand, people with scientific knowledge and on the other, people with specific vested interests. Representatives of different Government Departments and industrial interests, <Col N="2423" /> such as representatives of the fishing and tourist industries, local authorities &mdash; who would be involved in maintaining the purity of the environment in their own areas &mdash; and other interested and involved persons, should be brought together on a national committee and charged with ensuring that we are seen to be complying with the conventions which we are ratifying and participating in.  This committee would be seen to be active on a daily basis in analysing the quality of the environment and examining Government proposals and proposals from private individuals and companies and would continuously monitor all developments with the intention of securing the highest degree of purity in all matters relating to the environment.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can continue in the slipshod fashion in which this has been managed up to now.  Concerned citizens should have the opportunity of participating on a permanent committee established by the Government which could deal with matters raised by various groups who have been expressing concern over the years.  Such a committee would help to co-ordinate the work of the official and voluntary bodies who are concerned and giving a great service to the community by protecting something which is of great value and which we are all anxious to ensure is not destroyed or allowed to be diluted in any way.  If the Minister agrees with such a proposal, or if he considers that such a committee is not necessary, I would like to hear his views one way or the other.  It appears to the public at large that it has been left to voluntary groups to set the pace in this area.  That is not appropriate nor is it the way forward for this country.  This committee would provide a vehicle for Departments and organisations &mdash; such as An Taisce, Greenpeace and so on &mdash; to act as watchdogs for the protection of our environment.</P>
    <P>Due to the lack of scientific specific knowledge and the actual effects of the various levels of radioactive waste in our waters, it is difficult to be specific as to the level of the danger and when it might reach a critical point.  It has been suggested <Col N="2424" /> to me that radioactive waste levels in the Irish Sea are 100 time higher than the waste levels in Galway Bay.  The last time I made that comment the Minister said that was a scare statement from Fianna Fáil.  This information was given to me by somebody qualified to speak on these matters.  I am not giving it as a scientific fact, but I am asking the Minister to tell us if this is true.  Are radioactive levels in the Irish Sea growing at such a pace that they are now 100 times greater than levels in areas off the Atlantic coast, such as Galway Bay, where none of these industrial radioactive wastes is being discharged into the sea because of the remote location <i>vis-à-vis</i> Europe and America?  If that is so, it must be causing the Minister some concern because no matter how low the level of radioactive waste is at present, or that it is so much below the accepted danger levels, if it is increasing continuously, then the day could come when the critical levels would be attained and then it might be too late to do something about them.</P>
    <P>Even if ten years have been lost in our participating in this particular convention, I do not think we have reached the critical stage yet.  We can make full use of our membership of the commission which will be set up to monitor and implement the agreed articles in this convention. I hope our membership will be vigorous, that we will lead the way and act as a watchdog not just for our own coast but for the whole of western Europe.  Because of the tidal and wind movements and the prevailing winds from Europe we have a very special interest in ensuring that deleterious matters being dumped into the sea or into the air by European countries do not end up here because there is a very strong possibility that this could happen.  Warning signals are being flashed by scientists and we must pay heed.  I appeal to the members to be appointed by our Minister to be active and vigilant on our behalf in their membership of this commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister said our Water Pollution Act is the instrument under which the terms of this convention can best be implemented here.  That Act places obligations on local authorities in regard to <Col N="2425" /> the preservation of the purity of the waters around the country, and in particular authorises them to issue licences for discharges into those waters which would occur primarily in the case of sewerage systems which can be very dangerous if not properly handled, by interfering with the quality of the waters.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have established in a number of cases that the body charged with implementing and enforcing this legislation is itself the greatest offender. This is a matter of serious concern.  This comes back to the principle where local authorities are allowed to do things without having to obtain the consent of the local community, whereas the local community have to obtain the consent of the local authority for any developments they propose.  In some cases local authorities implement schemes which do not maintain the highest standards and result in causing pollution in the case of water in particular and sometimes in emissions into the air.  I am astonished that the Department recently approved of a major sewerage scheme in the Galway city area which proposes to discharge untreated all the sewage collected in the greater Galway city area into Galway Bay at one point.</P>

It is important for the tourist trade and for the residents that the general aesthetic amenity of the area be preserved. This is a matter of major importance to Galway which is one of the primary tourist resorts and is our second or third largest fishing port, based at Rossaveal. Since the matter was raised previously in the Dáil, I have been informed that the Department of Fisheries would not agree to issue a licence for the discharge of sewage into Galway Bay at the point proposed in the Minister's plan if they were to be asked now.  This is because of new information which has become available to them about the toxic effect of effluent consumed by shellfish such as oysters which are consumed raw, not giving people the protection of cooking which in some cases results in the cleansing and purifying of the items before being eaten.</P>
      <P>I warn the Minister that we are looking to him to ensure that all the fine principles enshrined in the Paris Convention, in the Water Pollution Act and in the statements made by him and his predecessors on various occasions and at international conventions will be implemented at ground level and that there is no short cut to save money.  That is what is happening in the case of the Galway sewerage scheme, which is a dangerous threat to the lives of the people and tourists in that area.  It could wipe out the shellfish industry in the inner Galway Bay area and destroy the aesthetic beauty of the bay and its beaches forever more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that rigid application of these laws and principles be applied.  We do not want to see develop in Galway, Cork or any other part of Ireland what has been allowed to happen in Dublin Bay.  The citizens of that area are now afraid to allow their children into the water because of the effects which it will have on their health.  We have had many reports of damage to the health of adults and children from swimming in Dublin Bay, due to the excess level of sewage pollutants in those waters.  That is a serious <Col N="2428" /> threat and a matter about which I know the Minister's Department are concerned. They are anxious to eliminate it as quickly as possible.  I know that his Department are committed to the expenditure of many millions of pounds through Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council in an effort to eliminate that problem as soon as possible.  Vast sums will have to be spent yet before we can hope to achieve the restoration to their former glory and purity of the waters of Dublin Bay.</P>
    <P>We do not want that type of situation to develop in other urban areas and in our coastal waters adjacent to them.  That is what the Minister's Department almost allowed to be done in Galway, until the citizens objected and forced the corporation to tell the contractor to leave, saying that they were not going to allow the contract to start.  That contract now has been held up.  Granted, the Minister has consented to a postponement for six months.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt but that the leakages at Windscale, which is now called Sellafield, in Cumbria, England, which is a nuclear processing plant, have caused great public alarm and concern. They display great negligence on the part of the British authorities.  I understand that since the early fifties the nuclear reprocessing plant at Windscale has been discharging radio active waste into the Irish Sea via two pipelines in what has been admitted to be an experiment to test the effects of such pollutants on the marine environment and local communities.</P>
      <P>I understand that in 1958 John Dunster, chief designer of the discharge programme and present day head of the National Radiological Protection Board &mdash; which is an independent Government watchdog in England &mdash; admitted the experimental nature of the discharges. He was reported to have said that meaningful results from the experiment could not be obtained if the discharges were minimised.  Any man who would make a statement of that kind should be locked up in jail.  That he would endanger the lives of his fellow citizens for the purpose of carrying out a dangerous experiment over which he had not full or adequate control is disgraceful.  It has resulted in minute examination since then.  That man has a lot on his conscience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is talk of several deaths &mdash; I do not wish to put a figure on them &mdash; which have resulted in critical groups along the Cumbrian coastline.  We know that this discharge has resulted in contamination of the Irish Sea.  I understand that they have disposed of a quarter tonne of plutonium, which is a known highly carciogenic material, into the sediments.  We do not know officially from our own resources what quantity of plutonium or any other radioactive material is present in the sediment or in the waters of the Irish Sea, resulting from the activities of this British reprocessing plant.  I hope our membership of the commission under the Paris Convention will enable us to bring our feelings in this matter to bear on the British authorities and on any other <Col N="2431" /> Government who have similar plants that are making discharges of this kind.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion and I assure the Minister of the very fullest support of all the Members on the Fianna Fáil benches. We urge the Minister and his officials to make the fullest possible use of all the terms and articles of the convention.  In that way future generations will be grateful to us for having acted properly.  I hope our action is not too late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily welcome the motion before us this morning.  I would like to congratulate the many environmental groups who have stirred all our consciences in this area and particularly have brought to the attention of the public in general the problem which was before us and which many of us had ignored for far too long.  I am thinking particularly of Hope, the West Cork Environmental Group, the Dublin Clean Seas Committee, An Taisce, Green Peace and many others.  I have no doubt that our children and many generations to come will thank them for having brought the problem to the attention of the authorities on both sides of the Irish Sea and many others further afield. Under the Constitution we need, as the Minister pointed out, Dáil approval to ratify the Paris Convention because of the finance required.  The Minister said that it will cost the State £4,200, which is a negligible amount of money.  We are perhaps doing today one of the most important things we have done in months.</P>
      <P>The Paris Convention requires that contracting parties prevent pollution of the sea by certain persistent and toxic substances including &mdash; this is most important to us today &mdash; radioactive waste, by prohibiting or regulating their discharge through pipelines, water courses or from man-made structures at sea.  It applies to the north east Atlantic, including the Irish Sea, and complements the Oslo and London Conventions ratified by Ireland in 1982, which deal with dumping at sea from ships and aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note with disappointment a few sentences <Col N="2432" /> towards the end of the Minister's speech.  He was referring to the London Convention and said:</P>
    <P>We are prepared to consider these findings but will not commit ourselves to accepting that they should be binding.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at that again and to consider the implications of it. Those concerned throughout the world want &mdash; technology allows this for the last ten years &mdash; radioactive wastes to be at zero level of discharge from these reprocessing plants.  When the technology is available and the cost is minimal, particularly if incorporated into these plants at design stage, we should insist that these findings be binding.  Let us as a small nation in Europe stand up and be counted on this particular issue.  That was only one statement which disappointed me very much in an otherwise excellent speech by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We have known for some that the outcome of the London convention was not binding.  The nations concerned, those guilty of ongoing discharges, are going ahead.  In fact, they have increased the discharges in some cases.  Let us stand up and be counted in relation to this and insist that the findings of these conventions are binding for all our sakes and for the sake of future generations.  In order to ratify the convention contracting parties must have all the legal powers to implement it.  In our case the Local Government Water Pollution Act, 1977, conferred virtually all the necessary control powers, the exceptions being discharges from offshore platforms which are subject to control under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, and disposal of radioactive waste which is subject to licence under the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1977.  The person who thought of that name for it was not very considerate.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Water Pollution Act along with many other Acts which have been passed in the last five to six years, which pertain to the Department of the Environment, failed to confer <Col N="2433" /> on local authorities additional finance to implement these Acts.  As a result they have been less effective than they might otherwise have been.  The Minister gave us the figures.  There were approximately 14 licences to discharge through water courses issued in 1979 by local authorities. This had risen to well over 1,000 last year.  I know from my limited experience of Wexford local authority that if sufficient capital had been available far more progress could have been made in this area.</P>
    <P>It will not be too long before the Book of Estimates is prepared and next year's budget is before us, so we could look to this area to see if there is any way, even accepting the position of limited resources, that local authorities can be made fully efficient in an area which is vital to all of us.  It is vital to us in Ireland because, as has been pointed out, we are an island nation.  The contribution to the economy of our fishing industry needs no underlining from me, or indeed the tremendous environmental value of our beaches and our coastline from the tourist point of view and from our own people's point of view.  The enjoyment experienced by both is immense.  I ask that this particular Act and indeed any others which local authorities are obliged to take on board recently, are given the financial structure they need to be implemented fully.</P>
    <P>In the last two years over 50 local authorities have passed motions condemning the dumping at sea of radioactive wastes.  We are very concerned as a nation about what has been going on in this area so I am delighted that we are here this morning ratifying the Paris Convention. We are consistent in the stand we have taken all along in relation to the London Convention and the Oslo one before it.  I pointed out that the cost to us is minimal plus the minimal cost of attendance at any relevant meetings. Membership is an important international gesture in the pollution control area.  It is now official and it is a frightening thing to have to stand up and say that the Irish Sea is the most radioactive sea in the world today.  Dublin is only 100 miles from Sellafield, or Windscale as it <Col N="2434" /> is better know to all of us.  When you put those two sentences side by side is it any wonder all of us should be concerned about the ongoing discharges from Windscale?</P>
    <P>The burden of the proof that these radioactive discharges do not and will not cause harm rests with the discharging or dumping authorities and not with the people or nations they may be putting at risk.  The Irish Nuclear Energy Board endorsed the dumping programmes in the Atlantic on the basis that no proven damage to marine or human life had been ascertained.  I do not accept that that is good enough.  It should be the other way around.  Until it has been proven beyond doubt that no harm or damage is being done these discharges must be stopped immediately.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that technology is available for zero discharge of liquid radioactive wastes.  This has been the case for some time in Hanford in the US and Marcoule in France.  A new method of dealing with the waste is necessary.  It involves flocculation plants and ion exchange plants and various other systems which are not overly expensive in the context of this industry.</P>
    <P>What is continuing at Sellafield and Cap de la Hague is indefensible.  Nuclear fuel re-processing accounts for 90 per cent of all radiation doses experienced by the public as a result of the nuclear fuel cycle, from both civil and military sources.  Windscale is the European Community's major source of man-made radioactive contamination in the environment. The only other plant comparable in terms of radiation doses to the public is the French re-processing plant at Cap de la Hague.  The latter contributes 8 per cent of the European Community's nuclear fuel cycle radiation dose.  It is evident from much published data that the technology has been available for over a decade to allow zero discharge from these plants.  I urge the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Energy to put all the pressure they can on our European partners, but particularly on the British authorities, to see that as soon as possible there is a cessation of discharges from Sellafield.  None <Col N="2435" /> of us can be satisfied with what is going on; neither can we be justified to future generations if we renege on our responsibility now in this most important area.</P>
    <P>Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention are of particular importance.  The others must not be underestimated but because of the topical importance of radioactive nuclear discharges these two articles bear more emphasis than the others.  We have not the same clear indication as to how these discharges affect man and the animal kingdom in general.  Other toxins which are dealt with under Annexes 1 and 2 of the Convention are more clearly understood by scientists and we can leave it to them to handle those issues.  I do not think even the technocrats really know the possible dangers from excessive radioactive discharges into our seas.  Neither the West German nor the USSR Governments permit discharges of radioactive material from re-processing plants to water.  They do, however, to compensate for this, allow greater discharges to the atmosphere.  Discharges on the scale permitted in the United Kingdom are unheard of in any other developed country.</P>
    <P>Radioactive discharges can be broadly lumped into two groups.  The first and most serious are the alpha emitters, mainly plutonium and americium.  The guidelines and standards are laid down, as well as the so-called safety limits which I question.  I do not think anybody knows sufficient to call anything a safety limit in dealing with this issue.  They are laid down and itemised for the different isotopes and discharges involved.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect which bothers me considerably and we are being fooled as a result of it.  We are being very dishonest if we do not point it out and request that it stops immediately.  One alpha emitter, plutonium 239, has an isotope, plutonium 214, which is a beta emitter of less serious consequence.  This beta emitter is discharged from Windscale into the Irish Sea under the very much more generous permitted limits for beta emitters.  However, it decays to an alpha emitting americium 214 which slips through the regulations because, as it is discharged <Col N="2436" /> when its parent element is a beta emitter, it does not count in the alpha emitter category.  This is a very serious aspect.  It is possible that far more alpha emitters are being discharged into the Irish Sea than is being admitted because they are being discharged as beta emitters with their parent element.  I would ask that this aspect be investigated immediately because the figures we are given may not indicate the facts.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the vast bulk of the alpha emitters are absorbed into the silt on the sea bed within days of discharge. The eastern coast of the Irish Sea bears the brunt of this and the silt there is seriously polluted.  At present our Irish coastline is not polluted and there is no immediate danger but when we have no control over what is happening and are not prepared to request that these conventions be binding on all parties to them, what will the future hold?  Almost all the alpha emitters from Sellafield are held on the eastern floor of the sea, so the danger to our coastline is not immediate.  However, the eastern floor of the Irish Sea is irreversibly polluted and no practical steps can be taken to undo the harm.  We should put pressure on an increasingly expensive and unpopular industry to halt further discharges to limit the consequences of a disaster.  We must insist that there be zero liquid radioactive discharges from Sellafield and, if we have any influence on the French Government, at Cap de la Hague also.  We should point out to them the situation in Hanford and Marcoule where they have managed to achieve this, with tremendous benefits to their environment and population. There is no technological reason why it cannot be done at Sellafield and at Cap de la Hague.</P>
    <P>The people most at risk from Windscale are those who live on the Cumbrian coast.  The risk to Irish people, north and south, is very much less but no one ever tries to pretend that Ireland benefits from British nuclear power.  The risk is incurred for zero benefit.  There should be no risk to the Irish nation when we are not incurring any benefit.  Let us be seen to be doing all we can to halt these discharges <Col N="2437" /> from Sellafield.  They are no longer necessary and cannot be justified. We must insist that they cease forthwith.</P>
    <P>I am very heartened by the line our Government have taken in relation to both the Oslo and the London Conventions. At the latter convention the items which gave rise to most interest were those relating to the dumping of radioactive waste at sea.  Proposals were submitted by the delegations from Kiribati and Nauru, two Pacific island nations, to amend Annexes 1 and 2 of the convention which, if adopted, would have the effect of prohibiting the dumping of all types of radioactive waste at sea immediately for each country accepting the amended convention. Many countries did not accept it or were not bound by it.</P>
    <P>The five Nordic countries submitted a draft amendment to the latter proposal, the effect of which would be to prohibit the dumping of all types of radioactive waste at sea with effect from 1 January 1990.  In the meantime the level of dumping would have to be restricted and would be subject to very strict control.</P>
    <P>The Spanish delegation submitted a draft resolution calling for the suspension of dumping at sea pending the completion of research to ascertain all its implications. Our delegation stated that they were opposed in principle to the dumping of radioactive waste and indicated support for the Nordic proposal.  Following some informal negotiation it was agreed that the scientific basis for the Pacific Islands proposal should be reviewed by an expert group.  In view of this the Nordic proposal was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Spanish delegation then introduced a revised draft resolution which in effect stated that, as the meeting had decided to refer the Pacific Islands' proposal to an expert group, all dumping at sea of radioactive material should be suspended pending the presentation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to repeat the importance of protecting our environment, our fishing industry and the amenities of the seas around us.  These should all be developed for future benefits.  Neither is it necessary to go into detail about the value and importance of any action we may have to take against any breaches that may occur.</P>
      <P>I support the motion, as I do any effort that we will decide to make to ensure the protection of our marine environment from the hazards of pollution from the dumping of waste in the seas around us. The Paris Convention was a very important step but in my opinion the procedure is slow moving.  We must not be slow as an island State to give a dynamic lead in the efforts to protect the ever-changing circumstances in the seas.</P>
      <P>I, like other speakers, will endeavour to bring home to the Government the urgent need to take our own measures and to adopt a dynamic approach to this matter in the various conventions and discussions which go on.  As I have said, as an island nation we must give a lead and develop our own clear-cut policies to deal with these issues.  We must adopt a leading role in this very good cause.  The conventions constitute a further step in efforts to control and to monitor the pollution taking place around us and we must use these conventions to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Paris Convention and in most of the other conventions the emphasis seems to be on reduction of the levels of pollution rather than on direct action to prevent it.  Running throughout the Minister's speech today are references to attempts to minimise pollution, to reduce the effects of the dumping of wastes, without much reference to eliminating the causes.  In many cases the only way <Col N="2439" /> to end pollution is to close down the plants causing it.  Windscale has been the subject of discussion in the House.  Deputies spoke at length about the damage already done by Windscale and I am glad the Minister acknowledged the wholesale pollution caused by the release of radioactive liquid waste last year, so much so that the beaches had to be closed down. That means that at that time the Windscale plant should have been closed down.</P>
    <P>If this type of pollution is continued, Windscale inevitably will have to be closed down because if we are not prepared to take a firm line of action with the British authorities the danger and the hazard will continue.  We must be clear-cut in our determination to prevent hazards of this nature developing and to put an end to their cause, and if the only way to deal with it is to close down Windscale, even temporarily, it must be done.  As I have said, we have to face up to this resolutely by representations, discussions and involvement.</P>
    <P>The conventions require contracting states to establish certain committees.  I wish to compliment our own Water Pollution Advisory Council for the work they have been doing.  I support Deputy Molloy about the need for committees whose members would have detailed scientific knowledge to deal with the various problems arising from waste dumping. The fishing industry should be involved.  However, there is a need for co-operation between our councils and expert people in the UK.  There is a need to establish Government-to-Government contacts between Ireland and the UK, between Ministers from here and the UK.  Such arrangements should be established as soon as possible so that the harmful effects from Windscale can be eliminated as soon as possible and a repetition avoided.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of a difficulty.  An inter-departmental committee has been established representing the Environment, Fisheries and Communications. We must go still further and in order to form some clear-cut Government policy a special Minister should be appointed. In this way alone can we get any co-ordinated <Col N="2440" /> action.  Such a Minister would be able to establish communications with his counterpart in the UK so that we could have regular exchanges of views, above all on monitoring.  At present our main problem is Windscale.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the valuable work being done by local authorities and the various councils dealing with this matter.  He expressed reservations in regard to some of these conventions.  I, too, have some reservations about the effectiveness of that type of procedure. I know there has been some communication between the local authority and the fisheries boards, the regional boards and the central board, who have responsibility. How can anybody tell me that a body like a local authority can have any influence or, indeed, jurisdiction, over the activities, for instance, of an offshore oil rig in the Porcupine, operating 200 miles off the Clare coastline, the Kerry coastline, the Galway coastline?  What authority, can the Minister tell me, would have control over discharges from, or activities on, an offshore oil rig operating 90 miles out from the Shannon Estuary on the Porcupine Bank in the oil exploration there?  Control is necessary and essential there in that type of operation organised by the Clare authority, by the Galway authority, by the Kerry authority and is there not a need that this should be clearly defined because we all know now that there is offshore activity taking place off the Porcupine, in the Celtic Sea and, without going into the involvement of offshore activities in the Celtic Sea area, does not a similar situation arise there?  I would have very grave reservations about the effectiveness of the control under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts especially since I can see they would not have the kind of jurisdiction or authority or, indeed, the manpower and resources to deal with the activities of the offshore oil rigs or any other offshore oil exploration or whatever may take place in the next 100 years.</P>
    <P>As well as that, if it should come to pass, as hopefully it will come to pass, that there is a major oil find either in the Porcupine or the Celtic Sea how will that situation be monitored?  How will it be <Col N="2441" /> controlled?  Which local authorities or who will have the responsibility in these specific areas to deal with specific cases which may arise?  For instance, if there is an oil find in the Porcupine in two or three years time and there is some major oil spillage who controls or monitors that situation?  Who will take action to deal with breaches of these conventions on behalf of the State?  These are very important areas which will certainly become more important as offshore oil development and exploration continue and as hopefully we see some useful oil or gas find in the Porcupine or the Celtic Sea within the next 100 years.  It is important we should be clear about what we are doing in these motions and in any legislation we pass.  We must know where exactly responsibility lies.  We must know exactly who will enforce the regulations. We must know exactly how these will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points which other speakers have already raised.  I notice that the contribution which the State will make in 1984 is about £4,200. I do not know what one can do in this area for £4,200 in 1984 but apparently that is the contribution which will be made for the establishment of the commission and if we can measure priorities from the point of view of the amount of money being contributed by the State in 1984, as I said, it is a very small amount and I doubt that anything worthwhile could be done with that type of expenditure in that situation.  I should like to hear more about this from the Minister. I should like to hear from him how he visualises the budget.  Presumably there will be contributions from the other member states.  Will the proportion be similar?  What will be the total budget? Could the Minister give us more information? Each state, the Minister says, will contribute 2.5 per cent towards the balance proportionate to the budget.  Now 2.5 per cent of what?  I am not too clear about this.  Perhaps the Minister will give us more details later on.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see this convention covers the area east of Greenland because the area around Greenland has very important bearing on our salmon stocks.  Most <Col N="2442" /> people recognise that a great number of Irish salmon feed off Greenland and people will be concerned to ensure that the area around Greenland is very carefully monitored and that any necessary action will be taken to deal with particular problems that might arise in that area. Radioactive discharges should be further considered.  Two or three references have been made to what will happen next month.  I believe there is a need here to have a more dynamic approach and a more up-to-date and positive attitude in this whole area.  There is an urgent need for us to provide our own marine research facilities.  I am aware that the National Board for Science and Technology have been engaged in some work, especially through their activities in the operation of Lough Beltra, but I do not think we have here the necessary research facilities to enable us to monitor the situation, especially the situation in our own economic zone which now extends 200 miles out into the Atlantic.  Even from the point of view of the exploitation of the huge resources in that economic zone, as well as the need to monitor new fish species or new marine values used in that area, we need to have such facilities as will enable us to have an up-to-date picture of what the whole pollution situation is in that whole economic zone over which we have jurisdiction.  This is a zone which hopefully we will be able to exploit fully in the future.  Over the last 100 years hundreds of research vessels have operated within our economic zone and while we can, if we wish, get some information from these research vessels &mdash; I know some foreign research vessels have been carrying our research into pollution levels in our economic zone &mdash; nevertheless we need as soon as possible a modern sophisticated research vessel which will do our own fisheries research, marine research and pollution research.  It is essential this should be done as soon as possible.  We have been talking about it for so long. We know there is huge potential and it is essential that we immediately set about &mdash; with the assistance of the National Board for Science and Technology who are involved in this area already and have had the benefit of Lough Beltra, which is <Col N="2443" /> not really designed specifically for marine research &mdash; equipping ourselves with this type of research vessel to go out and be fully involved in the monitoring and control of pollution levels within our own economic zone.  We must do this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>This is a very useful and important motion.  All of us must be concerned about this matter and we must take firm and decisive action to deal with it.  In addition, we must recognise there is a huge potential for us in other areas that have not been exploited and that could create hundreds of jobs.  While it is not relevant to the motion, it is important to note that in the area of marine research and oceanography there is enormous potential for job creation for many young graduates and for scientists and engineers. We have not exploited that potential but we must do so in the future.</P>
    <P>We must not become hysterical or unduly alarmed with regard to pollution but we must be alert and prepared to take any necessary action.  As an island nation in the Community we must give a lead in dealing with matters like this.  We must not be unduly pessimistic.  Up to now, relatively speaking, our environment has not been polluted and we want to keep it that way.  We must ensure that we pass on to future generations the heritage we have now.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion tabled by the Minister for the Environment and if I make certain criticisms of the Minister and his Department I hope they will be regarded as constructive. This motion is one of the most important motions that has come before the House since I became a Member.  It has been put to me in the past that this subject is non-political and it has been said there are no votes in it.  However, I believe that in the coming years it will increasingly become an issue and will become more political.  I am delighted the Minister has taken steps to have the Paris Convention ratified by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised at the criticisms made by Deputy Molloy, who is not now in the House, with regard to the delay in ratifying <Col N="2444" /> the convention as the commission has been in existence since the early seventies. I wish to place on record &mdash; I do not wish this to appear too political &mdash; the advances made and the changes in attitudes that have occurred in the past 12 months.  Up to a short time ago we had little or no policy with regard to nuclear dumping but now we have a vigorous and vital role to play in the London Convention dealing with dumping at sea. As Deputy Avril Doyle said, we were very active in support of the Spanish resolution there which asked for the cessation of dumping at sea.  Two years ago that would have been unheard of and in the light of this development the criticisms voiced by Deputy Molloy were unfair.  Ironically, they came from a former Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment the many environmental groups who lobbied us and who were very positive in their approach. They asked us to take up issues with which many of us initially were unfamiliar but they worked hard to make sure we were briefed on the subject.  At all times they adopted a very balanced approach. Deputy Doyle mentioned the names of a number of the groups and I will not repeat them.  I should like to compliment some of the correspondents of the newspapers who produced well-researched articles.  There were also dangerous comments from certain people who tried to turn this whole matter into one big scare story but on the whole the correspondents did valuable work in making this matter an issue of concern to the public.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to be part of an all-party <i>ad hoc</i> group in this House who met the various environmental groups. Some months ago we met Greenpeace and we have been in contact with British Nuclear Fuels about the procedures they adopt.  As a result of our concern and our queries, we are now treated as a serious body.  British Nuclear Fuels have invited our group to visit the Sellafield plant, not to indoctrinate us but to inform us of their views.  We will listen to their views and draw our own conclusions.  It is an example of how a group of backbenchers can nudge and push people into making a matter like this a serious issue.  It is a <Col N="2445" /> great pleasure to us to see this motion before the House and I hope I do not sound too self-laudatory in saying that.</P>
    <P>One comment made during the debate was that the nuclear station at Sellafield should be closed.  That is not realistic. We have to take it step by step and the first step has been taken today in ratifying the convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>They can close the beaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different matter. If you aim for the sky you get nowhere. We have taken the first step in a programme to push governments and people into taking responsible actions.  This is a new approach.  As a nation we have the reputation of being careless and slipshod in our attitude towards the environment and a walk around the streets of Dublin, Cork or the larger towns will confirm this. I have met a number of foreign industrialists who have been discouraged by such evidence of our attitude.  Even at the basic level, our form of approach towards people who litter the streets is the wrong one.  Instead of handing out fines, the litter wardens should be in the schools educating our children about the problem of litter.</P>
      <P>We seem to be unable to tackle environmental pollution in an effective way. We do not have a national environmental protection policy and we have little strategy to deal with problems caused by industrial development.  At the moment we tend to react to crises without having any clear objective.  All the major problems seem to arise from what I term departmentalised thinking in relation to environmental protection and the Minister's speech is an example of that.  In the course of that speech he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Sellafield discharges it is therefore appropriate that the Minister for Energy, who has specific statutory functions in relation to nuclear matters, should take the lead role but it is, of course, essential that the interests of other Departments, including Environment, Health, Fisheries and Communications are taken into account.  Accordingly, inter-departmental <Col N="2446" /> consultative arrangements, involving also the Nuclear Energy Board, have been established and these have permitted full input of environmental considerations in the determination of national policy on this issue.</P>
    <P>That is the wrong approach as we require a nuclear energy protection agency here similar to that in the United States.  It has been a long-term ambition of mine to see such an agency operating here.  In raising the question of nuclear dumping over the last 18 months, various Ministers have answered questions on the subject and many Members were running around in circles trying to get information.  I question the efficiency at departmental levels in their approach to this matter.  It would be far better to centralise information under one agency.  There are local authorities dealing with these matters as well as Government Departments and they appoint their own specialists to interpret the rules and regulations coming within the sphere of their own interests without getting involved in the overall situation and with very little liaison.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency in the United States does an excellent job in providing specialist advice and in taking corrective action and which also is involved in long-term planning, which is very important.  I have been advocating this proposal since I became a Member of this House and I hope that we will have such an agency which will cover all aspects of environmental protection.  We should be planning and thinking of the environment and its management for the future.  Economic and social policies cannot be taken in isolation any longer without embracing the environment and its implications for them.</P>
    <P>Thankfully as the Water Pollution Act operates at present no company can set up a business without going through a select and difficult screening system with organisations like the IDA, An Foras Forbartha, the IIRS and local authorities. At least in that area the public can be assured that there is a professional approach and I hope it extends to all areas of the environment.  The most dramatic <Col N="2447" /> examples of pollution in recent times have been in water and, from reading reports of the Water Pollution Advisory Council, it is clear they have made a detailed study of the problem and that local authorities are reviewing and updating their plans for dealing with emergencies such as that in Ballyshannon in recent months.  Pollution of this type is caused through carelessness or ignorance.  I welcome the recent efforts announced by the Minister to educate people in the agricultural industry to the need for greater care in the use of chemicals and pesticides. At the same time, I urge local authorities to be ruthless with persons caught polluting our waterways.  The message has gone out loud and clear from the Minister and people polluting our waterways must be dealt with firmly.  The belief has existed for too long that irresponsible acts can be carried out without fear of detection or prosecution.</P>
    <P>In recent times, many of our well known fishing and tourist areas have been destroyed and I do not think I am being an alarmist when I say that loss of life could occur as a result of the contamination of our waterways.  I am aware that local authorities have financial problems but I do not think they are laying enough emphasis on environmental protection although there are notable exceptions. Local authorities will only react on the strength of public opinion.</P>
    <P>Over the last years there has been much debate about the effect of new industries on the environment while, at the same time, our largest home-based industry, agriculture, has developed greatly because of new technology.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the major problems which will face us in our programme for industrial development.  No specific problem of pollution can be taken in isolation because they are all interlinked. Our industrial development will be hampered unless we get a more responsible approach to the question of central waste facilities.  I am glad to see that the Department have made money available for the development of facilities at Baldonnel, and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism <Col N="2448" /> announced recently that there would also be facilities in the Cork area.  The absence of such sites in the past and the attitude of certain politicians who drummed up unnecessary fears posed serious problems, especially at a time when industrial jobs are badly needed.  Sites throughout the country can be identified and developed but only by surveys being taken by the Geological Survey Office and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  It is only by such a professional approach that the fears of the public can be allayed.  I hope this work will not be undermined by people who do not bother to get details of such facilities and cause unnecessary fears in the minds of the public, as has happened too often in the past.</P>
    <P>Our inability in the past to provide proper sites for the disposal of industrial and toxic waste has undermined our ability to deal with other countries in a proper manner in relation to the dumping of nuclear and toxic waste in the seas and oceans.  Unfortunately, that is confirmed by the Minister's contribution in relation to the London Convention when he said:</P>
    <P>While it does not arise directly under the Paris Convention, I think that I might refer briefly to the general question of dumping at sea of wastes, particularly the dumping of low level nuclear wastes, which is at present permitted under the London Dumping Convention.  The Government are opposed in principle to such dumping of nuclear wastes and at the February 1984 meeting of the London convention called on all signatory countries to strongly consider the disposal of any further low level radioactive waste on land.  The scientific and technical basis for the proposal made at the 1983 meeting to amend the London Convention to prevent the dumping at sea of low level radioactive waste is at present under review.  It is anticipated that the proposal to amend the convention will be considered at the September 1985 consultative meeting when the findings of the review will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that should read &ldquo;September <Col N="2449" /> 1984&rdquo; and perhaps the Minister would confirm that.  And this is the part I do not like:</P>
    <P>We are prepared to consider these findings but will not commit ourselves to accepting that they should be binding. Our attitude will be determined by our concern to ensure the immediate and long term protection of our population and environment.</P>
    <P>The reason we are inhibited in our approach to, say, Britain is our inability even at this stage to dispose of our toxic and industrial waste ourselves.  I have said so in the House on a number of occasions already and I am somewhat concerned about the Minister's statement here today.  Perhaps he will explain in replying why we will not be supporting the concept of the convention being binding. Perhaps I am being over-suspicious, but, until such time as we have properly managed sites to deal with industrial and toxic waste we cannot hope to be successful in dealing with threats of indiscriminate and irresponsible dumping of waste in the seas around us by other countries.</P>
    <P>One cannot isolate one mode of dumping from another because atmospheric dumping eventually contaminates our seas; they are all interlinked and interrelated. Therefore, if we are examining the question of dumping at sea we must consider that of atmospheric dumping. Atmospheric pollution has been a source of concern to environmentalists and legislators for some time because of its potential damage to human health and the environment.  As we all know, two of the more significant atmospheric pollutants are smoke and sulphur dioxide. These were the subject of an EEC Directive adopted in 1980.  In recent times the levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide generally have been such as to meet the requirements of that directive even in large centres of population such as Cork and Dublin, although in the Cork region on certain days the limits have been exceeded, such breaches of the limits being attributable in the main to meteorological factors and severe weather. Unfortunately that increase has been <Col N="2450" /> occasioned by the use of solid fuels for domestic heating.  That poses the big political question: should we think about the question of smokeless zones?  I do not think the position is sufficiently serious to warrant that consideration at this stage but we must be aware of the ever-increasing problem in our cities.  We must ensure that our local authorities have the will and facilities to keep a close eye on the monitoring of the situation.  This is an area in which environmental and energy policies will have to be co-ordinated at some future date.</P>
    <P>The question of acid rain is causing serious concern all over Europe.  However, as far as this country is concerned its present monitoring suggests that there has been a gradual increase in the acidity of rainfall because of atmospheric pollution in this and other countries also. However, those levels are not high and I do not believe there is any cause for much concern at present.  At the same time we must keep a close eye on what is happening.  We cannot ignore the problem because of the damage that can be caused by acid rain to our lakes, forests and buildings, which potential damage has been well documented in other countries. Strict EEC directives on pollution levels will have serious economic consequences for us because our air pollution legislation has not been implemented.  At present we cannot afford the clean air policy necessary to stop the upward trend.</P>
    <P>In regard to the disposal of toxic and nuclear wastes at sea and the disposal of nuclear wastes from land-based sources, the major industrial nations such as the United States when faced with such problems have taken the easy way out by deciding to dispose of such waste at sea. Even the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States, whom I praised earlier, at present seem to favour the burning of deadly substances at sea. In a recent article I read in <i>Time</i> magazine it appears the United States have already constructed three specially designed vessels for this purpose.  The disposal of toxic waste chemicals has taken place also by incineration in the North Sea, which was the subject of discussion <Col N="2451" /> here one evening on the Adjournment debate when we were concerned with the disposal of dioxin which eventually turned up in Paris.  Those vessels are owned by a waste management company.  At present there are many shades of opinion about the wisdom of incineration disposal at sea.  Opponents of this type of disposal &mdash; and I will not go into the technicalities of this area in great depth &mdash; say that it is not possible to attain the required 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit under seagoing conditions.  Their ability to fully incinerate such chemicals is questionable allowing the escape of dangerous chemicals such as dioxins which are highly toxic dangerous ones.</P>
    <P>I hope one will not be regarded as scaremongering but those questions must be posed and answered.  I should like to know whether our Government have had discussions with the American and European Governments about the operations taking place in the North Sea.  If allowed escape into the oceans these chemicals can affect fish and eventually human beings through the food chain.  That has been established scientifically.  Even in this House we have identified the sources of scientific studies that have taken place proving conclusively that as a result of the dumping of chemicals and nuclear wastes they eventually end up in the food chain.  There has also been expressed serious concern about the way in which the whole incineration practice is monitored. General opinion is that the vessels of these companies can sail out of a port, burn dangerous chemicals without any real monitoring of whether the operation is accurate, that there is no monitoring on the part of any government.  I may be proved wrong in that respect but I should like some assurances on what our Government have been doing in relation to this because it is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>On the question of nuclear dumping it must be clearly said that there have been too many accidents at the Windscale Nuclear Plant, accidents which have been proved beyond doubt, resulting in pollution of sea water and plant life.  Many questions have been raised about the effects of this pollution on the health of <Col N="2452" /> the population on both sides of the Irish Sea.  For instance, there is a suggested link, not confirmed, between an accident at that nuclear plant and the extraordinary incidence of births of handicapped children on our east coast.</P>
    <P>We must accept at this stage that the level of radioactivity in the Irish Sea is not yet so serious as to harm fish consumed here.  There is a possibility that dangerous levels could be reached either because of a further accident or because of insufficient knowledge of the problem. We are not just talking about discharges into the sea.  We are also talking about possible emissions into the atmosphere in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Dumping at sea has taken place withour proper research into the possible effects.  A number of scientific studies were mentioned in this House which raised serious questions which have not been fully answered at any stage.  They are on record at Question Time and on Adjournment Debates.  There is sufficient scientific documentation available to pose serious questions about the environmental impact of the dumping of nuclear waste at sea.  This has taken place in the Atlantic off the south-west coast of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Nuclear dumping, be it in land-based sources or at sea, has raised considerable political interest in recent times.  Dumping of nuclear waste is a huge international problem: it is not confined to the east coast or the south-west coast of Ireland.  Britain is allowing an operation to continue at Windscale which is not up to international standards.  Deputy Doyle went through the scientific evidence available and I will not repeat it.  She has raised technical questions which require answers.  The operation there is being used for part military and part civilian purposes.  It is using the Irish Sea as a dumping area.</P>
    <P>Britain has failed to carry out its responsibilities to the international community by establishing land-based dumping sites in Britain, but has preferred to use international waters for dumping purposes. Britain has been guilty on two counts; one is in relation to dumping at sea from ships.  Despite the Spanish resolution <Col N="2453" /> passed at the London Convention, Britain continues to dump.  Serious medical and environmental questions have been raised on these two types of nuclear waste disposal and no satisfactory answers have been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The cessation by Britain of dumping in the Atlantic off the south-west coast of Ireland did not come about because of pressure from this country or any other country in Europe.  Britain was not influenced by the motion passed at the London Convention.  This dumping came to a standstill because of pressure by environmental groups and ultimately pressure from the trade union movement in Britain stopped totally the dumping operation.</P>
    <P>In the past Britain used the Irish Sea as a dumping ground for its Windscale operation and will continue to do so unless forced to do otherwise.  There is a new awareness of the problem.  We must pressure everybody concerned to insist that Britain regulates its operation at Windscale and ceases dumping at sea.  I am not &ldquo;Brit bashing&rdquo; when I say that Britain has treated this country and its European neighbours with utter contempt. We have tolerated this behaviour for far too long.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Of particular interest at this time are the Paris Convention provisions in regard to the pollution of the marine environment through discharges of radioactive wastes.  Under Article 5 of the convention, contracting states undertake to adopt measures with the aims of preventing, and, as appropriate, eliminating pollution caused by such substances.  In implementing this undertaking, states are required to take full account of the recommendations of the appropriate international organisations and agencies regarding disposal of radioactive substances, including safety limits and monitoring procedures.</P>
    <P>There is a grave onus on Britain as a party to the convention to eliminate totally the discharge of nuclear waste from the Windscale plant.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any penalties which <Col N="2454" /> can be handed out to offending countries. I should like the Minister to let us know what penalties can be handed out to countries who breach Article 5 of the convention.  If the penalties are inadequate to force them to stop breaching the article, are there more effective ways to get them to act in a responsible manner? There was a precedent in the South Pacific.  When France carried out atmospheric testing of missiles and bombs, the Australian and New Zealand Governments took France to the international court at The Hague.  That threatened action forced France to cease its operations in the South Pacific.  Do we have to go that far to get Britain to stop these discharges into the Irish Sea?  Even with the pending ratification of the convention I am still very concerned about the attitude of Britain.  I am concerned that we have not got enough muscle to get the British to behave.  Their record in the past has shown that there have been cover-ups of accidents and they continue to act irresponsibly.</P>
    <P>A number of us will be visiting the plant in late June and we will be able to see at first hand what is happening there.  We will be told the official line, I presume, but we will draw our own conclusions. I ask the Minister to react to the suggestion about a national environment protection agency which would co-ordinate all the groups within the country. Would he consider suggesting to Britain under the terms of the Paris Convention a joint body which would monitor emissions into the Irish Sea while they continue? It will take time to have these discharges stopped.  Would it be possible to set up a joint monitoring body with Britain to monitor the discharges into the Irish Sea?  Would it be possible to establish a joint monitoring body to look at the dumping of nuclear waste at sea by ships?  The problem does not relate to Windscale only.  I should like to refer to an article under the heading, &ldquo;Major N-plant probe by EEC&rdquo; written by Dan Collins in yesterday's issue of <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> He stated that there are serious questions being asked about the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Cap de <Col N="2455" /> la Hague in France.  Bearing in mind the terms of the Paris Convention we should look at the consequences of the discharges from there.  We are not too far from that country and we should look at all implications for our nation.  I hope the criticisms I made are viewed as constructive and that the Minister will respond to them in the course of his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House on this issue because, like all Members, I welcome the motion. I give my personal endorsement to it.  I agree with most of Deputy Molloy's contribution. It is unfortunate that in the last 12 years various Governments did not ratify this convention.  The fact that we are ratifying it now is an indication of the increased awareness by the public of the danger to our marine resources from land-based sources.  The Minister's speech, and the convention, can be divided into two sections.  There are matters which the Government have control over and there are actions we can take to control the actions of some people.  They also deal with the discharges into our seas by people from other countries.  It is unfortunate that there is very little we can do about that except to continue to protest and try to prevent the dumping of nuclear waste off places like Cork, as we did recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last ten years various Governments have taken steps which have generally been successful but there is a danger of complacency.  On this issue prevention is a lot better than cure.  We are all aware of the damage that can be done to the tourist industry, the environment, the quality of life and the health of our population when pollution occurs but we can do a lot to prevent such happenings. Local authorities and fishery boards should, if possible, undertake a series of inspections to monitor sources of pollution in their areas.  I am referring to large septic tanks, council treatment plants and industrial effluent.  I accept that local authorities do not have the resources to carry out such work.  They were given the powers to deal with such matters but, unfortunately, were not given the finance <Col N="2456" /> to carry out inspections.  In regard to industrial effluent it is worth mentioning that the steps taken by Mayo County Council prior to the setting up of the Asahi plant in Killala proved successful. Their work is an example for other local authorities.  Many statements were made about what might happen to the bay but the fact that the council commenced monitoring of the bay prior to the industry commencing operations meant that public concern was eased.  That monitoring is continuing.</P>
    <P>Work should proceed on the selection of dump sites for toxic waste.  Selection should be made after consultation.  There is little use in consulting people after the choice has been made.  The fishery boards and local authorities should take note of unauthorised dumping and differentiate between deliberate and accidental pollution which can occur on occasions from a farm.  If one carried out a survey of the fines imposed by courts for such offences one would not see much difference between the penalties for accidental and deliberate pollution.  There should be a difference and the cause should be taken into account.  I know of farmers who spent thousands of pounds on anti-pollution measures but they were fined by the courts although people who lived close to them and had not taken any precautions got off.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the Windscale operation.  I wonder why it was necessary after so many years to change the name to Sellafield.  Like other Members I watched a very interesting programme on British TV &mdash; I am not certain of the channel &mdash; and I was astonished at the situation there and the difficulty the TV crew had in getting answers from the British Nuclear Board.  That programme proved beyond doubt, if proof was necessary, that the operation at Windscale is dangerous and that as a result of the spillages there was a substantial increase in radioactive levels not only close to the shore but also inland.  That tends to suggest that not only is the sea polluted but that a tremendous amount of contamination is being carried into the atmosphere. I have not the technical expertise to judge that programme, but when one <Col N="2457" /> takes into account the experts whom the presenters of this programme got to carry out the research, when one sees the experiments that were carried out on it, one would feel that the programme was a very accurate assessment of the situation in Windscale.</P>
    <P>Of course I accept the information which the Minister gives me in relation to the results of our own Nuclear Energy Board's monitoring programme which indicate that the exposure level from the source is less than 1 per cent of the annual whole body dose equivalent limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. However, with all due respect, coming back to a point raised by other Deputies, I feel that that is 1 per cent too high. Particularly a country that prides itself &mdash; as Britain does &mdash; on its contribution to the world should not deliberately set out to pollute the waters of a friendly neighbouring state.</P>
    <P>The Minister, quite rightly, pointed out the difference between the higher concentration of radioactivity in discharges from Sellafield compared to the discharges from other nuclear reprocessing plants.  One should keep in mind that not only is British nuclear waste being reprocessed here but the waste from other countries is being processed in Windscale.  I make no apology for saying that, unlike Deputy Allen, I agree fully with Deputy Daly that unless the Government are fully satisfied about this &mdash; obviously they are anything but satisfied judging by the terms of the Minister's speech &mdash; they should demand that Windscale be closed.  I am glad to see that the Minister, Deputy Spring, in February asked that the discharges should be discontinued as soon as practicable.  I would go further than that and say, in view of the research of the television programme &mdash; which was not carried out by RTE &mdash; that the Government should ask that Windscale be closed.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Sellafield discharges are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Energy, but something more than just the interest of other <Col N="2458" /> Departments should be taken into account.  He said:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, inter-departmental consultative arrangements, involving also the Nuclear Energy Board, have been established....</P>
    <P>That is not strong enough.  The Minister should establish a body who will have power, not just a body to have inter-departmental arrangements.  That suggests telephone calls and so on.  I hope that there is no dispute between the various Departments on this very important issue.  It is almost important enough for a Government Ministry and I think a Minister of State should be appointed to co-ordinate and correlate everything related to this very important problem.</P>
    <P>Let me disagree with both Deputy Doyle and Deputy Allen on their understanding of the Minister's statement when he said in relation to the reconvened London Convention:</P>
    <P>We are prepared to consider these findings but will not commit ourselves to accepting that they should be binding.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the Minister, because many of the people at this convention perhaps themselves will be dumping and at this stage I feel that there should be no more dumping at sea.  Nobody knows the effects on concrete, in which these things are encased, of continuous submersion underneath the sea at great depths.  There is evidence that in some cases the concrete has deteriorated and there are leaks in the concrete coffins, as they are called, in which the waste is buried.  I agree with the Minister that he should not commit himself in advance to accepting findings which might be completely contrary to the views expressed by this country.</P>
    <P>I presume that the Government will be seeking the complete abolition of dumping at sea.  I wonder what the Minister had in mind when he said:</P>
    <P>The issue of radioactive discharges will be further considered at a meeting next month of the commission established under the convention.  Matters to be dealt with include a proposal <Col N="2459" /> from Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark that states should be required to take account of the best available technology at existing and any proposed nuclear reprocessing plants in order to minimise discharges.</P>
    <P>What is needed is that under the Paris Convention a completely independent committee of experts should be established to monitor all the effects of the dumping and the existing discharges from existing plants so that countries like Ireland who really have not the expertise would not be under any disadvantage. While some people may say that we cannot afford the cost, my opinion is that we cannot afford not to afford the cost. Future generations will not thank us if we leave behind an environment that is contaminated by what would appear now to be acceptable levels of pollution.</P>
    <P>Like most Deputies I do not often have the opportunity of going to films but I made it my business recently to go to the one about the nuclear plant in America. It is suggested that the story is true but in any case it is very frightening.  We may take it that film makers dramatise to some extent these sorts of situations but this film portrays a horrific picture of the problems that can arise in relation to nuclear plants.  These problems are beyond the expertise of most of us so the only way to deal with them is to have established a body of the type I have suggested.  Such a body could be financed in the same way as are the administrative section who put into effect the Paris Convention, that is by way of State contribution as described by the Minister in his speech.  Until such time as there is such a body to monitor the situation there will be a lot of anxiety about the problem of nuclear pollution.  While we must be guided by the experts it is unfortunate that they are in the employment of people who have vested interests.  Therefore, it is a matter for the nations of the world to establish a body who will be neutral and who will be able to provide the best advice possible as to what is feasible and what is in the best interest of the people of the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2460" /> This motion is very important.  It is one that all of us here are agreed on in the main though we may disagree in respect of some details.  The Minister has told us that contracting states are required to forestall and, as appropriate, eliminate pollution of the sea by radioactive substances, including waste.  I do not think there is any way in which we can eliminate pollution that exists, but we can prevent it from happening again.  From now on we can demand that the problems that were associated with Windscale will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>In view of the large number of accidents that were associated with Windscale we should seek to have that plant closed.  The programme which was made by a British television company in that regard indicated that that plant is not being operated to the best scientific standards.  Its closure would prevent any further pollution of the Irish Sea which, as Deputy Molloy has said, has a considerably higher level of pollution than is the case on the west coast, for instance. That situation should be investigated.  We must insist either on Sellafield being closed or on proper standards being maintained there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in supporting this motion. Steps taken to deal with this problem from now on will be extremely important especially for us as an island nation. Apart from initiatives we may take ourselves we must put every pressure possible on other countries to adhere to the conventions relating to the prevention of pollution.  This will be all the more important in the years ahead because of increased industrialisation and, consequently, increased wastage disposal for which some dumping place will have to be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two aspects that I see in terms of this problem is first what we achieve in relation to the implementation of the conventions by way of requesting other countries who discharge these substances to maintain the highest standards possible. Up to now we have been surrounded by relatively clear waters but we must make every effort to ensure that that <Col N="2461" /> situation continues by way of getting commitments from the other parties to their adhering to the terms of the conventions. There may be some countries involved in those conventions who because of their geographical location or of some other factor are not as concerned as we are about nuclear waste.  If nuclear waste is dumped into the Irish Sea there is obviously a risk to the health of our people as a result of fish being contaminated.</P>
    <P>However, we must look to the situation at home too.  Up to now standards in this regard have been reasonably good but there has been a disimprovement in recent years particularly on the east coast where there is heavy industrialisation. This has caused pollution of the environment at a level that is unsatisfactory.  The south and west coasts are probably not affected as seriously by these problems.</P>

      <P>I have no evidence to suggest that parts used in motor cars, which are standardised worldwide, are a major contributory factor in such fires.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>On 27 January 1983, I announced in the Dáil that I would have an indepth inquiry carried out into the cost overrun on the IIRS Administration-Information Technology Building known as the &ldquo;A&rdquo; Building, at Ballymun.  The building which was commenced in 1979 was due for completion in 1982.  However, in August of that year it became clear that, while the funds allocated to the building were almost entirely spent, the work was far from complete.  The inquiry was undertaken by the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Collins, with the assistance of a panel of advisers.</P>
      <P>The report of the inquiry is, and was always intended to be, confidential and I do not intend to publish it.  However, I did indicate that I would make a statement on the matter here in the House which I now propose to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2467" /> The inquiry established that:</P>
    <P>(i)  When the first stage of the IIRS Ballymun building programme commenced in 1974, involving work amounting to £992,000, a contract was placed on the basis of competitive tenders.  It also provided for the retention of the contractor for Stage 2 of the work which related to the &ldquo;A&rdquo; building, subject to satisfactory performance. This is a common practice and can be the most cost effective method.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The contract for the &ldquo;A&rdquo; building was based on a bill of approximate quantities.  This provided an outline sketch of the estimated work and material that would be required but where the design of the project had not been finalised.  The use of unfinished design work and incomplete costings, together with the retention of the contractor for Stage 2 of the building programme was not an appropriate method of undertaking such a large capital project.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The design team headed by the outside architect grossly under-estimated the cost of the building and did not bring this to the notice of the institute until August 1982.  The Department were only then advised.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The board of the institute apparently gave only very cursory consideration to the &ldquo;A&rdquo; building project and accepted seriously defective reports on its progress and cost.</P>
    <P>(v)  The board and some members of senior management at the institute must be held to be negligent for: (a) failing to have the project fully designed and costed at a preliminary stage; (b) failing to examine in detail and to recognise the serious errors and inadequacies in reports furnished to them or to oversee the project properly; (c), failing to interpret information available to them which would have brought to light the under-estimation by their professional adviser; (d) operating an unsatisfactory method of <Col N="2468" /> determining the annual estimate for the institute's building programme.</P>
    <P>(vi)  My Department did not concern themselves with relating requests as they came for funds to the estimated overall cost of the building and must bear responsibility for not seeking the fullest possible information on the project. </P>
    <P>The inquiry has clearly established that there were major deficiencies in planning and monitoring the construction of the building.  I will shortly discuss with the board of the institute the question of appropriate disciplinary procedure.  The report of the inquiry set out procedures to be followed by my Department and the semi-State bodies under its aegis on future building programmes.  These procedures have been adopted with a view to avoiding a similar occurrence in the future.</P>
    <P>Because of the manner in which the building was planned, the changes to the design that were made during construction and the degree of extravagance in fitting out parts of the building, the final cost of £7.9 million will exceed the cost of Government accommodation of a similar size.  However, in its present condition the second phase of the building is unusable and, unless the situation is rectified, it would represent a wasteful use of Exchequer funds.  Accordingly, the Government have agreed that the building should be completed and fitted out at a cost of £1.422 million.  This amount has been provided in the 1984 Estimates for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The level of office accommodation exceeds the current needs of the Institute. I have requested the institute to examine the possibility of using the excess space for laboratory use and to report to me at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for such a comprehensive statement.  He will appreciate that I initiated this inquiry a short time before I left the Department because it came to my notice in August 1982 when a request came in for an additional £1½ million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be only too delighted if the Minister would agree to have even a very short debate in the House on this.  It is very unsatisfactory from my point of view at Question Time. I would remind the Chair and the Minister that when I originally brought up this matter the Minister of State, Deputy Eddie Collins, said the matter would be put before the House for a discussion. It puts me in a rather awkward situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider putting it before the House? Is there anything more in it that the public <Col N="2470" /> and the Members of the House are not entitled to know about? There are lessons to be learned out of this.  I am sure the Minister will agree with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just respond to what Deputy Reynolds has said? The formal inquiry consisting of a panel of advisers overseen by the Minister of State, was initiated by me.  I am aware that Deputy Reynolds during his period in office was concerned about this matter and initiated some preliminary moves to bring the matter to the surface.  I am not suggesting that he did anything less than fully perform his responsibilities in this matter. For the record, the formal inquiry was initiated by me.  As far as the debate is concerned I do not have sole discretion in that.  It is a matter for negotiation between the Whips as to what matter is the subject of debate in the House.  If the Deputy wants to initiate a debate in Private Members time he is free to do so. There have also been occasions when the Government allowed some of their time to be used for debates on matters requested by the Opposition but it would not be for me to give a decision on that matter at this stage.  It would be more appropriate, if that is what the Deputy has in mind, if he initiated moves through the normal channels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take that up through the Whips and have a discussion on it.  In case it might not come out that way, there are a few questions I want to ask the Minister.  He says the architect grossly under-estimated the cost of it. Will he tell the House how much the architect's fees were for this project and if they have been paid in full? Does he propose to take any action against the architect who grossly under-estimated the cost of the project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the architects' fees are concerned, I recommended on receipt of the report of the inquiry that the institute should seek to negotiate a reduction of the fees for the project.  This recommendation has been acted upon by the institute and I understand they have successfully negotiated a reduction in the <Col N="2471" /> fees.  I naturally would not wish to comment further as to legal liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister looked into it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I would wish the institute to pursue any legal means of redress they may have against anyone who may have contributed to the fact that this project, which was planned to cost somewhere in the region of £2.87 million when it commenced in 1978, has ended up costing £7.9 million.  One must make some allowance for inflation but clearly there was a major over-expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if there was a specific contract and a specific bill of quantities for this building?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that my original answer was rather long and the Deputy may not have picked up every nuance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want straight answers to straight questions.  There was an original contract but I understand there was no contract for the second portion.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me refresh the Deputy's memory.  The contract for the &ldquo;A&rdquo; building was based on a bill of approximate quantites and this merely provided an outline sketch of the estimated work and material that would be required.  The design of the project had not been finalised.  The initial contract was based on approximate quantities and an unfinalised design, some parts of which were changed during the course of building.  The fact that the design was unfinalised and that the bill of quantities was approximate led to the cost turning out to be a lot larger than the sum which was discussed at the time of the original contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the use of poor approximations is not appropriate in the execution of Government contracts? Is there not a <Col N="2472" /> lesson to be learned from this inquiry as to project management in the public sector? Has the Minister any plans to institute a totally new procedure so that this type of thing, which has happened so often in the past, cannot recur?  I am glad he is not putting the total blame on the IIRS.  Obviously there is a lack of communication.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What disciplinary action does the Minister propose to take against people who were negligent in not matching the request for funds against estimates for the job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily agree with the Deputy's implication that the procedures disclosed are quite unsatisfactory.  The report of the inquiry contained certain recommendations about future contracts designed to avoid a recurrence.  While I was unaware of this over-run, as the Minister for Finance I was responsible for setting up a committee on cost over-runs in public sector contracts.  When they reported to the present Minister for Finance last year they laid down a new set of procedures.  These procedures are now operative and will contribute to the avoidance of a recurrence of this type of exercise.  I would make no attempt to defend what has happened in this instance.  I am concerned at negligence in all quarters, both in the institute and in my Department and on the part of professional advisers.  I will be considering all of these together.  I will be initiating discussions with the board of the institute in regard to disciplinary procedures there and I will also discuss with the people in my Department the question of what would be appropriate within the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that there was no obligation on this institute and that generally there is no obligation on a semi-State body, to obtain sanction or permission from the relevant Department if they wish to involve themselves in substantial expenditure <Col N="2473" /> in the development of office blocks for their own use?  If there is not such an obligation, will the Minister take steps immediately to ensure that any semi-State body or other body using public funds would be obliged to obtain sanction before embarking on any contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wise to provide that expenditures, particularly on office accommodation, by institutes of this kind should be subject to prior approval by the Minister.  That should be the pattern.  I can see that in the case of capital expenditures of a kind more specifically related to the normal functions of the institute, as distinct from office accommodation, there would perhaps be need for less stringent requirements.  I would point out that the institute have to obtain sanction each year for their estimates, broken down as between capital and current expenditure.  That procedure always affords the Minister and the Department an opportunity to question or halt projects which in their view represent bad value for money.  It would be appropriate to have special procedures in regard to such things as office accommodation, which are outside what one would normally regard as an appropriate area of delegation to the board.  That would be my considered opinion.  However, I would need to do some work on the precise methods of making it operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the real problem is that there was not a specific contract and a specific tender for this job?  When the application came to me for additional expenditure in August I refused to sanction it and set up a preliminary inquiry.  I am glad the Minister took up the instruction I had given for a full inquiry before I left office.  It reveals that there was no specific contract for this building, that it was a carry-on of a previous contract, that there was no specific tender and that it was grossly underestimated by the architect, who claimed £1 million in fees.  Am I correct in that figure?</P>

      <P>I want answers to some straightforward questions.  First, what <Col N="2475" /> was the figure of the architects' fees? Was it £1 million or something near that figure? Secondly, what penalties will be imposed in future procedures which the Minister has referred to in respect of people who over-spend on particular projects? Thirdly, will the Minister agree there was no specific contract for this building and that there was no specific tender for the specific job?  That is where one of the real problems arose in relation to over-expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the last part of the Deputy's question, the answer is yes.  In regard to over-expenditure in future, we have initiated procedures as a result of this inquiry and as a result of the report to the committee dealing with cost overruns in the public sector which I initiated with the Minister for Finance which are designed specifically to prevent such over-expenditures in the future.  As to disciplinary procedures in this case, I have indicated I intend to discuss this matter with the institute.  However, I would not wish to make a general statement about disciplinary procedures because the appropriate discipline would tend to vary with the seriousness of the offence.  With regard to the architects' fees, I am not able to give the Deputy precise information as to the extent of the fees paid to the architects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that during a severe winter three years ago the major oil companies entered into an agreement not to sell oil on the home market that would freeze above a temperature of minus 9Cº?

I am not in a position to give detailed information on this matter. My Department are concerned merely in so far as the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are in a position to make standards.  Actual consumer protection by voluntary means would be a matter for the Department of Energy and I do not wish to discuss that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Standard No. 251. to which the Deputy has referred is a voluntary standard.  That means that if it is indicated by the seller of the oil that it complies with the IIRS standard, the buyer has a civil case against the seller if it is found that the oil does not comply with the standard.  However, this standard does not allow me to pursue people from the criminal point of view who sell oil that does not comply with the standard.  I am advised that it is not possible for me to make a mandatory standard in respect of which criminal sanctions could be applied because such mandatory standards can only be made under the IIRS Act where considerations of public safety apply.  It is the legal view that this problem would not come within the definition of an issue of public safety.</P>

      <P>In their review of the <Col N="2480" /> Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the National Board for Science and Technology made certain recommendations in relation to Irish standards which I am considering at present.</P>
      <P>I would point out that in the last few years the IIRS have considerably increased their output of Irish standards with which Irish-made and imported goods may comply.  Furthermore, an inter-agency committee, chaired by my Department, was formed over a year ago to identify priority areas for standards and to encourage the use of Irish standards.</P>

      <P>County Kerry is already designated for the higher level of industrial grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the Industrial Development Authority do not propose to establish County Kerry as a separate region for industrial development purposes. The existing regional structure, with County Kerry forming part of the south-west region, is beneficial to the <Col N="2481" /> county in that industrialists visiting any part of the south-west area normally consider County Kerry as a location for industrial investment.</P>
    <P>In September 1983 the IDA appointed an assistant regional manager to their new office in Tralee to accelerate industrial development in the county.  In addition, Tralee is being promoted as a priority town by the IDA.</P>

      <P>With all due respects to the Deputy, we have enough partition without introducing a new one between Cork and Kerry.  I am also surprised to hear the Deputy say that the Kerry region is attached to the Cork region.  One could equally say that the Cork region is attached to the Kerry region and I would not expect a subjection of one county to another in this regard.  The Kerry area within the south west region gets <Col N="2482" /> very careful attention.  The fact that in September the Government announced the establishment of a special office of the IDA is significant in that it represents a commitment on the part of the Government to assist Kerry people in developing the potential of their county to the maximum extent.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the seriousness of the unemployment problem and the prospective labour force in schools.  There is no denying that.  I would be hoping to see a situation in the relatively near future in which greater powers would be devolved on local IDA regional offices in the west and in other parts of the country to enable them to provide a one-stop shop, so to speak, for local small industrialists where all services for potential small businesses &mdash; whether they be services from the IDA or from other agencies &mdash; can be provided in a co-ordinated way in each of the regions, in Galway in this case.  That is the way in which we can solve the problem, by providing back-up services for the undoubtedly large numbers of talented young and not so young people in Galway who have ideas for the setting up of businesses.</P>

      <P>With the new special branch arrangement for the Cork city region, would the Minister agree that Buttevant is a much more deprived area where many people have been unemployed over the last three years, where whole families are now unemployed, where the total number of unemployed would now be about 200 people?

      <P>I recognise that there are problems in Buttevant but I never gave any undertaking such as the Deputy indicated.  Indeed all of these questions are a bit of a waste of time because Deputies on the other side of the House are each coming along making a special case for a particular part of the country. We must recognise that the unemployment problems this country faces are spread throughout the entire island and that doing a little bit extra for Buttevant by taking money from Galway, or doing a little bit extra for Galway by taking money from Monaghan does not solve anybody's problems.  We must endeavour to tackle this problem on an overall basis. While I am quite prepared to answer questions of the type asked by the Deputy <Col N="2486" />&mdash; which I know, by his selection of Buttevant will hopefully get him into the appropriate local newspaper as being somebody who is concerned about this matter &mdash; we are not really solving the problem by segmenting it into those of individual towns.

      <P>The attitude the Minister has adopted in the last few minutes amazes me.  Arising out of what he said would he not agree that there are different levels of unemployment in different parts of the country and that Deputies have a right to try to get out of the Minister what he is doing and what he proposes doing?  It is deplorable for him to come in here with a lecture like that &mdash; when he has taken no positive action in the last 18 months, when unemployment is at its highest, when the number of people working in manufacturing industry is at its lowest level in 20 years.  It is understandable that the Minister becomes irritated but to come in and lecture Deputies in this House on their fundamental rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> their constituencies is not good enough.  We know he has not been a success as Minister for Industry but he should not deny Deputies <Col N="2487" /> their rights in relation to asking questions. Will the Minister admit that there are different levels of unemployment around the country?  Will he admit the right of Deputies to do something for their constituencies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I have never questioned the rights of Deputies to ask these sorts of questions.  However, I do not think it is wise for us to assume that we can solve the problem by breaking it up into those of each individual town. The problem of industrial development is one that must be tackled on a global basis in this country.  It is not true to say that nothing has been done for Buttevant. I indicated to Deputy O'Keeffe that nine people are already employed by the company whereas he was asking whether or not it had been started.  Indeed perhaps Deputies might inform themselves about what is happening in their own areas before asking questions.</P>

        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> There may be a misunderstanding in regard to this, although some of the statements made were inaccurate. I do not believe in coming in here to discuss problems that should be discussed outside.  However, we had better get this into perspective.  What happened was that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition rightly raised the question of the £500 million, expressed his concern, felt the public should be told about it and that this should be explained to them. The Taoiseach offered to sit on Thursday specially to discuss this matter.  That was to facilitate a request from the Opposition. <Col N="2512" /> The Opposition have tabled a no confidence motion in the Minister for Finance which does not discuss the £500 million solely but also refers to the budget.  That is a Private Members' motion that could be dealt with next week if the Opposition so wish.  It is important to stress that the public and the Opposition rightly want to raise this matter.</P>

My recollection for a long time in the House &mdash; I am asking the Chair if a precedent confirms me in my opinion &mdash; is that a no confidence motion of this type is invariably given immediate priority by the Government of the day.  Surely I am entitled to seek from the Chair guidance on precedent as the Chair is the arbiter on precedent and the person in the House who keeps us all up to precedent.</P>

    <Title>Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources: Motion (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the terms of the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for the Environment.) </P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I welcomed the fact that the motion was before the House because it deals with the attempt by the Paris Convention to get agreement on regulations and rules <Col N="2516" /> in regard to the prevention of marine pollution.  The aspects to this problem are various and the signatories to the convention must combine in their efforts to prevent pollution.  We in this country in both our own initiatives and pressing for the implementation of the regulations must do all in our power to ensure that as far as possible we have clear water surrounding our coasts and the coasts of other nations who are signatories to the convention.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the problem of Windscale, now Sellafield, and Article 5 of the convention provides for regulations.  We must make it clear to other countries who are signatories to the convention that waste and leakage from such a plant is to be deplored and should cease at once.  This point must be brought home at every opportunity and at all levels because it appears, that while it has been brought to the attention of the British authorities and their relevant Minister, they have taken a long time to act and even then the action taken was entirely unsatisfactory.  Radioactive waste is a potential killer.  Previous speakers have mentioned its possible side effects, particularly on children and mothers.  After agreements are reached and regulations brought into effect we must insist that our neighbour, Britain, and other countries adhere to the regulations and do not agree to any tolerable level of radioactive waste leakage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal power to maintain vigilance in relation to water pollution lies mainly in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  The Minister referred to an increase in the number of licences allocated from 1979 onwards.  Are the local authorities examining this matter comprehensively enough and is the Minister himself satisfied that all regulations in this regard are being adhered to as far as possible?  Monitoring of water systems in many areas should take place regularly. This water pollution problem is somewhat similar to the litter problem with each person dropping a little bit of litter on the streets and thinking that another little bit will not make much difference. If small industries have small discharges of waste the bigger industrial <Col N="2517" /> concerns may think that they each can contribute their little bit to the general pollution without effecting damage.  If everyone thinks along those lines then gradually we will find ourselves in a worsening situation.  The further downhill we go in tolerating a higher level of pollution the harder it is to get back to the higher standards we have known.</P>
    <P>The cost of implementing the recommendations of the Paris Convention is in all respects only minimal.  We must make our voice heard and ensure that other nations sit up and listen.  Some nations which have little or no coastline may have vested interests and use areas near our seas for dumping some of their waste. Article 16 provides that the commission will make regulations and we must have our say in ensuring that other nations adhere to the principles involved in the convention.</P>
    <P>Another aspect to be considered is the implementation of regulations relating to oil exploration.  With all the activity in the Irish Sea on various sides in oil exploration and seeking oil wells and gas fields, we must ensure that effluent discharge from rigs etc. is monitored and that clear and defined regulations are enforced in regard to any effluent.  Consultation between contracting states must continue and monitoring of the situation must be on an ongoing basis.  At all times we must cross-check with the other countries and examine the situation to see what aspects of it can be improved or what troubles can be prevented.  While a certain level of effluent will be going into waters at all times we must ensure that this does not reach a level which will be harmful.  We must pay special attention to waste treatment techniques and ensure that sufficient finance is directed to research in this.  We must also examine water pollution control strategies.  Sewage and animal manures can be brought back to land for use in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the convention and the fact that this debate has come before the House.  I hope that it will awaken awareness in the public.  I hope that monitoring of waste will ensure that pollution <Col N="2518" /> does not become a tolerated part of our system as has been the case in certain other areas.  I hope also that the Minister and the bodies concerned in this will bring home to other nations which may not be quite as concerned about this as we are or who may have a vested interest in allowing waste disposal, the concern of this country.  I hope this debate will result in a greater awareness among the public of what is involved.  The question of water pollution must remain a priority. With increased organisation and industrial output the waters aroung our coasts will become polluted unless we are very vigilant.  If we allow pollution of our waters there will be no return to the present fairly adequate situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have anything dramatic to add to the excellent debate that has taken place so far.  I am sure the Minister has found the debate very interesting and that he has been impressed by the development of interest among all parties in the House in this issue.  I am adding my voice so as to indicate the unanimity there is among us here on this matter and also to strengthen the Minister's hand in any negotiations that may take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps no other country has suffered as much as we have suffered from radioactive waste pollution.  There was a good deal of opposition in the Pacific Islands because of the fear of dumping by Japan but dumping of radioactive material has been taking place off our south-west coast since 1967.  While we may have supported from time to time initiatives taken elsewhere, we have not been aggressive in opposing this dumping. Though I am glad we are now initiating the procedure for our ratification of the convention that has been in existence since 1974, it is surprising that we have not made such a move before now and that we have not adopted an aggressive approach internationally on the issue of the dumping of radioactive waste in the seas.  We must congratulate people like Deputy Allen and others who have been highlighting this danger for some time and who have made the Government <Col N="2519" /> aware of the deep-seated feeling among Deputies not only along the east coast or the south coast but throughout the country. The Irish Sea is the most radioactive sea in the world.  Sellafield has been described as the single most polluting plant of all the nuclear establishments. Radioactive pollution from Sellafield is being poured directly into the Irish Sea. As has been pointed out by a number of Deputies, that plant has been shown consistently to be inefficient, accident prone, using the lowest level of technology and not being an up-to-date processing plant. In these circumstances we must be on our guard constantly in so far as the dumping of waste from that plant is concerned.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we are not at any risk at the moment.  That is probably true and I have no intention of engaging in scaremongering but the point is that we do not know the rate at which the risk increases because all the waste that has been dumped remains dumped and remains radioactive while all additional waste increases that radioactivity.  The same applies to fish in the sea.  The level of radioactivity continues to increase. Similarly in humans radioactive levels increase as the years go on.  Therefore, the years ahead will be vital for our environment and for our very lives, certainly so far as the east coast is concerned but perhaps also in many other parts of the country.  This leads me to the system of monitoring and to the statements as to the levels of risk which I do not think are at all satisfactory.  One is at risk in at least three ways, first, from the possibility of air pollution such as that which occurred some years ago at Windscale following an accident there.  There can be such risk also because of east or north-east winds such as those we have been experiencing for the past two months.</P>
    <P>One can be at risk also from water pollution as a result of bathing in the sea should it be radioactive.  The present situation in that regard is of a very low level of radioactivity but a person bathing in those waters would be absorbing a small amount of radioactive substances.  Many people would not be at risk or would be at very little risk in the event of swimming <Col N="2520" /> only occasionally but there are people who are in the sea every day and these are the people who are most likely to consume more fish.  Obviously, they would be at a higher risk than others. Therefore, the level of risk is something that is relative.  We cannot determine an actual level of risk.  Section 11 of the convention provides that the contracting parties agree to set up progressively and to operate within the area covered by the convention a permanent monitoring system allowing for the earliest possible assessment of the existing level of marine pollution and the effectiveness of measures for the reduction of marine pollution from land-based sources.  I hope the Minister will proceed to ensure that our monitoring system will live up to the terms of the convention.</P>
    <P>One wonders whether a nuclear energy board whose purpose is to clear the way for the use of nuclear energy and whose entire thinking is on the lines of the great benefits to mankind of the use of nuclear energy &mdash; undoubtedly there are some such benefits &mdash; are the people who should be monitoring the dangers of nuclear waste.  I think the immediate attitude of the Nuclear Energy Board would be to minimise the dangers. That is the role they consider themselves responsible for carrying out. Some years ago the ESB were considering the setting up of a nuclear energy plant.  We may take it that the Nuclear Energy Board will be taking the best elements of reports and paying little attention to what we might regard as the worst elements in terms of pollution.  In addition, there are indications that the Nuclear Energy Board are accepting assurances, statements and statistics emanating from the British Nuclear Energy Commission.  These statements and so on should not be accepted at face value.  According to the Minister's speech we undertake a certain amount of monitoring but I should like to hear what form that monitoring takes, how regularly it is undertaken and what the results so far have been.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Allen in regard to the need for a nuclear energy protection agency that would be established basically <Col N="2521" /> to check that the environment is suitable and healthy for our people and is not being affected in a way that is dangerous by nuclear energy.  We would need to have the necessary expertise to undertake such a task.  Local authorities, especially those along the eastern sea-board, should have a specific role in the area of monitoring, that role to be under the direction of the Minister for the Environment because this is an aspect that relates to the Department of the Environment and not the Department of Energy.</P>
    <P>This deals with the protection of our environment, which is a job for the Minister for the Environment.  The Minister for Energy obviously is interested in nuclear energy, its uses for the future and for the ESB and its effects if used.  The job of the Minister for the Environment is precisely to monitor first the level of waste which we are putting into the seas around us &mdash; toxic and otherwise &mdash; and secondly the effects of dumping by other countries in the seas around us on the fish, food and marine life, particularly shellfish.  This should be done on a local authority level by the local county councils and borough councils along the coasts, not as individual bodies working on their own but with some liaison.  The specific officers in question should meet under the Ministers at regular intervals, perhaps once every six months, to compare their methods and results and see whether they could become more efficient.</P>
    <P>Our fishermen and their fleet could also be used in this light for testing and monitoring in our seas.  It should not be very difficult to provide them with the necessary instruments, or at least for them to bring back samples to be tested on shore.  Monitoring is a vital factor for which I see the Minister for the Environment as being primarily responsible.</P>
    <P>While the convention does not relate to dumping off the south-west coast, the Minister referred to it in his speech.  This must be referred to in the present context, because it is a blot on the entire Atlantic.  Other countries are amazed that we who are nearest to it have not been to the forefront in objecting to this <Col N="2522" /> enormous dumping which is now apparently in the region of 150,000 tonnes since 1967, when it began.  In the space of six years 40,000 tonnes were dumped.  In 1978, it was 8,000; in 1979, 5,400; in 1980, 8,391; in 1981, 9,400 and in 1982, 11,700 tonnes &mdash; ever rising.  The biggest dumper has been Britain.  Other countries dumping off the south-west coast have been Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium, but the UK is responsible for the vast majority of this dumping.</P>
    <P>Once this waste is dumped, it will be impossible ever to take it out.  If a better method is found one cannot remove it to some place else, or do something else with it.  Tests have been done by the Americans, who stopped dumping in the sea in 1970.  These show the precise method used by Britain &mdash; the concrete inside a barrel &mdash; is most unsafe.  At the actual dumping time in these tests one-third of the barrels were shown to have been crushed.  Many of the cement blocks also broke at that stage.  Over a period of years they became obviously unsafe and would open up the radioactive waste.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that these wastes disperse at sea.  That has also been proved to be incorrect.  It does not disperse, but goes down into the sea bed where various elements of small marine life absorb the radioactivity.  These are then eaten by bigger fish or sea animals, which are then eaten by others and arrive up through the whole scale of the food system, coming on to the table eventually.  The waste remains in the dumping area even in very deep waters in the Atlantic.  This dumping system has been stopped by everybody except a small number of European countries who are dumping off our south west coast.  The argument is very strong for a total ban on this dumping.</P>
    <P>On the point mentioned by Deputy Daly and some other Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side of closing down Sellafield, first I do not think that anyone will be in any doubt that the discharge from Sellafield must be closed off.  Some other system of disposing of the nuclear waste must be found, but the direct discharge into the sea in the first instance should be closed up.  The closing down of Sellafield might be a difficult objective to achieve, <Col N="2523" /> but there is a very strong argument for it. New technology is available to other processors of nuclear waste.  This reduces the level of waste, but is rather expensive. The people in Sellafield want to do the cheap job and do not use this new technology. They should at least be forced to close down until they do instal this new technology and have an up to date, modern, efficient processing plant.  We should force them to stop discharging at once and press for the closure of Sellafield until this new technology has been installed.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that we are endorsing the ratification of the convention.  Up to now we have been able to attend conventions on sea pollution only as observers. We shall now be able to be active and have our say and our vote in the convention which takes place next month in Oslo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice of welcome to this motion.  Every speaker whom I have heard today in the House has welcomed it.  It is unfortunate that at the same time as I am now speaking a legislative committee meeting is going on at which I have a number of subjects to discuss.  I shall be brief and hope not to go over every subject which has been mentioned.</P>
      <P>First, with regard to the picture being painted by Deputy Mac Giolla, although he did not attempt to be sensational we would all agree that its effect was frightening indeed.  I am aware, as he is, that the Americans decided in the seventies to discontinue the conventional system of dumping as still used by Great Britain.  It is appalling to think that this is still going on on such a large scale in the sea which adjoins us here.  What worries me most about dumping, whether in the sea or on the land, is that no matter what safety precautions are taken there is always an element of error, either technical or human.  For that reason this motion today will go a long way towards providing some system of checks and balances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Deputy Mac Giolla was speaking I was thinking about the possibility of error.  On 3 June 1982 some of the best <Col N="2524" /> technical equipment known to man, an early defence warning device, went off in California alerting the American defence forces to a nuclear attack by the Russians. It was discovered that a 39 cent microchip had failed.  One would assume that was a minor thing but the results of it could have been disastrous.  Three days later the same thing happened again.  If it happens with the most advanced technology one can imagine what could happen when certain countries use lower technology in the dumping of waste.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see in the Minister's discussion document that there will be consultation between the contracting states. I was also gald to see the joint programme for scientific and technical research, including research into the best technical means of reducing marine pollution from land based sources, the move towards a permanent monitoring system and the obligation on each state to assist each other.  I find it a little worrying that our contribution for 1984 is only £4,200, which seems to be a very small sum.  I would be afraid that it would reflect the intention of the group.  Larger funds should be made available for supervision and research.  I hope the Minister will clarify that point for us.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note that Ireland was participating to the degree that there were meetings and that we were working with technical groups prior to the formal ratification of the convention.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provisions of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, I believe Deputy Molloy mentioned a rather provincial issue, the pumping station at South Park in Galway, which is a controversial issue.  He stated he was not notified of the intention of the Minister for the Environment to visit the park.  I assume Deputy Molloy is telling the truth about this but I know that I received an invitation.  There was a large representative group from the area most affected by the sewerage outfall. Senator Michael D. Higgins also attended.  I want to assure Deputy Molloy that in his absence we made a very good case to the Minister.  The continuing effect of the present system, whereby raw sewerage being pumped into Galway Bay <Col N="2525" /> is being washed back towards the shore, was pointed out to him.  The residents in the Claddagh area are affected by this, particularly when there is a high tide and on very warm days when they are stifled by the smell as they go to Mass on Sunday.</P>
    <P>The residents recognise the need for some move forward but they object to the move forward being suggested: the location of a pumping station directly in front of their housing estate.  They pointed out to the Minister that the scenic view of Galway Bay would be obstructed by this large pumping station and that it would also curtail the use of the park for walking, football pitches and as a general recreational area.  I am not sure if it was brought to the Minister's attention at that time so I would like to bring to his attention now that there is a recommendation in America regarding pumping stations that they be sited approximately 500 metres away from any dwelling houses; yet the proposal in Galway is to site it 100 metres directly in front of houses.  We also pointed out to the Minister the likely effect such a pumping station would have because there would be a certain amount of noise and there would also be a smell. Considering the proposed location is 100 metres away from dwellinghouses one can imagine the effect that would have. There would be infestation of rats and flies.  Since this park is used for recreation it is hardly the place one would bring one's children to.</P>
    <P>The residents are now proposing that the whole project be reconsidered.  When the Minister visited the area he was sympathetic to the views expressed and he wrote to Galway Corporation, in whose hands the matter really is, and asked them to review the situation.  I believe Deputy Molloy inferred this morning that it was the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.  It is not.  It is at present the responsibility of Galway Corporation.  I was delighted last Saturday when Deputy Molloy joined me in the march in an attempt to get Galway Corporation to change their minds.  The residents agree that there will be a high cost involved in building a sewerage disposal unit on Mutton Island in Galway <Col N="2526" /> Bay.  They are willing to put up with the smell for a few more years until money can be made available to complete stages one and two.</P>
    <P>The other group of people who are frightened of raw sewage going into Galway Bay are those involved in the fishing industry.  They said it would have an adverse effect on mussels and shell fish in their area, so much so that they actually took their boats and sailed across Galway Bay to join the march last Saturday.  In relation to the effect of sewage on the beaches one can imagine that, if a tourist walking along the beach saw this unsightly view and got the smell, he would not be inclined to come back again.  I ask the Minister to write again to Galway Corporation pointing out our views.</P>
    <P>I, like the other speakers, welcome this motion.  In the Water Pollution Act, there is a general prohibition on polluting matter entering our waters.  I notice that the local authorities have handed out 1,150 licences for the discharge of matter into rivers and that licences may only be reviewed every three years or at an earlier date with the consent of the licensee. The Minister should consider having the licences reviewed every year and also the provision of funds to local authorities so that they can monitor pollution into our rivers much better than they can at present. Very little investigation was done into pollution of our rivers in the sixties. It was only in 1971 it was discovered that 17 per cent of our waterways were polluted. This was verified in 1973.  That amount of pollution is too much If our watchdog is to be the local authorities, funds will have to be made available to them.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in this project. I am somewhat concerned at the statement that the ratification of the contracting states does not necessarily make in binding.  I hope that can be reconsidered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has taken a very deep interest in the matter of marine pollution over several years, I do not share the optimistic view expressed during this debate that things are getting better.  We are at crisis level in regard to <Col N="2527" /> water pollution and I should not like this debate to give the erroneous impression that there is a level of toleration which this nation will accept and that, because conventions are established and rules and regulations exist, all is well.</P>
      <P>The main and most insidious pollution comes from Windscale.  The name change from Windscale to Sellafield is a public relations exercise to counter the bad publicity about that nuclear cesspit.  When that plant was initially established in 1947 its primary function was not the reprocessing of nuclear waste; rather it was planned to refurbish nuclear warheads and develop atomic strategy.  It is totally unsuitable as a nuclear reprocessing plant and the Irish Government should be unrelenting in their insistence that the plant be closed down.  The House may not realise that many billions are about to be spent in extending the Windscale operation, not to improve the safety aspect but to make it suitable to handle greater amounts of nuclear waste for reprocessing.  It is important to realise that it is a commercial, money-making exercise &mdash; last year its profits were £54 million &mdash; engaged in reprocessing material from Japan and other countries which would not engage in such a dangerous exercise themselves.  Nothing short of closure would satisfy me.</P>
      <P>I was accused during the Adjournment Debate in July 1975 of being alarmist in my views about Windscale.  The public attitude has changed but I am convinced that we will not realise the seriousness of this matter until radioactive seaweed is washed up in Skerries or Sandymount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of emission from Windscale is 1,000 times greater than the American level.  Who can monitor this?  I am not condoning the breaking of the law by the Greenpeace people but they highlighted the fact that higher levels of radiation were being emitted.  America and France do not tolerate these levels, yet we do.  I would have no doubts about taking this matter to the Court of International Appeal in order to highlight it and put pressure on Britain.  I know that the Minister for Energy met his counterpart in London and pressed the Irish case and <Col N="2528" /> that assurances were given.  That is not good enough.  Unless our officials are present at Windscale and have a direct input, our information will always be secondhand.</P>
    <P>The Minister listed various materials but there was little reference to the deadly pollutants caesium and plutonium, one tonne of which is lying at the bottom of the Irish Sea.  Any silt shifting around Windscale can drift across the Irish Sea.  It is fortunate that it is so shallow and that this does not happen but it is possible that there could be movement of this deadly pollutant.  People must realise that it will take hundreds of thousands of years for the radioactivity to fade away.  Sellafield is an international scandal which is totally unacceptable to this nation and there must be no stop-go policy whereby we appeal for lower levels of emission.</P>
    <P>A recent seminar on this subject was attended by experts from the Nuclear Energy Board and there was no doubt in my mind that the situation was far from satisfactory.  Three hundred accidents have been recorded at this nuclear dustbin less than 100 miles from this House.</P>
    <P>There is scant regard for the Irish point of view in relation to the operations of nuclear submarines in the Irish Sea.  All we seem to do is appeal for the safety of our fishermen, not realising that these deadly submarines are operating at will in the Irish Sea.  There are so many Departments involved that it would be easy to choke this issue with officialdom without any real attempt to put Ireland's case unequivocally, without apology, to England.</P>
    <P>Given our indented coastline, the perimeter of this island must run to many thousands of miles.  If we project it by, say, 50 miles, the square mileage must be very considerable.  We have a Department of Agriculture to look after the land but we have no marine Department.  We must think in terms of a Department which would address itself to the waters of this island nation.  The Minister for Energy and the Minister for the Environment are involved in this matter and there is some confusion about who is responsible. <Col N="2529" /> I think the Department of Health is the Department which has perhaps the greatest input here.</P>
    <P>Let us go back for a moment to 1975 or thereabouts.  At that time I do not think the Department of the Environment existed.  We had a Department of Local Government and the people there were engaged in local government administration, housing and so on.  Environment was a word in the dictionary and nobody was concerned about it.  It connotes preservation.  Only 15 or 20 years earlier the same attitude applied in the USA and so the Department of the Environment was born and of course everyone welcomed its birth.</P>
    <P>Now we as a nation are not looking to our fields with enough attention.  It is all a piecemeal approach with an input from several different Departments.  The thing to do &mdash; and I would like the Minister when he comes to conclude to take note of what I say &mdash; is to form a marine department.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous ramifications in relation to our fishing stocks, to nuclear dumping, to pollution of our waterways, pollution of our fields.  The thing goes on and on.  I had a period in the Department of the Environment as Minister of State and I remember the water advisory council.  With respect, I do not think the Department is able to cope with all that should be done.  A very excellent idea was put forward by the environmental protection advisory service, something that would be highly desirable, but the Department has now become a Goliath and the whole situation is so grotesque the Department simply cannot cope with all the problems.</P>
    <P>Now our marine life and our seas are very much involved and a great deal of international clout is vitally essential in this area.  Indeed, it would take the full weight of a Department on its own to have a forcible voice in Europe in the way the Department of Agriculture can make its voice heard and listened to in Europe, for instance, on the Common Agricultural Policy.  How can a splintered voice carry any weight in the sort of situation to which I have adverted?  There is a kind of parallel with that awful rabies <Col N="2530" /> disease which may hit this country at some stage in the future, perhaps in the not too distant future, and should that day come people will then sit up and take notice.  But let us try to do something now about our marine life, something positive.  People talk about the inversion problem of air pollution where one can go just so far.  Take the Los Angeles example where they are unable to cure the problem.  They have this inversion lying over Los Angeles.  It is said that marine pollution can reach the same stage, a stage at which it cannot be corrected. I remember attending a seminar in Geneva on the question of marine pollution and air pollution and there was no doubt at all in the views expressed but that marine life can be destroyed because marine pollution can reach the stage at which the levels of pollution lying on the seabed cannot be corrected.  Apparently that is the major problem.  The problem does not exist in inland waters because in those waters it can be corrected.</P>
    <P>In our case we have offshore pollution which is caused by the sly and sneaky way in which boats from England go out with a hole cut out in the centre of the boat and just discharge the waste through that hole off our coast.  A great many of these boats are being blacked in England and they have great difficulty now in getting them out of harbour.  That type of pollution can never be estimated.  Future damage cannot be estimated.  There will be a build up of low dosage radiation. The situation as it exists is in no way acceptable.  I represent a maritime constituency and so does Deputy Barnes and I am sure she will agree that Dublin Bay out as far as the Kish Lighthouse is intolerable from the point of view of pollution. It has been said that swimming in Dublin Bay constitutes a health risk. Sometimes comments like that can be very erroneous in a way.  One person will say one thing and another will say something quite different but unless we have the machinery to cope with a problem of this kind &mdash; and I do not think the machinery is there and this is the difficulty &mdash; the problem will only become worse.</P>
    <P>The intention is good.  It is a good thing <Col N="2531" /> to align ourselves with nations who are trying to do something but I do not think we have the necessary machinery.  We are in the unique position in Europe of being the furthest geographically in Europe, the most westerly country, surrounded by so much water, and so our voice should be put by a Department geared specifically for the purpose of coping with the problem of pollution.  We have a common accord with Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Greenland and Denmark as against the heavily industrialised countries of Europe and all these countries are being subjected to trans-global pollution of a very horrible type in the form of acid rain.  We are also receiving pollution, as the Minister is aware, from the Sellafield plant.  That pollution is travelling up along the coast of Scotland and reaching the beaches now.  The Minister is perhaps aware of the high increase in lukaemia cases in western Scotland. These are now being investigated.  They are apparently attributable to the plant at Sellafield.  Here there was the much chronicled report by Dr. Sheehan referring to the mongoloid babies as a result of the accident which occurred 25 years ago and there is enough evidence to cause concern.  Any pollution which contributes to blood cancer must be treated with the greatest care.</P>
    <P>Now I realise the Department is an excellent Department, doing a marvellous job within its parameters, and I shudder to think what the country would be like without this Department but we must think forward into the next millennium and here I would like to see private enterprise involved because there is a social obligation involved and it should not be left just to officialdom to provide the solution.  That is not good enough because I do not think officialdom can provide the answers even with the best will in the world.  Where officialdom is concerned it will be a matter of recommendation with no positive action.</P>
    <P>The Minister should involve commercial enterprises in doing something about correcting the problem.  That would be fine.  It is commercial enterprise that is involved and some unscrupulous people <Col N="2532" /> have scant regard for our environment. Why not swing it right round to them and make sure that part of their profits are devoted to the preservation of our marine environment?  I have little regard for people who abuse the environment and who are not prepared to pay something in recompense.  The Minister would get co-operation from many responsible commercial organisations who would be prepared to go along with this idea.</P>
    <P>Our seas are heavily stocked with fish, and with shellfish in particular which is a valuable resource.  That type of fish is the most prone to radiation from nuclear discharge. I do not want to be alarmist but in this House we should state the facts. The Minister must be aware that fishermen close to the Cumbrian coast realise there is great difficulty in selling fish caught in that area and notices are put up in some shop windows stating where the fish were caught.  That is the kind of atmosphere in which we live.</P>
    <P>There are 5,500 employees at the Sellafield plant.  It is a commercial enterprise and there is a vested interest in keeping it going.  There is almost an ironic acceptance of some level of radioactive contamination among the employees.  Their attitude is that it is their job and what can they do about it.  My answer is that we should not tolerate it.  It is not necessary to pollute the sea because much of the nuclear waste could be stored in the ground in especially constructed containers. As far as I am concerned, the Sellafield plant should be closed immediately but if it is to be resited at a capital cost of £3 billion that kind of money could be devoted to finding a practical means of storing the radioactive waste.</P>
    <P>I am a little sceptical about what the Minister can do to make sure our voice is heard on this matter.  I have spent a considerable time on this issue.  The worst outcome of this debate would be if we were lulled into a feeling of false security, that the levels of radioactivity in the Irish Sea or around our coast are acceptable and that the situation is improving.  That is not so.  In my view it is getting worse daily.  I do not think that the Department of the Environment can cope with this problem.  The best thing the Minister <Col N="2533" /> could do would be to give the House an assurance that he would recommend the establishment of a marine Department. In addition, he should request that his officials have a permanent presence at the Sellafield plant.  That is essential.  We are only begging the question if it is merely a matter of the Minister depending on his counterpart in England giving some tacit assurance that they will do their best to correct the problem.</P>
    <P>The Americans have the most sophisticated nuclear system on our planet &mdash; not that I am a fan of that kind of involvment. The Minister should try to persuade the Taoiseach to have a word with Mrs. Thatcher about the Sellafield plant which is causing such a major problem for us.  As recently as Monday an approach was made by one person regarding the tragic case in the Philippines, with a marvellous result.  I do not want to compare the two issues but certainly this matter is of monumental importance.  The Americans would not tolerate it.  It would be an enormous gesture of goodwill to this country if we could get an assurance that the Sellafield plant will be closed.</P>
    <P>It may be dreadful to say but I guarantee there will be more accidents if nothing is done.  I have scant knowledge of the matter but I have taken considerable interest in it: I have studied the equipment used and I have read the reports.  I am in no doubt that there will be more accidents.  There have been 300 accidents since 1947 and by the law of averages there will be more.  The matter is with the Minister and I hope he will take up some of the suggestions made.  He should not be content with anything short of closing the plant.  I urge him not to be persuaded otherwise or lulled into a feeling of false security by Britain with regard to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the ratification of the convention.  I hope to be more optimistic than Deputy Brady although I share his concern and I have admired his commitment in this area for a long time.  The convention realises that concerted action not only at national and regional levels but also at global level is <Col N="2534" /> needed.  As we advance further into this technological society we are reminded of the truism that we are a global village and that what happens in one part of the world can affect the other part, unfortunatley very often to the detriment of all. We are a small county and we are most vulnerable.  We have not the capacity or the clout needed to ensure that the levels of pollution in the future will be strictly limited.</P>
      <P>There is another area where we need concerted action and the sharing of resources to monitor this. Article 4 says that these programmes and measures shall take into account the latest technical developments.  Unfortunately, when technological advances have been made we reap some of the bad influences.  We need a shared, concerted, high level commission set up within this convention, not alone to eliminate and strictly limit present pollution but to make sure that the latest technical developments do not add to the problems we already have.  One of the areas where this could be done is in the permanent monitoring system referred to in article 11 which says that these programmes shall take into account the deployment of research vessels and other facilities in the monitoring area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brady rightly referred to the efforts of Greenpeace who have been a lone and courageous voice in speaking on our behalf.  I hope that the permanent monitoring system will have the deployment of research vessels and other facilities and that they will be used above and beyond the vested interests of single countries or single groups of countries. That is why I feel a sense of optimism.  In Ireland we have come very quickly from one of the cleanest and purest maritime countries to a polluted country.  This pollution has come from inside the country as well as from outside and, if this debate does nothing more than continue to raise the awareness of people to the problems involved, we will have achieved something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 12 says &ldquo;the contracting parties shall inform the commission of the legislative and administrative measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the <Col N="2535" /> preceding paragraph,&rdquo; which refers to the need for ensuring compliance with the provisions of this convention.  Will the legislative and administrative measures be strong enough to overcome the vested or nationalist interests of some countries?  The convention involves the contracting parties, as they are called, but to what extent will the commission be able to influence non-contracting parties or parties who are not part of this convention? Does the commission envisage having the legislative and administrative measures necessary to ensure that action can be taken against any country which does not bring down the level of pollution?</P>
    <P>Norway and Sweden are very striking examples.  They have had a tremendous commitment to cutting down pollution within their own waters and country from an industrial base, and yet, to their consternation, they find that because of lack of commitment from industrialised areas like Britain and West German their forests are now being demolished by acid rain.  They are invaded from outside.  Can the Minister give a guarantee that this can be safeguarded against because otherwise you will have the good guys and the bad guys and there is no point in some people keeping the rules if others, for selfish reasons, continue to pollute the area.</P>
    <P>Although we are a small country we have a high level of expertise.  Through membership of the EEC we have found that much research, development and expertise can be shared.  Article 16 says &ldquo;to receive and review information and distribute it to the contracting parties in accordance with the provisions of the present convention&rdquo;.  I do not know how specific the Minister's reply can be but I should like to know what kind of dissemination of information service will or has been set up which is more than just words on a paper or lip service?  Will we share to the extent that we will be brought up to date and will our voice be as loud and influential as that of other members? Unless our planet takes strong measures and penalties against offending countries or regions then we are living on borrowed <Col N="2536" /> time.  I am not being sensational but it is frightening.  Our planet cannot continue to be polluted at the present level without us all being strangled slowly and painfully. It is the height of arrogance and obscenity that when we talk about destroying the ecology and our environment we are destructive enough to not alone remove ourselves but everybody on the planet.  That is not alone flying in the face of our own survival but it is flying in the face of any creative God in whom we are supposed to believe.  It is a moral and urgent issue.</P>
    <P>I share the fears expressed here.  The Minister should take immediate action with regard to the pollution of waters by the discharge from Sellafield.  There has been evidence to show that it is affecting not just our coast but very northerncountries who are striving to remain unpolluted. We are talking about a level of radiation which will pollute and destroy marine life.</P>
    <P>Although not yet proven the high level of mothers of Downe's Syndrome babies from a class in Dundalk awakens the nightmare in all of us, reminding us that we are not just talking about our lifetime but also about the planning for the future of this and other administrations.  We are talking about a destructive force that will not alone destroy present life on this earth but which will deform, mutilate and bring unbearable agony on generations not yet born.  The whole question raises fears and anxieties.  Research to date, particularly that in America, renders it imperative that we take action not just immediately but for the future.  Bearing in mind our vulnerability to actions beyond our country on a European, even global level, I welcome the ratification of this convention, necessary and overdue. I also question the strength of the commission. I would hope that we will have a continuing debate, perhaps even a review in this House at regular intervals to ascertain how effective are our voices within the commission so that resources will be made available from this and other countries making their goal effective.</P>
    <P>We should make use of the experiences of other countries in combating our internal pollution.  Probably no Member of <Col N="2537" /> this House is too young not to remember when the waters around our shores were clear of pollution, when we did not have to build swimming pools because we could not swin in those waters.  It is a tragedy for and indeed deprivation of our young people today that they cannot safely and healthily swim in the waters surrounding us, something we cannot blame on outside interests.  It was incredibly bad planning that allowed the waters around our coasts to become so polluted.</P>
    <P>I too attended the seminar Deputy G. Brady attended, organised by An Taisce in Dún Laoghaire, which examined the whole area of Dublin Bay.  The bad new emanating from that seminar was indeed bad; there is not doubt about that.  One of the problems identified was that we did not appear to have carried out the right type of evaluation.  The other problem identified &mdash; something that should be taken into consideration in the way we monitor levels of pollution in Dublin Bay &mdash; was that there is a high level of lack of credibility among the people who inhabit that area about what is now being done. People do not believe that efforts are being made to eliminate the pollution; rather they believe it is being aggravated. The good news was that that seminar was crowded with people who were not alone committed and worried but who were also expert in this field.  There was an urgent request by the experts at that seminar for the establishment of a marine department, as Deputy G. Brady suggested, or a centralised department of research, development and evaluation, perhaps not actually under the aegis of a Government Department, embracing not just experts on the elimination of pollution but also those expert in the shell fish industry which has been practically murdered before birth.  The consensus at that seminar called for a co-ordination of all the expertise in that area, to be supported and given resources in order that pollution could be attacked in the urgent way needed.  It was also recommended that the whole area of marine biology, the whole of the fishing industry, be given the resources necessary to bring about <Col N="2538" /> that end.  Perhaps the Minister might respond to that point when replying.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that in the end the solution lies with the people &mdash; this is probably what keeps a lot us going at times &mdash; that the kind of world we want lies within the competence of its people. I believe that, if we are given the right kind of information, if the necessary resources are allocated and the experts allowed work properly, we will combat this problem &mdash; and there is some evidence to demonstrate that this can happen. About 1964 there was a type of world plan drawn up at a very high level by economists, futuristic planners and so on who projected a very high number of nuclear energy plants throughout the world, seen to be the answer to our energy problems for the 1990s.  Yet when people's consciousness was awakened, when they lobbied and protested, it was discovered that not alone was that source of energy not really needed &mdash; apart from it being highly dangerous &mdash; but that probably it also constituted one of the most costly methods of generating energy.</P>
    <P>The human being is an adaptable creature; that is why we have survived so long.  Healthy alternatives were sought and are being discovered.  Again and again we were told in regard to the whole area of nuclear energy stations &mdash; and this remains one of the main anxieties of people &mdash; there was absolutely no danger, that they were foolproof, that all systems were foolproof and could not break down.  Yet the accident at Three Mile Island occurred but, thankfully, the worst did not happen there.  However, that example illustrated to us, as ordinary people, that we could not believe the experts.  None of us, no matter how expert we may claim to be, can project, measure, evaluate the destructive danger we are building up in the whole area of radioactive discharges, nuclear power stations and so on.</P>
    <P>I add my voice to those calling for a total investigation of the Sellafield nuclear plant.  We would all contend that there are discharges of radiation from that plant polluting vulnerable countries like ours, Scotland, Norway, countries <Col N="2539" /> having no control over it.  As a neighbouring country we should and must have control over its discharges because there are levels of discharge therefrom which would not be acceptable in highly industrialised countries such as Japan and the United States.  It must be brought home to Britain that no longer can the Irish Sea or the North Sea be used as dumping grounds for an experiment, with a vested interest, so that a profitable industry can thrive in Britain.  I hope that is why we are ratifying this convention.</P>
    <P>Remembering its urgency this convention must vest powers in a commission. Because of our very special geographic position, because I believe we can still safeguard ourselves against the worst pollution, we must have an influential voice. I would urge that not alone should this question be kept under constant review but that we should have regular debates, truthful evaluations of pollution levels around our shores, ascertaining how the convention we are today ratifying and the commission are dealing with such levels. I join with other people in continuing to ask for honest accurate information. Above everything else, we must restore credibility to the people who have to live on this planet, and talking about it in this House, to the people of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I share the views of previous speakers and I am glad that a concerted action is now likely to be taken on the matter of nuclear waste, although I know this motion covers a broader area than that.  We cannot set boundaries to the scientific advancement of mankind. Nuclear energy has an important role in the future development of the whole world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who know very little about this are anxious about it.  They make up their minds on the basis of television programmes they see.  There were two programmes about Windscale which had a dramatic effect on the general public and caused the public tremendous concern. About that time the Eastern Health <Col N="2540" /> Board unanimously adopted a motion expressing grave concern at the possible implications of the Windscale nuclear plant and other nuclear plants in Britain for the public health of people here and the implications of the continuous dumpting of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea.  We asked the executive officer to seek a report from responsible and expert people, which he did.  He considered that the Nuclear Energy Board were the appropriate statutory body and he approached them and asked them to provide their analysis of the current situation and how we were being affected by what was happening.</P>
    <P>What they had to say was quite interesting. While I share the concern of other speakers, the report they furnished does not show a very grave situation.  Any element of nuclear waste is a matter of concern, but I do not think people are fully equipped to estimate its effects which appear to be a slow progression and a long term matter.  We can only go on what these people had to say.  They said:</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board undertakes a monitoring programme of the radioactivity levels of the Irish Sea. The programme includes the sampling and analysis of fish, seaweeds, sediments and seawater.  This report presents an estimate of the exposure of members of the Irish public during the period of May 1982 to June 1983 due to the consumption of fish and shellfish, the most important route by which exposure of the Irish public could occur from radioactivity, in particular radio-caesium, in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Radiation exposure from other pathways, such as external radiation, is negligible. The results are examined in terms of the dose limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the basic radiation safety standards of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The principal source of radioactivity in the Irish Sea is the discharge of low level radioactive liquid effluents from Sellafield, Cumbria, in the United Kingdom to the north-east Irish Sea. <Col N="2541" /> Discharges from other sources are, by comparison, negligible.  The location of Sellafield... include the Windscale nuclear fuel reprocessing works and the Calder Hall magno-type nuclear power station.  The prototype Advanced Gas Cooled Reactor, which was also sited there, has been closed down.  The radioactivity discharges arise almost entirely from the reprocessing activities and particularly from the used nuclear fuel storage ponds. Virtually 100 per cent of the radioactive wastes separated from the reprocessed fuel are stored on site and only extremely small quantities are discharged to the Irish Sea via a pipeline which terminates 2.1 km beyond the low-water mark. </P>
    <P>If I had not seen this report I would be very concerned.  They said:</P>
    <P>These discharge authorisations... are set so that, if they are observed, the dose limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection for members of the public will not be exceeded.  These latter limits have been included in the European Community Directive on the protection of members of the public and workers against the dangers of ionizing radiation.  The discharge authorisation for Sellafield was amended recently to require discharges to be kept as low as reasonably achievable within the authorised discharge limits. </P>
    <P>There was a major increase in 1974 in the quantities of radionuclides being discharged to the Irish Sea.  This was due to operating difficulties at the reprocessing plant which necessitated prolonged storage of magnox-type used fuel under water in the used fuel storage ponds.  This resulted in corrosion of the fuel and the release of radionuclides, notably caesium, to the pond water.  Pond water treatment facilities were inadequate and the quantities of caesium discharged to the Irish Sea increased.  This gave rise to alarm signal from the Irish people when they heard of this and saw this was happening. They said:</P>
    <P>The quantity discharged in 1974 amounted to about 50 per cent of the <Col N="2542" /> annual total beta ratioactivity limit and in 1983 about 20 per cent of this limit. A further significant reduction is expected during 1984 when a new ion exchange effluent treatment plant is due to be brought into service.</P>
    <P>That is very hopeful and good news about what is happening.  I am not in any way making allowances for the fact that it is happening at all.  We have been exposed to a high risk, but it is now being controlled and monitored by our own people as, indeed, are fish sampling and analysis. The analysis and sampling concentrate on plaice, whiting, cod, herring and prawns because these species make up the major proportion of the fish consumed by the Irish public.  They also said:</P>
    <P>The results show that the radiation doses of members of the Irish public arising from the consumption of fish and shellfish from the Irish Sea, are very small and are likely to be less than 1 per cent of the dose limits recommended by the ICRP and of the European Community basic radiation safety standards.  The doses are less than 2 per cent of the dose arising from naturally occurring radiation.</P>
    <P>The results show a small decrease on the levels of recent years and indicate a decreasing trend probably reflecting the reduction in the quantity of radio-caesium being discharged annually from Sellafield.  The monitoring programme enables the radioactivity levels of the Irish Sea to be kept under review and will be continued to enable trends to be identified. </P>
    <P>I agree with all my colleagues on the need for caution and I support most of what they said.  I want to make a point of supporting what Deputy Brady proposed. It is all right to have a Nuclear Energy Board, but we should have a marine research department, as he suggested. This could be of benefit not only in this area but also in many other areas, and it would be profitable for the nation if we were to fully exploit the wealth which abounds around our shores.  I support the motion and wish the Minister success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in welcoming the motion and I compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House.  I hope to see the terms of the Paris Convention honoured in the spirit and the letter when the motion is adopted here.  My one concern is that the Minister in his introductory comments referred to the existing monitoring of the Irish Sea being carried out.  The House will recall that at Question Time recently the Minister of State at the Department of Energy, and the Minister, told the House that we carried out some monitoring in regard to fish and that the main monitoring as to the quality of the Irish Sea was dependent on information supplied by British Nuclear Fuels to our Nuclear Energy Board.  That was the data that was being used here for monitoring.  On the two days when the matter was dealt with I expressed the view that it was a ludicrous situation for us, an independent island nation, to be depending on information regarding possible pollution of our seas from the pollutor.  In this case the pollutor is Winsdcale or, to give it its new name following the public relations exercise by the British Government, Sellafield. The changing of the name does not make the operation at that processing plant any more acceptable from our point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accepting the motion the House should call on the Minister to put pressure on the British to have that nuclear processing plant closed down.  We have been told in the past by British Nuclear Fuels, and the British Government, that all safety measures were being taken and the most modern technology was being used to monitor the situation.  We were told that there would not be any further leakages or accidents at Sellafield but six months following those assurances another incident occurred at that plant. Another board of inquiry was set up by the British Government into the operation of British Nuclear Fuels but the report that was published amounted to another whitewash.  It stated that the Government had been assured that no further radioactive waste would flow into the Irish Sea above the acceptable <Col N="2544" /> levels.  It is my view that no level of radioactive waste going into the Irish Sea is acceptable.</P>
    <P>Surely it is a nonsense that Japanese nuclear plants send their nuclear waste right across the world to Windscale for processing.  That waste is processed in a small amount of water, the Irish Sea. Why is it that our Government, and Parliament, accept that the British should continue operating that processing plant across the water from us?  Windscale is nearer to Dublin City than Galway.  It does not make any sense that we are not protesting and demanding through our membership of the EEC and as signatories to the Convention that the British close Windscale.  The position of that plant is unacceptable from an Irish point of view.  In fact, the excellent television programmes made by Yorkshire Television indicated that its location is unacceptable to people in that area because of the damage it is causing to citizens on the north west coast and in Scotland.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I had the opportunity of visiting the atomic research centre in Denmark and I was shown the damage being done to the North Sea and the Norwegian and Danish coastlines by the leakages from Windscale and the dumping of radioactive waste in the Irish Sea. Apparently, it works its way with the currents along the north west coast of England, Scotland and across the North Sea to the coast of Denmark and Norway. I am aware that those people are very concerned about this.  We should put pressure on the British to stop their nuclear operation at Windscale.  The closing of Windscale is not such an incredible thing to demand, because people in Great Britain are also demanding that it should be closed.  We should be giving support to those people.  We should commence our own monitoring operations in regard to the Irish Sea, fish life and our beaches rather than dealing with the matter in a haphazard fashion and depending on information from British Nuclear Fuels.  On two occasions recently we were told in the House that the monitoring of the Irish Sea was being carried out by British Nuclear Fuels.  That is a nonsense. We should also put pressure on the British <Col N="2545" /> Government in regard to the dumping of nuclear waste off our coastline, particularly in the South Atlantic, a few hundred miles off Cork and Kerry.</P>
    <P>When he signs the convention the Minister should implement a positive policy in regard to the disposal of toxic waste generally.  A facility for toxic waste was to have been provided here.  Deputy Peter Barry, in his last days in the Department of the Environment, agreed to a site for such waste at Baldonnel.  I questioned the wisdom of choosing that site but the decision had been made between the election of February 1982 and the time Fianna Fáil took office on 9 March 1982.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a proper toxic waste disposal facility provided, not so much for the treatment because we have not the quantity, but at least for the assembly of the toxic waste in one national depot for export to treatment plants that are available both within the UK and on mainland Europe.  It is essential that we provide that facility for our industry as soon as possible.  Without that facility the temptation for industry and for cowboys in the waste disposal business is to dump this toxic waste illegally in the rivers, in the sea and on the seashore with damage to fish life and the possibility of human damage also.  That is a major threat and the Minister should act, but I ask him to reconsider the decision that is there with regard to Baldonnel.  I understand and am aware of the details&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not getting into a Committee debate on the Baldonnel proposal. All I am saying to the Minister is that we should have as soon as possible a national toxic waste disposal facility available for the assembly of toxic waste from national producers of toxic waste and that that toxic waste, having been broken down into the various four or five international categories, should be in turn re-exported to treatment plants abroad.  Without the toxic waste facility the temptation is there for cowboy operators in the waste disposal business to dump along our coastline and in our rivers and cause damage to fish life and also possibly damage to citizens.  For example, we had a decision by Dublin County Council with regard to the proposal to dump asbestos in a site in Ballealy, Lusk. I threatened that I would take a court injunction against them if they proceeded because I was aware of the danger to people swimming in the estuary at Rogerstown and the threat along the whole coastline there to the number of people who go swimming at Portrane, Skerries, Rush, Malahide and the coastline generally. It is essential that the Minister proceed with a toxic waste facility as soon as possible, preferably not at Baldonnel.</P>
      <P>The Minister in signing this convention should honour it in the spirit as well as in the letter.  I am referring to the manner of sewage waste disposal and treatment plants for that purpose.  In my time in the Department and in the time of my predecessor, Deputy Sylvester Barrett, enough funds were being given for treatment plants for major sewerage schemes around the coastline, but since we left office many of the councils have been hiding under the present Government's financial rectitude umbrella and refusing to proceed with the proposals.</P>

      <P>The point is this.  I represent north County Dublin and part of the greater Dublin area with one-third of the national population in the greater Dublin area.  Part of the problem facing the local authorities in that area is to provide not just proper housing, roads, lights, bin collection etc. but also proper amenities.  Part of those proper amenities must be coastline and clean water.  To do that we need a certain amount of money for the provision of proper treatment plants to cater for the expanding population. The population within the Dublin county boundary is the fastest-growing in Europe at this stage.  The necessity for proper treatment plants to preserve the quality of the water on our coastline is essential and the need for money for that is obvious.  A number of major schemes for which I gave money when Minister have now been stopped because the local authorities are hiding under this umbrella of financial rectitude raised by the Minister for Finance in that Government. The Minister for Finance will probably be removed tomorrow with votes of the Labour Party who will be totally opposed to that money going astray.</P>

      <P>The treatment plant scheme to maintain and improve the quality of the water in Skerries has been stopped although money has been allocated and the scheme was going ahead. The same thing happened in Lusk.  There the waste is going into Rogerstown estuary. The population in Lusk village and upstream is expanding.  The same thing has happened in the Feltrim-Kinsealy area, again causing pollution of the coastline. The same thing happened in the Rolestown area which was to have a treatment plant to deal with waste going into the Broadmeadow River and in turn into the Broadmeadow estuary.  It is vital that, rather than just signing conventions and agreeing in this House &mdash; all very nice and laudable &mdash; we have the backup of funds and the implementation of the spirit of the convention rather than merely the letter of it.  I appeal to the Minister to be more liberal in his approach to the provision of funds for sanitary services treatment plants so that we may preserve and improve the quality of the water around our coasts.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister also to ensure that the Nuclear Energy Board undertake the process of monitoring instead of having us depend on information provided by the people who are the pollutants &mdash; British Nuclear Fuels.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Brady in regard to the possibility and the desirability of a department of marine development. That would be an important initiative for us as an island country.  It would enable us to maximise the riches and the amenities of the seas around us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue being debated today is of particular importance to us in County Louth because of our close proximity to Sellafield.  Recent rumours, warnings and threats have caused much fear and apprehension among the people of Louth, especially those in the Cooley Peninsula area.  I refer to the danger of fish life being polluted, to unusual sightings and so on.  The Louth coastline is very exposed.  Some medical people who <Col N="2550" /> undertook a survey in the area recently were of the opinion that a number of Downes Syndrome cases had their origin in the fifties.  While there has not been any clear evidence of this, there is the possibility that the radioactivity discharged from Windscale following an accident there during the fifties was a contributing factor.  A number of young girls who were attending a convent school in Dundalk at that time gave birth some years later to children suffering from Downes Syndrome.  We do not know whether this was coincidence but it is a possibility that cannot be dismissed.</P>
      <P>It is significant also that there is the highest rate of certain types of cancer in Louth.  This was discovered in recent times but we do not know whether the situation can be linked to discharges from Sellafield.  However, it is something we should examine immediately so that we might isolate the cause and put people's minds at rest.  At the last meeting of Louth County Council there was present a representative from the Nuclear Energy Board.  While what he said may have gone a long way towards putting people's minds at rest the fear remains that an accidental discharge from Sellafield could cause a catastrophe in the Louth area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no such concept as an acceptable level of radioactivity.  There is a real danger of discharged material from Sellafield accumulating on the seabed and perhaps manifesting itself later on the Louth coastline.  One shudders to think of the effects that could have on the health of the people of the area.  All these fears could eventually harm the tourist industry in that part of the country.  Until such time as the plant at Sellafield can be controlled properly and we can rest assured that there is no danger of a discharge, it should be closed.  The health of our people is much too important a matter to be jeopardised by the possibility of such discharges and we know that there have been accidents at the plant and that radioactive material has been discharged from it.  While these accidents may have been accounted for there is no guarantee of our ever having a foolproof system whereby we could be guaranteed that such incidents would not occur in the <Col N="2551" /> future.  Therefore, until such time as the situation is proved to be satisfactory we should seek to have the plant closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank all those Deputies who have contributed to the debate and who have shown such a deep sense of commitment to the issue in question. The debate has been wide ranging. I accept the genuine concern of all those who have spoken.  Some people dealt directly with the convention while others ranged beyond these terms.  However, the more than five hours that we have spent debating the ratification of the convention reflects clearly the interest among public representatives in this whole area.  I am very grateful for the various contributions.  If I am not in a position to deal directly with every observation that has been made, I can assure the Deputies concerned that these observations will all be considered.</P>
      <P>There are some points I should like to deal with now.  Deputy Molloy raised the question of the delay in ratifying the convention. When that convention was signed in 1974 we did not have any legislation that would have enabled us to accept the consequent obligations in full. However, once the Pollution Act of 1977 and the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, had been enacted the convention could have been ratified, but for a variety of reasons we are only now setting up the machinery to enable us to ratify it.  The main reason for the delay has been the succession of elections since 1981.  I could be a little political and say that one of the previous speakers, a Minister of State in my Department, had some responsibility for this delay.  Perhaps the opportunity was missed on a previous occasion.  Action should have matched the high concern demonstrated in the contributions here today, but it now falls to me to introduce the motion.  From what all the Deputies have said this appears to have the total acceptance of every side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we have not ratified the convention has not precluded us from participation in the annual meetings of <Col N="2552" /> the convention's commission and in the working groups.  In addition, we have been paying the normal subscription in the budget of the commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy raised several points, including the role of the Nuclear Energy Board in monitoring radioactivity.  I welcome this opportunity to clarify the position of this monitoring in the Irish Sea. Our own Nuclear Energy Board undertake a monitoring programme which includes the sampling and analysis of fish, seaweed, sediments and sea water.  Concentrations of radioactivity are measured in plaice, whiting, cod, herring and prawns.  These species constitute the major proportion of the catches from the fishing grounds in the Irish Sea and are representative of the types of fish and shellfish consumed by the Irish public.  In addition, these species are representative of those found near the bottom of the sea, those living in the middle depths and on the surface of the waters of the sea. Samples of fish and shellfish are obtained primarily at the Dublin and Howth fish markets and are taken from catches landed at the east coast ports of Clogher Head, Skerries, Howth and Arklow.  The frequency of sampling enables a reasonable estimate to be made of the radiological doses to the public as a result of eating seafood from the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Intercalibration checks are carried out with the Department of Pure and Applied Physics in Trinity College, Dublin, and the Department of Experimental Physics at University College, Dublin.  Samples of fish and reference sources are analysed in the three laboratories and show good agreement, which provides an independent basis for confidence in the reliability of the measurements obtained.  The results show that the radiation doses to members of the Irish public arising from the consumption of fish and shellfish from the Irish Sea are very small and are likely to be less than 1 per cent of those limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the European Community Basic Radiation Safety Standards.  The doses are less than 2 per cent of the dose arising from naturally occurring radiation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2553" /> The results for the period May 1982 to June 1983 show a small decrease on the levels of recent years and indicate a decreasing trend, probably reflecting the reduction in the quantity of radio caesium being discharged annually from Sellafield. The Nuclear Energy Board believe that the principal public radiation exposure arises from the consumption of fish and shellfish.  As I have stated, the exposure levels determined from this source are extremely small and indicate that there is no significant health risk to our public.</P>
    <P>The board's analysis of seaweeds, sediments and sea water taken from a broad spread of sampling locations around the east coast indicate that levels of radioactivity are of no significance.  A monitoring programme enables the radioactivity levels of the Irish Sea to be kept under review and will be continued to enable the trends to be identified.  That statement should bring some reassurance regarding many of the worries that Deputies expressed during the debate.</P>

      <P>I shall be delighted to give it to the Deputy as soon as I can gather the entire information.  Then he can react to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say that this Government, right from the time when they resumed office, have taken a very strong line in regard to the question of discharges of radioactive wastes into the seas in general and, in particular, in regard to such discharges from Sellafield, formerly Windscale.  This <Col N="2554" /> matter has been taken up by this country at the relevant international conferences. As I said earlier, the Minister for Energy asked for and obtained a special meeting with the United Kingdom Secretary of State for the Environment.  At this meeting the Minister put to him forcefully the Irish view on the subject.  As a result, Mr. Jenkins agreed to the Minister's proposal for improving consultations at administrative levels and for the notification of incidents involving departures from accepted procedures.  He also accepted the need for greater research into the long-term effects of these discharges and undertook to keep the Irish Government informed of progress in this research.</P>
    <P>As regards the dumping of radioactive wastes into the Atlantic, the United Kingdom have temporarily suspended such dumping, pending the completion of a scientific study to be carried out within the context of the London Dumping Convention.  No great dumping has been carried out by Great Britain in 1983, or up to this period of 1984.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, the lead Department in this whole area of nuclear energy problems are the Department of Energy.  There is no conflict, as Deputy Brady would suggest, between Departments and no lack of interest and no confusion entering into the situation because of the interests of other Departments, such as Health, Environment or any of those mentioned.  The Department of the Environment are the appropriate Department with whom to take up these matters regarding discharges from Sellafield. The many comments made in relation to that problem in this debate will certainly be taken up by me and I shall make the Minister aware of the concerns about these problems which have been voiced by many Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy stated that the level of radioactivity in the Irish Sea has been reported to be 100 per cent higher than the level found in Galway Bay.  A study carried out in 1982 and 1983 did, in fact, establish that the levels in the Irish Sea are significantly higher than in Galway Bay.  However, I have already stated the exact position.  I have covered this aspect <Col N="2555" /> fairly adequately.  It is natural, with the problems with Windscale or Sellafield over the last year or so, that levels in the Irish Sea would be somewhat higher than on the west coast.</P>
    <P>As a representative of a maritime county on the east coast, I can assure the Deputies that my interest in this area is as acute and high as that of any Deputy in this House.  We, too, in Wicklow represent a constituency which depends not only on its fishing industry but also on its tourist industry for part of the economy of that county.  We are every bit as concerned that the citizens either visiting the county or living there are not exposed to a high level of radiation that could damage them either now or in the future. My interest in this whole area is heightened just as much by that fact as by my concern as Minister in the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for confirming what I said about the level on the east being 100 per cent higher than in the west.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that if it is negligible or nil in Galway Bay, then it could be one hundred or one thousand times higher than in the Deputy's area. I am more concerned about the level in the Irish Sea which is greater than that in Galway Bay.  I am reliably informed by people in the Department of Energy that in carrying out their investigations there is not a hazard to life due to the level in <Col N="2556" /> the Irish Sea.  This has been under continual monitoring and if the trend changes that certainly will be made known to the general public and action will be taken.  Action will be taken if the source is located as being from any particular direction, particularly if it is Sellafield or any other area.  I assure the Deputy that the monitoring of the level in the Irish Sea is continual and is spread over a number of locations.  As long as I am in the Department of the Environment and have some influence with the other Departments that will certainly continue and it will be closely watched to see that there will be no change in the wrong direction.  We hope the change will continue to be in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy suggested a committee representative of all relevant private sector bodies and concerned citizens to monitor all developments in the environmental area and to co-ordinate activity.  I am prepared to consider this suggestion.  I would, however, point out, in relation to water pollution, that we have the water pollution advisory council which is widely representative of public and private interests. I addressed the council at 1.30 today and suggested to them that they might pay particular attention to Ireland's international obligations under the various conventions dealing with marine pollution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Avril Doyle expressed disappointment at the statement in my brief that we will not commit ourselves to accepting the findings of the review being carried out under the London Convention in regard to dumping of nuclear waste at sea.  The Deputy missed the point here.  Deputy Allen had the same impression that we were not committing ourselves fully to the findings of the London Convention.  Deputy Calleary got the situation quite right.  It is intended that we should keep our options open in case the findings of the review are considered inadequate from our point of view or do not recommend the strict kind of controls we wish to see.  Deputy Doyle and Deputy Allen can rest assured that our approach will continue to be opposition to the dumping of radioactive waste at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2557" /> With regard to the comments made by Deputy Molloy about Galway Bay the impression I got was that my Department had designed and were preparing to implement a sewerage scheme which would ruin the amenity and the fish life of Galway Bay.</P>

      <P>The impression was clearly given that my Department were the Department implementing this whole scheme and imposing it on the people of Galway.  I assure the Deputy that is not the case.  In 1983 Galway Corporation's proposals for a sewerage scheme were sanctioned and finance was allocated to them.  The corporation since decided to consider the matter further.  I know this is as a result of pressure brought by public representatives from all sides of the House.  I have made it clear that the loan which was already approved would not be lost while this reassessment is being completed.  At this stage the ball is in the corporation's court and there are no proposals before my Department.  I am waiting for an indication from the corporation of their views.

Surely it is the Minister's responsibility to ensure that sewerage schemes are properly designed and that adequate provision is made for the treatment of sewage effluent?

      <P>The scheme sent by Galway Corporation was approved by the Department of the Environment.  I assume that concerned representatives from the area would know what they wanted and would see what the plans for the area were.  They would certainly be aware of what was coming to the Department for approval.  Since I came into the Department I believe I have taken the action the representatives asked me to take, that is, to visit the area at the first opportunity.  I have done that.  I have asked the corporation to take another look at the situation.  When I get their new consideration of the proposals I will decide if we can approve them.  As I said, the money made available for this scheme is being held until that reconsideration takes place.  I am quite fair in my attitude to the corporation in relation to the approaches made by public representatives and the general public when I met them in Galway some months ago.</P>

      <P>Very good.  Deputy Allen took the opportunity to present a wide-ranging review of our organisational arrangements for environmental control of the various programmes operating in this area.  The time available <Col N="2559" /> would not permit me to deal with all the points made in relation to waste, litter, air pollution, chemicals and so on but I will study his remarks with interest and take account of them where appropriate in reviewing the various programmes.</P>
      <P>Pollution in Dublin Bay was mentioned by Deputy Molloy, Deputy Barnes and others.  While a number of monitoring results in certain locations on occasions exceeded the mandatory standards set out in the EEC directive on the quality of bathing waters, the coastal waters in Dublin Bay do not, in the opinion of the health authorities, constitute a threat to public health.  Monitoring for the purpose of the EEC directive is carried out at two locations on Dollymount beach during the bathing season.  Since 1978 full compliance with the requirements of the directive has been achieved and analysis of the monitoring shows that results are well within the EEC parameters. I know there has been media speculation regarding the possibility of health risks associated with bathing at various locations in the bay.  The Eastern Health Board are satisfied that there is no public health risk, even allowing for a number of monitoring results at certain locations which exceeded the mandatory standards for bacteriological analysis.  It is useful to assure people who may have got a different impression that the Eastern Health Board, the responsible body for monitoring, are satisfied that there is no public health risk from bathing in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Deputy does not feel it is satisfactory. The situation in regard to effluent has been improved over the past few years. All the authorities bordering the bay have been asked about the preparation of a management plan for Dublin Bay. We are not satisfied to leave things as they are and want to see that they are improved.  Certain changes have taken place, such as the improvement at Corbawn Lane in Shankill where EEC standards were exceeded in the past.  A £7 million treatment scheme has been completed there.  The long sea outfall at Shanganagh which came into operation in the autumn of 1983 will ensure that the area will be improved.  I am satisfied that there will be a steady improvement in Dublin Bay.  The Eastern Health Board have informed us that there is not, as the Deputy suggests, a grave health hazard in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have covered the point as best I can but apparently I cannot <Col N="2561" /> reassure Deputy Molloy.  I assure Deputy Daly that our contribution of £4,200 to the Paris Commission budget does not represent any lack of commitment on our part to the objectives of the convention. The Commission budget caters mainly for the permanent secretariat, office accommodation and clerical expenses. Budget requirements for each year are determined by the Commission and, in accordance with the rules of procedure, are subject to adoption by contracting States.  Under these rules each state is required to contribute 2.5 per cent of the adopted budget in a balance proportionate to gross national product.  We are paying our full contribution as determined in accordance with this formula. Ireland hosted a technical working group meeting of the Paris Convention in February last at a cost of approximately £10,000 and we will be hosting further meetings in the future.  It is a question of paying a proportion of the adopted budget and there is no need for concern about the amount.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen spoke of the imposition of penalties on states which contravene the convention.  The discharges from Windscale could not be said to contravene the terms of this convention.  However, even where there is a contravention the question of imposing a penalty does not arise.  Each contracting state binds itself to ensure compliance with the terms of the convention and any dispute about implementation can be referred to the commission or to arbitration.  The ultimate sanction is the force of international opinion.  The annual meetings of the Commission give us the opportunity to state our case for stricter controls in an international forum and to attempt to mobilise support.  This is important from the point of view of small countries like ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barnes asked if the Commission would have power to enforce the provisions of the convention.  It is the contracting states who bind themselves to accept and implement the convention provisions.  We will have a voice and a vote in the deliberations of the Commission which will have equal force to that of any other contracting state.  International <Col N="2562" /> agreements of this kind do not operate on the basis of imposing penalties or sanctions on those who do not pull their weight.  There is a growing international concern about matters such as this and we must look to this concern in the last analysis to enforce the adoption of reasonable standards by all countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady's main contribution dealt with the Sellafield problem.  I have covered that area in my reply.  There is absolutely no conflict between Departments in this area.  The Department of Energy look after nuclear energy problems. I do not see that there would be any benefit in setting up special Departments for every problem.  We are constrained by the Constitution to have 15 Departments and if we set up one Department we must do away with another.  It is incumbent on anyone who suggests setting up a new Department to say which existing Department should be amalgamated with another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>We are considering that.  I think Deputy Burke was pushing the debate a little far when he suggested that we set up a toxic waste disposal plant.  That has been decided but it will not be at Baldonnel and it is incumbent on those responsible now to suggest the location.  I am sure many others would like the Deputy to tell us where the alternative site is.  Anyway the decision has been taken and work is proceeding in that direction.  A number of areas were mentioned and it was claimed money was indicated for treatment works around the country and, as far as I could gather from Deputy Burke, in North County Dublin. The amount of money being allocated by my Department for sanitary services in 1984 exceeds that previously allocated by any Minister and I shall be glad to compare the activity in that section of my Department throughout the country with the activities of any previous Minister. Every county is benefiting from sanitary services allocations this year and the allocations are more generous than those previously made despite the stringent times in which we find ourselves.</P>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I am glad it has been accepted by both sides.  As I said, we are all interested in curbing pollution and the decision to approve this convention is one step forward towards ensuring that the war against pollution is being carried on vigorously by this Government.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5&mdash;(1) Section 45 of the Principal Act is hereby amended as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  by the substitution, for the words &lsquo;on the vesting day&rsquo; where they occur in subsections (1) and (2), of the words &lsquo;with effect from the vesting day&rsquo;; and</P>
      <P>(b)  by the insertion, after the word &lsquo;designated&rsquo; where it occurs in subsection (1) (a) and (1) (b), of the words &lsquo;whether before, on or after the vesting day&rsquo;.  </P>
      <P>(2)  Paragraph 13 of Part I of the First Schedule to the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution, for the words &lsquo;on the vesting day&rsquo; where they last occur, of the words with effect from the vesting day'.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to empower the Minister for Communications to correct errors and omissions in the list of staff of the Department of Posts <Col N="2569" /> and Telegraphs who were designated by him in December 1983 under section 45. In an exercise involving some 30,000 staff I suppose it was inevitable there would be some errors in names and possibly in wrong designations as between An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  Unfortunately section 45, as enacted, did not empower the Minister to make the necessary corrections now but this amendment will empower the Minister to make such corrections now.  Errors may have occurred in first or second names or in designation as between one section or the other.  This amendment will enable the Minister to make the necessary corrections and that is all that is involved in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister elaborate further in relation to the effects on staff.  The explanatory memorandum explained that this was a technical Bill to give clear effect to the intentions of sections 56 and 57 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State must be aware of the lengthy discussions and negotiations that took place here between the Minister, the POWU and other unions in relation to the status of the transferred staff. He is also aware that promises were given by his party to members of the staff that they would not lose their Civil Service status.  I am concerned that this new section will pose a question mark so far as the staff are concerned.  Will the Minister state if the unions have been consulted in relation to this matter?  They will be directly representing their members.  There is a danger that this Bill is not detailed enough.  I should like the Minister to state clearly why this provision is being included now and why it was not included in the Bill when it was first circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Department have been considering this situation for the past six months.  The Bill was published and printed on 4 April 1984 and within a few weeks several amendments have been put before the House.  I am concerned that there may be some sleight of hand operation with regard to the 30,000 people who have been transferred.  I have <Col N="2570" /> serious reservations about including this section unless the Minister clearly indicates the background to the changes required.  I ask him also to explain why a Bill that was printed on 4 April has been changed to such an extent.  The whole concept of the Bill has been changed as a result of the revision of the Title.  It is broader in scope than the Bill that was circulated to us and the explanatory memorandum did not refer to revision of this section.  I should like the Minister to indicate clearly why this change has been made.  If we had been notified of the change we could have consulted with the unions involved to get their views.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why, after all the discussions that went on for the last couple of months since vesting dates, the Department, the lawyers and everyone involved could not come up with a Bill which was complete and would not require the amendments before the House today.  I accept that the majority of amendments are technical and relate to actions which were taken against the Department and by the Department against individuals and that those actions are now being taken by the two semi-State organisations.</P>
    <P>I accept that from the legal advice received by the Department and both organisations it was necessary to have a revised Bill, but I regret that necessity.  It is a reflection on the Bill which went through both Houses of the Oireachtas in 1983 and which was debated at length in relation to most of the sections.  Some of the sections were not discussed in detail and this highlights the difficulties in this House.  In major legislation there is a very good case to be made for a committee system of going through a Bill. This Bill was highly technical and has resulted in this mish-mash of changes which, I believe, is unprecedented in the history of the State.  The Bill was passed less than a year ago, came into operation on 1 January and has been revised by this Bill which has been further revised and amended since it was published on 4 April.  The Bill has been changed by the insertion of an amendment relating to the staffs of both organisations.  The Minister of State should clearly indicate to the <Col N="2571" /> House in detail how this section will affect the 30,000 people who, so readily and willingly, transferred to both semi-State organisations on 1 January 1984.</P>
    <P>Since that date I have not received any complaints from the employees on the way they have been treated by both boards.  I commend the board for the sensitive way in which they dealt with the personnel of both organisations and the transfer.  However, we must bear in mind that there was serious concern that they were losing their Civil Service status. Why has this section been inserted at this stage and what provisions in relation to the transfer of staff have now been included which could affect the principles governing their transfer on 1 January? This is a very important section and I regret that the Government have decided to amend the Bill so radically and to change its whole concept at this stage when we had ample opportunity to bring a correct Bill before the House.  This Bill has been changed radically and dramatically by the insertion of that section and the Minister should elaborate on the background to the changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I categorically assure the Deputy that it makes no difference to the safeguards, guarantees and so on which were laboriously worked out as far as the staff of the two boards were concerned. The unions have been consulted by the boards about this.  It is by no means a radical change and does not affect the transfer in the slightest.  It is regrettable that it occurred and the reason it is in this laborious from is that the final advice from the Attorney General was only received after we had moved Second Stage.  Otherwise, the amendments could have been made before that in the original Bill as introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 30,000 staff transferred and a list had to be compiled before the vesting date.  There were some mistakes made.  Take the case of a small post office somewhere down the country where the telephonist might have been working for the postmaster.  He or she might have been put on a list under An Post instead of Bord Telecom Éireann.  Little mistakes <Col N="2572" /> were made and this legislation is necessary to correct them.  I can give a categorical assurance that the major issues which were introduced are not changed.  I accept the legislation is cumbersome and I am sorry that it had to be introduced in this fashion but it is understandable that errors are made when a staff of 30,000 is involved.  This is to put right the errors to follow the purpose of the original Bill.</P>

      <P>I hope that some of the points which I made on Second Stage will be dealt with by the Department.  I wish to thank the Minister for clarifying some of the points already raised on Second Stage.  However, I still feel that the major points which I made in relation to that are still not resolved.  I appeal to the Minister to publish the Swedish report on the billing system for telephones.  Since the Second Stage, Bord Telecom Éireann have brought in a new accounts system which has been circulated to all their customers, and I welcome that.  I also welcome the new changes which are being proposed and which will be implemented very soon.  To allay public fears the Swedish report in relation to the billing system should be published, because I do not see why the Minister and the Government should conceal a report <Col N="2573" /> which has been paid for by taxpayers' money.  People who are disputing their accounts would be happy to see it and the Minister has not clarified why 40,000 accounts are being seriously challenged in Telecom Éireann.  The Minister and his Minister of State should take a personal interest in the telephone accounts system as it affects consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the visit of President Reagan to Ireland has highlighted this question.  I should emphasise that this Bill is not in the nature of a campaign against the Reagan visit. Rather it is something we believe should be part of our code and practice for visits of any Heads of State of similar capacity or with similar equipment and that its provisions should apply to all foreign leaders with nuclear capability.  For example, if President Chernenko of the USSR had similar equipment then those provisions should apply to him or to any other Heads of State who have nuclear powers and who have such equipment with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When President Reagan visits this country at the weekend he will bring with him equipment capable of unleashing nuclear weapons on Europe.  This consists of codes and related materials necessary for him to order the launch of nuclear missiles and bombers.  The equipment is kept in a brief case which is handcuffed to the arm of the United States army officer who accompanies the President everywhere he goes.  When the President stands in this Chamber on Monday next it is fair to assume that the black box, as <Col N="2574" /> it is called, will not be far away, that the United States army officer carrying it will certainly be within the precincts of this House.</P>
    <P>It is fair to assume that the other nuclear powers operate similar systems. It has been said by Dr. Francis Barnaby, a British nuclear physicist, that rival powers target their nuclear weapons on the black box of opposing powers.  Therefore, in all likelihood &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ireland will be a nuclear target for the Soviet Union this coming weekend.  In fact, on Monday next, probably this House will be the target if what is said is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a neutral country.  Recent public opinion polls have indicated that the overwhelming majority of Irish people <Col N="2575" /> are committed to Irish neutrality.  As a neutral country offensive equipment of this nature should not be allowed on our territory.  We must defend our neutrality at all times even though that does not seem to be done by our MEPs in Europe.</P>
    <P>In accordance with replies given to parliamentary questions in this House by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs the Irish Government did not even raise with the United States Authorities their plans to bring this equipment of death with them.  It is obvious that it would not be brought with the President unless it was intended to use it and that it will be used in Ireland if the need arises.  Thus, for three days, Ireland will be the possible launching site of American nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>This Bill is introduced in defence of our neutrality; as is stated in the Bill itself, that is its purpose.  Probably Members of NATO would have no objection to having the American alternative command centre on their territories as already they have American bases on their territories.  But how can we hold up our heads with other neutral nations such as Sweden or Switzerland?  Would they allow a whole military command centre &mdash; especially one capable of launching nuclear war on their territory &mdash; to be sited on their territory and still maintain that they are neutral countries?</P>
    <P>Of course we are not suggesting that foreign Heads of State should not bring communications equipment with them to enable them to keep in touch with their capital cities &mdash; there is no problem about that and there never has been &mdash; but what we are saying is that specific equipment, which has no other purpose or role than the discharge or facilitating the discharge of these weapons of mass destruction, should not be allowed on Irish territory.</P>

      <P>The Government oppose leave to introduce this Bill.  Very simply, this matter has nothing to do with Ireland's neutral position outside of military alliances.  I am glad that Deputy Mac Giolla has said that his approach in this matter is not by way of opposition to President Reagan's visit but, if one takes this somewhat further, an invitation was issued by the leader of this country to President Reagan to come here in a similar way in which invitations are issued to other Heads of State.  It is normal practice that Heads of State of nuclear nations, when they leave their countries and visit others, are accompanied by communications equipment and so on in order to keep them in touch with their capitals.  If we adopted the view suggested by Deputy Mac Giolla, then essentially what he is saying is that any such people could not come here, because what will happen here is not in any way exceptional.  The position is that we are merely permitting the United States President to adhere to the routines which are customary on his visits to any other state.  In so doing he is not in any way calling into question our position of neutrality.  Therefore, there can be no question of the Government agreeing to the introduction of this Bill.  The effect of agreeing to the proposals put forward by Deputy Mac Giolla would be that President Reagan could not come to this country. May I say that it would not be just President Reagan who would be precluded from visiting here but the Head of State of any other nuclear nation would be placed in a similar position.  I suggest that that would place this country in an absolutely ridiculous situation and, on <Col N="2577" /> that basis, we cannot accept that this Bill has any merit.</P>
      <P>May I reiterate that the situation that will arise will not in any way affect our neutral position outside of military alliances.</P>

      <Col N="2578" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Reynolds on Tuesday, 29 May 1984:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to proceed immediately with the building of the briquette factory at Derryfadda, Ballyforan, County Galway and in the national interest to take all measures necessary to secure the maximum development of the potential of our bogs. </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on Amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;endorses the action of the Government in having a thorough examination carried out of the economic viability of the proposed briquette factory before a decision is made to proceed with the project and notes that in this examination full consideration is being given in the national interest to the maximum development of the potential of our bogs.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned on this motion last night I was speaking about the importance of the bog industry to the economy.  In 1946 Fianna Fáil acknowledged that by setting up Bord na Móna who have proved to be a very successful organisation in the interim years.  Today they employ 6,000 people and have an annual payroll in excess of £50 million.  We can see how important that direct employment is to our economy.  If we are to have any redundancies, or if the Government or Bord na Móna fail to avail of an opportunity to expand and develop by using our natural resources, we can see the amount of money which will be lost in the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Ballyforan I should like to state that Bord na Móna were working on that project up to 4 p.m. yesterday evening.  At that time an emergency meeting of all the staff was called and <Col N="2579" /> workers were told that Bord na Móna had made a decision to postpone the building of the factory for another year. It is obvious that if Bord na Móna were working on the project until 4 p.m. yesterday evening it was not their intention to postpone the building of the factory. I understand that briquette sales from the various Bord na Móna factories were higher in the first quarter of this year compared to the corresponding period of 1983.  The argument put forward by the Minister for Energy that Ballyforan would not be a viable project falls flat on those facts.</P>
    <P>A major difficulty has been created in the west due to this decision not to go ahead with the building of the factory. There is a big threat hanging over some service companies there.  I am aware that a company that supplied some of the engineering equipment for the proposed factory will be in a weak position if they are not selected for other projects in Dublin and elsewhere.  In fact, the company could go out of existence.  Many small companies in the west are in a similar position.  The decision in regard to Ballyforan will have a detrimental effect on the economy in the west.  We have had many meetings with Ministers and Ministers of State in the last year, but the same attitude was adopted at all meetings. When we met Minister of State Collins we were told that the matter was under review and a decision would be made as soon as possible.  Last August we met the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy J. Bruton, who told us that a decision would be made shortly. When we asked when that would be, he replied &ldquo;As soon as possible&rdquo;.  When we asked if a decision would be made in 1983 he sniggered, as only he can, and said that our question was a silly one, that of course a decision would be made in 1983.</P>
    <P>Had the Fianna Fáil representatives in the west not consistently and persistently in recent months put pressure on the Government I doubt if we would have a decision yet.  Yesterday evening we were given the sad news that this major project was being postponed.  This type of political procrastination is the hallmark of the <Col N="2580" /> Coalition Government.  We have witnessed an economic withdrawal from the west and the decision in regard to Ballyforan represents the start of a move against the west.  Scarriff was closed down because the Government refused to make £80,000 available and the Connacht Regional Airport was not given the money that was expected.  Operations at the Tuam sugar factory are being curtailed and staff have been transferred.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to give a firm commitment to the tolerant workers of Bord na Móna, to the seasonal workers who do not have jobs, to the farmers who own the bogs and to the people of the west who have been responsible for providing services to Bord na Móna over the years, that the factory will go ahead sooner rather than later.  He should announce to the House that after 12 months the Government are committed to giving the same amount of economic investment to the west that they have given to the east and other parts since they took office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies on both sides of the House who contributed to this debate. They have demonstrated the concern felt by all at the difficulties facing Bord na Móna in their efforts to build this factory which had promised to bring such benefits to the local communities in an area where options are limited.  Exploitation of an indigenous resource, particularly where the employment given is long term and stable, is a prime enterprise and there is great disappointment on all sides at the shadow overhanging the Ballyforan project. It has been the hallmark of the present Government that State boards should carry out their responsibilities to the full and manage their affairs with competence and effectiveness.  It is only to be expected then that the board's approach to new projects must be prudent at all times, especially in an uncertain economic and financial climate.  The timing of such projects must be determined by two things &mdash; the board's ability to pay their way and the existence of a market for the product.  Revenue must be sufficient <Col N="2581" /> to meet all costs; money spent on new development can only be recovered through sales of turf, milled peat, briquettes and moss peat.  The level of borrowing required to fund new development, especially at a time of high interest rates, makes investment in new projects financially hazardous.  Such investment if not soundly based could seriously threaten the board's solvency and because of this all new projects must be very critically appraised.</P>
      <P>The debate in the House has focused quite rightly on the consequences for the social and economic life of the area if the Ballyforan project does not go ahead and, as a rural Deputy, I can understand their fears in this regard.  The Tánaiste and the Government must, however, have regard to two aspects of this project &mdash; to the optimal use of the important indigenous fuel source that is peat and the prudent use of scarce and expensive finance for capital projects to ensure that the best possible use is made of both.  The Government, the Minister for Energy and I recognise our responsibilities in regard to these two duties.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the role and value of peat as an indigenous fuel source of very great value to this country, not only in terms of import saving in respect of expensive oil or coal, but in the safety and security of a supply within our own country.  I am conscious, too, of the 30 years of employment afforded and of considerable economic underpinning to the regions affected and indeed the degree of prosperity that it brought to these regions and to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of Bord na Móna in the decades since the mid-thirties is one of the success stories of this country.  It is more than that, more than a success story, it has been a pioneer, and it has been emulated in other places where peat resources are available.  In more recent years, the Government have shown their faith by approving the third programme on which Bord na Móna are now engaged.  This was done in the face of rising costs, of scarce capital resources, of increasing interest rates, virtually at times to crippling proportions, and of the very great risk that these ever-increasing <Col N="2582" /> costs, fuelled also by a very adverse inflation rate, could push Bord na Móna projects well beyond budgeted costs.</P>
    <P>That, too is a problem which this House and the Government cannot be unmindful about.  It would be reckless in the extreme not to pay full regard to the need for viability and effectiveness in investment decisions.  Economic development, the growth in the national product, the affording of new opportunities for employment, these are one side of the equation with which Government must be concerned.  The other side is to achieve this effectively, within economic viability and by not depriving other areas of Government investment or activity by cost overruns, by unviable projects, by non-competitive enterprises.  Spokesmen on the Opposition benches devoted much of their comments to the first half of this equation; not as many are equally as realistic or as pressurising in relation to the second.  I think the times we are in demand that they should be.</P>
    <P>The rationale of the board's existence is to produce peat and thereafter to create arable land.  The first responsibility of the organisation must be to implement a national programme of peat development whose main features are the annual production of around five million tonnes of fuel peat for use in electricity generating stations and briquette factories and sod peat and briquettes which are sold on the domestic market.  It is this programme which provides the context for Bord na Móna's current activities at 21 locations around the country today, and it is the milled peat from this programme that is being used to increase the output and extend the existing electricity generating stations at Shannonbridge, County Offaly, Lanesboro, County Longford, and the power station at Bellacorick. Additional sod peat under the programme will be used to offset to some extent the reduction in output from existing sod peat bogs as they become cut out.</P>
    <P>The programme also provides for a major increase in horticultural production. Export sales of horticultural peat of the order of £12 million made a useful contribution to the revenue of Bord na Móna and our balance of payments last <Col N="2583" /> year.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are a major industry employing 6,234 persons on average throughout the year.  Apart from providing employment directly, the programme also generates spin-off employment in engineering construction and allied industries.  The consequence of this on the economy in the catchment areas of all the board's enterprises has been substantial.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds has asked about cutaway bogs.  The position is there will be 10,000 acres available by 1990, and by the year 2000 a further 20,000 acres.  The area is mainly in Kildare and Offaly with a further 5,000 acres in the western counties of blanket peatland which could be used only for coniferous forestry.  Over the past ten years Bord na Móna have been applying research to pilot scale developments in conjunction with the Forestry and Wildlife Service and An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <P>The work of the committee is necessarily slow in that they have to monitor application of the information received from technical studies to actual experiments.  Results to date show that the most attractive options are forestry and agriculture and very significant area will be made available for these.  The technical, scientific and economic results are to hand.  Cost input models are being put together by Bord na Móna and will be into the Department within two months.  It will be necessary to look at the wider issues of funding and the sociological aspects of ownership before a final report can be issued.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are a very successful company but also a very vulnerable one. Harvesting is subject to weather conditions and year to year fluctuations in output occur primarily because of weather conditions during the drying season, which causes substantial stocks to be carried. Land acquisition is a very slow process. Essential lengthy processes of drainage and development mean that there is a lead-in time of up to seven years before a bog can come into production.  The outlay on these can create a very heavy burden on the board's finances.  Most <Col N="2584" /> important too is the fact that the source of about a half of Bord na Móna's revenue comes from the ESB where peat faces severe competition from imported oil.  Since the mid-seventies Bord na Móna have spent £78 million on this programme and have proposals to spend a further £82 million to complete the programme in about three years' time.</P>
    <P>In the early years of the third programme the Exchequer financed by way of repayable advances the bulk of Bord na Móna's capital requirements.  Since 1978, however, when the Fianna Fáil Government rejected the suggestion of Bord na Móna that the interest on these advances should not be waived for a further five years, Bord na Móna had to meet the expenditure on their development programme and related capital charges mainly by borrowing.  This cutting off of Exchequer advances combined with withholding, delaying or reducing increases recommended by the National Prices Commission on an allowable costs basis which was the short-sighted Fianna Fáil policy during the seventies, expressed through the action of the then Minister for Energy, created the seeds of Bord na Móna's problems and caused a very heavy burden of debt to build up which put severe financial strain on Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>It was only when the last Coalition Government took office in 1981 and it was seen that the board were not in a position to remunerate their capital borrowings that a review was undertaken, in conjunction with the board, of their financial needs in the context of their development programme.  This was the first attempt to come to terms with the fact that the only revenue available to Bord na Móna must come from the sale of their products and that to continue the policy of restraint on prices which had been practised by the previous Government would mean that further finances would not be available from lending institutions and the entire development programme would be jeopardised.  This review was continued in 1982 by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government and I am glad to say resulted in the four phased market price increase.  Such a large <Col N="2585" /> increase would, of course, not have been needed if realistic increases had been introduced gradually over the years.</P>
    <P>A considerable improvement was expected in the board's finances from the implementation of the four phased price increase.  Based on certain assumptions at this stage, the board's financial projections showed that they could implement a capital programme which included a 150,000 tonne per annum briquette factory at Ballyforan while meeting the capital charges which the programme would incur.  The principal assumptions were that all planned production would be sold at certain prices and that such prices would keep pace with inflation.  It was soon evident, however, that the financial projections in relation to Ballyforan were too tight and that even with the implementation of full energy-related pricing further assistance would be needed if the factory project was to go ahead.  The only promise of extra assistance was a grant of £3 million approved in principle by the IDA and perhaps some assistance from the EEC, which given the state of EEC finances at present, could not be counted upon.  The IDA grant approval was not based on a totally independent assessment of the project, as the Opposition Deputies would like to suggest but, as I have said, a grant in principle based on the number of jobs envisaged from the project; it necessarily relied on some of the projections made by Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Early in 1983, in the face of continuing board anxiety over funding and revised projections which showed that the costs of the Ballyforan project had now escalated to £48.2 million, the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy John Bruton, initiated a review of the Ballyforan project.  The initial review had been into the board's financial position, and the price increases which followed had strengthened that position.  The purpose of the second review was to assess the viability of the project itself and to examine the major cost elements involved. The increased cost of the project would involve a higher level of borrowing by Bord na Móna and it was necessary for the Government to be satisfied that expenditure on this project would ensure <Col N="2586" /> a better return to the community.  The Government have the ultimate responsibility where very large capital expenditure is involved and it is only right that before any investment proposal is approved it must demonstrate a reasonable probability of success.  At a time of high public sector borrowing, as now, there must be greater reluctance by the State to approve investment projects which do not offer reasonable return. The Opposition Deputies have deplored the time taken over this review.  I would remind them if the analysis and review of projects in the past had been more exacting, there might be fewer white elephants today.</P>

      <P>I would ask Deputies to respect the board's assessment that this project must be assessed by them as viable, or the board cannot proceed with it.  Otherwise it could threaten the very solvency of the board.  This is a matter that must be considered.  Much has been made of the surplus of £15.9 million shown in the 1982-83 annual accounts. This was merely a trading profit which had to be used for the partial clearing of an outstanding overdraft.  Borrowings to date amount to £102 million and annual interest on outstanding loans costs Bord na Móna £12 million or 14 per cent of revenue annually.  The 1983-84 annual accounts are expected to show a profit of £13 million approximately.  In 1984-85 because of reduced volume expectations and price projections down on previous estimates, coupled with increased costs, the outturn is expected to be a breakeven position with no surplus for debt servicing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board are being realistic, difficult as that decision was for them.  Real difficulties came to a head in the last year <Col N="2587" /> for Bord na Móna.  With the slowing up of oil prices in the two year period the board could not apply any increase to the price of milled peat to the ESB.  But Bord na Móna's costs did not stop because of that.  On the domestic scene, that is, turf and briquettes, following on years' experience of a phased increase in the price of briquettes the fact emerged that demand had fallen and that competition was intense and the price appeared too high.  A new briquette factory at Littleton had come into production and as a result briquettes had been on unrestricted supply for the first time.  The market reaction, with consumers pressed by the recession and sensitive to home heating bills, sent out clear warning signals.  At present the level of briquette sales are significantly lower than they were at the same time last year and correspondingly stock levels are appreciably higher.  The board had no option but to think further. To their credit they have done this.  There has been not a trace of ministerial or Government pressure.  I reject outright Deputy Reynolds' suggestion on that. The Tánaiste, myself, the Government and all sides of this House want a successful Ballyforan, not a failure or a financial morass.</P>
    <P>Part of the rationale for Ballyforan was that its production would compensate for the decline in Bord na Móna's machine turf production which was envisaged as the older sod peat bogs became worked out.  In fact, the substitute has been an upsurge in privately-produced turf. Privately-produced turf has increased since the beginning of the Private Bog Development Scheme in 1981 to 500,000 tonnes in 1983 as a result of the grant scheme and the advent of small turf-cutting machines.  The effect of the increased competition from coal and private turf has meant that the price of Bord na Móna baled briquettes were £7.20 a tonne lower than projected.  In the case of sod peat the price was lower by £8 per tonne.  This means that the present price of briquettes is £48.80 per tonne against a projected price of £56 per tonne and the present price of sod peat is £29.50 per tonne against the projected price of £37.50 per <Col N="2588" /> tonne.  In the light of this it is hard to take seriously Opposition Deputies' charges that the market is flooded with German briquettes and that consumers would be much happier to buy Bord na Móna briquettes if these were available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very necessary that Fianna Fáil should table this motion because we are anxious to prod the Coalition into taking some action, first, to build the briquette factory at Derryfadda and, secondly, to develop the bogs to the maximum.  In October or November last we discussed here the ESB's strategic plan, a plan that would have farreaching effects throughout the country but especially in the midlands.  However, so far as we are aware no action in that regard has been taken at Government level.  In answer to a parliamentary question the Minister for Energy told us he had instructed the ESB to cancel their arrangements for further development at Moneypoint but the following day he told us he had not done so.  This incompetent Government, not knowing whether they are coming or going, were not in a position to tell the ESB to cancel their grandiose plans for Moneypoint but have been able to tell Bord na Móna to stop work at Ballyforan.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State spent a good deal of his time telling us about borrowing requirements.  I expect that in this respect £800 million is involved in the Moneypoint project, but it is well to remind ourselves that out of every pound we pay towards our ESB bills, 25p goes to pay interest on borrowing.  Apparently there is one rule for the ESB and another for Bord na Móna.  So far as Derryfadda is concerned the attitude of this Government is the méar fada.  They adopted the same attitude in relation to the LaoisOffaly by-election in an attempt to save face for a few more weeks but the day of reckoning is very close.  The people will then have their say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording in the amendment tabled by the Minister is laughable.  The only full examination undertaken by the Coalition of this issue was a political examination, an examination of their dwindling prospects and of how they <Col N="2589" /> might put off the evil day when, like previous Coalitions, they will disappear, just as the £500 million has disappeared down the black hole.</P>
    <P>One would not need to be an economist to realise that the utilisation of national resources is no more than commonsense. In the forties there were set up the Turf Development Board and they were succeeded by Bord na Móna.  The board have not been stagnant.  They have been very inventive.  Indeed, people from other countries, including Russia, have come here to learn our latest technical know-how in turf production.  We have reason to be proud of the board and of those excellent people who have been employed on the bogs.  A Fine Gael Minister for Finance in a former Government said that the Allenwood station would be no more than a white elephant.  So far as the people of Kildare are concerned it was a lily-white success.  It has provided a lot of employment for many years.</P>
    <P>Briquettes are still good value.  They were so much in demand at one stage that a quota system had to be introduced. The public demand for this commodity will not be met by reducing the output. Consequently, there is a need for a factory at Ballyforan.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government the price of briquettes at the tiphead was such as to enable the middleman to make a handsome profit on the resale of the briquettes to the public.  Though Fianna Fáil sanctioned a price increase, this form of fuel continued to be good value for money. There are figures to prove conclusively that turf is still the cheapest way of cooking and also of heating the average house. The extra income that was to be generated by Bord na Móna was to enable them to expand and to undertake such projects as the Derryfadda factory.  This factory would enable a whole new track of bog to come into production and would allow for a continuous supply of turf as well as a continuation of employment after the midlands bogs have been used up, probably at the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>Even in town and city homes there is a demand for turf and briquettes because in those homes where there is only very limited storage space this fuel is easily <Col N="2590" /> stored in addition to being clean.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to the Irish people once that they burn everything British except British coal but who would ever have thought that we would have had a Government who would have allowed a conscious decision to burn foreign coal instead of Irish turf?  One might ask why the Government have to wait so long before announcing that the turf-burning electricity stations should remain open. It is because they are ditherers and procrastinators. A very enticing carrot was dangled by the ESB before the workers to encourage them to accept voluntary redundancy and closure of the peat stations. The Government may have thought that that carrot was too nice to be refused.  However, to the credit of the members of the unions, both in the ESB and in Bord na Móna, they stood four square behind one another and the country and their protest march to Leinster House some weeks ago proved where their allegiance lay.  Those people had no doubt that they wanted the dignity of work and not the despair of the the dole. It is obvious that this week's decision rejecting the ESB's strategic plan is a reluctant, eleventh hour stop-gap proposal of a Government who have realised what the midlanders think of their incompetence.</P>
    <P>We want somebody at some level to remove any doubt about the future of our bogs.  We want to see them utilised to the ultimate as a means of providing energy, whether milled peat, sod peat or briquettes. We want our own people encouraged to utilise our native fuel and thus ensure that in an emergency we shall be self-sufficient.  Whether there is a war brewing in the Middle East, shelling in the Gulf, or cooling of relationships between East and West, we do not want to wonder where the next spark will come from.  In many remote rural areas the ESB and Bord na Móna are the only employers.  They brought prosperity where there was despair.  Many a midland parish in Kildare, Laois, Offaly and all over the midlands would be still boggy and the economic outlook still foggy only for the far-seeing pioneers and willing workers who gave their lives to provide <Col N="2591" /> the jobs which are there today.</P>
    <P>If we had a decent Government they would not confine their thinking to today. They would look a little further than June 14.  The new generation in those areas want to learn about tomorrow.  We must plan ahead and continue with our agricultural and horticultural projects which have been already successful in cutaway bogs.  We must ensure that industries will be based in these areas to provide alternative employment for our young people there.  The processing of vegetables on cutaway bogs appears to offer great possibilities and the technical training and engineering skills of the workforce already employed by Bord na Móna and the ESB in these areas give a wide scope and range of possible industries to take up the slack when the bogs run out.</P>
    <P>Peat moss production is important for the export market.  On a recent visit to the Isle of Man one of the nicest things I saw was Irish peat moss being used extensively. Did anyone consider that briquettes might be exported also?  There is a great plan for the flooding of cutaway bogs in the Allenwood area to connect up with the Grand Canal and provide a tourist attraction with fishing, sailing, boating, wildlife sanctuaries and other kindred attractions.  These amenities would be within an hour's drive from Dublin.</P>
    <P>We want the Government to be serious about the development of our bogs, to realise their wealth and utilise it for the good of the nation, as any sensible Government should.  Above all, we want the Government to show some social conscience and care for the people, to show the respect for the workers who made the bogs blossom and to give hope to the next generation that they will be able to earn a living in a country which was made prosperous by the toil of previous generations.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government is shown tonight in their callous rejection of our motion.  Fine Gael and Labour are not the parties to give the people the respect which they deserve and the hope they need.</P>

      <P>The announcement last night by the Minister for Energy, Deputy Spring, came as a complete bombshell to the people of Ballyforan and the surrounding areas.  It has cast over them a shadow of gloom and doom.  The counties of Roscommon and Galway are now seriously affected by this decision.</P>
      <P>I happened to be in Ballyforan last night when the decision was announced in the Dáil and saw how the loss of this major project would affect the opportunities for young people in the area.  The whole area of Derryfadda, once a bog of hope, has been turned into a desert of despair.  The loss of in the region of 50 to 60 jobs has now been initiated by Bord na Móna in the Derryfadda group of bogs and I regret this very much.  As a result of the decision by this Government, there is, straightaway, this direct loss of permanent jobs in a very deprived area of the constituencies of Roscommon-East Galway and of East Galway itself.  The effects of this decision by an uncaring, callous Government are already in train. This is a Government who gave a firm commitment to build this briquette factory in Ballyforan and to carry on the policy which we commenced in November 1982, when the foundation was dug for this project and it was under way.  We were and are totally committed to this project.  This Government have made a decision which has been a major blow to the people of the area.  We now wonder what will be the next step.  The first effects are now directly influencing actual bog development.  People like fitters and office staff are now being deprived of their jobs.  Unions are being notified by the management of Bord na Móna of the Government decision in relation to this briquette factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of developing new bogs and of promoting the land which has been <Col N="2593" /> acquired for development is now under threat as well.  The 156 jobs at present in the Derryfadda workshops and on the bogs are now in jeopardy.  The target for 1984 is to produce 135,000 tonnes of milled peat and the total stockpile at the end of 1984 would be 200,000 tonnes. What will become of that stockpile without a briquette factory?  The major outlet &mdash;&mdash; and, I believe, the only real outlet &mdash; for milled peat in that area is the provision of a briquette factory in Ballyforan. We believe that, which is why we initiated the present project.  That is why a sum of £5 million has already been spent on the actual site works which will allow the erection of the factory.  The money which has already been spent will be wasted unless the project is completed.  It is essential that this Government agree with our motion.  The motion before this House calls on the Government to proceed immediately with the building of a new briquette factory at Derryfadda, Ballyforan.  I am asking all Deputies in this House, on both sides of the political divide, to leave aside their political affiliations and in this instance to work for their own area and support it.  Remember that the people of Ballyforan and the surrounding districts sent Deputies here, not just to back up the political parties but to support their areas.  I regret that Deputies who were so vocal when in Opposition now in Government are silent in not supporting the people of the Ballyforan area.</P>
    <P>The work which has already proceeded has made an enormous impact on that area.  The fact that so many young people have been given the opportunity of work must be regarded as a major breakthrough in that whole region.</P>
    <P>When I was first elected in 1977 to the area of south Roscommon and the constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim I knew straight away that there had to be major development in the western and southern area of the constituency and, in particular, in the area of Ballyforan which had never received any assistance whatsoever in relation to development.  It was a priority area as far as I was concerned and one golden opportunity was that the bogs which had held back the people for so <Col N="2594" /> long would now be utilised to provide jobs.  The total money already spent on the development of the Derryfadda group of bogs is in the region of £12 million.  This expenditure will be lost unless the briquette factory proceeds.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to come up with a decision in favour of this project.  Last night he announced a decision against it and it had taken about 18 months for that decision to be made.  In that period this project became less viable because of the delays.  Every year the cost of the project has increased.  A decision by the Government now to postpone it for 12 months has put the whole project in jeopardy. Nobody in the area believes that the Government have any serious intentions in relation to this project.</P>

On 15 May 1984 a meeting was arranged at 3 o'clock but the Minister for Energy became ill, unfortunately and was removed from the building.

      <P>Further to your representations regarding the Ballyforan briquette factory I am informed by Bord na Móna that the construction schedule for the factory is as follows:</P>
      <P>September 1982, site preparation commenced and contract awarded.</P>
      <P>December 1982, order for boiler and turbo alternator to be placed.</P>
      <P>Early 1983, civil engineering contract to go to tender.</P>
      <P>Late 1983, mechanical contract to go to tender.</P>
      <P>November 1983, boiler to be delivered.</P>
      <P>February 1984, turbo alternator to be delivered.</P>
      <P>February 1985, factory to be commissioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2596" /> I might also mention that I am scheduled to perform the official sod turning ceremony on Friday, 5 November next. </P>
    <P>That was long before there was a question of a general election.</P>

      <P>The projected employment level in the factory when completed was 110 jobs but those have now gone. There were to be 180 jobs during the construction period.  The loss of those 110 jobs means that 550 people were depending on those jobs in that area.  Roscommon County Council provided sewerage, water and housing in the Ballyforan area and Galway County Council provided roads to the briquette factory in Ballyforan. The Government are destroying the whole fabric of the Roscommon-East Galway area.  They have now made the biggest decision against this region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a Fine Gael Government decision with the Minister for Energy, a so-called socialist Labour Minister. Nobody in Ballyforan believes it.  I am telling Deputy Naughten not to go down to Ballyforan.  The Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, and Deputy Naughten are not welcome in that area because they have let down the people of the area by backing this Government decision.  I hope the Deputy will now decide to support our motion.  I would like to remind Deputy Naughten that on 26 May 1982 he said in the Dáil:</P>
      <P>We stated clearly that the project would go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has let down the people of the region of Roscommon-East Galway. I am not leaving out Senator Connor. Neither he nor Deputy Naughten is prepared <Col N="2597" /> to stand up and speak for the people of Roscommon and Galway East. Fianna Fáil made it possible for this project to to ahead.  Deputy Naughten and the other Government Deputies from that constituency are letting down the people who voted for them.  It is a shame that they are prepared to go along with this corrupt Coalition Government who are not able to balance their books, who have lost £500 million.  This money has been robbed from the people.</P>
    <P>The Government have now decided that this project in Ballyforan will not go ahead.  We call on them to go ahead with the project and we call on the Deputies who represent the constituencies of Roscommon and Galway East to come into the House and vote for this project.  If they vote against it they will have to go back to their constituents and explain their stand in relation to this.  I have been involved in initiating this project from the first day.  I backed it all the way and will continue to do so.  The people of Ballyforan know that if Fianna Fáil were in Government now this project would be completed and would be opened in the next few weeks.  They will soon see the position they are in.  The Fine Gael Coalition Government do not care for the people of Roscommon or Galway East.  They are not concerned about employment down there.  They have shown they are not prepared to put investment down there.  We are asking the Deputies opposite to support this motion tonight, back this project and the people will not let them down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words in this important debate.  After listening to Deputy Leyden and his wild allegations I would like to remind him that it is Bord na Móna who have made this decision not the Government.  The political appointees of that board are all Fianna Fáil and I defy contradiction on that. They were appointed by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Reynolds.  These are the people who have made the decision to deprive the people of Ballyforan of a briquette factory.  There is great disappointment in Ballyforan at the decision <Col N="2598" /> taken by the board on 25 May.  Since the erection of a power station in Ballyforan was first envisaged in 1974 the people of the area looked forward to full employment in and around the area.  The farmers in that area sold their bogs, Gowla Farm was taken over and some of the workers got employment in Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>Forestry and vast tracts of bog were taken over by Bord na Móna with the intention of building a briquette factory or a power station.  Later the plan to build a power station was changed and a major station was built at Moneypoint.  It was decided to build a briquette factory and this decision was welcomed by the people of the area.  Vast sums of money have been spent by Bord na Móna on drainage and reclamation, clearing the bogs and getting them right for development.  A lot of money has been spent on site development. The 1982 Fianna Fáil election campaign was launched at that site at the taxpayers' expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the reality.  Bord na Móna were used by the then Government to launch their election campaign, turning a sod on a site in Ballyforan when no contract had been signed.</P>
      <P>I very much regret the decision which has now been taken by Bord na Móna.  I believe it is an irresponsible decision by a semi-State body who have spent vast sums in the area.  The Irish people are entitled to know why a semi-State body should spend £20 million on a project and then decide to cancel it.  It is extremely serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management of Bord na Móna has been deplorable over the past few years. Certain work practices and other features have been introduced which have cost the board substantial sums of money and have led to downright bad management. As recently as six weeks ago they were talking about deferring the building of a briquette factory in Ballyforan.  Some two weeks later they informed the manager and the workers there that they were going into full production and overtime was worked on Saturdays and Sundays. <Col N="2599" /> Yesterday they told the same workers that they were to be made redundant. We are entitled to an explanation from Bord na Móna so that we can know precisely what their views are.  It is not good enough for them to make a decision deferring this project for 12 months. They are putting the future of many workers in jeopardy.  Some of these workers have bought houses in the area and have heavy loan commitments.  Some have come back from England and others have left jobs in Dublin and elsewhere to settle at home.  There has been massive investment by both Galway and Roscommon County Councils.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that Bord na Móna have made this decision and I appeal to the Minister to ask them to reconsider.  It is of vital interest to the people of the area that the project should get under way.  Having invested £20 million there the board owe it to the Irish people to go ahead and build the briquette factory, to employ new technology and new ideas and to go out and sell their product.  It is surely a sad reflection on the board that they are not able to develop the bogs. We have a high number of people who are unemployed and we are importing coal and German briquettes.  It is a scandal that a semi-State body cannot utilise the peat reserves, create jobs and prevent imports.  The Minister should request the board to reconsider their decision.  If they do not, they should take the only honourable step open to them and resign.  If they do not resign they should be dismissed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the whiteness in the face and the funny feelings in Deputy Naughten's stomach as he faces the thought of going home to the people of Ballyforan.  It is scraping the barrel for him and his party to denigrate the members of the board of Bord na Móna.  During my term of office I met the chairman of the board.  I do not know the political views of these people and I am not interested in finding out.  I stand over every appointment I made to the boards of semi-State bodies and I want no cheap allegations from any Deputy <Col N="2600" /> against people who give of their time for a lousy few hundred pounds a year to serve on these boards.  I will be surprised if the Minister and the Minister of State do not ask Deputy Naughten to apologise publicly to the members of the board of Bord na Móna for the scandalous things he has said.  He has tried to indict the management of Bord na Móna.  I heard nothing from his lips about indicting the handling of Bord na Móna by this Coalition Government or the previous Coalition.</P>
      <P>The Deputy was happy to join the Minister of State in Ballyforan and say there was great news for the area because the project was going ahead.  In May 1982 Deputy Naughten challenged me to state the position clearly, which I did.  He said:</P>
      <P>We stated clearly that the project would go ahead.  This was re-iterated by the Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs when speaking in the area.</P>
      <P>That is what the Deputy said about his party when there were in Government in 1981.  Does he want me to tell him what they did that year?  They have been stopping this project from the time it started.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government knew the financial position of Bord na Móna and tried to trick the people of Galway East and Roscommon by putting a figure in the capital programme when the Minister and the Government knew they could not borrow a single shilling because their financial position was such that they could not remunerate the capital they had already borrowed.  The Coalition Government of 1981 were not prepared to take the politically unpopular decision to rectify the financial position of Bord na Móna.  They have been going back over the years saying what Fianna Fáil did; but I am not interested in what was happening ten years ago, although I would be glad to argue the record.  The Coalition Government in the years 1973 to 1977 initiated several projects.  There was an over-expenditure of £100 million by NET but there is no talk about the bad financial management in those days. <Col N="2601" /> The Government have now lost £500 million in a black hole and they have the audacity and the hard neck to come in here and preach financial rectitude.  They talk about the reckless approach by Fianna Fáil.  Only today I raised at Question Time over-expenditure of three times the original cost on a building for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  Who initiated the inquiry? The Minister had to admit that I did so.</P>
      <P>The facts are that the Coalition ran away from rectifying the financial position of Bord na Móna in 1981 when they could not borrow from the European Investment Bank or the commercial banks.  I took up the matter with the Fianna Fáil Government in 1982 and took the politically unpopular decision to rectify it so that the development of our peatlands and the project in Ballyforan could go ahead and Bord na Móna could remunerate their capital borrowings.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna carried out a review in 1982 and told the Government that the project was all right.  It was assessed by the IDA and the Minister is stooping very low in saying that it was not carried out on an independent basis.  What are they trying to do to the semi-State organisations? Are they saying to this House that the IDA are not capable of analysing a project?  If they did not think it was viable they would not have approved in principle the grant of £3 million.  The IDA do not do their business in that way.  They have a failure rate of only 7½ per cent but yet the Minister questions their judgment with regard to analysing the project.  It was a disgraceful action on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened with regard to the review?  If I had someone working for me who was not able to analyse the viability of a project in one month, never mind 18 months, I would not have him around for a week.  What kind of Government have we who carry out review after review and who are finally driven to make a decision because the Opposition put down a motion in Private Members' time?  What were the Government doing for 18 months?  What kind of analysis was carried out?  Within a matter of weeks after they came to office they stopped the project <Col N="2602" /> despite the fact that Bord na Móna had carried out an analysis and were going ahead with the work.  Up to 4 o'clock yesterday Bord na Móna continued to spend money on the project.  It was at that time yesterday afternoon that the management called in workers and told them there would be a lay-off of men.  The work went ahead while the Government spoke about a review.  If the Government were responsible and were interested in saving the taxpayers' money, why did they not tell Bord na Móna before this to stop work on the project?  Why let them go ahead and produce between 150,000 and 200,000 tonnes of milled peat, stacked higher than this building in the bogs of Derryfadda? The Government need not trot out the nonsense that this is not a political decision.  Of course it is.</P>
    <P>When I opened the debate last night I asked what kind of analysis was carried out and I was given vague references with regard to market changes and so on.  Bord na Móna were set up by virtue of an Act of the Oireachtas in 1946 to develop the peatlands and to create jobs.  The Government took account only of a narrow economic analysis and they used this as an excuse to get rid of the project.  Did they take account of the return to the national economy?  Did they take into account the imports of coal and German briquettes?  The Minister of State scoffs at the idea and tells us this is not the position but I invite him to come to Longford or Westmeath where he will see plenty of German briquettes on sale. After all the fine work of Bord na Móna, are they supposed to sit back and let the Germans take their market?  This is the kind of defeatist attitude that has been enunciated daily by spokespeople of this Government.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the leader of the Labour Party has allowed a narrow economic analysis to be carried out in connection with this project.  The Government did not take into consideration the imports that could have been avoided, the money that will have to be paid by way of dole and the interest that will have to be paid on the £20 million already spent on the project.  Why was <Col N="2603" /> the project allowed to get to this stage? Do the Government realise that when a project is delayed for 18 months building costs and inflation represent major additional charges?  The Government stand indicted before the taxpayers and the general public for their mishandling of this and other projects.</P>
    <P>The Government talk a lot about investment in projects but only a few weeks ago I was obliged to put down a motion regarding the money put into the Dublin Gas deal.  In that instance also the Minister for Energy answered for the Government.  The Government told us they got a great deal, far better than anything Fianna Fáil could achieve.  They put an extra £47 million into Dublin Gas.  There was no trouble about that because it was connected with Pale politics, with Dublin 4 and all that goes with that.  The Government have no concern for the midlands or the west.  They never had and they never will have, but I promise them they will get their answer in Laois-Offaly on 14 June.  They will also get their answer the first time they go to the west of Ireland or any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>Where is the great reliance on financial rectitude now?  It is gone out the window or even down the black hole.  How much is this Bord na Móna project out of line on a strictly commercial basis?  I have not been given that answer yet.  I warn the Minister and the Government that if this motion is not carried I will put down a request at the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies to have the full facts put on the table.  We will not rest behind vague ministerial scripts.  This House and the people are entitled to know what went wrong with this project.  If there are deficiencies in Bord na Móna let us know about them.</P>
    <P>The Government are trying to cover up their inactivity on this matter in the past 18 months.  The Minister smiles at this and that is quite incredible: I know Deputy Naughten is not smiling and I do not see the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, in the House.  He is the man who represented the Government in Ballyforan, the man who said this <Col N="2604" /> Government never give reckless promises or commitments.  We could write a book about them and sooner or later I will get an opportunity in this House to list them one after the other.</P>
    <P>The Government will do anything to get themselves out of a tight corner. Some six or eight weeks ago in this House I tried to find out what will be the future of the power stations in the midlands but I got no reply.  I made a forecast then that we would get a response during the Laois-Offaly by-election campaign and I am sure that will happen.  I do not care who makes the announcement.  There may be a dispute between the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach as to who delivers the occasional bit of good news.  Let the Minister hold on to his rightful place in the Department of Energy and make the announcement.  The Taoiseach has no right to say he will take that good news from him.  The Minister is entitled to it because he has to build up the flagging hopes and fortunes of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy made a great fanfare announcement about the National Development Corporation but, unfortunately, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, stole the show the night before. I ask the Minister what this corporation will do.</P>

The Minister might like to tell me at the first opportunity the kinds of projects the National Development Corporation will take on board.  If they consider any project it will have to be connected with the development of our natural resources, to which the Labour Party are supposed to be committed.  Here is a project based on such a development which, as the Minister said, has a slight risk attached to it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly does not believe in the National Development Corporation and I do not believe in it but there are people sitting on those benches who believe in it.  Again, I ask the Minister is it not the case that there are risks attached to any project?  Many proposals appear gilt-edged on paper but they do not turn out so well; but others that may not appear promising at first turn out very well.  If the Minister and the Government are going to make any use of the National Development Corporation, which I doubt, they will have to take on board projects like the Ballyforan project which carries a slight risk.  I do not deny that there is a risk.  If we believe in ourselves in relation to the development of our national resources we can produce and market a product which is far superior to the imported goods.</P>
      <P>I should also like the Deputies to bear in mind the mark up which is on peat briquettes when one considers the miserly figure which Bord na Móna get for them.  The middle man is getting a mark up of 150 per cent and it is obvious that there is a marketing problem. Twenty million pounds worth of taxpayers' money should not be lying in the west unused and the Minister should not consign another 400 or 500 people to the dole queue there.  That has been the philosophy of this Government since they came to office and I hope that the Deputies from that area will take their courage in their hands, vote for the motion and show that they represent the people of Roscommon.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £90,936,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1984, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Public Works; for certain domestic expenses; for expenditure in respect of public and certain other buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works; for the execution and maintenance of drainage and other engineering works. </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>The net amount sought for the Vote for Public Works and Buildings for 1984 is £90,936,000.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is responsible for a wide range of activities.  It is involved in the design and construction of offices and other buildings and in the purchase, leasing and disposal of property.  It undertakes extensive civil engineering works and is responsible for the preservation of important aspects of the country's heritage, both natural and man-made.  The scope of its activities is reflected in the diversity of professional skills it employs.  In addition to the administrative grades to be found in other Government Departments, its staff includes architects, engineers, valuers, professional accountants and surveyors and representatives of other specialist disciplines such as archaeologists and naturalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The salaries of this staff and associated expenses are met from Subheads A and <Col N="2610" /> B of the Vote for which a sum of £13,942,000 is provided in the Estimate. Provision for the continuing development of new computer systems designed to improve efficiency is also included.</P>
    <P>Subhead D covers expenditure on the purchase of sites and buildings for various State services and an amount of £500,000 is sought for this purpose in 1984.</P>
    <P>The amount sought for Subhead E is £27 million.  This represents an increase of about 5½ per cent on the actual amount expended in this respect in 1983.</P>
    <P>I have circulated among Deputies copies of the list showing the individual projects covered by this subhead and this gives a good idea of the varied nature and widespread location of these projects.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of the money is needed for the erection of new office buildings to replace old, dilapidated and unsuitable buildings in which some Government services are at present housed.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have a difficult task in relation to many building projects in satisfying the various interests involved while at the same time complying with all the necessary procedures which bind a Government Department and also working within restricted resources.  For this reason the Office are often criticised for delays which are not of their making.</P>
    <P>In addition to office accommodation Subhead E includes provision for specialist type projects for the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Departments of Finance, Justice, Education, Agriculture, Foreign Affairs and Social Welfare as well as those arising from the responsibilities of the Office of Public Works in the conservation and amenity field.</P>
    <P>At Leinster House, the new security railings and lights have been erected and the reopening of the Visitors' Entrance to the House is in progress.  Additional accommodation provided in the College of Science has been occupied by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Accommodation for Courts of Justice staff will be provided in a new building <Col N="2611" /> on the site of the former Four Courts Hotel.  Removal of administrative and allied staff from the main Gandon building will facilitate development of vacated areas there for court purposes.</P>
    <P>Blocks 1, 2 and 3 of the new Garda headquarters at Harcourt Square have been occupied and occupation of Block 4 is now about to take place.  A few comparatively small areas remain which are earmarked mainly for specialised services.</P>
    <P>Major inroads are being made on the Garda station building programme. Divisional Headquarters have been completed at Tralee and District Headquarters at Carrick-on-Shannon.  The gardaí at Santry, Dublin, have recently moved into new premises.  Among the projects in progress are Divisional Headquarters at Galway and District Headquarters at Mayfield and Gurranabraher in Cork and at Cahirciveen, Nenagh, Arklow and Belmullet.  Sites have been acquired and planning is at an advanced stage to provide new headquarters at other centres including Tallaght, Limerick, Ennis, Killarney, Shannon and Sligo.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that 1984 will see the completion of the restoration of the former Royal Hospital at Kilmainham which is one of our oldest public buildings, little changed from its foundation 300 years ago and considered to be one of the finest examples of classical architecture in the country.  It is being faithfully restored to its former magnificence by the Commissioners of Public Works who are also providing modern facilities and services such as heating, lighting, lifts etc.  An interdepartmental committee has been set up to consider all aspects regarding the future uses of the restored building.</P>
    <P>This year will also see the completion of major adaptation works to premises at 2-3 Kildare Street for the National Library.  Works are in progress on the adpatation of the former Jacobs premises at Bishop Street to provide new centralised headquarters for the Stationery Office.  Planning is in hands to rehabilitate the houses in Merrion Street which have been vacated by the Department of <Col N="2612" /> Fisheries and Forestry and also to restore Dublin Castle where some buildings through age and structural failure have deteriorated to such an extent as to be almost in a dangerous condition.</P>
    <P>In the provinces, new centralised Government offices have been completed in Navan and Thurles and the new Government offices in Cork will be ready for occupation this summer.  Offices for staff of various Departments in Carrick-on-Shannon have been completed and the erection of new offices in Arklow is progressing satisfactorily.  The construction of a new, badly needed Employment Exchange at Newcastle West has started and the construction of new offices in Sligo is about to get under way while planning is at an advanced stage for offices at Kilkenny and Letterkenny. Other developments being planned include Government offices at Portlaoise, Tullamore, Tralee and Wexford.</P>
    <P>Two important projects for the Department of Agriculture are in progress at Abbotstown &mdash; a Hormone Residue Testing Laboratory and a Veterinary Diagnostic Unit.  There is provision also for the improvement and fitting-out of various embassies abroad and for the works being undertaken at Dublin Castle and at Iveagh House to provide facilities in connection with Ireland's Presidency of the EEC in 1984.</P>
    <P>Work is proceeding on the provision of a car park, toilets, picnic areas and pedestrian routes at Glendalough.  This is the first stage of a programme for the improvement of visitor facilities at this major national monuments site and is being planned in consultation with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, Bord Fáilte and the Wicklow County Council.</P>
    <P>A provision of £100,000 has been included in respect of development works on the Shannon navigation and for minor expenses in connection with the survey of the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal.  In addition, the Commissioners will be spending almost £700,000 under Subhead F.1 on the day-to-day maintenance of the navigation.  These provisions are indications of a very real commitment to the River Shannon and <Col N="2613" /> an acknowledgement of the valuable contribution it makes not alone to our tourism industry but also to the enjoyment by our own people of many water-based activities.</P>
    <P>Indeed, due in no small measure to the success of the Commissioners with Shannon navigation, the Grand and Royal Canals are also to be placed under their control to be managed and developed for recreation and public enjoyment.  Legislation to give effect to the transfer of the canals will be introduced shortly by the Minister for Communications.</P>
    <P>I am seeking a total amount of £42,391,000 in respect of Subheads F.1 to F.4 which cover the costs of maintaining, furnishing, leasing, heating and lighting Government offices and various other buildings used for State purposes, and the costs of maintaining certain State-owned harbours, the River Shannon navigation and our various national parks.</P>
    <P>I am sure I do not have to emphasise the importance of proper maintenance of buildings and property generally.  The Commissioners of Public Works have a duty to ensure that the properties in their care in which large amounts of public funds have been invested should not be allowed to deteriorate.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Commissioners have been making significant advances in helping the public to attain a greater appreciation of the natural and cultural resources in their care through the publication of guidebooks and leaflets and the use of audio-visual programmes.  Last year booklets were published for Garnish Island and for Killarney National Park and an audio visual programme, which was highly acclaimed, was produced for Killarney.  This year it is hoped to produce one for St. Enda's Park in Rathfarnham.</P>
    <P>The acquisition and development of Glenveagh National Park has been referred to in previous years.  Following completion of the first stage of an extensive building programme part funded by the EEC Regional Development Fund, this park will be opened to the public during the coming summer.  It will be the third National Park in this country, the others being Killarney and Connemara <Col N="2614" /> National Parks.</P>
    <P>Glenveagh National Park in North-west Donegal comprises 25,000 acres of mountain, moorland, lakes and woods and is the home of the largest herd of red deer in this country.  The objective in establishing the National Park is to conserve this outstanding wilderness in such a way that people may visit and appreciate it and yet leave it unspoilt for the generations to come.</P>
    <P>The gardens of Glenveagh Castle, which are among the country's premier gardens, will also be opened to the public this year.  A range of booklets relating to various aspects of Glenveagh as well as an audio-visual show are at present in preparation.</P>
    <P>I am seeking a sum of £1,929,000 under subhead F2 to meet expenditure by the furniture division of the Office of Public Works on the maintenance of furniture and furnishings in State occupied premises throughout the country and in our embassies abroad.  In addition to its maintenance responsibilities, the furniture divisions are also charged with the furnishing for occupation of all new State premises and provide a variety of services to State and semi-State bodies on a repayment basis.  The division operate a small furniture factory and restoration workshops alongside extensive furniture stores and a direct delivery service in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In the discharge of their responsibilities for the furnishing of Government Offices the division restore and re-use existing furniture to the maximum extent possible.  Notwithstanding this it is necessary for the division to procure the great bulk of their supplies from furniture manufacturers and consequently they are a major customer of the furniture industry. The division have for many years pursued a conscious policy of purchasing only items which are produced and finished to a high standard.  This policy has been influenced both by the need to get the best possible value for the taxpayers' money and the desirability of providing a lead for the Irish furnishing industry to produce to the highest possible standards in order to compete on the home and export markets.  In this regard I have <Col N="2615" /> been gratified to note from recently published statistics that the gap between furniture imports and exports is steadily narrowing.</P>
    <P>In furnishing Irish Embassies abroad the division operate a policy of providing high quality Irish furniture wherever it is reasonably possible to do so.  I believe that such practical demonstrations of Irish ability to produce and deliver items of the highest quality anywhere in the world assist in the overall export drive.</P>
    <P>I am seeking an amount of £16,334,000 in 1984 in respect of the provision for rents for premises leased by the State through the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The advantages of providing purpose built, State-owned buildings for State services are obvious and to this end the commissioners are undertaking an on-going office building programme which in time will decrease the State's dependency on rented premises.  Some renting, however, will no doubt continue to be necessary to provide immediate solutions to urgent accommodation problems. Given the current restrictions on the filling of vacant posts in the public service it is unlikely that any significant demand for additional accommodation will arise during this year.</P>
    <P>A provision of £7,556,000 is required under subhead F4 for heating and lighting State accommodation.  The commissioners are very conscious of the need for conservation of energy and have issued a list of simple economy measures to all Government Departments and offices which it is hoped will be followed.  In consultation with the Department of Energy the commissioners are looking into the use of natural gas for heating premises for which they are responsible. One plant which has already been converted for gas use will serve as a pilot project.</P>
    <P>An amount of £10,000 is required for subhead F5 to cover the final cost of the works to Waterford courthouse which have been completed.  The cost of these works is repaid by the local authorities to the commissioners.</P>
    <P>I come now to one of the most <Col N="2616" /> important functions of the Commissioners of Public Works.  I refer to the arterial drainage programme which has been running since the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act in 1945.  In March last this House discussed the programme in some detail in Private Members' time. In the course of that debate both the Minister for Finance and I informed the House that the Government had decided that a thorough review of arterial drainage should be carried out.  It is only right that a large programme like this, ongoing for four decades, should be examined in some detail to ensure that it is still necessary and that, if it is, it is cost efficient and that the benefits conferred by the programme compare favourably with the costs.  I am glad to inform the House that the Commissioners of Public Works have completed such a review which I am examining at the moment.</P>
    <P>Since the drainage programme was debated here as recently as March last I propose to confine my remarks now to an outline of what will be done in 1984. Amounts totalling £14,599,000 are required under subhead G1, G2 and G3 of the Estimate to provide for the survey, design and construction of arterial drainage schemes together with the maintenance of upwards of 30 completed schemes.  This year work will continue on the collection and analysis of hydrometric data on many river catchments throughout the country and on the specialist studies required to be completed before the design for a drainage scheme for the Dunkellin-Lavally catchments can be finalised.</P>
    <P>On the construction side, work will continue on the Boyne, Maigue, Corrib/Mask/Robe, Boyle and Bonet schemes, which will give employment to about 750 men.  A new scheme, the Ulster Blackwater, which is being undertaken jointly with the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture is due to start this week.  The necessity to complete the lengthy and complex procedures prescribed in the drainage legislation on both sides of the Border militated against an earlier start which I had hoped would be made in 1983.  The EEC provides substantial grants annually towards the cost <Col N="2617" /> of drainage construction works.  The cost of maintaining completed schemes is met from subhead G3 initially and is recoverable from the county councils concerned.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,954,000 is required in respect of subhead H for the purchase of engineering plant and machinery, the purchase of stores and the payment of wages to the staff of the central engineering workshops.</P>
    <P>An amount of £205,000 is required under subhead I to cover the cost of maintenance of completed coast protection schemes such as those at Rosslare, Murrough, County Wicklow, and Moville.  The expenditure is recoverable from the county councils involved.  Some survey work will also be undertaken in 1984.  A sum of £2,867,000 is required under subhead J for the conservation and preservation of national monuments in State care, for archaeological excavations and for archaeological survey work.  Conservation of national monuments is an on-going activity arising out of the statutory duties of the Commissioners of Public Works under the National Monuments Acts.  Work is in progress at many national monuments throughout the country and there is hardly a county in which major monuments activity of one sort or another is not taking place.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of the conservation of our heritage of monuments and sites which should not be overlooked is the continuing employment this activity gives for traditional crafts and skills.  The evidence for this is to be found at any of the monuments at which major conservation work has been carried out.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report that the 18th century building known as the Casino which William Chambers designed for the Earl of Charlemont's residence at Marino in Dublin will be ready to be opened to the public this year.  Consideration is being given to the acquisition of a tract of land around the Casino from Dublin Corporation with the intention of landscaping it in such a way as to create for the visitor an impression of the original setting.</P>
    <P>Grants for research archaeological excavations are being made again this year under a scheme operated in consultation <Col N="2618" /> with the Royal Irish Academy.  The major site under excavation is at Knowth, County Meath, in the Boyne Valley megalithic cemetery.</P>
    <P>As has been widely publicised in the past year or so monuments, particularly field monuments, are continuing to be destroyed in the course of development, particularly agricultural development. Much of this destruction is often due to a failure to recognise certain monuments for what they are and, when they are recognised as antiquities, a failure to appreciate their importance as an irreplaceable part of our heritage.  It was decided to tackle this problem on two fronts: firstly by making precise information available on the location of monuments and secondly by creating an awareness among property owners of the national importance of monuments in their ownership.</P>
    <P>As previously announced, the archaeological survey is now concentrated on the preparation of inventories of sites and monuments for each county.  The County Louth inventory is almost ready for publication and work on the preliminary surveys for inventory purposes of counties Cork and Galway by University Colleges Cork and Galway respectively is proceeding satisfactorily.  As part of the work on the inventories a separate sites and monuments record is being compiled for each county.  These records are basically numbered lists of the monuments accompanied by a set of correspondingly annotated 6&rdquo; Ordnance Survey maps.  They are a basic planning tool for all concerned with environmental change as they pinpoint the location of monuments and take away the element of guesswork that may exist in some cases.  The County Louth sites and monuments record was launched recently.</P>
    <P>Publication of inventories, sites and monuments records and the results of surveys generally will not of themselves halt destruction of monuments.  Our legislation also requires to be strengthened and I hope to be in a position very soon to introduce a Bill to amend the National Monuments Act.  Above all else, what is needed is a change of attitude among the public at large towards our monuments <Col N="2619" /> so that they will fully appreciate that these monuments represent an essential part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second element in this strategy the commissioners have recently established contacts with the Farm Development Service of the Department of Agriculture, ACOT, Macra na Feirme and Foróige to try to encourage a greater respect for these monuments.  I would hope in time to see these contacts paying rich dividends.</P>
    <P>In addition to the works programmes provided for in this Estimate, the commissioners also undertake works on behalf of various other Government services on a repayment basis.</P>
    <P>The major programme which commenced in 1979 for the provision of buildings required for the development of the telecommunications system, is drawing to a close.  To date about 440 buildings have been completed and I expect a further 60 or so to be handed over by the end of this year.  Approximately £12 million will be spent this year on this programme. Other building programmes being undertaken by the Office of Public Works include those for the prison service of the Department of Justice, a special project for the Department of Fisheries and Forestry at Killykeen Forest Park involving the construction of holiday homes, harbour works for that Department and also for Roinn na Gaeltachta and works at postal buildings for An Post.</P>
    <P>The building of primary schools was another programme which in the past was undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  In recent years the annual expenditure on that programme was in the region of £25 million to £30 million. As Deputies will be aware, that work is now to be transferred to the Department of Education.  Up to now the OPW have been involved in this large-scale project.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Commissioners of Public Works are widespread and because of this I am sure many Deputies will wish to contribute to this debate.</P>
    <P>I have identified many facets in the OPW who are working to preserve much of our heritage.  This is a very important <Col N="2620" /> Vote and I will listen with interest to contributions that may be made and I understand that I will have a few minutes to reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very disappointed when I saw that the Estimate for the Office of Public Works was down from £97,726,000 last year to £90,936,000 this year, and something should be done about this.  Very few people realise the extent and variety of the work of the OPW.  They provide services for every Government Department.  They are a great barometer for assessing a Government and their performance.  When the OPW are left short of finance every Department in Government feel the pinch.  Everyone knows that when the OPW are left short of resources the Government are not going too well. There is a great shortage of finance this year in the Estimates for public works as I have told the House, a £7 million shortfall.</P>
      <P>The work of the OPW can be examined under three headings &mdash; engineering, architecture and conservation.  I would like to talk about drainage.  Five of our major rivers are being dredged at present. They are the Boyne, the Maigue, the Corrib-Robe-Mask, the Boyle and the Bonet.  This is a large spread which covers a great deal of country.  The trouble is that not enough money is being provided for arterial drainage and the arterial drainage work is proceeding very slowly, especially on the Boyle and the Bonet which in fact are proceeding only at half-cock.  All of these schemes were started by a Fianna Fáil Government, were carried on successfully and efficiently and progressed very quickly. Under the present Government very little progress is being made on this work and there is a definite delay in implementing the arterial drainage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four of those rivers are 50 per cent EEC funded and, because the Government have starved arterial drainage of resources, we are not getting what is rightfully ours from EEC funds.  I believe <Col N="2621" /> also that the cost benefit analysis on the rivers that are to be dredged in the future is not being done.  That is a disgrace.  We should be planning for the future.  Do the Coalition want to terminate the arterial drainage programme altogether?</P>
    <P>We were informed early this year that the OPW were letting off 260 workers from arterial drainage.  We could never get a satisfactory explanation of that even though we raised the matter here in the Dáil.  This was a retrograde step in view of the fact that half the wages of those people was being paid from EEC funds and the Government did not save anything in laying off those workers.  The Government must give them redundancy payment and pay-related benefit whereas they should accept the EEC funding and pay the balance in wages, thus boosting the morale of those workers who would otherwise be unemployed and adding to the dole queues.  Brussels must be having a great laugh at us for not accepting funds that are available to us.  I would like the Minister to state how much his Department paid out this year and last year in redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>I notice also that no money is provided in the Estimates for a survey of the River Shannon.  About two years ago we were offered a 50 per cent EEC grant for the purpose of conducting a survey on the River Shannon but that survey has not commenced yet.  When Fianna Fáil were in power they tried to recruit engineers for that work by way of advertising but the project has been put on the shelf by the Coalition.  This represents a further loss of EEC funds.</P>
    <P>It is very necessary that the River Shannon be dredged but the dredging cannot be commenced until such time as a survey has been completed and a cost benefit analysis produced.  The Shannon floods the nine counties of Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway, Westmeath, Tipperary and Limerick.  I am confident that in addition to the 50 per cent grant towards the cost of the survey the dredging would qualify also for a similar level of EEC grant.  The dredging of the Shannon would provide from between 1,500 to 2,000 jobs while making viable many more acres of land. <Col N="2622" /> There is a very close link between arterial drainage and farm land.  We hear a lot about making farms more viable.  Arterial drainage is a very important factor in this context in so far as many underdeveloped small farms are concerned.  In the absence of an outfall for water farmers are not in a position to go ahead with drainage schemes.  Arterial drainage is the only answer to that problem.  In addition to dredging the big rivers we should consider a new scheme for the dredging of small rivers.  In my county, as in many others, there are rivers very much in need of dredging.  However, I do not see much chance of any such scheme while the Coalition remain in office.  They are not making much money available for arterial drainage.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister of State to put a strong case to the Government for the allocation of more moneys for this very important work.</P>
    <P>I note from the Book of Estimates that there is a reduction of 3 per cent for arterial drainage in 1984 compared with 1983.  If we take into account inflation and other factors, the reduction is more of the order of 15 per cent.  The allocation for services for future schemes is reduced this year by 31 per cent.  This is proof of the Government's lack of commitment to agriculture and of their attitude towards farmers.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our most important industry.  Consequently, it is the duty of the Government of the day to ensure that the industry thrives and prospers.  There are many rivers on the list for dredging. There is the River Lee which floods the land around Tralee as well as many other acres of land.  A survey on this river was carried out in 1980.  I am appealing to the Minister of State to have the dredging begin as soon as possible.  Another river that is much in need of dredging is the Dunkellin in Galway.  We have heard a lot about that as a result of parliamentary questions and also during various contributions in the House.  The Minister might let us know what the up-to-date position is in regard to that project.  Yet another river that should be dredged is the Blackwater which floods the towns of Fermoy and Mallow as well as many acres of <Col N="2623" /> fertile land in that area.</P>
    <P>I am not inclined to blame the Minister of State for the lack of finance for the Office of Public Works.  It is the responsibility of the Government and of the Minister for Finance in particular to provide those moneys.  But I suggest that when the Estimate for the Office of Public Works is being discussed in the leadup to the budget, the Minister of State would be in a position to sit in at Cabinet meetings.  I say this because the Minister for Finance who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works will be trying to keep expenditure down and consequently may not have much interest in financing for the Office of Public Work.</P>
    <P>I note, too, that in the Estimate this year there is an allocation of £200,000 for coast protection work.  This is a very paltry sum in view of the extent of the problem. Anyone with a basic knowledge of engineering would know that coast protection work is very costly.  Many areas need coast protection work.  The Magharees in County Kerry are first on the list of the Office of Public Works.  If action is not taken there very soon, they could become an island in a very short time. Also, in County Kerry an area between Tralee, the Spa and Fenit is suffering greatly from coastal erosion.  This is also on the list of the Office of Public Works. County Waterford also has extremely serious erosion in Ballyvoyle, Stradbally, Ardmore and Belair.  The same problem exists in County Dublin and should be looked after immediately.  I am very disappointed at the lack of progress in coast protection work.  I suggested last year that if we applied to the EEC we might get a grant from them to help us to do some of this essential work.</P>
    <P>The preservation of our national heritage has for a long time been one of the great success stories of the Office of Public Works and I should like to congratulate the Minister and his office for the new projects which I understand will be completed this year.  They include the Casino, Marino; Ennis Priory in County Clare; Glenveagh National Park and the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2624" /> The network of national monuments on which major conservation work has been carried out countrywide is impressive. What is more encouraging is the policy of providing facilities.  I am sorry this year that there is an 8 per cent reduction in the provision for national monuments. We have some very beautiful national parks, as mentioned by the Minister of State.  We have Killarney in my own county of Kerry, Glenveagh in County Donegal and Letterfrack in County Galway.  There is a nucleus of one in the Burren in County Clare which at some time may be a national park. There is also the Phoenix Park which is not a national park but an urban one, the largest urban park in Europe.  This park is under the auspices of the Office of Public Works and I am very disappointed at the way in which that office are treating this park.  Under Fianna Fáil 130 people were employed there, but the number has been reduced now to 119.</P>

      <P>I also notice that a superintendent has not been appointed there for the last 12 months.  I tabled a question about this some time ago and noticed that straight away the Office of Public Works advertised the job through the Civil Service Commission.  According to the Minister's speech, he has not yet been appointed.  Due to the absence of a superintendent and the reduction in the workforce, the maintenance and upkeep of the park is not as good as in the past. Some of the pathways have deteriorated and grass has been left on the margin. Other aspects are not up to the same standard as four years ago.  I appeal to the Minister of State to take a special interest in seeing that the Phoenix Park is better kept.</P>

      <P>Dublin has more than one million people and many of those are unemployed.  An urban park like this is a great asset to this city and should be properly maintained as an <Col N="2625" /> amenity area for the enjoyment of these people.  As referred to by my colleague, Deputy Wilson, there was a recent suggestion from the Minister for Transport that buses should run through the Phoenix Park.</P>

      <P>We have some of the most beautiful parks in the world.  There is a duty on the Government of the day to keep them that way, and a duty to encourage our people to visit them.  I had the privilege at one time of visiting national parks abroad and was amazed at the number of people who visited them in other countries &mdash; much greater than here at home.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister write to all the principals of our national schools, and perhaps also post-primary schools, sending them a booklet or guide book on these parks.  The teachers might include one of these on their excursions every year with their students.  Almost every school has a day's outing for sightseeing and they would welcome the opportunity of visiting our national parks and should be encouraged to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a beautiful national park in Killarney, not in my constitutency but in that of the Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan.  I have often heard that this park is one of the most beautiful in the world.  It is very well maintained and I congratulate the people in the Office of Public Works, both in Dublin and Killarney, for the excellent job that they are doing down there.  There are 21,000 acres of land and lakes.  It is a tremendous asset to County Kerry, and especially to Killarney, <Col N="2626" /> in attracting tourists.  One could call Killarney the Mecca of Ireland in that respect.</P>
    <P>There is a very large herd of red deer in Killarney.  It is very important to ensure they are preserved.  I would like to congratulate everybody in the Office of Public Works who took steps to preserve that fine herd of deer.  The Minister of State said that there is a herd of deer in Glenveagh, which he said was the largest in the country.  I always thought there were more in Killarney but I accept the Minister of State's word.</P>
    <P>I have a great interest in farming and there is a very good herd of Kerry cows in the national park in Killarney.  It is possibly the only herd of pure bred Kerry cows we have.  For the past couple of years those cows have been suckled by calves.  I suggest they should be milked by machine so that there milk yield can be recorded.  My information is that when those Kerry cows were milked their yield was 1,000 gallons per annum.  Many people would not believe that.  I appeal to the Minister to have those cows milked for a couple of years and if the yield is recorded it will be very beneficial to the agricultural sector.  Kerry cows have very rich milk and they would be a good mixture with Friesian cows.</P>
    <P>Another national park of great prominence is in Glenveagh, County Donegal, which comprises 25,000 acres.  The Minister said the first phase of the development in Glenveagh is completed.  I would like to congratulate him and the Department on that.  He said that the gardens of Glenveagh Castle will be opened to the public this year.  What is happening to the beautiful castle in Glenveagh?  When I was in the Department I visited that castle and I considered it should be opened to the public.  I would like to hear the Minister's views.  This would be very beneficial to the Donegal area.</P>
    <P>There is a very attractive national park in Letterfrack.  Have they bought any additional land?  During my time in the Office of Public Works they were negotiating the purchase of some mountain land adjoining the area.  I hope the Connemara ponies in that park are still there. I have not been in that part of the country <Col N="2627" /> for some time.  I thought it was very fitting to have Connemara ponies in that national park.  I would like the Minister to tell us what is the up-to-date position about the development of the Burren in County Clare.  Even though it is not yet declared a national park I know negotiations were taking place to purchase extra land there.  The Burren is unique.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Office of Public Works deserve congratulations for the tremendous effort they have made in acquiring and developing our national parks.  There is one man outstanding over all the rest, the former chairman of the Office of Public Works, Mr. John McCarthy, who has now retired.  He was responsible for the purchase of all our national parks.  He purchased Killarney Lakes and Glenveagh for very little money.  He deserves congratulations for his negotiating ability and doing a very worthwhile job.  He was dealing with two very important people, who were the owners of those national parks, Mr. McShane and Mr. McElhinney. It was not easy to do a deal with those men.  The country owes him a debt of gratitude.  I hope the other officers of the Office of Public Works will not mind me paying a compliment to Mr. John McCarthy.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the provision of State buildings around the country for the Civil Service.  He referred to a building in Tralee and said work there was progressing slowly.  Tralee badly needs a Civil Service building.  A very suitable site was purchased from the UDC in the middle of the town.  The Office of Public Works would not have got this site without my intervention when I was in the Department.  The Government have not made any effort since they took office to erect that building.  It is needed to house all the civil servants in the Tralee area where 200 civil servants are employed in various Departments.  They are fragmented around the town at the moment and it would be very beneficial to have all the different Departments under one roof in a central position where the site is.</P>
    <P>We have the Revenue Commissioners in Tralee, I suppose we would be better <Col N="2628" /> have three prefabricated buildings at the back of the existing building and the working conditions there are deplorable. They certainly need new accommodation. The Department of Agriculture have three different offices in Tralee. One of these is in the office of the county committee of agriculture one mile outside the town.  These offices are vastly over-crowded and the floors have sunk about six inches due to the weight of the files.  The offices are very unsuitable and too far out of town.  Many farmers have great difficulty in getting there.  I appeal to the Minister to have an office erected in Tralee to cater for these 200 civil servants.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Department are negotiating the transfer of the Royal and Grand Canals.  The development of these canals as amenity waterways can only take place if sufficient manpower and financial resources are available.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have done marvellous work on the Shannon.  I notice that £14,000 is provided for the quay at Drumsna but the estimate last year was for £18,000 and I should like to know why it has been so much reduced this year.  Perhaps they are finishing the work at Drumsna but I would be grateful if the Minister would give that information. The sum of £15,000 is to be spent on the new quay at Lough Kee.  This is a very small amount of money for such work.  I notice that there is a fairly adequate amount provided for a new quay at Williamstown. I welcome these new developments on the Shannon.  It is a great attraction and the OPW are to be congratulated on the work they have done there during the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the provision of £427,000 for the erection and repair of Garda barracks.  Some barracks are in a deplorable condition and it is essential that the Garda should have proper working conditions.  If we expect good results from them we must provide them with good accommodation.</P>
    <P>There are 214,000 people registered as unemployed and £1,325,000 is being provided for employment exchanges.  That is not enough.  My information is that some <Col N="2629" /> of the employment exchanges in Dublin city are in a shocking condition and many of those in country areas are not in a good state.  The Minister should try to get an increased allocation for this purpose, although I presume the money is made available to him by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Department of Education are endeavouring to take over the building of national schools from the OPW.  This is a retrograde step because the OPW have very well trained staff.  I do not know whether a decision has been made but I am aware that there is a dispute about it.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether there will be duplication of staff.  The OPW have the staff to deal with this type of work.  If the Department of Education take over the building of national schools will such professional people have to be employed by the Department of Education as well as having them in the OPW?  If that is so, I would completely disapprove.  This task should be left with the OPW.</P>
    <P>We recently had an Adjournment debate on the question of selling sites which were acquired for the decentralisation of the Civil Service.  I was very disappointed to hear that these sites were to be sold.  I happened to be in the OPW when the 13 sites were purchased.  Some of the urban councils and county councils as well as private individuals went out of their way to co-operate with the OPW in facilitating the purchase of sites in anticipation of Civil Service offices being built. Some of the places which were to benefit were Killarney, Limerick, Nenagh, Cavan, Ennis, Letterkenny and Galway. I appeal to the Minister of State to retain those sites.  When Fianna Fáil come back into office we will start the decentralisation programme again and this will mean the transfer of many civil servants to the country.  This project was welcomed by the Civil Service and would have afforded many rural people living in Dublin an opportunity to go back to their own towns.  With the present state of the property market these sites will not make very much money and it would be better to retain them.  Any money acquired by <Col N="2630" /> their sale would not be of much benefit to the Government.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister of State speak about furniture.  I remember visiting Inchicore where the Office of Public Works manufacture furniture.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the furniture in State offices and in our embassies abroad be made at home.  Our products are as good as those in any other part of the world.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that there was a reduction of nearly £7 million in the Estimate for the Office of Public works. I am not blaming the Minister of State but I ask him to do his utmost to sit in next year when the Estimate for his Department is being discussed.  The Office of Public Works carry out important work but they have been starved of resources because they have no one to make their case for them when the Estimates are being discussed.  The personnel in the section are tremendous and they are entitled to the resources they need to do their valuable work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is afraid that I will be too loquacious but I can assure him I will finish in the time he has mentioned. I regard it as a privilege to speak briefly on this Estimate and to support our spokesman, Deputy McEllistrim, in his wide-ranging and penetrating analysis of this Estimate.  I know that with regard to the heritage aspect of the OPW he is in a fine tradition.  I had the privilege of knowing his father and many times I discussed with him the valuable aspects of our heritage which he supported and fought for when he was a young man and afterwards as a Member of this House. For that reason, I am very privileged to support Deputy McEllistrim in his contribution on this Vote.  I am also happy that the Minister of State in charge of OPW, Deputy Bermingham, is also a member of a family who appreciate our heritage and the many aspects covered <Col N="2631" /> by the OPW.  I had the privilege of meeting his late brother who was a distinguished poet in the Irish language and who, by definition, would have been interested in that aspect of the Vote.</P>
      <P>I regret that there has been a reduction in the Estimate from £98 million in 1983 to £91 million in 1984.  There are some areas in which I have a special interest. As Deputy McEllistrim has said, the OPW is a fine department, covering a wide range of professional skills and expertise.  For that reason the office should concern us to an increasing extent. Throughout the world the entire ecological movement, which is in part social and in part political is commanding more attention as the years go by.  For that reason the OPW will become more important in our future deliberations in this House.</P>
      <P>Some years ago I called attention to the deterioration in the facade of the National Museum, in the section of it in the Kildare Street forecourt and also in Kildare Street itself.  The facade is a classical one.  I remember mentioning to the late lamented Deputy Henry Kenny how important it was to do something about it, and in particular to remove the greenery that was on the stonework.  I note some constructive movement in that area and I hope that in the future we will give more attention to this matter than we have done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks closely at Leinster House, the museum and the library, one will see they are not nearly as well preserved as they might be.  They do not look as well as the National Gallery, the Natural History Museum and the Merrion Street entrance to this building.  It is important to ensure that those buildings look well. The Bank of Ireland have done a very good job on their building which was the old Parliament building and the GPO is also being attended to at the moment.  I hope that the complex here will receive attention.  In the few moments snatched at lunch-time during meetings of the Forum, I used to walk around the Castle area and I observed that the Church of the Holy Trinity needs special attention. Small sections of windows are unglazed <Col N="2632" /> and some have some form of boarding. That little gem of a building should get proper attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim mentioned various buildings and enterprises for which the Office of Public Works are responsible. When we were in Government we had plans for the decentralisation of a section of the Department of Agriculture to Cavan town.  I regret this has not been proceeded with and I support Deputy McEllistrim in his plea that we do not shut off the availability of sites in the area.  The town of Cavan is crying out for the construction of a Garda station, a military barracks and a building for the Department of Agriculture.  I want to second Deputy McEllistrim's plea that we should not shut off that type of development.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, which the Minister mentioned in his speech, is reaching the final restoration stage.  A distinguished architect from my constituency, Patrick Shaffrey, has been dealing with public and private buildings and he has published works about them asking us to pay due attention to our heritage.  I know that the Office of Public Works, within their financial structures, will pay attention to him.  I remember giving a lecture in the library in Boston some time ago and the librarian there, whose assistant was a past pupil of mine from Letterkenny, pleaded for that complex involving at that time the College of Art, the National Library and the National Museum.  I want to reiterate that plea now.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation will take place in the future and I hope that this House will not forget it.  I was very glad to hear the Minister say that we are paying particular attention to Irish products in our foreign embassies.  This should extend to painting, sculpture, furniture and carpets, and I am sorry to hear that the Killybegs world famous knotted carpet factory is in trouble.  I ask the Minister, knowing that he has an interest in that area of preservation, to talk to his Minister of State and members of the Government to try to have that unique skill preserved.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell canal.  I feel very <Col N="2633" /> strongly about this since the time, many years ago, when I visited the Norfolk Broads where thousands of people go for boating.  I have spoken in this House about the potential of the Erne system from Ballyshannon back to Lough Erne. If the horrible circumstances which prevail in that area could be settled politically&mdash;we hoped in our deliberations at the Forum that we were on the way to doing that&mdash;there would be potential there second to none in Europe for development.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim also emphasised the importance of the Phoenix Park.  I am in total agreement with him that there should be no question of buses passing through it.  The story of the Phoenix Park being the citizens' park is interesting.  The Duchess of Cleveland, who was the mistress of George I, was to be given a present of the park on the principle of, as a famous architectural historian said, rewards in Ireland for services rendered in England.  The Duke of Ormond stopped this happening and preserved the park for the citizens.  I hope that the Minister of an Irish Government would not defile the park by allowing buses to go through it.  If anybody has any doubts about it, I invite them to pass through the park and drink in with delight the horse chestnuts that are now in candle bloom there.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Glenveagh National Park is now being developed for the nation.  In that connection, there is a beautiful story written by the late M.J. McManus called <i>The Glen of the Silver Birches</i> which gives the history of that park.  It is right that it should come back into the possession of the nation when one reads what happened when it was being developed.  When I lived in Donegal I visited it regularly; the gardens are magnificent.  Deputy McEllistrim asked about the availability of the castle. I met Mr. McElhinney and every time I use Tabasco sauce I think of that beautiful castle, the lake and its surroundings with its herd of deer.</P>
    <P>I spoke privately to the Minister about the Boyne drainage which is now coming to a conclusion.  I appeal to the Minister to finish it off by doing the Killinkere <Col N="2634" /> river which is a very small extension of that scheme.  I have already mentioned how important it is to have the very best products of our craftsmen and artists in the embassies and I know that I can rely on the Office of the Public Works to do that.</P>
    <P>There is no courthouse in Cavan at present and the Office of Public Works or the Department of Justice should deal with that classical building, the roof of which is about to fall in and which has been the subject of court cases already. There is an economic philosophy developing which applies cost-benefit analysis to everything and I am afraid that this will affect areas in the west which at present cannot be subjected to that criterion. It is not the only criterion and I hope that the philosophy which is rampant in London, Washington and to a certain extent in Dublin should not be applied because there are other considerations besides the percentage of profit on a cost-benefit analysis.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Boyne valley megalithic operation, it is wonderful to see the work of Professor George Eogan and Sir Michael Herity coming to fruition.  The late Professor Ruairi de Valera was also involved in that scheme.  George Moore, who was not an archaeologist, popularised it throughout Europe and the United States at the beginning of this century. Now we have our own scholars and experts reporting on that area and, apart altogether from its contribution to scholarship, it will be a wonderful tourist attraction in times to come.  The archaeological survey in Donegal has been completed and I hope that Members of this House will be provided with copies of those surveys.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Fianna Fáil Party had a very strong and comprehensive heritage Bill which he intended to put on the Statute Book.  It was going to be very comprehensive and I hope it will not be lost sight of and that the whole area will be covered in one Act.  I also hope that this House will back it up with finance because in the end one will not get anywhere without proper funding.</P>
    <P>I should like to have gone on for some time on this Vote because there is an <Col N="2635" /> importance attached to it far beyond the time we are allocating to it in this House. I am very proud that the main Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, was put on the Statute Book by a predecessor in my constituency in County Cavan, the late Deputy Paddy Smith, former Minister for Agriculture and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try within the limited time at my disposal to deal with some of the points and criticisms made.  I want to thank both contributors from the opposite side.  I want to thank them, on behalf of the Office of Public Works, for the things they said that I know to be true about the work and dedication of the people in that office.  I should like to pay tribute to the people who work in that Office.</P>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy McEllistrim and Deputy Wilson for their kind remarks in regard to myself.  As Deputy Wilson has just said, the work of this Office is a lot more important in the context of the whole political, industrial and social scene than the amount of time given to it here would suggest.</P>
      <P>I do not think there was any severe criticism levelled except perhaps about lack of finance.  The survey and drainage of the River Shannon was mentioned. While I do not want to appear to be smart the drainage of the Shannon has been going on and I have been hearing about it since I was a boy &mdash; let us all be honest with one another in this respect &mdash; and I do not think anything definite was ever done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the whole drainage scene there has now been completed a review which I am at present reading carefully and which will then go for consideration by the Government.  I am hopeful it will add to the drainage programme generally.  I might add that any new drainage schemes must await the outcome of this review.  There were intermediate drainage schemes undertaken on a smaller scale in the 1960s which dissipated too much of the money which <Col N="2636" /> should have gone into the major drainage schemes at that time.  That is what was felt by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim did say that while they were in office drainage continued apace and everything was flying.  That is not exactly true.  I might take one example, the drainage of the River Boyne which was mentioned in the course of the debate.  It was estimated that its drainage, properly funded, would be finished in 1979.  Yet it has not been finished to date. I am prepared to admit that I have been arguing that never has any drainage been carried out in the most economic or viable way.  This happened throughout the periods of office of various Governments. Drainage never received sufficient money and we all know that.  In regard to the point made about people laid off, it is fair to say that people are laid off in drainage even where there is no question of cutbacks being made.  I know in my constituency &mdash; where the Boyne rises &mdash; there were people employed on its drainage ten years ago at the commencement of the scheme who were laid off through natural wastage.  The completion of the drainage of the Boyne is targeted for next year.</P>
    <P>The drainage of the rivers Boyle and Bonet were commenced in the term of office of the previous Government but there was no money provided in the Estimates.  Let us be honest with one another in this respect.  I am not saying it is progressing faster now because, if it was to continue at all, it must have done so at a faster pace.  It is my opinion that no Government ever invested sufficient money in arterial drainage, which is most important and something which should be given more attention.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy McEllistrim who said that the Phoenix Park was deteriorating. There are fewer people employed there than there were but I do not agree with the contention that it is deteriorating. The decrease in numbers employed was occasioned by a Government decision in regard to engaging people.  There has been some difficulty experienced in the Phoenix Park about the filling of a superintendent's post which is now well under way and there will be a superintendent <Col N="2637" /> installed there very soon.  I agree with what both Deputies said about buses in the Phoenix Park.  I am of the same opinion, that it would amount to a desecration to allow buses in the Phoenix Park.  I would be opposed to it anyway.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim mentioned Killarney Park, of which I am very proud also. Indeed it is one of the great achievements of the Office of Public Works, if not one of the greatest achievements of the country and something of which we can all be proud.  We can be proud of our other parks also because they are beautiful places.  I think the one in Killarney was handed over to the State and the only cost factor there was the purchase of extra land.  I understand that there are negotiations in train for the purchase of extra land in the other parks, the one in Connemara and also the Donegal one even though it is already a very large park.  Preservation is the principal consideration in regard to those parks, not that we develop them so much as to preserve them as part of our beautiful heritage.  In regard to Glenveagh and the castle there, I should say that the castle will not be open this year.  There is some repair work to be carried out there on entrances and so on and it is the intention of the Office of Public Works to have it open to the public eventually.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim mentioned also the funds provided for the project at Drumsna pier on the Shannon.  I should say that that is a finishing job, which is the reason the financial provision is small.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim mentioned a site being acquired for Government offices in Tralee.  That is being planned and under way.  Deputy McEllistrim mentioned also Garda stations and employment exchanges.  A programme of building work in regard to both has been under way for quite a long time and, as I said in my introductory remarks, progress on these is steady and will continue.  I can assure him of that.  In regard to schools a discussion is taking place on the transfer to the Department of Education of the national school building programme. Arrangements for its smooth transfer are at present being planned and the Deputy <Col N="2638" /> may be assured that this will not result in any duplication of staff.</P>
    <P>On the decentralisation programme, I should say that a decision has been taken to dispose of any State property surplus to requirements.  That does not mean that we will give away property at a cheap rate or anything like that.  The Office of Public Works have as good a valuation staff as anybody else and I can assure Deputies that property will not be given away at sacrifice prices.  However, some of the sites purchased will not be used for some time.  A decision has to be taken as to whether it is better to have money invested in sites or put into a building programme.  For that reason perhaps there is some merit in disposing of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson raised the subject of Dublin Castle where plans are in hand for large scale restoration and development work.  It should be remembered that most of the buildings in the Castle are between 200 and 250 years old.  As a number of them are deteriorating at foundation level it renders their preservation and restoration difficult.  I might add that at the Church of The Most Holy Trinity there is one such building deteriorating. I can assure the Deputy that the problem is not too serious and remedial work is being carried out.  A long-term programme of works for Dublin Castle is now being prepared and I am confident that we will see a start to this building in 1985.  I wish to thank the two Deputies for their constructive contributions to the debate.</P>

      <P>Deputy N. Treacy has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the serious financial position of T &amp; D Engineering Loughrea, County Galway, which is forcing the company out of business.  He has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I want to thank you for giving me an opportunity to raise this matter.  I wish to share my time with my constituency colleague, Deputy Kitt.  I should also like to thank the Minister of State for coming in to hear the debate and reply to it.  T &amp; D Engineering were founded in April 1972 at Tynagh, Loughrea, County Galway. They were born out of the necessity to manufacture ancillary equipment and to service the mining industry in the country in general but in particular at Irish Base Metals Limited in Loughrea.  At that time Tynagh was the biggest lead and zinc mine in Europe.  It was more popularly known as Tynagh Mines.  When the company were set up they employed six people on a permanent basis.  They made steady progress and employed 26 skilled workers on a permanent basis at one stage until the present crisis hit them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that most of the company's revenue came from the mining industry put them into a decline with the closing down of the local Tynagh Mines and the scaling down of mining and exploration activities throughout the country over the past few years.  The company are resilient. They were not prepared to close down.  They sought new products and explored new markets.  These products include comealong cable clamps, earthing equipment, stringing wheels, bus stop signs, cable anchors, loading ramps, locomotive caps and others.  The company are the sole suppliers of comealong <Col N="2640" /> clamps and special earthing equipment to the ESB, one of our most efficient semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>In view of the declining mining operations throughout the country the company took a hard look at the situation and saw that there was an opportunity for import substitution.  We are all aware that with the present state of the economy and the high rate of imports, our one hope is to diversify and try to effect import substitution.  That is exactly what the company did.  They also supply similar equipment to the British Electrical Board.  They won these orders after assessment by the British Institute of Research and Standards who recommended this company's products to the British Electrical Board against a Finnish manufacturing competitor.  This shows the quality of their product range and the skills available within the company.</P>
    <P>In an effort to explore the market place and to see what products could be substituted from an import point of view, they spent well over £100,000 in research, development and training.  They have had a cash flow difficulty over the past three years since the closing down of Tynagh Mines.  We accept that they are in difficult financial circumstances and that they have financial liabilities to the State.  Their debt to the State was caused by the fact that they used their own liquid cash in research, training and development. They have a tax liability and other liabilities to the State.</P>
    <P>They got two grants from the IDA of slightly in excess of £17,000 for training and development.  The company spent much more than that.  They have done their best to survive.  They are committed to the market place.  They have their range of products.  They are committed to their workforce.  As yet they have not explored mainland Europe, the Middle East or the Far East.  From the information available it seems that there is only one competitor in Finland supplying these markets so there would be a major potential for the company in these areas if they had the resources to explore those markets.</P>
    <P>Recently the IDA got a report about these products from Córas Tráchtála who <Col N="2641" /> did an amount of investigation into them. Córas Tráchtála have projected that this company's products would make a major impact in the market place from 1984 onwards provided they could manufacture a sufficient amount of them and get them sold overseas.  The company have not got the liquid resources; they have not got the personnel in the marketplace; they have not got the money to manufacture them in big numbers; and consequently they cannot make progress.</P>
    <P>Last December they made an application to Fóir Teoranta for a working capital loan of £50,000.  That application was rejected in March of this year.  The company could wind down their operations and go into liquidation, but they are not prepared to do that.  They are committed to their liabilities, to their products and to the country.  They want to survive in business.  They want a fair opportunity to do so.  Their bankers are satisfied with the commitment of the company, have supported them and will support them still further if the State can come up with the necessary capital through the IDA and Fóir Teroanta by way of grants and loans to make the company viable.</P>
    <P>The company had to lay off some of their workers recently.  At present they employ seven people, a drop of 20 compared to their maximum period of employment.  However, only last week the company secured a contract from Canada worth £40,000 and as a result hope to recruit a further five people next week.  That is an indication of the resilience and commitment of the company.  It is worth noting that the company have strong assets, two buildings, a workshop, a store and a two-acre site in the heart of south Galway at Tynagh.  It is close to the Tynagh Mines which lies derelict at present. Outstanding mining and mechanical equipment lies idle in those mines.  The company under discussion have a particular expertise for dealing with such equipment.  Looking to the future it would be wise if we tried to attract an industry to Tynagh Mines to replace Irish Base Metals Ltd., a concern which proved very successful for 20 years.  T &amp; D Engineering could make a major contribution to the success of a new industry <Col N="2642" /> there.</P>
    <P>Company stocks, in raw materials and finished products, are worth in the region of £85,000.  The equipment and machines at depreciated value are worth £75,000. One can see from that that quite an amount of capital was invested by the directors in the company over the years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt and I are very perturbed about this matter because the southern part of our constituency is regarded as a black area as far as unemployment is concerned.  The House will be aware, following the debate earlier this evening, of the problems that arise in the northern part of the constituency due to the decision to postpone the construction of the briquette factory at Ballyforan.  Unemployment is very high throughout the constituency.  I should like to put on record the number of companies in the southern part of the constituency located within five miles of T &amp; D Engineering that closed down in the last five years. They are, Irish Base Metals Limited, Tynagh; Milihem Minerals Limited, Gurtymadden, an ancilliary company of Irish Base Metals Ltd. which manufactured a special product for the oil industry; Wrangler Limited, Loughrea; Hohner Panoramic (Ireland) Limited, the only German company that manufactured musical instruments outside Germany; Loughrea Precision Engineering Limited which closed down a few months ago and is at present in liquidation; Loughrea Cottons Limited, a traditional industry which was the biggest in the town; Westphalian Carpet Yarn Spinning Company, which replaced the former but closed down after two years in operation and, most recently, PMPA Garage (Loughrea) Limited.</P>
    <P>In the Loughrea-Tynagh area more than 1,000 people are unemployed.  The company under discussion could liquidate tomorrow morning and the State would have to settle for what would be left after the assets of the company have been disposed of.  However, the company are committed to their liabilities and to the market place.  There is no doubt but that the company have potential at home and on the foreign markets.  They have succeeded in getting a grip on the English <Col N="2643" /> market and are involved with one of our most successful semi-State companies. They have a skilled workforce that no other company of their size possess.</P>
    <P>We accept that the company have liabilities but we appeal to the Government, the Minister responsible and the Minister of State who is well aware of the problems industries face, to come to the aid of the company.  It is important that the Government recognise the contribution the company made to import substitution and that the opportunities exist for it to expand and develop.  In the next three years if the financial resources are made available by way of loans from Fóir Teoranta and a State grant through the IDA the company can be made viable and make a major contribution to the economy of that area.  I appeal to the Minister to give us a commitment to come to the aid of this resilient company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the case made on behalf of T &amp; D Engineering. The company made an application to Fóir Teoranta for working capital and I hope the Minister will be in a position to outline the response to that.  The situation in that company is unusual in that while the concern are letting people go there is still a demand for their products. That company have also submitted an application to the IDA for capital and training grants.  They are anxious to be told the amount of the grant to be paid and if it will be paid retrospectively.  They also ask if the Revenue Commissioners, through the Minister for Finance, would be sympathetic in regard to the repayments in view of the fact that they did not get any grant in the past.  Had they got a grant they might not have the large tax bill they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company feel they have been victimised in that some of their competitors got grants towards the cost of premises, machinery and training at the full rate. They believe that if they were located anywhere else in the country they would not have much difficulty in obtaining State assistance and would be treated more sympathetically.  It is sad that for the second time today we are speaking <Col N="2644" /> about another west of Ireland project that is in danger.  The directors of the company have clearly indicated to me that all the profits of the company were reinvested in the concern.  They are anxious to increase the number of jobs.  At one time 26 people were employed in the concern and I am sure the Minister agrees that if there is potential at home and abroad for the products of the company they should be given every possible assistance to enable them to continue in operation.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal of talk about import substitution.  Here are a company who have UK markets but I am afraid they are losing ground in the UK market because they are in financial difficulty. We should have a policy of trying to cut down on imports.  This company should have a strengthening export market, and I am sure they will do that because they are dealing with some of the best companies in the UK.  If they are given the help they are seeking I am sure we will not be talking about saving the company, rather we will be talking about expanding T &amp; D Engineering Ltd.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by both Deputies concerning the present difficulties of T &amp; D Engineering Ltd, Tynagh.  This company developed their business based on servicing the needs of the mining industry in Tynagh and were for a large number of years a perfect example of the type of company that can make an effective contribution to the economy.  In this case it was a small Irish engineering company who serviced a major mining operation and identified a niche in the market.  Their successful past record makes their present difficulty all the more unfortunate, particularly when we have regard to the fact that when their mining customer base in Tynagh diminished T &amp; D Engineering Ltd., with the assistance of the IDA, followed the recommended course of identifying and developing new products.  I will have more to say about that aspect of the case in a few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, development of new <Col N="2645" /> products is not the only facet involved in maintaining a viable business.  Of equal importance is the need to ensure that the company's finances are maintained in a sound condition commensurate with the company's development programme.  In this instance I understand that the company, despite the assistance they had received from the IDA and CTT, now find themselves in serious financial difficulty the solution to which lies outside the remit of those State agencies which operate under the aegis of my Department. I understand that the company approached Fóir Teoranta for assistance earlier this year but that Fóir Teoranta who have to observe statutory criteria including a criterion that they must be satisfied as to the long-term viability of a company, found themselves unable to provide the assistance sought in the light of the information provided in T &amp; D Engineering's application for aid.  Fóir Teoranta are very conscious of the need to assist Irish industry wherever possible, particulary industry in areas such as Tynagh. In this regard I understand that Fóir Teoranta were recently in touch with T &amp; D Engineering Ltd. and indicated to them that if there were any material changes in the company's circumstances since they made their original application Fóir Teoranta would be happy to reconsider any new application which might be submitted by the company.  Consequently, while I must stress that this offer by Fóir Teoranta must not be taken as a commitment on their part to provide assistance to the company and Fóir Teoranta would still have to have regard to the statutory criteria, I recommend to the Deputy that he encourage the company to consider whether there are sufficient grounds for a reapplication to Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>On a more general note but <i>a propos</i> the problems which have arisen in this case I feel it necessary to say that, given the length and severity of the recession we have experienced over the past few years, there has been an unprecedented level of demand for the service of the State agencies, especially those involved in the industrial rescue scene.  From my knowledge of the work of these agencies <Col N="2646" /> I can say that they have responded extremely well and sympathetically in very difficult circumstances and have made a very serious effort to help companies in difficulty where at all possible, given a reasonable prospect of viability. Deputies must appreciate, however, that there is a limit to what State agencies can do, and often firms face difficulties which the State agencies, despite their best efforts, are unable to resolve.  For instance, if a firm's problems relate primarily to a fall off in demand for their products then State agencies can do only a limited amount to assist the company. Certainly CTT can assist a company in funding new export markets for the company's products, but the State rescue agencies cannot create demand where it does not exist.  Unfortunately, the recession is associated with falling demand across the whole spectrum of industrial products, and this is a problem which assistance from the rescue agencies simply cannot resolve.</P>
    <P>Another problem facing the rescue agencies is that the firms often leave it until too late to approach them for assistance. When a firm begin to experience difficulties there is an understandable temptation for the management to see the difficulties as being of a temporary rather than a permanent nature.  Management often hope that difficulties will pass and the company will be restored to health.  This, of course, does not always happen, with the result that firms continue to trade unprofitably and often have accumulated large liabilities by the time they approach the rescue agency.  These liabilities are sometimes such that there is no prospect of the firm trading out of their difficulties.  In fairness to the State agencies &mdash; I deal with them on a day-to-day basis&mdash;too often firms leave it until too late for a restructuring exercise.  I can only advise firms in general that when they come into a difficult trading situation where they have financial problems they should go to the State agencies who are primarily responsible for assisting them, sooner rather than later.  In my experience far too often things are left to drift to where the banks, whom I have found to be sympathetic to companies in <Col N="2647" /> difficulties, cannot help them and State agencies with the best will in the world are bound by statute not to assist them because of the criteria adopted in the Act.  Therefore, there is responsibility on the companies themselves to come early to State agencies who can help them.</P>
    <P>This case is a typical example of what I am talking about.  Certain statements were made by Members for Galway which confused me somewhat.  For instance, I am not aware that an application to the IDA for grant assistance is outstanding or that any grants payable are outstanding.</P>

I am not quite sure of the value of <Col N="2648" /> the mining stocks and equipment which the Deputy spoke about.  I would imagine that the demand for these products is, to say the least, slow.</P>
      <P>With regard to the penetration by the company of foreign markets, I am not impressed by what the Deputies have said.  I am quite satisfied that the sales of products to the British Central Electricity Generating Board are not of significance. I must say that in fairness.

The Army Pensions Acts provide that any compensation received may be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of any pension which may be granted under the Acts.  As the annual value of the compensation in this case, assessed on an acturial basis, exceeded the appropriate rate of pension under the Army Pensions Acts, payment of pension has been withheld. The question of payment will be considered if and when the annual rate of pension, appropriate to the degree of disablement exceeds the annual value of the compensation awarded.</P>

      <P>The question of the transfer of BIM staff to the new premises at Dún Laoghaire is primarily a matter for the board.  Of the £750,000 estimated for the cost of transfer, I understand that the amount spent to date is £149,846.  I am also informed that tenders were invited for the fitting out of the new premises and six tenders were received.  Tenders will also be sought for the transfer of office furniture and equipment at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>Details of the proposed transfer are a matter for negotiation between the unions concerned and the board.  The decision to proceed with the move was made because efforts by the board to sell or lease the Dún Laoghaire premises were not successful.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> As I indicated in reply to previous parliamentary questions, it is intended to achieve and maintain an overall Garda strength of 11,400 during 1984.  To achieve that and taking account of anticipated wastage, a total of 149 male recruits have already been appointed to the force this year, a further 50 male and 25 female recruits are due to be appointed on 30 May and present plans are to appoint a further 100 males and 25 females before the end of the year.  However, the precise numbers to be appointed will depend on the level of vacancies arising from resignations, retirements and deaths during the year.</P>

      <P>The recently published Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and <Col N="2510" /> Welfare at Work contains a number of general recommendations in relation to employers' liability insurance both in the long term and the short term.  As some of the matters at issue were outside the commission's terms of reference they recommended that a major inquiry be carried out into the whole matter of compensation for injury at work.  The commission also recommended that employers' liability insurance be made compulsory on a selective basis initially.</P>
      <P>I am examining these proposals, in the context of the report as a whole.  The issues involved are extremely complex and, as recognised by the commission, the solution to the problem does not merely lie in making such insurance compulsory, but also in ensuring that any system adopted can be properly enforced.  I intend to consult the various interests concerned before developing proposals for action.</P>
