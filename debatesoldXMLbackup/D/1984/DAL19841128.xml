      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if, in view of the very far-reaching implications for business, commerce and industry, and especially for householders and mortgages, he will make a statement or provide some way in which the House can discuss the impending rise in the bank rate and its consequential impact on mortgage rates?</P>

We are ordering business for today and surely it is part of ordering our business whether the Government will give us time to discuss this matter of fundamental and far-reaching importance which will affect practically every citizen in the country? If the Whips discuss this matter, will they be discussing it with a view to coming to some arrangement?  There is no point in the Whips discussing something if the Taoiseach is not prepared to indicate that he will accept their decision.</P>

    <Title>Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Bill, 1984: Committee Stage (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P>In page 7, subsection (2) (a), between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(xii) entitlements arising in the event of a person losing his ongoing pension payments owing to his employer becoming insolvent&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We reported progress on this last Wednesday when our spokesman, Deputy Ahern, put down a special amendment with the full support of our Front Bench and parliamentary party to ensure that in the event of insolvency and pension funds being affected by a liquidation, as has happened in numerous cases &mdash; notably Castle Brand, Nenagh &mdash; that the Minister of the day would ensure the implementation of the EC directive which requires the indemnity of the pension fund, that is, that the lost contributions on the part of the employees will be indemnified, thus <Col N="855" /> ensuring that the loss is made good here as in other countries.</P>
      <P>We gave cogent reasons for our arguments and since then the public seem to have become aware of the extent of the problem in Castle Brand and other industries. We considered this in detail over two weeks ago and, as we were conscious of the implications not just for Castle Brand but for other firms, including Irish Shipping, which have gone into liquidation, Deputy Ahern put down this motion which would in effect protect the pension fund rights of employees in the event of liquidation affecting the solvency of the fund.  Since we put down this amendment I am glad to note that it has become a national issue and I am glad that the Labour Party support our case.  However, we are capable of making the case for Nenagh without the assistance of Deputy Prendergast here or on the national airwaves.  Unfortunately, we are witnessing a trend at present of increasing liquidations.  It is evident that this year liquidations will be well in excess of last year and by the end of the year they will be in the order of 900.  This directive came into effect in October 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum says that the Bill is designed to protect employees' interests in regard to pay in the event of their employer becoming insolvent.  I am sure the Minister will confirm this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can also confirm that Deputy O'Kennedy was Minister for Finance in October 1980 when the Government of which he was a member agreed to the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister sits back smugly he should take note of the next sentence in the explanatory memorandum.  I also want to address Deputy Carey, through the Chair, whose father taught me at one stage, so perhaps I can instruct him now.  He should note that the memorandum goes on to say that <Col N="856" /> it will also implement the requirements of EEC Council Directive 80/987/EEC which came into effect on the same date and which confers certain rights on employees in insolvency situations.  If the Minister had read the first two sentences of the explanatory memorandum he would have had the information.  Because the directive came into effect in 1983 it becomes a matter of issue and obligation for the Government to implement what has come into effect since 1983, not before it.  Secondly, it becomes a matter of crucial importance because of the increasing spate of liquidations.  Regrettably by the end of this year we will have at least 900 liquidations.  That was not the position in 1980 and there is no point in suggesting or pretending that it was. From 1982 to 1984 there has been a total change and practically every day on the Order of Business the closure of firms or factories is raised.</P>
      <P>We discussed this matter at some length at our parliamentary party meeting. It is clear that the problems at Castle Brand &mdash; I know about them all too well and we discussed them on the previous occasion &mdash; are reflected and repeated in other places throughout the country. Pension funds and the rights of employees are being lost when certain liquidations are carried out because of the failure of management to contribute. There is no point in any Deputy trying to say that this Government have become aware of this problem and have cared about it or in suggesting that no other Government were concerned about the matter.  The obligation was not there under the EC directive until 1983 and the need was not there, at least not to the same extent, prior to the last two years. Now there is the need and the obligation and that is the reason I ask the Minister to support the amendment in the name of Deputy Ahern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot overstate the impact this is having in my home town, Nenagh.  I cannot overstate the frustration, the anger, resentment and the feeling of hopelessness of a workforce many of whose members have contributed on average to the fund for the past 30 years <Col N="857" /> and they will not even have the opportunity of getting employment under a new promoter.  Quite properly this matter was raised in court yesterday.  We have also a role, and that can only be discharged by the Minister, in ensuring that the proposal of Deputy Ahern which would meet this and other cases be adopted.  In the circumstances I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to go over all the arguments again but I will not do so.  Last Saturday night in the programme &ldquo;Dáil Report&rdquo; I heard the Minister say that he had listened to the arguments of Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies. Obviously he did not hear what Fianna Fáil Deputies had to say but I will not put the House through the agony of going through the arguments we put forward in a two hour period on a previous occasion.</P>
      <P>The most important amendment has to do with pension funds.  As Deputy O'Kennedy said, this matter was discussed by us at party level and it became clear that the cases referred to, such as Castle Brand in Nenagh, have been repeated throughout the country.  We must also consider the pensioners who have been on pension for a number of years: where the company concerned goes into liquidation those people lose their pension rights.  Last week I referred to Bolands Mills.  In that case some people had spent their entire working lives in the employment of a reputable company but when there was a take-over they lost a substantial amount.  They had to be grateful they got anything because under present legislation in the event of a take-over they have no entitlements.  In the case of Bolands at least the people concerned got part of their pension, but in Castle Brand the fund is insolvent and there will be nothing left.  Yesterday there was a statement by Mr. Justice Costello that there should be an investigation into what happened to the funds. We will have to wait and see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many such losses have occurred but they have never been highlighted.  As this Bill was going through the House at this time it probably focused attention on a <Col N="858" /> number of pension funds.  One point I made last week was picked up by Deputy Prendergast.  He said that when a company goes into liquidation it is bad enough for employees to lose their jobs and entitlements with regard to wages and salary.  However, they also lose the substantial amounts they have paid into a pension fund for a number of years.  In many of the traditional Irish industries that are closing now the employees had 35 or 40 years service.</P>
    <P>In his speech on Second Stage on 26 June the Minister made the following comment:</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for the protection of workers' claims relating to pay, the EEC directive also imposes an obligation on member states to protect workers' interests in the matter of company pension schemes.  I am very concerned that the entitlements of employees under company pension schemes should be protected.</P>
    <P>We fully supported that view.  Our spokesman on Finance, and hopefully the next Minister for Finance, made it clear last week he would support the Minister knowing that the contributions would have to be increased if the concession were given.  We know the money cannot be provided out of the redundancy and insolvency funds as at present constituted. We are asking the Minister to follow up on what he said on the previous occasion.  We all know that his alternative and compromise solution is to wait until there is a national pay-related pension scheme.  That will not happen until many of us have left this House, either forced out by the public or having left on retirement. The Minister was not very precise in what he said last week and I checked to see if there was any proposal by his colleague, the Minister for Health, to bring in a Bill that might resemble in any way a national pay-related pension scheme.  I was told by his Department that there was no such proposal.  In that event I welcome the Bill which I consider a good Bill.</P>
    <P>I know that the directive has been around for three years and that the latest <Col N="859" /> date by which we had to implement it was 22 October.  By funding 12 months contributions of pensions we fulfil the EC directive in the most minimal way. However, we are putting a case to the Minister in the interests of thousands of defenceless people.  They have no one to argue their case, they are out of work, they have no trade union to speak for them and many of them have lost the contributions they have made in the past 35 or 40 years.  When the directive was drafted in Europe it was obviously designed to provide such protection and the Minister admitted that on Second Stage. If there is some way for the Minister to put forward an appropriate amendment I willingly withdraw my amendment now and will wait until Report Stage.  I am as anxious as the Minister to get this Bill through so that people who have been made redundant since 22 October 1983 may receive their entitlements under the legislation.  Surely it is an opportunity to give something back to the thousands of people who have been deprived of their jobs, entitlements and pension contributions. I ask the Minister to consider doing something to alleviate this massive hardship.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with Deputies opposite in their attempts to have this matter dealt with.  It is the Government's intention to advance the progress made in relation to providing a proper pension framework for everyone.  The question arises about whether this amendment is the best way to deal with the problem.  Fundamentally there is no difference in approach to the desirability of having a national pension scheme for everyone, including the self-employed and to ensure that adequate protection is provided for people who contribute to a pension scheme to ensure that their contributions are not misappropriated or directed to some other use.  It is scandalous that moneys contributed by employees in Deputy O'Kennedy's home town of Nenagh, destined for a pension fund and presided over by trustees appear to have been used for purposes for which <Col N="860" /> they were not collected.  It is essential that in any kind of pension fund at least one trustee is nominated by the workers, preferably a member of their trade union who has access to the specialised knowledge that the utilisation of pension funds requires.  The tragedy that is undoubtedly Castle Brand's underlines the necessity for dealing with this problem.</P>
      <P>This Bill will guarantee that moneys contributed by an employee to his or her pension fund will be guaranteed for the previous 12 months in the event that those moneys were not used for the purpose intended.  To that extent there is an added degree of protection for workers which is an interim requirement under the terms of the EC directive.  However, that is not the intention of this amendment. This amendment attempts to say that any worker at any stage of his or her employment in a company will be entitled to a full pension in the event of the company going into liquidation.  To do that in the manner suggested without consequential amendments to other parts of the Bill is illogical.  We would need to establish a substantially larger fund than is provided for.  The cost of this fund is being borne entirely by the employer as part of his PRSI contribution.  What Deputies now want is that the full pension obligations in relation to workers who are employed in companies who go into liquidation will be carried.  If that were to be funded in a proper sense the employers' contribution would be enormous.  I do not think they are suggesting that they should be funded entirely by the employer because in all pension funds there is a joint contribution by employers and workers depending on terms and conditions of the fund.  The logic of adding a seventh requirement in relation to section 5 is not backed up by supporting amendments in other sections of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the situation which exists at present in relation to Irish companies.  I accept that many of them are in considerable difficulty. He will recall when he was Minister for Finance that many employers argued that they were in difficulty because of their costs in terms of taxation.  One of <Col N="861" /> the costs they complained about &mdash; I do not say I agree with it &mdash; was the cost of PRSI contributions.  It is illogical for Deputies O'Kennedy and Ahern to complain about the need for this legislation and the need for extending it to cover pension rights for workers on the one hand and to put down an amendment the consequences of which would be to dramatically increase the cost of employers' PRSI contributions which in turn would accelerate liquidations.  As a consequence of that accelerated level of liquidation it would require an increased contribution to fund the fund.</P>
    <P>We will introduce a national pension scheme during the lifetime of this Government.  The proposal in this amendment is not supported by a complementary proposal to change the nature of the fund or the structure of it.  If the motivation for putting down the amendment was to highlight the need to deal with this aspect of workers' protection I welcome and support the motivation.  At page 107 of the national plan it states:</P>
    <P>The Government intend to publish a framework for a national pension plan.  This is in line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government.  The proposals will take into account views which were submitted in response to two discussion documents, the Green Paper <i>A National Income-Related Pension Scheme</i> published in October, 1976, and the Green Paper <i>Social Insurance for the Self-Employed</i> published in January, 1978. The timetable of those publications will indicate the difficulties in getting an agreed system of pension funding for everyone including the self-employed. On a number of occasions Deputy O'Kennedy stated that Ireland is the only EC member state, with one possible other exception, which does not guarantee workers pension entitlements in the event of the insolvency of their employer.</P>
    <P>To make such a statement is misleading and fails to take account of the wide variety of pension arrangements which operate throughout the EC.  A distinction <Col N="862" /> must first be made between State pension schemes, such as the State earnings-related pension scheme in the United Kingdom or the <i>pension legale</i> in Belgium and other private pension schemes negotiated between employers and employees in those countries.  In the case of these State schemes, contributions are paid into a central fund.  The contribution level is kept under regular review to ensure that the fund is adequate to meet its liabilities.  An employer's insolvency does not affect an employee's entitlements under the State scheme.  In the case of private schemes, however, there is no guarantee and the liability of the insolvency fund extends only to the payment of unpaid contributions, usually limited to 12 months which is what we have done here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responding to the contribution the Deputy made and answering his questions.  To further illustrate the difficulty in making valid comparisons I will refer briefly to the situation which applies in a number of other member states.  In the Netherlands, for example, there is a legal obligation on employers to be members of the appropriate industry pension fund and to keep all pension fund moneys separate from other capital.  If that were in operation here we would not have the problem we have in Castle Brand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A somewhat similar arrangement operates in Denmark.  In West Germany a pension guarantee association has been established and all employers with company pension schemes are obliged to contribute to the association.  Where an employer cannot meet his pension <Col N="863" /> scheme commitments, because of insolvency, these are taken over by the association.</P>
    <P>In a report based on a comparative survey of the measures operating in member states to protect employees' entitlements in insolvency situations, conducted prior to the drawing up of the EC directive, it was stated that the question of how to protect employees' rights and future expectations under company pension schemes posed a major problem to which no solution had been found.  It was conceded that these rights and expectations were of a completely different scale to other entitlements and could not be covered within the financial means of the guarantee institutions.</P>
    <P>Given that background it is not surprising that the EC directive does not place any obligation on member states to pay pensions or indeed to pay pension contributions from the guarantee institution.  I do not wish to be petty in this way but Deputy O'Kennedy was in office when this directive was issued and being negotiated and his experience both as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Finance would have brought him into direct contact with the formulation of this directive. His subsequent experience as an EC Commissioner should have given him an insight into the way in which the directive was formulated.  During the period 1981 and 1982 there were three changes of administration here so it is not surprising that it has taken so long to get the legislation before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>What is being proposed in this amendment is out of line with the objectives of the Bill.  The amendment does not propose to change or amend the way in which the fund is to be provided for by the levels of contribution from either side.  I am not an expert on national pension schemes but from my limited knowledge I know that the provision of a national pension framework into which existing company pension schemes could interact with State topping up schemes and into which individuals, like those in the VHI, for instance, could opt for certain levels relative to what they foresee would be <Col N="864" /> their own needs, with comparative adjustments in contributions, is an immensely complex matter which we have not yet been able to deal with satisfactorily. Given the level of liquidations we have had, although according to statistics they seem to be decreasing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am quoting Colm Rapple of the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  In his business column he uses the headline: &ldquo;Worst Over as Irish Firms See Sharp Slow Down in Failure Rates&rdquo;.  He is recognised as an independent journalist.</P>
      <P>However, we see far too many companies going into liquidation.  The broad implications of this amendment have not been considered sufficiently deeply by Deputies opposite.  If they were logically to pursue the implications of the amendment they should have provided for consequential amendments elsewhere in the Bill.  We have debated this earlier and I hope the Deputies opposite will not go over the ground again.  We are meeting our EC requirements and are even going beyond the requirements of the directive in many matters.  We have covered arrears contributions for up to 12 months, which were contributed by employees but were not properly processed or protected by the employers or the trustees of the pension funds.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the problems in relation to a national pension scheme and the need to provide an adequate framework for all employees, including self-employed if they wish to come into the scheme.  This amendment could not possibly deal with that problem.  Within the framework of our national plan the Minister for Social Welfare will advance the proposals for the construction of what is clearly necessary, and I welcome the support Fianna Fáil have offered in relation to this.  It will not be done easily and much effort and sacrifice from both sides will be necessary.  As I have said, I am not in a position to accept the amendment because it is contrary to the whole thrust of the legislation before us.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not indicated the extent of the increase in cost to employers and the State pending the introduction of the proposed national pension plan.  We asked the Minister to indicate what those costs would be but beyond telling us that they would be enormous we have not been told, although there has been an opportunity to do research into it.</P>
      <P>I wish to make some corrections in relation to what is causing liquidations. There are many contributory factors and I suggest that PRSI contributions are a small element in it.  The Minister must know that the entire tax climate for business is causing these problems &mdash; I will not go into the dramatic news of the imminent bank interest rate increases. Particularly in relation to Castle Brand, it is the luxury level of VAT imposed by the Government on essential items of kitchen ware that has driven Castle Brand and others like them to the wall.</P>
      <P>During the course of the Finance Bill debate last year I pleaded with the Minister for Finance not to impose a 35 per cent VAT rate on essential items in any household, pots, pans, cups and saucers etc.  The response of the Minister for Finance was that 35 per cent is not a luxury or penal rate but a standard rate. I had called the rate a luxury one.  That penal rate now has become standard under the regime of the Minister for Finance and the Government.  Because of that it is standard to have a 35 per cent VAT rate charged on pots and pans.  That is the main reason for the drop in consumption of Castle Brand commodities. We are being asked to ignore that.  It is killing companies like Castle Brand.  I would remind the Minister that in 1980 and 1981 these levels of taxation were not there.</P>

      <P>It is not the job of the Opposition when they put down amendments to go through the entire Bill and make consequential amendments.  We have done a damn good job on this Bill <Col N="866" /> having regard to the resources available to us.  The Minister has the parliamentary draftsman and civil servants to advise him and he is lucky to have them.  We have one secretary, one typist.  We have done rather well.</P>
      <P>If the Minister says further consequential amendments are necessary he should draft them.  Either he accepts the principle of what we are talking about or he does not.  He has resources in his private office and in his Department.  Incidentally the Department of Labour are the biggest growth Department.  We are seeing cutbacks in public expenditure but the Department of Labour have a 44 per cent increase in their Vote for next year. There is a one per cent cutback in the Department of Agriculture.  If with £160 million the Minister cannot find somebody to draft a consequential amendment that is a terrible acknowledgement.  Our case has been made cogently and there is no point in going into further detail.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  I am amazed at the Minister's last argument.  He said he accepts the need for pension rights to be guaranteed in some form but not in this way. That is an effort by the Minister to get out from under his responsibilities.  This Bill is introduced in response to an EC directive.  It does not say that in the Bill but it is specifically stated in the explanatory memorandum that the Bill is designed to protect employees' interests in regard to pay in the event of their employer becoming insolvent.  It states that it will also implement the requirements of EC Council Directive 80/987/EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That directive is quite extensive and detailed.  In Article 8 it states that member states shall ensure that the necessary measures are taken to protect the interests of employees and of persons having already left the employer's undertaking or business at the date of the onset of the employers' insolvency in respect of rights conferring on them immediate or prospective entitlement to old age benefits, including survivor's benefits <Col N="867" /> under supplementary company or intercompany pensions schemes outside the national statutory social security schemes.</P>
    <P>That is a very specific directive.  If it is the Minister's intention to implement that directive he should include in this Bill the provision he says he agrees with. He says it is necessary but not in this Bill. It should be included in this Bill.  If the Minister feels this amendment is not satisfactory he should implement what he feels is the correct procedure.  He has said that he agrees entirely that this right must be protected.  The only thing left to many hundreds of people who have been thrown out of their jobs because of insolvencies is their pension right.</P>
    <P>The Minister understands all the arguments for the amendment but he feels this is not the place to do it.  I submit that it is.  It is laid down specifically in the EC directive that it should be done.  It is not included in any other part of the Bill.  If the Minister accepts the need for it he should include it in the Bill in whatever way he feels is the correct way.  It is absolutely essential that, when rights to holiday pay, sick pay and any other payments due to employees are being recognised in this Bill, pension entitlements and pension funds should also be recognised in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has explained <Col N="868" /> that pension rights in private companies are organised under a system of trustees in which the employees and the assurance companies are involved.  In providing for 12 months in the Bill the Minister has gone as far as possible.  There has been gross negligence by some people.  It is going too far to say the employer or the employee should be encumbered with a new charge for an open-ended pension scheme.  The Minister quite rightly recognises that companies can have difficulties from time to time.  A 12 month period is long enough.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand Deputies asking for a period longer than 12 months when there is a responsibility for the collection of funds.  There is also a responsibility to the employee and that is not being recognised.  There is a great need for legislation to penalise people who are guilty of negligence in this area.  Some employers have avoided paying PRSI. This was a grave disservice to people who paid their PRSI.  Even semi-State bodies have not seen to it that sub-contractors have paid their PRSI contributions.  The Minister has gone far enough in this Bill. He has recognised the dilemma of a company going into liquidation.  He would be going too far if he provided for a period longer than 12 months.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would give a brief outline of how, under subsection (3), the sum is made up.  I assume it is in line with statutory instrument No. 108/83.  Is it to be amended in line with the cost of living?  I should like to know, too, if awards granted by the Employment Appeals Tribunal are paid normally by the company concerned or by the tribunal?  Does this legislation mean that in future an employee's award against a company who had become insolvent will be paid by the tribunal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the Deputy's first question, the figure is linked with the figure used in the redundancy legislation. It will be adjusted accordingly.  As I said on the last occasion, I am trying to harmonise worker protection legislation so that the same standards will apply in respect of rates of pay and hours thresholds. In this legislation the threshold is 18 hours.  That is the case also in the redundancy legislation which has been interconnected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to correction, my understanding is that for the purposes of this legislation <Col N="875" /> where an Employment Appeals Tribunal's decision relates to an increase in a worker's pay or extra holiday money or the resolution of some dispute relating to money, it would be deemed to be a worker's right that the award would be in addition to arrears of wages or holidays. It may happen that extra cash granted at arbitration had not been paid to a worker.  In that instance and in the event of a company being insolvent, the money would come out of the fund just as the other moneys would.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received some additional information which I shall give to the Deputy lest there be any misunderstanding. In relation to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, if a case was filed by a worker in a company in September and the company went into liquidation in October and if the tribunal hearing did not take place until October and they made a recommendation after the company went into liquidation for cash to be paid to the worker, it would be payable out of the fund.  The application for a hearing would have to be made while the company was still trading and solvent.</P>
      <P>We will be relying on the liquidator in cases where there are formal liquidations to ensure there is no collusion between workers and employers.  We will inspect the documentation submitted.  Where no liquidator is appointed and where my Department at my request move into the shoes of the liquidator for the purposes of this legislation, we will take the normal precautions to satisfy ourselves that there was no collusion.  In doing so we will have recourse to the tax office to get records.  If somebody claims he was due eight weeks' money and was not paid, one way of checking would be to see what was paid through PAYE and PRSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In present circumstances there is rarely a claim for more than one week's pay because employees will not continue to work for more than a week in the event of a liquidation if they are not paid.  Under this legislation employers will know that their employees can claim up to eight weeks pay.  There will be an inbuilt enticement to employers to keep their firm going for a number of weeks on the basis that their employees will have a claim.  Surely it is in the interests of the Department to have some mechanism which would make employers inform them in time that they could not pay their employees.  The Department should be informed on day one.  If it is stipulated in the regulations that they must inform the Department after the first week that they are not paying their staff, the Department will know what that company is doing and thus be saved <Col N="877" /> from having to meet the employees' claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will look at that when we are formulating the regulations.  We could request it or make it a requirement.

Companies which are put into liquidation or receivership by a main creditor, invariably the bank or Revenue Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Needless to say, this is welcome in that it will standardise all legislation in bringing it down to 18 hours.  The Minister knows as well as I do that a number of employers will now reduce their normal working week from 19 hours to 17 hours.  Can the Minister see any way that people who work any minimum number of hours, let it be one or two hours a week, can be covered under the Bill?  Unscrupulous employers engage in sharp practice and employ people of poor educational background &mdash; we spoke about cleaning contract companies and catering type companies &mdash; in such a way that they are <Col N="882" /> never entitled to anything.  As soon as they become aware of this legislation through their employer bodies they will reduce from 19 hours to 17 hours and again their employees will have no entitlements under the Redundancy Payments Act or any of the other Acts which are amended by this section.

      <P>There can.  We are working on it in conjunction with other member states because the phenomenon of part-time work is increasing and is likely to increase in the foreseeable future.  A draft directive on part-time work is being prepared in the EC during our Presidency and that will supply the framework.  In much the same way this legislation comes within the framework of EC directives to extend cover to part-time work.  I accept that once you lower the threshold people will drop just below it.  The original threshold in the 1967 Act was 21 hours, subsequently amended in 1979 to 20 hours and now we are harmonising it down to 18 hours.  The movement has gone with it in the number of employers who want to evade their responsibilities and obligations.  Having an hourly threshold on its own will not be sufficient, but we will be in a position to reply more substantially when the part-time directive is finalised.</P>

      <P>We had a fairly lengthy debate recently on the other Bill concerning how regulations can be brought before the House.  The Minister for the Public Service made what I thought was a good case in support of the Ombudsman Bill: that in future rather than regulations being laid before the House for 21 sitting days, unless somebody puts down an order to amend a regulation, the regulation automatically passes at the end of 21 days.  In the debate a number of Deputies said that this should be done in most Bills and in order not to hold up the House perhaps an hour could be set aside each week and then if somebody wished to raise an objection or a point on a regulation going through the House it could be done.  This would be preferable to the present system of a regulation being laid before the House for 21 days and then it automatically passes.  Members should have a right to debate a regulation.  The Minister could say that it is on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, regulations on the <Col N="884" /> Order Paper can be missed.  This happens in every session and I can quote a notable example of it in this session where I and all other Members missed a regulation that the Minister for the Public Service put down that we would have transferability in the public service.  Nobody noticed it until some sharp journalist picked it up.  Then there was uproar about the fact that it could have been debated in the House.  I understand that the Minister for the Public Service or any Minister can implement a regulation subject to its being passed in the House.  What I suggest seems the better way because, with all the regulations listed on the Order Paper in any period of 21 sitting days, major amendments could be made by regulation without any chance of this House debating the point.  I accept that if we were to debate every regulation in this House we would have a major problem, but they could all be listed in one comprehensive list and they could all go through.  If people wished to raise them, say on Thursday afternoon during an hour, they could raise points relevant to them.</P>

      <P>It is.  But in the case of the Ombudsman Bill, the last Bill passed in the House, the Minister for the Public Service accepted what I am saying, that we have got away from that standard.  We can take it in conjunction with reform of the House.  This wording has been in use for three decades now, but the Minister for the Public Service has accepted what I have said and I would ask the Minister to do likewise.

      <P>One of the advantages of the arguments made and the amendment to the Ombudsman Bill is that there would not be delays in future.  For example, if the Minister wished to adopt that procedure today, 28 November, and bearing in mind that we have approximately ten more sitting days before the Christmas Recess and we will be returning at the end of January, he will have to wait a further ten more sitting days which will bring him to the end of February. Under the terms of my amendment, which has been accepted by the Minister for the Public Service, it will not be necessary to wait 21 sitting days.  The Minister will be obliged to lay the regulations before the House within a week.  Therefore, there will not be any delay.  Each week a Minister could have regulations before the House and if the House wished to debate them there will not be any difficulty about doing that.  Rather than delaying a Minister, and his Department, my amendment will help to speed up the operation.  The 21 day procedure has had the effect of delaying a number of important regulations.</P>
      <P>I accept that in some instances a Minister has the power to implement an amendment to an order by regulation without waiting but on an important issue he would not take that chance and wait the 21 sitting days to bring it before the House.  Part of the reform of the Dáil we are trying to carry out is to have built into all legislation a system whereby all regulations made under various Acts by Ministers will be dealt within a week.  We are hoping to forget about this silly 21 day procedure.</P>

      <P>I am in a difficult position. I support what the Deputy is suggesting but it is a procedural change which could affect all legislation.  I am reluctant to adopt that change without consultations. I was not aware that this had taken place in regard to legislation introduced by the <Col N="886" /> Minister for the Public Service.  My concern is to move as quickly as possible to make regulations so that money can be paid out.  It is possible, having regard to the debate that has taken place on this Bill, that we would have a further debate on the regulations although I accept that is not the intention of Deputy Ahern. However, other Members might want a further debate.  Reluctantly I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not interested in delaying the legislation.  The Bill was drafted some time back.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that my amendment contains the exact wording of a provision in the Bill dealing with the Ombudsman which was passed recently.  I understand that other Departments are adopting a similar position in regard to legislation.  I accept that the Minister's officials when they drafted the Bill in April or May last were not aware of such a provision.  If this causes the Minister any problem we will not press it but it would be better if all Departments updated their positions and brought them into line with what the Minister, Deputy Bruton, as Leader of the House, is doing and with what has been accepted in recent legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> In page 5, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(ii)  the date on which the liquidation is finally concluded and the company is wound up, or&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to make a last attempt to help employees who, following a full investigation of a company's assets, do not get any finance under the legislation. We have sought a change in this regard on Second and Committee Stages.  We want to include the date on which the liquidation is concluded and the company is wound up.  Our argument is that when a liquidator is called in, employees may feel there are adequate assets to pay their entitlements but, following a full investigation, it may transpire that the position is different.  We have seen some examples where administrators or liquidators were called in and they found that the position was different from that indicated to them. I do not have to cite the two examples that received a lot of publicity in recent days.</P>
    <P>A liquidator or administrator can be as much as £80 million out in his assessment based on the information he was given when he went into a company and the position he discovered after a full examination.  Employees prior to the effective date of the EC directive, October 1983, may have been happy that there were adequate resources to pay them their entitlements but they may find now that following the liquidation there are no funds, with the result that they lose out.  The Minister is aware of our arguments and I appeal to him, in the event of his not accepting our amendment, to consider carrying out some examination to deal with hardship cases.  Some firms in the summer of 1983, on the information available to the liquidator may have had adequate assets to pay employees their entitlements but those employees may now find that such assets do not exist.  The Minister should examine such hardship cases.  That would help to overcome some of the fears we have expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Ahern's amendment.  I do not <Col N="889" /> wish to reopen the arguments put forward on Second and Committee Stages but when the debate has concluded there will be a few hardship cases.  Some people will not be able to claim their just entitlements. The Minister acknowledged that our amendment would be a tidier way to deal with this matter if the final winding up of a company meant that some people had outstanding sums which may have been granted to them by the Employment Appeals Tribunal as due to them.  This amendment would be a protection for these people.</P>
      <P>The Minister's argument may be that we would have to mention a date because we could not leave it open-ended.  Companies which went into receivership or liquidation many years ago, but which have not yet been wound up, might consider they would come under this legislation, therefore the Minister would find it almost impossible to estimate what the cost would be and would not accept this amendment.  He could improve our amendment and tighten it up by inserting 1 January 1983 or the date the directive was implemented.</P>
      <P>We feel this is a tidy and effective way to deal with this problem because the amount of money involved will not be enormous.  If the Minister agrees with the principle of our amendment he might wish even to improve the wording of it. If this amendment were accepted it could be very beneficial to many people out of work, especially those who are still unemployed as a result of closures and liquidations.  Perhaps the Minister will agree to this very reasonable amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We are presenting this argument because the redundancy fund stands at over £12 million.  This was debated in detail last week.  There is a comparatively small number of employees caught in the circumstances Deputy Daly and I have outlined. <Col N="890" /> Employees understood that the liquidator would find that there were adequate assets to pay their entitlements, but following the liquidator's selling the assets, or investigating the assets and discovering that the assets mentioned on balance sheets did not exist, these people would not be protected under the employees' legislation.  Many people could have lost out by way of pay or holiday entitlements but not very great sums of money would have been involved.  This Bill will become effective from 22 October 1983, but the earlier part of 1983 was the worst period in the history of the State for liquidations and insolvencies.  If there are people still unemployed since early 1983 they have been suffering great hardship.  The maximum sum involved will be in the region of £200 per individual.  If the Minister does not allow them by right to claim this money, perhaps he would allow them to state their case to an investigating officer and if they prove that they have suffered deprivation because of losing these essential benefits to which they are entitled under existing labour legislation, perhaps he would consider helping them.  Many of these people are on the long term unemployed list and have a chip on their shoulders against the State because they were done out of their entitlements to which they had contributed but now people in similar circumstances whose companies went into liquidation after October are entitled to this money.</P>
      <P>This is not an unfair request.  We would agree to any safeguards which might be needed to prevent the floodgates being opened so that every Tom, Dick and Harry could make a claim.  There must be a fund which is adequately financed to give assistance to some of the most deprived people in the State who have lost their legal entitlements and who are on the long term unemployment list. Surely there is some way they can be given this small amount of money.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 6 line 13, after &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert the following:&mdash;&ldquo;in exceptional <Col N="891" /> cases or cases of hardship, the 1st day of January, 1983, and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The general principle of this amendment is similar to that in amendment No. 1.  In this amendment we are leaving a certain amount of discretion to the Minister and tying the date to 1 January 1983.  The Minister mentioned the date 22 October 1983 but we want to change that to 1 January 1983.  Within the period, 1 January 1983 to 22 October 1983, where hardship exists in certain cases, the Minister would have authority to cover those entitlements.  We have taken the example of Kilrush Potteries.  In that case the very highly skilled workforce have no prospect of further employment in that area.  The Minister should take into account the hardship suffered by such people.  The plant and machinery have been sold and there is no question of new management taking over or the company being restructured and re-employing some of these workers.  This is an industry which will never be seen again. Some of these highly skilled people worked in Kilrush Potteries for 20 years and will never get similar employment.</P>
    <P>Under our amendment the Minister would have discretion to make decisions in particular cases.  This would not be an enormous drain on the fund.  The period we suggest is 1 January 1983 to 22 October 1983, and we are giving the Minister discretion to select individual companies or employees.  This is a worth-while amendment which will meet the needs of those who have suffered hardship and have no prospect of getting employment using their specific skills.  I have argued the case of Kilrush Potteries already and it is unfortunate that these employees will lose out for the sake of a few weeks. The Minister had some sympathy for our amendment on Committee Stage, but he opposed it because it would cost an amount which he was not satisfied could be justified.  In this amendment we are giving discretion to the Minister to decide within the period January-October if he would have some regard for hardship cases within that period.  It is easy to <Col N="892" /> estimate how much this would cost and it would be covered by the Minister accepting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has sympathy for these employees especially as so many companies have closed down and are not covered by the Bill. I hope the Minister will be able to do something for the people who were affected during the previous nine months. He has probably been advised that if he allows exceptional cases everybody who lost entitlements during that period will be looking for compensation but that could be covered by a definition of cases of exceptional hardship.  It seems rather heartless not to make some attempt to help those people by at least allowing them to make their case of how they are affected.  Under the Bill there are sections which allow inspectors to examine cases which have arisen since 22 October. If the Minister would allow people to submit cases for the period between January and October on exceptional grounds it would give him an opportunity to help a small number of people whom he genuinely feels have lost out on entitlements. Redundancies were at their highest in 1983 and it is grossly unjust that workers affected are not allowed to make their case.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has adopted this hardline approach because we have had a very constructive debate.  However, we had very little commitment from the Minister even though he agreed in principle with many of our views.  He stonewalled throughout the debate in regard to further concessions to these people.  It is regrettable that we still have not found a solution for the problems of this very special category who have suffered great <Col N="893" /> hardship.  In 1983 there was severe unemployment and redundancies in many industries.</P>
      <P>I made a case here for the workers in Kilrush Potteries which is a typical example of the problem that faces many other firms.  We have been disappointed at the response of the Minister and the Government to this issue.  I also noted the crocodile tears which were shed by Deputy Prendergast when he criticised the failure to implement this legislation earlier.  We all agree with that sentiment although it was not possible to implement it earlier.  It is possible to make it more effective now and it is hypocritical for Deputy Prendergast and members of the Government to argue the case on behalf of these people and, at the same time, not be prepared to influence their Minister in regard to changes.  It is regrettable that the Minister cannot see his way to meeting this as the amount of money is significant, probably in the region of £500,000. It is very important for those people who are highly skilled and competent but who will not be able to find employment in the work in which they were involved.  I am at a loss to understand why the Minister is adopting this attitude when such a small amount of money is involved.  The Minister is concerned about how much it is going to cost and because of this failure to meet this amendment, the legislation will be weaker and many people will be disappointed.</P>

I notice that is not included in the amendment. We will oppose with all the powers at our command the section relating to guidance on matters of ethical conduct because we do not think that is a function of the board.

Why is one of <Col N="896" /> the more important sections put in as one of the last sections of the Bill?  Is the Minister trying to hide something since he has separated the functions in this way?  Normally the functions of a board are listed comprehensively in legislation. In this case one of the most controversial sections is section 39.  Perhaps the Minister will answer those points.</P>

      <P>This is a quite comprehensive Bill; in many ways it is a very elaborate Bill.  I want to ensure, particularly in section 6, that the general functions of the board shall be incorporated into the section, and be seen to be incorporated, specifying the specific functions of the board.  The specific functions were not clearly delineated in the section and I considered it essential that they should be clearly set out.  There is no purpose other than producing an effective measure.

In part VI &mdash; the miscellaneous section &mdash; it is stated clearly that it shall be a function of the board to give guidance to the nursing profession generally in all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.  We are opposed to that. When the Minister spelled out the functions of the board in section 6, why did he not make any reference to what I would consider to be of fundamental importance in terms of the functions of the board?</P>

      <P>The Minister appears to have said that the functions set out in section 6 are the normal functions of An Bord Altranais.  However, in section 52 (2) we deal with the general advisory functions of the board.  Why is this inserted in section 52?  Is it to wear down the Members of this House in that by the time we come to section 52 no one will have any real interest in discussing the matter?  In all other legislation functions are listed in the section of a Bill that talks <Col N="897" /> about functions and not in an omnibus, non-controversial section.  In this case we are talking about a major section dealing with ethical conduct and behaviour of the nursing profession but it is dealt with under the heading of &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;. Perhaps we are a little naive and a little green on this side of the House but there seems to be something highly unusual in this case.  I should like some Member to quote me a precedent where a major controversial function was listed on page 25 of a Bill under the term &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;. The functions of this Bill are set out in great detail section by section and we deal also with the establishment of the new board and the dissolution of the former board but the major function is put into page 25.  It seems incredible. Before we go any further the Minister should make absolutely clear why this has been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With profound respect to my colleagues, there is a slight touch of paranoia in relation to this Bill which I have detected both in representations and in some of the comments made. For example, Deputy Bertie Ahern said in a recent newspaper report that this Bill was devolving authority on the Minister for Health to determine ethical practices among nurses.  That is nonsense.  It is devolving on An Bord Altranais.  Various bodies have read this Bill and then rushed in and jumped to mad conclusions about it.  A classic example is in relation to the incorporation of ethical powers.  I am absolutely shocked that this House would refuse to devolve to An Bord Altranais where the nursing profession have an overwhelming majority on the board, the running of their own professional body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies and some hospitals as well as <Col N="898" /> other organisations do not consider that the board should be empowered to give guidance to the nursing profession on matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.  I think it is essential.  I would refer Deputy O'Hanlon to the fact that the Medical Council have enshrined in very definite terms the ethical conduct of members of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>It is our job to raise the general level of professional standards and above all to give protection to members of the nursing profession.  That is why I have specifically put in the broad functions of the board. Section 6 (1) is no more than a general statement of the functions of the board. There has to be a general statement in some part of the Bill and it is not introduced on the basis of being exhaustive. Right through the Bill we are dealing with education and training, fitness to practise and registration.  Section 6 (1) simply states the general import and thrust of the board.  Part of their task in relation to professional conduct among nurses will be to give guidance to the nursing profession on matters relating to ethical conduct.  I will deal in greater detail with this point when we come to amendment No. 39 (a). There is a difficulty in dealing with the Bill in that we may be hopping ahead of ourselves.  My amendment is purely germane to section 6.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not understand the fundamental importance of this section.  We accept the Minister's amendment but section 52 (2) is of fundamental importance in terms of the new nursing board.  To my knowledge no similar section exists in the miscellaneous section of the Medical Practitioners Act to which the Minister referred.  If the Minister has it in mind that the nursing profession should be given guidance on matters of ethical conduct, it should be brought to the forefront.  I cannot understand why the Minister brought forward an amendment and did not include an issue which is of such fundamental importance.</P>

      <P>It is absolutely essential that early in the Bill there should be <Col N="899" /> no ambiguity as to the general functions of An Bord Altranais.  I have attempted with the help of the parliamentary draftsman to capture the broad functions of An Bord Altranais and to insert them at an early stage in the Bill.  We can get down to the specific functions subsequently, including the question of ethical practices, on the interpretation of section 6. At the moment I am simply stating the general functions and this is very appropriate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), to delete lines 34 to 41 and in page 9, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" />&ldquo;(c) ten nurses resident in the State who are engaged in clinical nursing practice of whom&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  two shall represent nurses who are engaged in clinical nursing practice in general nursing,</P>
    <P>(ii)  two shall represent nurses who are engaged in clinical practice in psyciatric nursing,</P>
    <P>(iii)  two shall represent nurses who are engaged in clinical practice in midwifery,</P>
    <P>(iv)  two shall represent nurses who are engaged in clinical practice in public health nursing, and</P>
    <P>(v)  two shall represent nurses who are engaged in clinical practice in the nursing of mentally handicapped persons,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I pointed out on Second Stage the major deficiency of this Bill, the lack of representation on the board for nurses in the general nursing area and psychiatric nursing, the two major areas in which 80 per cent of nurses are involved.  Although it may appear from the Bill that nurses are well represented on the board, they are told whom they must elect.  They must elect five from the general training area, five from the administration area &mdash; in other words, nurse managers &mdash; and only five from those engaged in clinical practice, that is, ordinary ward sisters and nurses.  The Minister should accept this in order to redress the imbalance of representation on the board.</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to alter the balance.  It is in line with what the National Nursing Council of the ITGWU, the largest union involved in nursing &mdash; the Irish Nurses Organisation do not claim to be a union and are not affiliated to Congress &mdash; have recommended. Therefore, the largest nursing union in the country, particularly representing psychiatric nurses, have asked for stronger representation on the new board.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to get away from the archaic idea, which was hard <Col N="901" /> line and paternalistic, that nurses had to be protected and looked after by the board, all of whose members would know what was good for the nurses.  The board primarily should be for the protection and benefit of the nurses and should be run by the nurses themselves, at least those engaged in practice.  That is the perception of nursing of the general public, the nurses they meet in hospital wards throughout the country.  This Bill is supposed to be designed for them.</P>
    <P>The proposed representation on the board is a major step backwards because it would further grind down nurses in an administrative system which does not include them.  They should have a majority representation on the board.  We are not asking for representation in proportion to their numbers because they would have all the membership on the board if the election were open to all nurses.  All our amendment is asking for is fair representation. That would be much more in line with what the nurses are seeking and much more democratic.  It should have been what the Minister was thinking when he designed the Bill.  He should have looked at the demands of the nurses over the years.  This would ensure that the nurses doing the work on the ground would have fair representation on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The membership of the board has been increased from 23 to 27. A working party made recommendations in regard to the new board and I wonder why the Minister did not accept them.  I agree that there is only slight variation between the working party's recommendation on the elected membership and the provision in the Bill, in section 9.  The working party recommended six elected members who are engaged in training and three or four who are engaged in nursing administration.  They recommend that there should be a training paediatric nurse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like a definition from the Minister of &ldquo;nursing administration&rdquo;. Deputy Mac Giolla asked about the number of nurses in active practice who will be among the 15 elected members. <Col N="902" /> Nurses will have a majority of the elected members, unlike the medical profession and the dentists who do not have a majority of their members elected to their respective councils.  However, it appears that nurses in active practice will not have representation proportionate to their strength.  The same can be said of psychiatric nurses of whom there are 6,000 as against 25,000 in practice.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 in my name seeks to delete &ldquo;nurses&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;midwives&rdquo; in subsection (1) (c) (iii).  The purpose of that is to guard against the possibility of having a nurse who is not a midwife eligible for membership under the subsection.  As I said earlier, it is important that we should have a definition of &ldquo;nursing administration&rdquo; because we should know at what level or grade a nurse is recognised as being involved in administration.  I suppose public health and district nurses are so engaged, as are ward sisters.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 in my name deals with the 12 nominees of the Minister for Health on the nursing board.</P>

      <P>I accept that it is not possible to satisfy all groups who feel they should be represented on this board. Many groups of nurses could make legitimate claims to be represented but, if we were to cater for them all, we would make the board totally unwieldy.  The representation for the 20,000 nurses on the wards is inadequate &mdash; five out of a total board of 27.  They comprise 90 per cent of the nurses.  They deserve greater representation.  I ask the Minister to have another look at this section and to note my request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would argue for an increase, if possible in the nursing representation on the board.  There is a fair amount of concern about what might in some cases be perceived to be a degree of imbalance.  This board is designed to regulate and improve the standard of performance and organisation in the nursing area.  Analogous boards in other professions would be much more likely to have a higher preponderance of people from the profession than that proposed in the Bill.  In this section there is provision for the Minister to vary subsection (1) by regulation.  Subsection (3) provides that the Minister may, by regulations made with the consent of the board, vary the provisions of subsection (1) of this section. Subsection (1) has to be seen in that context.  I wonder why that provision is there and to what extent it is envisaged that it would change the ratio of nursing skills represented on the board.</P>
      <P>I would argue for an increase in the number of nurses on the board.  Perhaps the Minister could increase the psychiatric representation by one person and the general nursing area by at least one. There is a strong view on the need to include midwives by naming them in the section.  I support that proposal.  There is concern about the imbalance in the 27 proposed members.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to have a look at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there appears to be an unsatisfactory imbalance here.  I note that it is intended to have three members of the medical profession on the board.  When they were setting up their own structures they did not include members of the nursing profession. While I accept that it is necessary to have an input from them, I argue that three are in excess of what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable also to have representation from the midwifery section of the nursing profession.  Sixteen out of 27 is not a satisfactory representation from the nurses' point of view.  Perhaps when the Minister is appointing members of the board, he could appoint two people from <Col N="904" /> the Department of Health.  He has expert people from the nursing profession in that Department.  If he appointed two members of the nursing profession this would help to redress the imbalance.  I ask the Minister to take note of that.</P>

      <P>I argue the case for increased practising nursing participation on the board.  The setting up of this board is a very important step.  This is the first chance nurses will have to have a real input into their affairs.  In debates concerning nurses we pay tribute to them, and rightly so.  We could give practical effect to those tributes by increasing to 18 the number of nurses on the board.</P>

      <P>I concur with my colleagues. I appeal to the Minister to increase the nurses' representation on the board. There are many merits in the Bill and in the composition of the board.  The medical service in hospitals includes doctors, nurses and management staff. Nurses have given dedicated service and they are constantly in a working capacity within the hospitals.  This is their Bill. This is their board.  I appeal to the Minister to increase the nurses' representation. As another speaker said, the two people to be nominated from the Department of Health could be reduced to one and the other substituted by a nurse.  There could be one representative of the educational field involved in nurses' training and a substitute to allow nurses to have a minimum of 18 members on the board.  This Bill gives absolute power to the Minister. It is very important that the Bill, which will have such powerful effects on the nursing profession, and on the regulation of the nursing profession, should provide that two thirds of the board will be people who will be affected by the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to increase the nurses' representation from 16 as proposed to a minimum of 18.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 proposes to reduce the number of people appointed by the Minister from 12 to seven.  Amendment No. 2 proposes to increase the nurses' representation while <Col N="905" /> leaving the first two areas of training and administration intact as the Minister proposed. Amendment No. 2 doubles the representation of nurses in clinical practice. If we are to retain the membership at 27, we have to alter the Minister's representation.  There is no reason why the figure of 27 must be maintained.  I do not propose to alter the figure of 27 but, having increased the number of nurses to 20, five from the training area, five from the administration and ten from the clinical practice area, representing all fields, amendment No. 4 seeks to reduce the number appointed by the Minister from 12 to seven.</P>
      <P>Why must the Minister appoint three doctors to the Nurses Council?  If it were a medical council, would he appoint three nurses?  We dealt with the Dental Council yesterday and there was no question of appointing three dental nurses to the Dental Council.  The Dental Council is for dentists, the Medical Council is for doctors and the board that we are setting up now is for nurses.  There is an attitude of paternalism, that you have to have doctors to see that the nurses do their job right.  That is what we should get away from.  The nurses are quite capable and totally competent to run their council. They can get advice from any doctor they wish on any medical matter.  The appointment of the three doctors is a negation of the nurses'independence and right to run their own board.</P>
      <P>We continue, in our amendment, that one person is to be representative of management, of health boards, and one representative of management of hospitals &mdash; they can be doctors, if necessary. There should be one person representing the Department of Health, one to be a person experienced in the field of education and three to be persons representative of the interests of the general public. That makes a total of seven.  The interests of the general public are very important on the Nurses' Council.  The nurses would be able to avail of the advice of such representatives in the interests of consumers and the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are asking, in the combined <Col N="906" /> amendments, is to increase the representation of nurses and remove the three doctors appointed by the Minister.  By all means, doctors may represent health boards, the field of education or hospitals, but to have them just as doctors on the council is an insult to the nurses. Amendment No. 4 calls for seven members to be appointed by the Minister and amendment No. 2 calls for 20 nurses to be appointed.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister on the mix which he has achieved in the proposals on this section. The general proposals show very clearly the number of areas in which nurses are involved.  While many representations have been made to all of us by the nurses, the present representation of 15 nurses out of a total board of 27 is not unfair. You could compare it with the 1950 Act. resulting in only 12 nurses out of a total membership of 23.  It certainly represents the required broad spectrum to be represented on the board.  Doctors would be an essential part of the work of this new board although perhaps fewer than three members would serve the purpose.  You cannot have a board dealing with the professional needs of nurses and exclude doctors from it.  They are an essential and very important aspect of the medical profession.  That the nurses on the wards, in clinical practice, perceive that they are under-represented is not a fair comment because the whole board will be working for the good of nurses in all areas.  If they perceive that they are under-represented, I would ask the Minister, in conjunction with the other Deputies who suggested it, to reconsider in his own appointment possibly increasing the number somewhat in order to give the nurses a sense of fair representation. However, I believe that it is fair.</P>

      <P>I support the other speakers who requested greater representation for nurses on the board.  It is obvious that the nursing profession should be very strongly represented but not to the point of monopolisation.  They are the people <Col N="907" /> best versed in the problems which already exist and are likely to occur in the future. Perhaps at some stage an amendment could be considered adding after &ldquo;where two shall be persons representative of the Department of Health&rdquo;&ldquo;one of whom should be a member of the nursing profession&rdquo;. That would slant the bias more in favour of greater representation for the nursing profession, as we are requesting. It will be recognising that nurses are well qualified to point out the necessity for strong representation of their profession on the board.  It would not be overdoing the representation, but merely giving to the nursing profession the recognition it deserves.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their views on this section of the Bill. Taking the question of medical representation which is the only matter that I can deal with now we must remember that on the existing board there are six members of the medical profession.  The working party recommended four members and we are now proposing in the Bill three members of that profession.  The existing Bord Altranais has a master or an assistant master of a maternity hospital, two medical practitioners engaged in the training of nurses in teaching hospitals, a psychiatrist, a general medical practitioner and a medical officer of health &mdash; six in all.  The working party is heavily representative of the nursing profession, having a large number, including all the trade unions.  That party recommended one medical practitioner in a general hospital, one from a psychiatric hospital, one from the community services and one from the obstetric side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 9 I have decided to recommend to the House that the representation be reduced to three.  It most certainly would not go below that.  In effect, I am proposing that there will be one registered medical practitioner engaged in the practice of medicine in a hospital approved by the board for the training of general nurses &mdash; a training hospital in other words.  There should be one registered <Col N="908" /> medical practitioner in a hospital approved for the training of psychiatric nurses and one engaged in the training of midwives on the obstetric side.</P>
    <P>It is about time that we here stopped this excessive inter-professional paranoia. The health services are riddled, overwrought, overstrung and massively dominated by professionalism, with the enormous tensions, rivalries and preoccupations which relate to individual professions.  We should have an integrated health service, with people working with one another, training with one another and, above all, delivering a service to the public.  It is people that matter, not professionalism.  People will not have the services if they are not delivered by the professions on an integrated team basis.</P>
    <P>I propose to retain the provision regarding three medical practitioners.  I suggest, to Deputy Mac Giolla in particular, regarding the trade unions which now propose to remove the doctors, that Mr. Eddie Brown, National Group Secretary of the Transport Union in the working party signed the recommendation. The Deputy's erstwhile colleague Philip Flynn, now General Secretary of the Local Government and Public Services' Union also signed it.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to ascertain from the Minister if there is any point in recruiting a tiny number of females to the Army, a total of 61 out of 12,063?  Is there some policy, programme or target for a certain area of recruitment or is the Minister anxious to give the impression that the Army is open to men and women by having a token number of women recruited?  Is there a target in regard to recruitment when recruitment takes place?  Will a certain proportion of the number recruited be female?  I understand that only one woman was recruited this year and last year, four in 1982 and 50 in 1981.  What is the Minister's target and policy in regard to the recruitment of women?</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> The recruiting of additional female personnel is reviewed from time to time in the light of the current strength and commitments of the Defence Forces.

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> It depends on the requirements of the Army, the Naval Services or the Air Corps and because of the small number being recruited at present those being recruited have been males.  That seems to be reasonable since the duties they will have to perform are not performed by women.  There is not a policy not to recruit women.  It depends on the resources available to the Department of Defence and the duties the military <Col N="920" /> authorities feel they have to fulfil.  At present those duties are of a combatant nature.</P>

      <P>Given that the nature of duties open to women will remain non-combatant, should the Government not start some positive move for female enlistment?  Will the Minister agree that since Deputy Molloy, who as Minister for Defence introduced the enlistment of female recruits to the Army, left that Department the momentum has stopped?  Will the Minister agree that it is now a cosmetic exercise for the purpose of being able to say that the Irish Army is open to men and women when in fact it is only open to men?

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service the reasons that extra staff have not been made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General despite the fact that he suggested in his report for 1982 that extra staff were required, and if he is aware that shortage of staff is prohibiting this important State officer for expediting reports for other years, the action that he proposes to take and if he will make a statement on the entire situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in response to a previous question, my Department have been in contact with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General about their staffing position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that office, in common with <Col N="927" /> other parts of the Civil Services, have sustained a reduction in staff numbers, they are also losing a significant proportion of their work with the introduction of new arrangements for the audit of the accounts of An Post and Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the work of the office pending that change, I sanctioned the creation, on a temporary basis, of six supplementary posts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give the total number of staff available to the Comptroller and Auditor General for 1982, 1983 and 1984?  Could he also say how far behind the appraisals are of the annual accounts for the last two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the information in respect of individual years but if the Deputy tables a question in relation to that, I can make the information available to him.  The present staff levels appropriate to the office is a total of 91 and I understand that staff are in the process of being recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister does not have this very important information, as the buck must stop somewhere. There must be accountability for State expenditure through the provision of taxes and there should not be any reduction of staff in this vital area.  Many Dáil committees are also short of reporting staff and when officers and executives of State and semi-State bodies come before those committees, there are not sufficient reporters to take factual minutes of evidence which could lead to the salvaging of some companies which are now collapsing.</P>

      <P>As the Chair has said, the staffing of Oireachtas committees is a separate matter.  The Deputy did not ask <Col N="928" /> for the numbers employed in the Comptroller's office in years gone by and if he had I would have been more than happy to give him that information.  It is important to point out that all sections of the Civil Service are bound by the requirements of the embargo.  In the case of this office, as I pointed out in an earlier reply the audit of the work of An Post and Telecom Éireann which in comparative staff numbers up to the beginning of this year comprised one half of the Civil Service, that audit work is now completed with the creation of the two new boards which will have the effect of releasing a number of staff from their duties in connection with those audits for other audit purposes.  Some months ago, to expedite the completion of the audit of the work of the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I sanctioned the recruitment of additional temporary staff for the Auditor's office.  However, the Auditor saw fit not to recruit staff.  Perhaps the situation is a little more complicated than might have been explained to the Deputy at an earlier meeting of a committee of the House.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister assure the House that there will not be any further reduction of staff in this vital area of accountability?  Has he any proposals to extend staff available to the Comptroller and Auditor General who has requested this on a number of occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have pointed out, the Comptroller is at present in the process of recruiting additional staff which will bring the number to 91.  Some of that staff will be freed from existing duties because of the cessation of the audit work in connection with the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he is aware of the dissatisfaction being experienced by applicants for the position of probation and welfare officers with the Department of Justice, the result of unannounced decisions being made in shortlisting candidates, who are equally competent to be considered and interviewed for these positions; if he is now prepared to review the situation and direct that all applicants be interviewed as normal practice; and if he will make a statement on the entire situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Recruitment to the grade of probation and welfare officer in the Department of Justice is by way of open competition conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.  The regulations governing these competitions are supplied in advance to all applicants.  The regulations provide that the commissioners may request the interview board to examine the applications and, having considered the report of the board, decide that a number only of the candidates should be called for interview.  This has been the normal practice for some years in recruitment to this grade.  I am not aware of any general dissatisfaction with the procedure and I do not propose to ask the commissioners to make any change in it.  The Deputy will appreciate that the commissioners are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and that I could not intervene in favour of individual applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any misinterpretation, I assume the Deputy is not suggesting that changes in the regulations were initiated at my behest.  Is he suggesting that I intervened in this competition in respect of an individual applicant?  If so, it would be better if he clarified that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>People applied for very important positions in this Department who, heretofore, were always eligible for consideration.  The regulations were forwarded to them on receipt of their application. They were later notified that they would not be considered.  That was not the normal practice heretofore so somebody must have intervened and an internal direction been given that these people would not be interviewed.  Why was there an intervention and how many people were rejected before interview?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to give the information but I am anxious that any implication concerning me should be clarified.  I intervened earlier this year in relation to competitions generally when I requested the commissioners to clarify their regulations to ensure that representations made by any public representative, office holder, Member of this House or anybody else elected to public office, would have the automatic effect of disqualifying applicants for positions within the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, it is extraordinary how many representations came from the Deputy's party regarding applicants to the Civil Service.  It is no harm to remind the public once again that any representations will lead to disqualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the remainder of the Deputy's question, there were 129 applicants for ten appointments and 77 of those applicants were called for interview. The Deputy is entirely wrong to suggest this was a change in the previous practice.  For instance, the previous competition in relation to these posts was held in June 1982.  It attracted 154 applicants of whom 88 were called for interview. I hope the Deputy and the House will appreciate there has not been a change in practice.  In relation to the explanatory leaflet that was sent to the applicants who made application on foot <Col N="932" /> of the advertisement, paragraph (c) of section 4 of the regulations drew the attention of the applicants to the fact that the commissioners may, having considered the report of the board, decide that only a number of the candidates shall be invited to attend before the board for interview.  The fears the Deputy may have in relation to this are not based on fact.  The position seems to have been that the interviews were conducted in the same fashion as heretofore.  The entire question of the operation of the commission was looked into at some length by the Committee on Public Expenditure some time ago.  In their interim report in February 1984 the committee, of which the Deputy is a member, specifically recommended that the commission should engage more in the practice of short-listing applicants for interview.</P>

    <P>(a)  For the purpose of the question, the cost of paying salaries is taken to mean non-capital expenditure on public service pay as defined for budgetary purposes, i.e. pay of civil servants, teachers, defence forces, gardaí, health service employees, in addition to amounts included for pay in grant-in-aid to certain State bodies and colleges.  Pay of employees of commercial State-bodies and local authorities is not included as it is not funded directly by the Exchequer, and is not, therefore, part of the Exchequer Pay Bill.  The cost of paying salaries includes basic pay, overtime, allowances and employers PRSI contributions.  The cost of public service pensions is not included in the above figures.</P>
    <P>(b)  &ldquo;Other Pay&rdquo; covers amounts included for pay in grants to non-commercial State bodies, universities and other colleges.  For the years 1975 to 1979 inclusive, the cost of pay in grants to voluntary hospitals &mdash; which was then classified as &ldquo;other pay&rdquo;&mdash; has been included in the &ldquo;health employees&rdquo; totals in column 7 above for purposes of more accurate comparison with expenditure in other years.</P>
    <P>(c)  No figures are included for 1974 as the financial year was converted to a calendar year basis effective from 1 January 1975.  Prior to this the financial year was based on the period 1 April of the first year to 31 March of the following year.</P>
    <P>(d)  The 1984 estimate does not include pay costs of former employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Responsibility for the day to day operation of the postal and telecommunication services was transferred to An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann respectively on 1 January 1984.</P>
    <P>(e)  It is not possible to distribute the provision of the £54 million in Vote 49 for pay increases payable in 1984 because the distribution of additional cost of pay increases by Vote is not known at this time.</P>

      <P>There are no general directions to civil servants on the question of dealing with representations from public representatives, whether they are made directly to civil servants or otherwise. It is for each Minister to make such arrangements as he thinks fit for his own Department.  Instructions have, of course, been issued by my Department to Departments generally about courtesy and efficiency in dealing with the public.</P>
      <P>In the case of my own Department, while I have issued no directions to staff about their dealing directly with public representatives who make representations on official matters, I expect that these representations are handled as expeditiously as possible.  Indeed on occasions I have asked staff to deal directly with Dáil Deputies where this would ensure the immediate and satisfactory disposal of business.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it might help the Deputy if I explained that we are examining a number of different possibilities. You do not buy parliamentary draftsmen off the shelf.  The training of parliamentary draftsmen, even in respect of people who have quite a range of legal qualifications, takes quite a time and the lead-in time with regard to drafting is considerable. In order to assist the Attorney General's office we are looking at various methods whereby the pressure that may come on the office from time to time will be relieved.  However, I can let the Deputy know the establishment number and the numbers currently serving.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> I propose to take Questions Nos.  13 to 23, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Reports on Anglo-Irish Joint Studies presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas on 11 November 1981, a study carried out in 1981 into measures to promote mutual understanding recommended, in principle, the setting up of a formal scheme for the exchange of Irish and British civil servants.</P>
    <P>The study was undertaken jointly by senior officials of the two Governments. In carrying out their task, the officials bore in mind the already close relations between the two countries and their common membership of the European Community.  A Memorandum of Understanding between the Irish and British Governments was signed on 19 October 1984.  The Memorandum of Understanding was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 24 October 1984; there is thus no question whatever of a secret agreement between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Justice will not take part in the exchange scheme nor was it ever intended that they should.  Neither was it ever intended that Departments such as that of the Taoiseach, Finance, the Gaeltacht or Labour would be involved.  It is, therefore, clear that all issues of national security, including our policy on neutrality, are absolutely excluded from the range of work areas envisaged under the agreement.</P>
    <P>The Departments which it is envisaged might be involved in the exchanges are: Agriculture, Education, Environment, Fisheries and Forestry, Health, Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  The participation of the Department of Social Welfare is also under consideration.</P>
    <P>The exchanges on either side will not work in key positions or in sensitive areas in the respective administrations.  Nevertheless, while working in Irish Government Departments, the British civil servants will be subject to the Treason Act, 1939, and the Official Secrets Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the exchange scheme <Col N="942" /> is not repugnant to the Constitution.  I would add in passing that there is in any event no provision in either the Constitution or the Irish legal system for seeking the opinion of the Supreme Court on a memorandum of understanding of this kind.</P>
    <P>To date no civil servants have been exchanged.  It is intended that the scheme will come into effect early in 1985.  About three exchanges each way at any one time are envisaged.  Officials on each side will continue to be paid by their own Department and will receive allowances and travelling expenses between the two countries from that Department.</P>
    <P>The exchange scheme is modelled on schemes operated between the civil services of several member states of the European Communities.  It is perhaps worth noting that the main objections to the scheme hitherto voiced have been based on wrong or distorted information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>And Deputy Gerry Collins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that in the memorandum of understanding to which the Minister has referred there is no reference whatever to the exclusion of any Department?  Would he indicate the status of the exclusions he has mentioned? He has mentioned the Departments of this State which would be involved.  What corresponding Departments in the British Public Service are involved?  Apart from the exclusions he has mentioned, which are not mentioned in the memorandum of understanding, there are areas such as agriculture and fisheries, to name but two, where our interests are very often totally divergent from British interests, both bilaterally and particularly in relation to the affairs of the European Community. Does he not see that in making an arrangement of this sort, apart from the security aspects, he is engaging in a process which could be very damaging to the economic interests of this country?  In regard to the general situation, does he <Col N="943" /> not think that in the aftermath of the humiliation following the Chequers meeting last week this is an entirely inappropriate time to proceed with any arrangement of this sort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question, the text of the memorandum of understanding does not advert, as the Deputy has suggested, to particular Departments.  I would mention again that the memorandum of understanding is in the Library of the House and has been available for inspection by Members for a month or so.  In general it is anticipated that the Departments chosen would participate in an exchange with the equivalent Departments on the British side.  The whole purpose of the scheme is to select officers with expertise and talent in a particular area who might themselves benefit and bring benefit into the service of the visiting country.  If an official from, say, the Department of Health or the Department of Social Welfare were chosen, it is probably unlikely that the exchange would occur unless the equivalent Department in Britain had a civil servant deemed to be suitable who was willing to participate.  In every Department there are some areas that are more sensitive or confidential than others.  It would naturally be the intention, presumably on both sides, to ensure that the assignment of officials to any particular area would take due cognisance of the nature of the work and the work area to which the officer might be assigned.  The Deputy has mentioned that where the aims and aspirations of the countries might not be <i>ad idem</i> at Community level it would not be appropriate for either country to assign an officer to such an area.  In general the exchanges are designed to promote mutual understanding. I would have thought that the Deputy would have favoured such exchanges in view of the fact that it was arising from his discussions with the British Prime Minister that the arrangements for these exchanges took place.</P>

      <P>We should extend the time for these questions in view of the fact that the Minister has seen fit to take 11 questions together.  I asked a number of very specific questions.  First I asked him to state the specific status of the exclusions.  The memorandum of understanding does not indicate that any Departments are to be excluded.  What guarantee has this House that the Departments he mentions will be excluded?  Secondly, does he not understand that in the case of agriculture and fisheries there is no security in relation to what he said about the particular areas of Departments because the memorandum of understanding states in relation to civil servants that they will be integrated to the fullest extent possible in the work of the receiving Departments?  In the case of agriculture, does the Minister not realise that one of these British civil servants would have access to the full range of activities of the Department, as would be the case in relation to any other Department?  The Minister did not advert to the important aspect of this matter which is on everybody's mind.  In the humiliating aftermath of the recent meeting in Chequers, does the Minister think it appropriate to proceed at this time with an arrangement of this sort?  Should the whole business not be postponed indefinitely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement whereby the officials will be exchanged is based on mutual understanding and the Departments which either Government feel are appropriate are the only Departments which would participate in the exchanges.  Obviously the Departments outlined in my initial reply would not be regarded by this Government, or I presume any other Irish Government, as appropriate to participate in the exchanges.  I have given that undertaking and guarantee to the House.  Much of <Col N="945" /> the difficulty in this regard is based on a statement made by a person in the immediate aftermath of the signing of the memorandum of understanding which contained a series of factual inaccuracies and in particular suggested that Departments which were excluded because of their security nature were to be the subject of this procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No one Department is more important than another.  Deputy Haughey mentioned the Department of Agriculture.  There is no one civil servant in that Department who could be privy to the full and diverse range of all the activities in which they are engaged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with, perhaps, the exception of the Secretary of the Department. The intention is that officers who would have expertise would be based in particular Departments where it was recognised by each Government to be of benefit to them.  The apprehensions expressed by Deputy Haughey could presumably be equally expressed by somebody who was churlish enough to be opposed to this move on the British side. That in many ways reflects reservations expressed by the team, by many members in the Unionist tradition in a debate on this matter in the Assembly recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, I wish to answer the last part of the Deputy's question.  I do not see that arrangements such as these, which are based on encouraging mutual understanding, for any particular reason should be set aside or postponed at any stage.  Indeed, I suggest to the House that one of the difficulties our country has been suffering from is lack of initiative to promote better understanding between the two countries over the years, and the fact that too many people are too ready too easily to suggest the postponement or abandonment of anything that is designed to encourage or to promote mutual <Col N="946" /> understanding for reasons of their own. I want to make it clear that the events leading up to the signing of the memorandum of understanding arose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from discussions which the Leader of the Opposition had with the British Prime Minister in 1980. As a result of those, it was decided that a further series of meetings should take place.  The discussions in December 1980 between then Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister commissioned joint studies by groups of officials &ldquo;to assist them in their special consideration of the totality of relationships within these islands.&rdquo;  One of the studies was to be into &ldquo;measures to encourage mutual understanding&rdquo;.  On 30 January 1981 the terms of reference for this study were agreed.  One of the items was &ldquo;secondment of officials&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister to give me a number of assurances and he has failed to do so.  I ask him again to tell us what assurance we can have that the Department he mentioned will not be included in this memorandum of understanding. I want to know if he is satisfied that other very important Departments will not be included in this exchange which could result in very serious detriment to the interests of the country.  He has said that only three exchanges will be made at any time.  Can he possibly think that would be any safeguard in view of recent events which have shown us in regard to the British public service that only one mole could bring disaster to the national interests of that country?  I want to ask him in view of paragraph 2 of the memorandum, how he can be satisfied &mdash; that paragraph refers to responsible work in the field of administration and states that the exchange civil servant will be integrated to the fullest extent in the work of the receiving Department &mdash; in such circumstances and how can he possibly maintain that our security and our economic interests will be protected?  Will he please answer the questions that I have put to him?  Does he not understand that it would be the overwhelming wish of the Irish people today that this agreement would not be proceeded with in the circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In my original reply to the series of questions I made it clear that three Departments &mdash; Defence, Foreign Affairs and Justice &mdash; will not take part in the exchange scheme nor was it ever intended they should.  I went on to say that it was not intended that Departments such as that of the Taoiseach, Finance, the Gaeltacht and Labour would be involved. That is the undertaking which the Deputy sought and I have reiterated it on a number of occasions.  Those Departments are not involved in the exchange scheme and I hope the House will accept my word on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the integration of officials into the Departments to which they might be assigned, it is reasonable to expect that a visiting official would be involved <Col N="948" /> to the fullest possible extent.  If the benefit of the expertise they have is to be made available to the receiving Department, the visiting officials should be given meaningful work.  The Deputy referred to the disruption to a civil service through the activities of one person.  I am not in a position to comment on that.  I am not clear what the Deputy was referring to. In any large organisation the activities of one or more can often be unhelpful, and one must always guard against infiltration of the public service by members of subversive organisations.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to hear the Deputy suggest that the Irish people would be totally opposed to the concept of not more than three British civil servants with particular expertise or knowledge coming on exchange to the Irish Civil Service and three of our civil servants going to get the benefit of experience in Britain.  A scheme similar to this is operated between Britain and France and Britain and West Germany without difficulty. That has been so for years.  This, once again, is perhaps an indication of our basic insecurity and lack of self confidence.</P>

Is it his opinion or the opinion of his Department that this whole matter is constitutional, and, if so, what tests have been used?  Should it not be put to the test?  Should the people of this country not be asked by way of referendum whether the alleged close ties which we saw so much of in the recent past are a justification for infiltration of our Civil Service by the occupier of this country?</P>
      <P>Are the &ldquo;in&rdquo; words today in reference to Defence, Justice and Finance out, out, out?  Is that what we are to understand?

      <P>In relation to the Deputy's other questions, it is stretching credibility not only a little too far but far too far to suggest that the exchange of three civil servants, including a forestry expert, is the infiltration of the apparatus of our Government by people from Britain.  If these civil servants are to be conspirators deep in the machinations of the secret services of their respective countries, presumably the Administration in Britain is equally in fear and trembling of the nefarious activities which the three civil servants from Dublin will presumably carry out.</P>

Not only are the <Col N="951" /> British totally and absolutely our adversary in many sensitive areas in so far as agriculture is concerned but also in the fisheries area they are our greatest adversary in the EC.  In view of the debacle and the disaster of the summit, would the Minister and the Government not scrap the whole idea?  We have had too much of Britain for too long.  We do not want any more of them.  Let us not take them in and give them access officially to everything we do.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat the answer. During the past week the Minister for Agriculture has had discussions with representatives of the Clover Meats Group and the financial institutions concerned about difficulties which were being encountered by the company.  As a result of those discussions an outline of possible new arrangements emerged and these were subsequently finalised between the company and the financial institutions.</P>
      <P>The arrangements provide for additional financing for the company and will involve some rationalisation of the company's operations.  There is to be an immediate study of the entire group by a firm of consultants with the objective of placing the group on a viable basis.  This is expected to involve some slimming down of the group.  It is important that there should be the fullest co-operation from the company's management and workforce in implementing the arrangements agreed upon so as to ensure that the company will continue to make a significant contribution to the economy of the south-eastern region.</P>
      <P>So far as the Department of Agriculture are concerned, all payments in respect of intervention purchases and export supports are being made to the company at the earliest possible date permitted by EC Regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that it is important that we should not say anything in this House <Col N="955" /> which would exacerbate in any way what the chairman of Clover Meats has referred to as a crisis of confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not confirm that his Department agreed that intervention payments should be made at intervals of 120 days rather than the practice heretofore of 30 days and that this had a major effect on the cash flow situation of Clover Meats?  Would he comment now on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture have substantial dealings with Clover Meats in respect of intervention purchases of beef and in respect of export refunds and variable premium payments. Yesterday, certificates of debt to the value of £0.5 million in respect of intervention purchases of beef were issued to the company.  These certificates, which permit the Department to pay the amount involved to a specific bank account after the 120 days' delay required by EC regulations, assist meat factories in obtaining financing.  I might add also that if we breach that, we could jeopardise our intervention payments.</P>

      <P>No, it is an EC arrangement. Nearly £5 million is currently committed to Clover Meats bank account under these certificates.  Yesterday, also the Department made payments of over £260,000 to Clover Meats in respect of export refunds and variable premiums. Apart from some £15,000 which has already been paid and about £45,000 which again is being cleared, no further sums are likely to become payable in the near future.  However, certificates of debt to the value of about £400,000 are expected to be issued within the next week and about £250,000 per week for some further weeks after that.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that this is an act of gross irresponsibility on the part of the financial <Col N="956" /> institutions which are mainly responsible for the present crisis?  An institution which was formed, in the first instance, to support and assist the agricultural community have put at risk the security of almost 900 people.  This is matter of great concern and special intervention can be made by this Government to ensure that the jobs of the 900 people are maintained in the south-eastern region. Also, as the Minister has said, a crisis of confidence has been created for the management, the employees and the suppliers of this company.  There is a precedent for direct Government intervention.

      <P>The position is that a dispute on a claim has arisen and the union involved made a claim for a 15 per cent increase for the 24th round.  An offer of 3 per cent with a seven months' pause in accordance with Government pay guidelines was made and that offer was rejected.  Strike notice has been served and is due to expire on Friday.  Discussions have taken place and have continued during the week, but have not so far been successful.

In my view this matter falls completely within the ambit of the rules for Private Notice Questions.  The Chair, apparently, decided from his interpretation to rule out that question.  I should like to suggest to the Chair that this places me, and my party, in a very detrimental position.  Here we have a matter of very urgent public importance, of far-reaching implications and neither by getting Government time nor by Private Notice Question am I, or any Member on this side of the House, allowed to raise it here and have it discussed in the interest of the general public concerned.</P>

The Deputy may have one view about that and I may have another but, unfortunately, fortunately or otherwise, I am the Member appointed by the rest of the House to make decisions on matters like this.  I do not claim to be infallible but I claim to make these decisions to the best of my ability.  I had research carried out into the matter this morning with a view to <Col N="967" /> coming to a decision on whether the question was allowable on Private Notice or not.  Great consideration was given to this and I came to a decision clearly and without doubt that the question did not qualify for Private Notice and there was no way I could allow it.

It is a question of my having raised this on the Order of Business and the Taoiseach undertaking that it will be discussed by the Whips.  That is also involved. It is not even just a matter of bank interest rates.  It seems to me that there is a whole series of things happening, a rise in bank rates, a run on certain banks, the Agricultural Credit Corporation calling in loans; all these things can be traced to the psychological state of public opinion arising from the liquidation of Irish Shipping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Deputies Mac Giolla or De Rossa or the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Hanlon and I should like to explain why.  There are three points I should like to make in regard to the composition of the clinical panel.  Bord Altranais is not a management body. There is a widespread impression that it manages on a service type of basis the nursing profession.  It is a regulatory body and there is a profound difference.  In simple terms, it will be responsible for the education and training of nurses and ensuring that that is suitable.  It will also be responsible for maintaining discipline <Col N="1003" /> in the profession and it will decide on matters of great importance to the community and the profession.  For example, it will decide the circumstances in which nurses should be removed from the nursing register and the circumstances in which removal would be warranted.</P>
      <P>These matters involve working nurses in the clinical area.  We cannot have on a body essentially charged with education, training and discipline a dilution of those involved on the tutorial side and a dilution of those involved on the administrative side.  In effect representations I have received have proposed that arising from a fundamental misconception about the Bill.  If, for example, it was a joint industrial council it would have an equal number of employer and worker representatives. The Labour Court would have that type of representation but this is not that type of body.  It is a self-regulatory body on behalf of the profession. That is why I believe it would be taking a negative and narrow view if we were to exclude the three doctors out of 28 members on the board.  It is my view that three is the minimum we should have on the board.</P>
      <P>On the board at present there are six doctors.  The working party recommended four doctors but I have reduced that to three.  It is essential to have on the board a minimum of one general doctor for the training school, one doctor from the psychiatric training school and one doctor from the obstetric training side of the profession.  It would be irresponsible of me to suggest that midwives or psychiatric or general nurses can be trained in the absence of any input from the medical side.  I reject the amendment because it arises from a narrow professional reaction, particularly from some trade union reaction which is wholly inconsistent.  The trade union officers on the working party contributed at great length to this working party report.  That working party was set up by my predecessor Deputy Brendan Corish.  I have incorporated about 40 per cent of the recommendations in their report into this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> As regards membership, Mr. Edward Brown was appointed in January 1977, and this Bill has been gestating in the Department of Health for almost a decade.  I regret to say my predecessor's report was in March 1980 and this is 1984. Ministers for Health were so busy issuing toothbrushes and visiting old folks parties, getting their photographs taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They were so busy doing the PR work for their party that they could not deal with fundamental legislation.</P>
      <P>I accept that Deputy O'Hanlon is a serious colleague but some of his predecessors did not even try to do the work for which they were appointed, namely, to improve the legislative framework of the various professions, nursing, paramedical and so on.  As I said among the membership were Mr. Edward Brown, National Group Secretary ITGWU, Mr. Fergus Finlay, Secretary, National Hospitals Branch, Workers' Union of Ireland, Mr. Phil Flynn, Deputy General Secretary, Local Government and Public Services Union, and they all signed this report.  They wanted four doctors and I put in three, half the number on the present board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a very distinguished panel of nurses and matrons, for example, Sister John Berchmans Matron, Mater Hospital, Sister Francis Joseph, Secretary/Manager, St. Vincent's Hospital, Miss E. O'Dwyer, Matron, Meath Hospital and so on.  All their recommendations regarding ethical practices are in the Bill.  Some people are so preoccupied with B. Desmond that they want these points out.  This is the kind of nonsense one gets in this country because people <Col N="1005" /> cannot disentangle legislation from personalities. This has been the curse of this country.</P>
    <P>I suggest that section 9 is reasonably well framed.  I have met all the trade unions &mdash; ITGWU, FWUI, the Local Government and Public Services Union, the Irish Nurses' Organisation, the Matron's Association and I had a number of meetings with Government Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>The only possible change I could contemplate is as follows and it may allay fears and improve the position.  In this Bill it is provided that on the board there will be five nurses engaged in training, five engaged in nursing administration and five engaged in clinical nursing practice &mdash; admittedly the majority of nurses are engaged in the general and psychiatric nursing.  We have one representative engaged in general nursing administration, one on the psychiatric side, one engaged in midwifery, and one engaged in public health nursing and one engaged in the administration of nursing of mentally handicapped persons.  I would be prepared to increase the representation on the general nursing side from one to two, and on the psychiatric nursing side from one to two but I would not be prepared to go beyond that because it would unduly enlarge An Bord Altranais which is big enough already, having 27 members compared with 23 on the existing board.  On that basis I can bring in an amendment.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the points made by Deputies.  I may drop the proposal that one of my nominees should be a nurse.  I am dealing now with section 9(1)(d) where I may appoint 12 persons.  After the elections are over it may be that on a geographical basis one part of the country does not have a nurse elected to the board.  For example, it may be that of the 15 nurses elected all may come from the general nursing and psychiatric nursing areas.  It could happen that nurses of outstanding competence in particular specialities, for example geriatrics, may not be represented on the board and it would be difficult for the board to cater <Col N="1006" /> for the education and training of particular nursing specialities.  I want as broad a representation on the board as possible.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill for the appointment of two members from the Department of Health.  Some people regard that as a creeping encroachment of the State on this wonderful independent profession, which is paid for by the State.  That is absolute nonsense.  As I said I hope one of my nominees will have a nursing background &mdash; there is nothing unusual about that because it is very essential if the Department are to have an input into the development of the profession &mdash; and the second person to be appointed will probably be on the general side.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that I should delete one of the third level educational establishments.  I am a member of a trade union and I find it incomprehensible that such a suggestion should be made.  If nurses are to have graduate training, if they are to be trained in colleges and come out with third level academic qualifications, there should be at least one person representing the nurse training colleges, the Royal College of Surgeons and UCD, in other words, the third level educational establishments involved in the education of nurses.  I have no intention of changing that.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (d) one person will represent the management of health boards &mdash; that is reasonable &mdash; and one person will represent the management of hospitals. When appointing these representatives I will be writing to the professional bodies asking them to send me the name of a person from that speciality.  I will not do what Deputy Haughey did when making various appointments.  He asked for three names and then on the examination of their credentials one would be appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not indulge in that type of political chicanery.  The president of An Bord Altranais will be elected by the board.  I have changed all that.  Under the current Act I appoint the president.  I wish to divest myself of that responsibility although I do not apologise for appointing Sister Columba as president of the present board.  That is the privilege of the Minister of the day.  However, under the new Act, the president of the board will be elected directly by the profession at their first meeting. These are changes in the best interest of the profession.</P>
      <P>I do not know what misgivings or fears people have in regard to the new board. Most fears have been stirred up by people who are unused to going through legislation. Lawyers have advised religious orders that I am up to something and that, if they do not keep an eye on me, I will be running voluntary hospitals.  They say that as I am paying 98 per cent of the cost of running the hospital I am now going to decide on ethics regarding nurses, despite the fact that most of the hospitals do not have ethical guidelines. Many of them are so badly run they do not have those guidelines which is an interesting feature in terms of hospitals.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, am quite confident that the changes I suggested will be acceptable and balanced and will advance the best interests of the profession.  Deputy O'Hanlon asked me about clarification in terms of a definition of nursing administration. It would be reasonable to regard these as from ward sister upwards.  In the public health field it will refer to senior public health nurses and superintendent public health nurses who will be regarded as being in the administrative structure. That is the board classification which will come under the rules of appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that I do not see a necessity to <Col N="1008" /> accept amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy O'Hanlon.  While I fully appreciate the point he is making, I have received legal advice to the effect that the definition of a nurse as contained in section 2 obviates the necessity to amend this reference.  The definition is that &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; means a woman or a man whose name is entered in the register and includes a midwife and &ldquo;nursing&rdquo; includes &ldquo;midwifery&rdquo;. I expect that the rules to be drawn up by the board will specify the qualifications required of candidates for election in this group and, therefore, for that person a midwifery qualification would be specified.  I have been in consultation with the parliamentary draftsman and the legal adviser of my Department. I accept their advice in that regard and I do not see the necessity to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I am sure that many points will be raised but I am satisfied that the composition of the board is the best and most representative which can be put together within the constraints of keeping their size to manageable proportions.  I hope I have met the points raised so far and on Report Stage I propose to introduce amendments with the agreement of the House.</P>

Does the Minister intend to impose his standards on them?  Obviously he must because the surest way of justifying his action is to establish the need for it.  In all fairness, he will have to probe the matter much further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister normally claims to be a democrat but he is very dismissive of the <Col N="1009" /> representatives of this House when he chastised me and other Members for not accepting the recommendations of a working party who are not answerable to the public as we are.  I do not feel obliged at any time to accept the directions of anybody other than myself in my interpretation of the wishes of the people who send me here, qualified by what I think is appropriate for me to do on their behalf.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whips do not enter into it.  Maybe conscience makes a coward of Deputy Mac Giolla in respect of the Whips to whom he is answerable. On the surface it appears to refer to the establishment of another board, but when you relate it to the function of this board, section 52(2) says that it will be a function to give guidance to the nursing profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.  The Minister says that in many cases there have been no standards to date.  Unless he can demonstrate to me how the establishment of this board will improve the existing ethical standards, I cannot accept section 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All legislation should be about fulfilling a need or improving a service which already exists.  The Minister has advised the House that in the opinion of his advisers there is a need to create something that does not exist.  My fears are that the purpose of this legislation is to destroy what already exists and is acceptable.  I am not dealing exclusively with the actual membership but with what will be a function of the board.  I am never beholden to anybody but we must all express views arising from our own experience which we know to be true.  It is fashionable nowadays in the area of education to criticise the terrible Christian Brothers and priests.  We all know that most of us would not be here except for the Christian Brothers, nuns and priests.  Because of human frailty they had in their midst individuals who are not representative of the general body of persons in it, but that also applies to politicians.  We cannot <Col N="1010" /> condemn an entire profession because they had in their midst a person who did not satisfy the requirements of the profession.  We know that many of us would not be here were it not for the fact that when we required medical attention we had the good fortune to go to hospitals where the religious had a dominant role. We were happy then that the ethical standards obtaining were appropriate for us. In the establishment of the board and in particular with reference to section 52(2) there is no recognition of that.  Various categories of people have been mentioned and I am sorry to see that the physically handicapped have not been included.  Unfortunately there are many physically handicapped people who depend totally on the nursing care they get.  The Minister might indicate if he is aware of the omission of that category and let us know if he will make provision for the inclusion of a nurse, male or female, who could speak on behalf of the physically handicapped.</P>
    <P>My real fear and criticism of this legislation is that it tends to disregard the vital input into our medical services of the religious.  I make no apologies for saying that.  Again, it is not the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing. Rather is it fashionable to throw bricks at the religious and run.  Apart from any other consideration one gets more publicity for doing that.  I do not seek publicity for anything I say here.  I speak the truth as I see it.  It is a most retrograde step, especially in the matter of medical ethics, to remove the only guarantee we have. If this legislation is passed I will not be happy if the element we have at the moment in regard to this matter is discarded.  My wife and children, my friends and the people I represent will be equally uncomfortable.  I know that all of us may have had occasion at times to criticise a person whom we might describe as &mdash; I leave out the epithet &mdash;&ldquo;a &mdash; of a nun&rdquo; but that was only one person who was probably in bad form and was not representative of her group. One cannot generalise.  We must accept the facts as we know them.  Let the Minister ask people if they are happy with the situation up to now, and if they are very <Col N="1011" /> anxious to have new bureaucratic ethical standards in our hospitals.  I do not think he will find too many people who are interested&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla is a man of reason and sense.  He will realise it is not improper or irrelevant to relate the functions of the board as indicated in section 52(2) to what the board will do and the type of people on the board. Surely the matter of what will be the function of the board is relative to the personnel who will be on it.  While I know that one should not develop contributions on section 9 that would be appropriate to section 52, a passing reference to it can be made.  I am happy that I have indicated my position.  I have expressed my thoughts and I finish as I commenced, <Col N="1014" /> paying my tribute to the invaluable and indispensable contribution that has been made to nursing, hospitalisation and medical care in this and other countries by the religious.  I am happy that, apart from other considerations, in the matter of the ethical standards they are as high as I would require them.  Naturally I will be pleased to hear how the Minister proposes to my satisfaction to raise them. Finally I would ask him to indicate what provision he has made for the physically handicapped in the membership of the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that such a long time has been spent on section 52 since we will reach it later.  The Minister was the one who raised it and Deputy Tunney was replying to the Minister.  It should not have been raised at this stage.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that the Minister has appeared to agree to amend section 9(1) (c)(i) and (ii).  He accepts that the figures in paragraphs (i) and (ii) shall be two rather than one.  That is an advance and it is something which has been demanded by people in the nursing profession.  I would refute the point, as Deputy Tunney did, that anyone here or anybody in the trade union must accept the decision of the working party and what was signed by them.  The Minister has said he has implemented 80 per cent of that report.  The trade union involved did not sign the working party agreement.  They are quite entitled to their own amendments to this Bill without being abused by the Minister.  Because certain people who are part of the trade union movement signed the working party document they are being harrassed, harangued and abused by the Minister because they want more representation by general nurses than the Minister has provided for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Nurses' Organisation want to have 18 nurses.  They propose a different method of electing the 18.  Under the Bill there are to be 15 and then the Minister would appoint one nurse.  Now the Minister has agreed to include two more from <Col N="1015" /> general clinical practice but he is suggesting that he will no longer appoint one nurse.  In other words, subsection (1)(d)(ix) would be altered.  Nobody asked him to do that.  Why not continue to appoint one nurse?  That would be 18, as requested by the INO.  The transport union, who generally deal with nurses in general practice, have asked for 20 nurses, while 18 is the minimum asked by others.  I would hope that the Minister would at least continue to appoint one nurse.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a long attack on the second amendment in regard to doctors being appointed.  He is suggesting that in our amendment we are saying there should be a total absence of any input from the medical profession.  He said this was outrageous.  Of the people appointed by the Minister one shall be a person who is experienced in the field of education and one shall be a person representative of third level educational establishments which are involved in the education and training of nurses.  These can be medical people.  One should be a person representative of management of hospitals other than hospitals administered by health boards.  There can be medical people involved in that area.  In addition to those and the two representatives of the Department of Health, the Minister specifically wants to appoint three medical practitioners.  In many cases medical practitioners treat nurses as their employees, although they are not their employees.  They would be inclined to endeavour to dominate or domineer the nurses on their own council.  They have no place on the nurses' council, any more than nurses have a place on the Medical Council.  This is the point we are making. Is the Minister suggesting that the nurses themselves are unable to do this job? Is Deputy Tunney suggesting that the nurses if they were in control of An Bord Altranais would have lesser ethical standards than before?  Why would the nurses aim at lesser ethical standards than they had, any more than doctors or other people on the board?</P>
    <P>I understand the religious will be <Col N="1016" /> included under the administration section. Those who are in the nursing area will also be included.  A total of 17 people will be elected by the nurses, so religious who are involved in the nursing area may be put forward for election.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister at least to cut down the number of medical practitioners being appointed to the board.  There is an improvement in the election area, although it would be far better if the Minister continued to put two from the general nursing area so that there would be five from the training area, five from administration and ten from general nursing. That would give them their appropriate place.  I am glad that the Minister has agreed to put two from general nursing practice and two from psychiatric practice on the board.</P>

If so, he is under a misapprehension. Any nun or brother or priest, if he or she should hold a nursing qualification, will be eligible to be elected.

      <P>Deputy Tunney referred to nurses for the physically handicapped.  There is no division of the register for nurses for the physically handicapped. The Bill relates to a number of divisions of the register, namely, general nursing, psychiatric nursing, mentally handicapped nursing, public health nursing and midwifery.  We must have regard to the professional body which, incidentally, were attacked by Deputy Woods in regard to work of extraordinary value. The working party did not recommend that there should be an entirely separate register for nurses for the mentally handicapped. The working party had given the matter every consideration.  I do not know of any group of specialised nurses dealing with the physically handicapped who would seek a separate register.  I took note of the points raised by Deputy Tunney but I am confident that I reflect the views of the outgoing board, of the working party and the experience of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was asked about the functions of the board in regard to unethical conduct.  Under existing legislation it is not possible to deal with this matter unless we have particular complaints. Tomorrow morning, if the board get a complaint that a nurse behaved in an entirely unethical and unprofessional manner, either the nurse will be taken from the register or no action will be taken.  That is the only power the board have.  I am proposing a similar provision to that made for the medical profession in 1978 &mdash; there has not been nurses legislation since the fifties.  I propose to insert a section which was unanimously accepted by the House in 1978 in regard <Col N="1019" /> to the medical profession.  Section 69(2) of the 1978 Act states:</P>
    <P>It shall be a function of the council to give guidance to the medical profession generally on all aspects relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.</P>
    <P>I have here a copy of the current ethical conduct code for 1984 published by the Medical Council.  It is a very interesting document.  It was approved by the Medical Council of Ireland at their meeting on 11 April 1984.  The second edition was published in October 1984.  It is a very important document.</P>
    <P>It recommends to the medical profession how they should conduct themselves in relation to fee splitting, advertising, attendance of doctors on their families, medical consent which is a major issue, confidentiality &mdash; another major issue &mdash; human research, reproductive medicine. It is stated in the code of conduct that abortion in any circumstances is professional misconduct and that it is illegal in the Republic of Ireland, that doctors must be prepared to resist requests by patients and their relatives to advise termination where pregnancy is unwanted. It deals with donor organ procurements, euthanasia, relationship to prisoners, alcohol and other health disorders.  I could go on.</P>

      <P>For the first time in the history of the profession &mdash; and when I explained this to the INO and to the Local Government and Public Services Union at a meeting last week they welcomed the prospect &mdash; a guide to ethical conduct will be determined by the profession. You cannot determine professional misconduct and fitness to practise unless you have a guide for ethical conduct and what it constitutes.  It has absolutely nothing to do with the selective fear raised by Deputy Tunney that I intend to intrude on the current ethical codes within the hospitals.  It has nothing to do with that. The promulgation by An Bord Altranais of a code of ethical conduct for the profession as a whole has absolutely nothing to do with the existing, where they exist, printed codes of conduct operating in particular hospitals, be they set out by a health board, or a private hospital, or a public voluntary hospital.  Some of them have varying documents and a large number of them may have none at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The fitness to practise provisions are being brought into being.  We are dealing with the composition of An Bord Altranais.  In so far as it <Col N="1021" /> will reflect the general ethos of the board it is important that we should have a balanced and sensitive approach to the matter.  As now constituted the board overwhelmingly represents the nursing profession.  To suggest that the nurses of Ireland cannot be trusted and should not be given the statutory power to meet as a board and set out for themselves basic fundamental ethical codes of conduct, as were given to the medical profession, is an affront to the professional integrity and the outstanding competence of the nursing profession.</P>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the role of voluntary hospitals, health board hospitals, or private hospitals.  These are all glorious red herrings produced by people who are highly suspicious about the outstanding merits of this legislation which was carefully drafted by me and the Department arising out of the working party report.  It was drafted with great care.  There is nothing implicit in this legislation which cuts across existing codes of conduct of voluntary hospitals, health board hospitals, or private hospitals. That is the reality.  I earnestly hope this House will stick to the reality and not produce selective red herrings.  It is very easy to do that in health matters as I discovered to my cost in the past two years.  I responded in kind when these charges were made.</P>

      <P>We want to produce a Bill which will be in the best interest of the nurses and the general public and will not interfere with the character and ethos of our Irish hospitals.  There is nothing of a very contentious nature in section 9.

      <P>The Minister said Members of the House and people who made representations to him outside the House were paranoid.  He also said hospitals were badly run.  Lest it be taken that this <Col N="1022" /> is accepted by the House, on behalf of my party I want to say we are absolutely satisfied with the way Irish hospitals are run in terms of nursing, medical administration and ethical standards.  I do not want to respond to what the Minister said about ethicle conduct.  We made it clear this morning that we are opposing section 52(2).  We will deal with that when we come to it.

      <P>A number of Deputies referred to this amendment and the Minister responded.  I welcome the decision by the Minister to allow for the election of two more nurses, one from general nursing and one from psychiatric nursing. He did not tell us whether he intended to remove two nominees from his own panel of 12.  I presume he does not intend to enlarge the nursing board beyond 27 members.  He might let us know how he intends to arrange for the election of two more nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is provided that two of the Minister's nominees shall be persons representative of the Department of Health.  The Minister made an oblique reference to the fact that some Deputies thought that was an intrusion by his Department into the nursing board.  I do not feel that and I did not feel it when I submitted this amendment.  My amendment is intended to ensure that one of those two persons from the Department of Health shall be a nurse adviser.  There are three established posts of nurse adviser in the Minister's Department.  But because of the embargo implemented by the previous <Col N="1023" /> Coalition Government in 1981 and continued by the present Government, when two of those posts became vacant, they were not filled.  There is now only one nurse adviser in the Department and it is not the intention of the Minister to have the other two posts filled.  My amendment is that that nurse adviser should be a member of Bord Altranais.  After all, if there is a nurse in the Department, one of whose functions is to advise the Minister, it is important that she be in attendance at and privy to the deliberations of that board.  She could then go back to the Minister with the necessary advice, so that he could fulfil his statutory functions in relation to nursing.  I cannot see any objection to that.  I cannot envisage a situation where Bord Altranais would be in conflict with the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is important throughout the whole health service that we recognise that everybody is on the same team &mdash; the Minister, the Department, the health boards, the nurses the doctors, anybody working in that field.  If one of the two representatives from the Department were the nurse adviser, that would be in the best interests of the new nursing board.  The Minister told us the category of nurses who would be eligible to participate in the election under section 9(b) &mdash; nurses resident in the State who are engaged in nursing administration. Would the Minister consider writing into the legislation what grades these nurses should be, in case it would be decided that only matrons of hospitals or nurse administrators should be involved and that the field might be very much narrowed down from the list of people read out by the Minister here this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the indication by the Minister that he is going to take on board the general thrust of the feeling of a large body in the House, that a valid case has been made by the Irish Nurses' Organisation and various other representative groups of nurses around the country for an increase in membership, in particular of general nurses, on this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> On the move from 16 to 18, I would be interested in clarification on the appointees that the Minister is considering including here.  Perhaps he might consider whether in some capacity the number of those appointed might be reduced and the number of nurses under paragraph (c) who were engaged in clinical nursing practice would be increased. That is the area of concern.  I fully accept the Minister's explanation for the need for representatives of the training agencies of nursing administration on this board.  The board has a two-sided function, over and beyond that of other similar professional boards.  It has an important role in the management of training.  However, an extremely valid argument is being put forward by nurses, for whom this would be the major regulatory body, for adequate representation on the board.  I ask the Minister to look at the point raised regarding a possible expansion of paragraph (c) in one form or another.  Is he willing to make changes in paragraph (d), perhaps by an alteration of the balance between those two sections?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister have a look at other amendments suggested by the Nurses' Organisation relating to the specific use of the word &ldquo;midwife&rdquo; in relation to those involved in midwifery. It is desirable to have a specific improvement, because midwives of the nursing body are a group with whom 51 per cent of the population come into regular contact. Their contribution deserves specific recognition.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Tunney, I also refer to the absence of some specific mention of nurses involved with the mentally and physically handicapped, although the Minister did make some reply on this matter.  There is in the submission from the Nurses' Organisation a reference to this, specifically in one of the sections in relation to appointees from those who are trained in psychiatric nursing and dealing with the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>I again welcome, even though they are not strictly relevant here, the reassurances of the Minister in relation to the point raised by Deputy Tunney.  It is important <Col N="1025" /> to note and welcome the fact that the president of the board will be elected. That is desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the point made by the last speaker in relation to a greater recognition of the role of the midwife in the Irish nursing profession.  I have &mdash; and I am sure most Deputies here must have had &mdash; representations from people from that background who feel that they are very under-represented in the whole presentation of the Bill.  I welcome the Minister's intention to put the nursing profession on the highest possible professional level.  There is great concern among those people with experience of a background in midwifery that they are being totally forgotten or excluded in this Bill.  They feel that the proper title of the Bill should be the Nurses and Midwives Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the assurances of the Minister on the question of ethics raised by Deputy Tunney.  The Minister referred to the fact that provision had been made that this House would give guidance to the medical profession on the question of ethics.  If I heard him correctly, he said that this would in no way interfere with the written code and practice where such obtained in hospitals, whether private or coming under the public sector.  It could very well be that there is an ethos in certain hospitals which might not be written but which would have been very well established by custom and practice, in line with the religious principles of the ethics of the predominent majority of nurses in this country.  Would the Minister like to comment?  I am asking the question only for information because of the worries and reservations, which may not be well founded, on the part of people in representative groups.  They have written to me &mdash; and I am sure all other Deputies &mdash; on this line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister give the greatest possible reassurance to the interests in the nursing and medical professions that it is not the intention of the State to lay down ethical guidelines which might be manifestly in conflict with the widely held <Col N="1026" /> sense of ethics and principles of the practising majority of the profession?  I take the Minister's point.  I know that there is nothing sinister, but we are in the business of public relations and it is incumbent on the Minister and the House that that point is made clear.  I know that the Minister has had meetings with representatives of the biggest nursing organisation in the country from my union, the ITGWU, and certain points and objections were made then.  Would the Minister be good enough to make a statement to the House about the outcome of his discussions with representatives of my colleagues in my union who are very much involved in the nursing profession?</P>

      <P>When we spoke here this morning and asked the Minister for an increase in the representation of nurses on the board he saw fit to go some of the way towards that.  I want to take issue with him on a matter which he brought up.  He said that this Bill presented an occasion for Deputies to come in stupidly or crazily screaming &mdash; then he removed the adjective &mdash; into the House making their points.  The Minister was elected by people in his constituency and I and all other Deputies in this House were elected by people going to the polls and putting us forward as their representatives. I intend on any matters of legislation on which representations have been made to me and in which I have an interest to come into the House &mdash; not screaming but talking &mdash; and put forward my point of view.  It is to be regretted in regard to this Government that when, for instance, you take up matters of education the Minister says, &ldquo;How dare you?&rdquo; She is always right.  Now the Minister says that we are sinister, stupid, screaming, crazy.  We are the Opposition, therefore we have a legitimate right to come in here and represent our constitutents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was allowed a free rein to tell us what he thought of us.  I would like to tell him <Col N="1027" /> that his <i>tour de force</i> did not go down well with me, neither will it stop me from expressing the legimate representations made to me from groups of nurses whom I met in my constituency from whom I have received letters which I have answered.  If you are a public representative your duty is to listen to people. Maybe you do not always agree with them and therefore you do not put some matters forward, but if you agree with the point of view then you are right to stand up here in the Parliament and express that point of view.</P>
      <P>We are being well served in this country in so many respects by the existing hospitals, and their staff and the people who run the hospitals.  The Minister is correct, it is a long time since legislation in this regard was enacted here, I believe some time in the fifties.  It is time now, 30 years later, to bring forward legislation which will serve the nurses well.  Our job is to scrutinise every line of this legislation, and once it is passed we can do nothing more about it.  I shall be here as will all members of the other parties.  We shall not be screaming but we will be talking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to detect the Minister's appreciation of the special position of the physically handicapped.  I ask him to move a little further in this regard and assure us that in the matter of representations, when certain categories have been satisfied he will be prepared to take a special interest in the physically handicapped.  In the various elections we know that medical politics will operate in respect of specific categories and in that regard I do not see provision for the physically handicapped.  I ask the Minister to assure us that he will be especially mindful of them and include them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One purpose of having a ministerial role in relation to appointments is that one could encompass in the 12 appointees, for example, a <Col N="1028" /> person specialising in the care of physically handicapped people.  That is a possibility which I will consider carefully.  The section provides that:</P>
      <P>two shall be persons representative of the interest of the general public.</P>
      <P>It may well be that the board in their final composition will be lacking in certain areas.  I mentioned earlier today care of the elderly and nurses specialising in geriatric care.  Equally nurses specialising in the care of the physically handicapped could be brought in.  A large body of nurses are beginning to specialise in renal dialysis, cardiac work and so on who may not be elected at all either among the 17 nurses or in the other area.  I will do my utmost to encompass them.</P>
      <P>I make a point to Deputy O'Rourke as one reason why I have been particularly irate in my approach to this Bill.  Far be it from me to indulge in any way in a <i>tour de force</i> with her, but I have received 300 or 400 representations from Deputies and Senators in relation to this Bill.  I regret to say that, had the Deputies and Senators assured those whom they met that the intent and fears they had were in the Bill, were unfounded then the need for an enormous amount of correspondence and representation would not have arisen. Whether we are in Government or Opposition, a responsibility devolves upon us. I want to give another assurance here. The Conference of Major Religious Superiors said: &ldquo;Section 52 infringes on the inalienable right of a hospital to determine its ethical code&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is important to put out of our minds that there is no such impingement.  My colleague, Deputy Prendergast, asked me another question and I must take issue with him.  He asked me if I could guarantee or copperfasten <Col N="1029" /> the code of practice in line with the majority of religious belief in terms of hospitals.  I cannot give any such guarantee. No section in this Bill requires me as Minister for Health to give such a guarantee.  An Bord Altranais have been set up and they will affect the ethos of professional practice here if they are an elected body, and I hope that many more nurses than voted on the last occasion will vote for the nine and now 17 representatives. I hope there will be a decent live register to enable them to do so. They will reflect in the ethical code that they laid down in the context&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that I ask my colleagues that the many misconceptions in relation to section 9 and other sections of the Bill will not be propagated in the discussion on this Bill.  Deputy O'Hanlon raised the question about the additional two nurses in the clinical and psychiatric training areas I propose to appoint following their election.  I will give consideration as to how I will recast paragraph (d) on Report Stage.  Under paragraph (d)(ix) I will appoint one nurse and under paragraph (d)(x) I will appoint two persons representative of the interest of the general public; and under paragraph (d)(iv) I will appoint two persons representative of the Department of <Col N="1030" /> Health.  This means I will make five appointments. It may be desirable to reduce that number to four, but we can discuss that in detail later.</P>
      <P>I am not anxious to have a board of 30 members.  I will try to keep the figure as reasonable as possible, but I take the point made by Deputy O'Hanlon in that regard.  Deputy Flaherty raised a question about the definition of &ldquo;nurse&rdquo;.  I want to reiterate that the term &ldquo;midwife&rdquo; is encompassed within the phrase &ldquo;nurse&rdquo;.  There is no need to elaborate on this because &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; encompasses midwife and the general branches of nursing. That adequately covers the point raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I want to assure Deputies, and Deputy O'Rourke in particular, that I have stressed particular aspects of this Bill to dispel some of the widespread misconceptions and fears which, unfortunately, have been doing the rounds and I hope the remaining stages of this Bill will be quieter.</P>

      <P>The Minister acknowledged the contributions made before lunch, but I appeal to him to increase the number of nurses on this board which he has already increased by one to 17.  Again I want to stress that at least two-thirds of those on the board should be representative of the nursing profession.  In other subsections of the Bill it is stated that a chief executive officer, a management team, a secretary of the staff and so on will be appointed and under paragraph (d)(iv) two persons shall be representative of the Department of Health.  This is totally unnecessary.  One officer from the Department is sufficient to represent the interests of the Department and to advise <Col N="1031" /> the board about legislation and other financial matters.  In view of the fact that there will be a chief executive officer and a management team who will be responsible not alone to the board but to the Department and the Minister for Health, there is no reason why the Minister could not reduce that number to one and include another nurse on the board bringing their representation up to 18, thereby giving them two-thirds of the membership. I do not think the Minister can argue against that, because we come in here and argue for the people we represent. I resent some of the remarks the Minister made.  I come from a constituency with a number of hospitals, a public general hospital, a voluntary hospital, a public geriatric hospital and a public psychiatric hospital.  I am satisfied with the code of conduct, the professional approach and the caring attitude of the management and staff in these hospitals.</P>

There were to be 15 members out of a total of 27 and now that number has been increased to 17 out of 27.  Under this Bill five nurses would be engaged in clinical nursing practice &mdash; they represent 20,000 nurses &mdash; while the other ten members, five engaged in training nurses, and five engaged in nursing administration, represent a few hundred nurses.  That does not seem fair.  Perhaps the Minister would be more forthcoming and tell us how he arrived at that representation. The Minister will agree that as the majority of nurses are involved in the general and psychiatric nursing areas they should be given greater representation than is provided in this Bill.  The Minister might look to Britain to see how the nursing council of England and Wales is made up.  There, 22 nurses are elected by nurses and 20 other people are appointed by the different secretaries of State, and more than half of them are nurses.  The Minister might restore the balance before this section passes.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has conceded to some of our requests about the increased representation for those engaged in clinical practices.  As Deputy Begley said, there are in excess of 20,000 nurses in clinical practice at present and I note the Minister has increased their representation by two. Unfortunately I was not here for all the debate and I am not sure where these two members are coming from.  I should like to reiterate what Deputy Treacy has said. I understand that the Minister has conceded that there should be an increase of one in the number of nurses.  In other words, he has raised the number from 16 to 17.  Is the Minister indicating that he has not conceded that?</P>

      <P>The provision states that there shall be two representatives of the Department of Health and in our amendment we are requesting that one of those should be a nurse adviser.  That would be a response to the view of many nurses who feel there should be a two-thirds representation of their profession. If the Minister concedes on this point we will then have 18 nurses on the board, something that many Members have requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we should have medical representation on the board.  On the outgoing board there were six medical representatives, but it is intended to appoint only three to the new board.  A major factor in the provisions of the Bill will be nurse education.  There is no doubt in the hospital scene doctors have a major <Col N="1034" /> interest in relation to nurse education.  I am glad to see we have held firm on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of the debate is not central to the issue before us.  We are dealing with a Bill designed at the end of the day to protect the public and ensure that options are available to the public that are safe.  We should be discussing the fact that there will be only two representative in the interests of the general public.  If we are anxious to provide a medical service in the nursing area that will have the range of options the public need and will be sensitive to the public need we should not concentrate exclusively on medicals, be they nurses, doctors or officials of the Department of Health.  There should be a strong emphasis on members of the public who at the end of the day are the people who will be affected by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a general trend in dealing with the health area to put into professional expertise areas issues that are problems for the general public.  The general public must confront the public health issue just as much as the professionals.  If we wanted to provide community care to which nursing will be central we should have a great deal more public representation, because the public are the consumers of the medical services.</P>

      <P>I presume the board is necessary, but for the record I should like to know if the three medical practitioners to be appointed will be selected by the Minister at random from the list of qualified doctors or will the names be submitted by the Irish Medical Association.  If the recommendation is that the names should be submitted by the Irish Medical Association I applaud it.  The appointment of the board is vital, but it is dangerous also unless the recommendations for appointment to the board come from the organisations and associations which are above reproach.  We are all aware that from time to time there is <Col N="1035" /> a weakness on the part of Ministers to extend their considerations to various degrees in the appointment of members to boards.  That is human.  One occupying a ministerial position cannot avoid being overcome by a certain amount of importance when making appointments.  Naturally, human nature being what it is the person best known to the Minister responsible is likely to receive what can be considered as favourable consideration, very favourable and most sympathetic consideration. I have in mind a number of doctors who are well known to the Minister and closely connected with him, and I would not like to see them associated with the board.</P>

It is impossible in relation to this to divorce the question of the nominations to this board from that view, because the purpose of the board is to advise.  They have an onerous responsibility in that they will be advising young girls training in the medical profession. Guidelines will be laid down and codes of conduct outlined.  The board will also set the standard of professional conduct to be achieved.  The character of those appointed to the board must be above reproach, and their outlook must be in accordance with proper thinking to be expected when dealing with sick people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid of the powers given for the appointment of a board which will be responsible for the whole administration of health as it affects the public.  This board is vitally important because they will have a say in relation to the training of nurses.  A nurse cannot be trained in <Col N="1037" /> the same way as other workers.  Nursing is a calling, a vocation.  It is a gift given to some and not to others to look after the sick.  It is vitally important that they get proper training and guidelines in their early years.  When this Bill is passed they will only get this from the board now being appointed.  At present nobody can point a finger at the nurses, who excel in the discharge of their professional duties, and everybody who has been in hospital knows that.  The training which nurses have got from religious sisters in charge of hospitals has brought some of the best trained nurses to the four corners of the world.  No matter where one goes Irish nurses are looked upon with respect because of their ethics and their high professional standards.  This is due to their training undertaken by the nuns. The nuns have been responsible for the very high professional code of conduct of our nurses.  They perform with great efficiency in hospitals all over the world, especially in the mission fields, where proper codes of professional conduct are unknown.  Reference was made briefly to the appointment of the head of the present board.  This was an excellent appointment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot read the <Col N="1038" /> Minister's mind but, whatever the motive, the right person was appointed. She has discharged her duties in the highest manner possible.  One would expect that from a lady in religion who has had the experience of dealing with nurses, hospitals, those in bad health and those who are dying.  I do not think a better person could have been appointed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the composition of the board, Deputy Begley raised a very important point.  He suggested that the Minister should look at the composition of nursing and training boards in other countries.  I hope that the Minister, when appointing the board, will appoint those of a very high standard of professional conduct who also have very high moral standards so that they may be passed on to the nursing profession who, in turn, will bring comfort to the sick by practising the proper training which was taught to them in our hospitals.  I salute everyone associated with the present board.  We can be very proud of the high standard of our nurses and, in speaking about the appointment of the board, it is very gratifying that no Deputy can say that there have been defaulters in the nursing profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When making appointments to the board the Minister should sympathetically consider the special position of the midwife.  I am sure representations have been made in that regard by trade unions and professional organisations dealing with the special claim which that section of the nursing profession enjoy.  I hope Deputies realise that one of the essentials in the Bill is the appointment of the board.  That is why we cannot rush the Bill through the House.  We must know where we are going and try to extract every bit of information from the Minister because it is so important for the health service and the running of the hospitals.  We must ensure that nothing is concealed in the Bill which will lessen the admiration and respect which those in the nursing profession have for the religious who participate in their training. They consist of nuns, priests and brothers. We owe a deep debt of gratitude <Col N="1039" /> to the religious orders in the medical profession. I hope the board will not be biased against the religious orders.  It is right that there should be a voice in this House to sound a warning well in advance because many have expressed the belief that some of the motives behind the Bill were to squeeze out the nursing brothers and religious orders.  I should like the Minister to give the House a guarantee that that is not the position.  I should like him to give a guarantee so far as appointments to the board are concerned that where possible those engaged in the nursing profession and who are associated with religious orders be favourably considered.  In this way their expertise and, above all, their training will be passed on in the code of moral conduct that must be exercised particularly by the nursing profession who have a grave responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have had experience of hospitals rejoice that we had the benefit of the noble advice of the religious. They have a high standard of professional conduct.  We are living in a time when these people are coming under attack by the media and by those in high places.  Public representatives must make sure that the religious are given due justice and the recognition they deserve and which the Irish people expect them to get.  We are not legislating for a few. We are not legislating for those who might be described as the cranks of the health services.  We are legislating for all the people.  We are not just dealing with a few medical crackpots who are anxious to enunciate their own theories of medicine, of medical practices and their own self-manufactured code of morals in hospitals and on boards.</P>
    <P>As Members of this House we should keep a close and watchful eye to make sure that legislation of this kind is viewed seriously.  Above all it must be viewed with a sense of justice and consideration for the sick and the poor who do not enjoy influence or wealth.  However, these people have the love and charity of the nurses and they get words of comfort. The members appointed to the board will <Col N="1040" /> be responsible for the training of such people and we must ensure they are worthy of trust and responsibility.  I am sure when the Minister makes the appointments none will be suspect or will bring dishonour or disgrace to the medical profession. I hope he will scrutinise the curriculum vitae of every person who is appointed and that he will consult with the Irish Nurses Association.</P>
    <P>In relation to general practitioners, I hope he will examine their past history and conduct because they will have posts of great responsibility where they will train the nurses of the future.  Many of those people who will be trained by those about to be appointed may come from religious orders for professional nursing training because in many instances they first enter religious life and then qualify as nurses.  It is necessary that the right and proper people should give advice.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that advice and guidance must come from those appointed to the board.  There will be dangerous results if dangerous people are appointed.  There will be good results if people of fruitful record are appointed; but there will be bad results if people of doubtful record, either professionally or morally, are appointed.  That is why I want in advance to give the Minister due notice.  All of us in the House and outside it will be watching with keen interest. We will watch with an attentive ear and afterwards we will have a loud mouth in this House to ensure that the appointments are above suspicion and are not promoted for the sake of political affiliations. The appointment should not be made of those in the medical profession, both nurses and doctors, who today are loudly applauding a new theory and a new doctrine that is foreign to the traditions and the Christian values of the Irish nation.  We must ensure that the board will be free of such people.</P>
    <P>There is a place in this country for everyone.  Those who deserve a high place should be given that reward, particularly in relation to medicine, nursing and those who will be in charge of our hospitals.  Those who will be appointed and who will provide the training and <Col N="1041" /> guidance for our future nurses will have a grave responsibility.  They must set out the proper code of medical and moral conduct that is expected in hospitals. That is why it is right that we issue a warning to the Minister for Health that what he is doing will be watched carefully. Where we see an appointment made of a person who does not possess the right moral standards in our opinion as well as the right professional standards, the House and the country must be made aware of it.  This is where the Minister has a grave responsibility.  This is where he will have to forget his own personal feelings in relation to appointments of this kind.  The matter is very important for Irish hospitals, for the nursing profession and for the patients. Above all, we must not forget those who have to foot the bill.  The people expect high standards in our hospitals and they expect high standards from doctors, nurses and the advisers who will be on the board.</P>
    <P>I am suspicious of the entire Bill but I do not disagree that some aspects of it are necessary.  This will be an important board and that is why Members of the House should express their opinions on it.  The board will steer the future of Irish medicine and the training and education of nurses as well as the conduct of hospitals for 25 years or more.  It will be vitally important, therefore, that we get the right people appointed to the board, and Deputies will be keeping a keen eye on the appointments.</P>
    <P>At present there are between 2,000 and 2,500 trained nurses here looking for work.  Every week nurses are emigrating at the rate of 700 a week.  Will this new board simply be training nurses for work in Irish hospitals or for hospitals in Britain, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far and Middle East?  We have been training our nurses in a highly professional way and it is about time we thought about finding work at home in Irish hospitals for those boys and girls.</P>
    <P>The board must be seen to be above reproach.  In that way it will have the full confidence of the people.  If it is a good board it will be a success and its work will <Col N="1042" /> be reflected in the hospitals for years to come, if it is a bad board the work it will do will be bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan has been a Deputy for more than 34 years and it is 34 years since we had the last Nurses Bill.  That will indicate how difficult it is to bring the whole training and professional structure of the board into 1984.  However, it has to be done.  The last board was set up in 1950 and has operated for 34 years with a substantial number of ministerial appointments over the years.  The president of the board was appointed by the Minister of the day. This Bill changes that dramatically.  The president will be appointed by a majority of the board.  Seventeen nurses from the training, administrative and clinical sides of the profession will be elected by the nurses and I have not the slightest involvement in that area, so Deputy Flanagan can go to bed happy tonight because he has done a good day's work in supporting me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even those whom I have the right to appoint I will not be appointing personally but through professional bodies.  The Minister for Education will nominate a person experienced in the field of education and I will be in consultation with her. I will urge her to nominate somebody from the Department, preferably some senior official who will represent the Department.  I will be consulting the management of the health boards in regard to an appointment to the managerial structure of the board.  I will appoint a doctor to represent the training hospitals.  I will consult with the Royal College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Physicians in regard to the appointment of three nominees submitted to me by them.  I will appoint three. Therefore, concern about ministerial appointments should not exist because I will be working in co-operation with the professional bodies.  I will not be appointing a person with political service from a political party.  I have not done that since I came to the Department, though I have made at least 120 appointments, and I ask Members to put down any questions <Col N="1043" /> they wish about any appointments I have made and I am prepared to answer them fully.</P>

      <P>When the debate descends to that level we have an indication of the problems facing the health services.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Prendergast that I met the transport union and I gave an undertaking to review the membership in section 9.  I have done that.  I also discussed other sections of the Bill with the union; the fitness to practise section and the retention fee section.  I gave general undertakings to the union but, understandably, I said to them that I had come the House first.  The House decides. Nobody else does.  I received representations from all the professional bodies.  I spent hours and hours with these deputations. It was a very lengthy process.  Their views have been considered carefully.</P>
      <P>Another point was made by two Government Deputies.  This enables me to pinpoint a misconception about An Bord Altranais and the health services. Deputy Bruton correctly identified the real purpose of this Bill which is to deliver the health services to the Irish people. That is what it is all about, and that is what it should be all about.  In Europe, notably in America and increasingly here there is an amazing all-consuming preoccupation with the professionalisation of health.  It has become so professionalised now that we will have to have a special grade to decide whether a cup of water can be given to a patient.  I have absolute admiration for the work done over the years by Irish nurses.  We also have a major problem which was alluded to by Deputy Flanagan.  We have too many training schools and they are too fragmented.  The type of excellent training which Irish nurses should get is not being given to them in full measure.</P>

      <P>Every hospital, every county, every local community want a nurses training school and, as a consequence, the whole thing is fragmented. We are appointing nurses under section 9.  We have young men and women with an excellent standard of education and an outstanding sense of personal dedication who become nurses, but that does not make them professional nurses.  They have to have training and a regular updating of that training, and a capacity to deal with new medical technology.  They have to be fully registered.  In recent years An Bord Altranais have not been able to do that job.  The register is quite wildly out of date.  That point was made about the person who has an outstanding capacity to grapple with the fundamental health issues.  I counterpose that point to Deputy Begley and other Deputies over here who keep talking about a numbers game.  It is not a numbers game.</P>

That is the issue.  If Deputies were preoccupied with a numbers game this afternoon that is not my responsibility.

      <P>It is a numbers game because the Minister has put down the numbers in his Bill section by section. <Col N="1045" /> It is nonsense for the Minister to say we have no conception of what the Bill is about.  It is here in front of us and we know what it is about.  The Minister showed a certain amount of flexibility earlier on by doubling the number of nurses under section 9 (1) (c) (i) and (ii). I hope that on the sections where he has the appointment of people, he will also consider what Deputies have been saying.</P>
      <P>I do not see and the nurses' organisations do not see any need for three doctors to be appointed by the Minister.  The association of nursing teachers said that section 9 (1) (d) (i), (ii) and (iii) should be omitted.  They do not see the need for medical representation on the nurses board.  That was the main point they made.  It does not appear that the Minister will concede on that.  Will he consider the points made by Deputies?  There is no representation for nurses or doctors who care for the physically handicapped. The Minister has wide scope to appoint a person involved in the management of a health board or the management of a hospital, or people from the Department of Health or those in the education area.</P>
      <P>He should see to it that the interests of the physically handicapped are represented on the board.  One other area of nursing which is not represented is paediatric nursing.  The Minister said that under paragraph (d) (vi) one of the two people from the Department of Health will be from the nursing area.  I am not quite sure what he said.  Deputy O'Hanlon has an amendment down dealing with the advisory nursing area.  I hope the Minister will clarify the type of representatives he will appoint.  He should appoint somebody to represent the physically handicapped.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that we have spent the day debating this Bill.  It was worth while because we now have 17 members of the nursing profession on the board.  I am glad the Minister made that concession.  Could he clarify his intention in line 30, page 9, to appoint a nurse. Will that nurse fill some of the categories which are not already represented?  That <Col N="1046" /> would satisfy the nursing profession and everyone in this House.  Then the nursing profession would represent two-thirds of the membership of the board.  Could the Minister be specific as to his intention in this regard?</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan raised an important point on the method of selection to be adopted in relation to the three medical members of the board.  Would they be selected or elected by their own profession? This may not be terribly important at present, but there are rapid developments in experimental medicine, much of which even today would not be accepted by the Irish people.  It must be remembered that the last Bill has lasted for 34 years.  It is difficult to imagine what will be going on in the medical field 34 years hence.  It is essential that we should know how these people will be appointed, and I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate this.</P>

      <P>I want to make two simple points.  The Minister has made much play of the matter of the consumer and the public.  He has talked of a numbers game, but it is he who is playing a numbers game.  Despite the fact that he has shown such an interest in the consumer and the public, he has equated the public with two representatives as against two of the bureaucracy of the Department of Health.  Surely there is an opportunity here for him to change this imbalance and instead of the two from <Col N="1047" /> his Department to have one from the Department and put in one extra nurse, thereby bringing their numbers up to 18.</P>

      <P>I do not want to prolong the debate, but surely of the persons appointed by the Department of Health, as I have already indicated, one is most likely to be the nurse adviser. We have only one in the Department of Health.  That gives 18.  It also may well be, for example, that a person representative of third level educational establishments involved in the education and training of nurses will be a nurse, as most of those so involved are.  I do not know as yet.  I must consider the question of the impact of the change that I have made in paragraph (d) on Report Stage.  I can only give that assurance.  I remember well that at the outset it was said that there should be a nursing representation of half.  Now it is two-thirds.  I do not think that that is the issue.</P>

      <P>That subsection deals with consultation by the Minister with the Minister for Education and the consent of the Minister for Education to the appointment of one person who has experience in the field of education.  I have no objection to that.  It also refers to one who shall be a person representative of the third level educational establishments which are involved in the education and training of nurses.  I cannot see why it is necessary for the Minister for Health to have the consent of the Minister for Education to the appointment of such a person.  The Minister for Health would be in very close touch with what is happening in third level educational establishments dealing with health care.  He mentioned that he would be consulting with the College of Surgeons.  He would have closer contact with that college than would the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as it stands strengthens the general role of the Bill.  I have been very careful about the way in which the Minister of the day goes about making those appointments.  I know that the Deputy does not particularly object to the consent of the Minister for Education to the appointment of the person in the field of education.  I think I should consult and get agreement and consent of the Minister for Education for the person representative of third level educational establishments.  Otherwise, as Minister for Health, I should have to <Col N="1050" /> consult with those bodies, be it the Royal College of Surgeons or UCD.  It is a courtesy to the Minister for Education that in relation to both appointments I should discuss the matter with her.  The Minister for Education is anxious to see a greater integration of the Departments of Education and of Health in relation to nursing education.  This would strengthen it.  I can see that it is unusual, but it ensures that the appointment to the board will be subject to a Government decision, as is the current practice in relation to all appointments made by the present Government. I must bring all before the Government including the names of the elected members and the Government will formally appoint.  Naturally, they will not delay the process in any way, but I hope to have a name for the Minister for Education who will do the consultation. She will assess the situation, ask for the nominations, send them on to me and I will appoint.</P>

      <P>I am not anticipating or disputing the personnel who might be appointed by the Minister on this board. If the Dean of the Faculty of Nursing in the College of Surgeons is the appropriate person to appoint, I cannot understand why it is necessary to have the consent of the Minister for Education to that appointment.  I believe that the Minister for Health should keep that function to himself.  I agree with the Minister for Health that the Minister for Education should have an input into who the person would be who is experienced in the field of education.  I am talking about third level training for nurses.  If you are selecting somebody from an educational establishment catering for third level education for nurses, then the Minister for Health is the person appropriate to make that appointment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons given is that since one person only is being appointed, my Department would have much more professional competence than I would have in that field.  I do not want to arbitrate in this matter. In the years ahead if effective third level <Col N="1051" /> graduate qualifications are given to nurse training &mdash; we may be talking about Cork or Galway &mdash; then we have one appointee and the Minister for Education should make that choice.  The Minister of the day will have a far better awareness of the kind of person who should be appointed following nominations to her from the respective establishments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

      <P>I read in the section:</P>
      <P>(d) (i) Appointment shall not be made by the Minister without the consent of the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an unusual inclusion in a Health Bill.  Is my suspicious mind overworking? What is the motive behind this?  The Minister for Health would have the same social feelings as the Minister for Education. I do not applaud some of the appointments which the present Minister for Education has made.  They may be good, sound and in accordance with her conscience and a great fulfilment of her ambitions; nevertheless we are entitled to disagree with them.  I would be happier about this if the Minister were prepared to consider sympathetically the dropping of the consent of the Minister for Education and to agree on the next Stage of this Bill to a certificate of qualification from the educational authorities or from the Civil Service Commission that a person is qualified.  I would have more confidence in this Bill if such were written into it.  Of all the Bills that I have examined and spoken on here over 40 years, I cannot recollect any other health legislation which includes a provision that before an appointment is made by the Minister for Health the consent of the Minister for Education must be obtained to such appointment.  Is this handing over to the Minister for Education the function of appointing automatically the person possessing the qualifications recommended by the Minister for Education? If the Minister wanted to clear my doubts about this he would consider changing it.  I do not like it.  I would <Col N="1052" /> prefer that a certificate of educational qualification from the educational establishment at which the person concerned obtained the qualification would be the requirement.  That would be on a nonpolitical basis, outside the relevance of political activity.  It would be outside the control of the Minister for Education.  I do not know if other Deputies approve of this provision.  Am I reaching the stage of being suspicious of everybody around me?  I do not like this to be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would prefer that the Minister would consult with the officers of his Department. It cannot be impossible with the very high standards of advisers in his Department to overcome the question of the establishing of educational status and qualifications with an input by the Minister for Education in submitting a report in support of the person concerned.  We have the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission. We have a little notice at the end of every public service appointment authorised by Deputy Boland, Minister for the Public Service, that political influence will disqualify. In this case when the Minister himself is considering an appointment we find that advice given for local authorities by the Minister for the Public Service is meant only for the public service.  For all other appointments the application form indicates that all political influence of every kind and description will incur disqualification.</P>
    <P>That is why I ask the Minister to consider this.  If the boot was on the other foot and this was any other Minister for Education of any Government I would take the same stance because I think the provisions is wrong.  The principle is to debar public representatives from making recommendations and to appoint on merit alone yet this appointment must bear the seal of the Minister for Education before it is considered by the Minister for Health.  I do not like it, and I have the right to stand up in this House and say so.  I appeal to the Minister to consult with the educational authorities who are absolutely impartial and who are not elected on a political basis and would <Col N="1053" /> have no political considerations one way or the other but would recommend on the marks, points and educational standards of the person concerned.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this.  The more one examines it the more difficult it is to understand.</P>

      <P>Again, Deputy Flanagan is suffering from a misconception. The LAC and the Civil Service Commission do not appoint members of boards, they never did, and thanks be to God they never will do so.  Likewise there is nothing at all unusual in one Minister appointing members of a body having Ministers of another portfolio appointing on a cross basis.  The Dentists Bill is a classical example with the Minister for Education appointing two members to the Dental Council.  This kind of suspicion is ridiculous in this day and age.</P>

      <P>Last night the Minister read a lengthy speech.  I would like to question him on a number of points raised in that speech but, unfortunately, time is not on my side.  I hope the Minister did not mislead the House when he said last night that his Department had received a serious expression of interest in Verolme Cork Dockyard from a foreign concern. The extraordinary thing about the announcement is that it was made only after Fianna Fáil Members tabled the motion now before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an <Col N="1055" /> opportunity to reply.  I expressed the hope that the Minister was not misleading the House on it because I have other information about this matter.  It is obvious that little or no effort was made by the Government to prevent the closure of Verolme Cork Dockyard.  To prove that point I should like to quote from an article in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of Tuesday last, 27 November, concerning a press conference given by the Minister for Finance at Enniskean.  The article stated:</P>
      <P>On the subject of Verolme Cork Dockyard, the Minister was asked if he would comment on recent speculation that the Government would be prepared to participate in a scaled down operation at the yard with concentration on repair work.</P>
      <P>The Minister's response was:</P>
      <P>I have seen no proposals for any such operation.</P>
      <P>That is proof beyond all doubt that the fight to save the dockyard received little or no priority by the Minister or the Government and that the case failed to reach Cabinet level for discussion.  I must assume that the Minister for Finance, and his Department, are at all times involved in major matters concerning finance to the other Departments.  The statement by the Minister for Finance on Monday proves beyond doubt that the case for the dockyard had not been discussed at Cabinet level.  If that is not true perhaps the Minister will tell us.  The statement by the Minister for Finance proved beyond doubt to the workers at the dockyard that the Government have little or no interest in their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I asked the Minister to detail the total value placed on the dockyard. Will the Minister tell the House the amount of money being paid by the Government, or by the management of the dockyard, in the form of redundancy payments.  I am not referring to the statutory redundancy payments.  There are conflicting views about this.  We have <Col N="1056" /> heard it from management that they are the people who are paying this redundancy money.  I should like to know what arrangements are to be made for the repair of our naval vessels.  It must be a worry if such repairs are to be done outside the country bearing in mind the difference in exchange rates.  We must also bear in mind that such repairs must always be carried out speedily.</P>
    <P>Each page of the Minister's speech was confusing.  I was somewhat amused to hear the Minister placing so much emphasis on the development of the lower harbour in Cork when all Cork Deputies had spent years pleading with the Government to invest at least £1 million for the continuation of the work there.  Last night the Minister gave the impression that he was the lifesaver for that area of Cork when it was Cork Deputies who fought hard to ensure the completion of that project.  The Minister, or the Government, cannot claim any credit for that and I defy any member of the Government to say otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister should comment on the statement by the Minister for Finance in Cork on Monday.  Last night I was told, by way of interruption by the Minister of State, that I was wrong when I referred to the fact that the number of options submitted to the Government had not been replied to.  It is obvious that I was correct when the person who holds the Government's purse strings was not aware of the case being made to save the dockyards.</P>

      <P>Not surprisingly this is an issue in which all Cork Members are keenly interested and they have expressed their interest by their presence in the Chamber.  It is a matter of vital concern to us all.  The tragedy of the debate surrounding this issue is that there is an effort being made to score political points.  In my experience in public life over the last 20 years I have always found that Verolme Cork Dockyard was a political football.  There was a tendency for one party to suggest to the electorate that the continuation of the yard depended on their staying in Government.  It is not <Col N="1057" /> surprising that the crunch has come because it is still a political football.</P>
      <P>There is no need for backbench Deputies who support the Government to go over that ground again.  The Minister answered Fianna Fáil's motion last evening. He pointed out forcefully the weaknesses in the Fianna Fáil argument, listing the failure of Fianna Fáil when in Government to adopt the line which they suggest this Government should adopt. Among his counter-arguments he mentioned the bulk carrier completed in the summer of 1983 for which the commercial price quoted was £14.2 million, but the construction cost was in excess of £30 million.  He also said that it cost £21,000 in Government subsidies each year for every man employed in the dockyard. The opposition when in Government took the same attitude.  Even those who are very keenly and deeply involved realise there are insurmountable problems here.  It is a pity that this issue is constantly thrown around as a political football.</P>
      <P>The sense of the argument we will be supporting this evening and of which we must not lose sight is the Minister's amendment which calls on the Government to do their utmost to ensure that a purchaser for the yard is found who will provide significant continuing employment. Verolme is very dear to the hearts of every Cork Deputy.  We are all keenly interested in the continuation of employment. The men employed in this dockyard, many of whom are close friends of the Deputies who represent them do not yet feel the strain of unemployment because they have got their redundancy payments, most of them are enjoying PAYE and they have not yet experienced a drop in their standard of living.  With the passage of another year this will spread a great deal more gloom over our constituency. We have had a lot of gloom in Cork.  There have been closures of very large firms and almost all the employers in the Cork Harbour area have vanished. There is an air of hopelessness there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment will ensure that every effort is made and that money is spent <Col N="1058" /> to provide adequate alternative employment for these men who have no job prospects for the future.  We must change the situation.  We can talk about who is to blame but I say nobody is to blame. Each Government took the same decision because they had no option but to do so.  Again I want the Government to do all in their power to provide employment on a large scale in the Cork area where it is so badly needed.</P>

      <P>I would like to express sympathy with the workers who lost and are to lose their jobs in Verolme Cork Dockyard. They have been the victims of the world recession and a combination of bad decisions and labour management problems in the yard.  However, and more seriously, they have been the victims in recent times of gross hyprocisy and base political opportunism on the part of the Opposition.  We can toss words from side to side in this House, but that does nothing for the workers in Cork.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's positive statement that a third party is interested in acquiring the Cork dockyard as a ship repair yard initially.  I wish the best of luck to the discussions which will take place over the coming weeks and months. I am aware of another party who is interested in speaking to the receiver about the future of the dockyard and I hope these discussions will also take place shortly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wyse said nothing was done in recent times by the Government and representatives of the Government, but I would like to remind him that earlier this year Government Deputies had a day long meeting with the workers, the unions and the management of Cork Verolme Dockyard to eliminate some of the problems.  We thought some progress had been made.</P>

      <P>The closure of the dockyard <Col N="1059" /> and the misfortune of the workforce have been used in a cold blooded fashion by the Opposition for base political advantage and nothing else.  What we heard from the Opposition last night did not contain one concrete suggestion as to how the yard could survive.  All we heard were emotive statements, such as, &ldquo;a national scandal&rdquo;, and such empty phrases do the yard and its workforce no good whatever. These statements show the insincerity of the Opposition particularly in the light of the disclosures made by the Minister in this House last night and I think they should be repeated here tonight.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lyons demanded to know why the Government would not acquire the remaining 52 per cent interest in the yard implying that this purchase would secure the future of the yard and that Fianna Fáil would buy the remaining interest if they were in power.  This is base hypocrisy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is base hyprocisy in the light of the evidence produced by the Minister that the Dutch offered their majority shareholding to the Fianna Fáil Government in 1979 and that some Government refused to take up the option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lyons tried to give the impression that the building of further naval patrol vessels in the yard would ensure its survival forever more when the reality is that when Fianna Fáil were in Government, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to the then Taoiseach on 6 May 1982 advocating that that Fianna Fáil Government proceeded with only one of the two proposed patrol vessels because of the likely additional cost to the Exchequer.  The same Government decided to contact the European Commission to seek a reduction in the number of patrol vessels and aircraft necessary to provide adequate control and the surveillance necessary for fishery protection purposes.  This information, in the light of recent utterances from Fianna Fáil members, again shows up the hypocrisy <Col N="1060" /> of their approach to the problems in Verolme.</P>
    <P>We all also had the red herring of our neutrality&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told that Irish naval vessels would have to go to British yards for maintenance, ignoring the fact that we have a naval maintenance yard in Cork harbour which carries out a big percentage of necessary repairs.  However, we must be positive and look beyond the closure of the yard next Friday, tragic as that is, to a rebirth of the operation there.  All available options must be investigated so that the very specialised skills in the Cork area, as ship design, ship building and ship repair skills are utilised in the future.  Of course we must be realistic and agree that the immediate future of the yard is in ship repairing and, possibly, in heavy engineering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had discussions recently with the Russian Trade Consul and he informed me that there is a future for ship repairing in Cork provided that the operation is efficient and economic.  If the yard operates efficiently with a good labour management relationship, it can also take advantage of any development in the area of offshore oil exploration and oil field development.  Earlier this year I visited Norway in connection with a project which was being proposed for Verolme Cork dockyard and I am disappointed that this project has been turned down by the Government.  Taking into account circumstances of recent times, I was not surprised by the announcement last night.  Having been in the south of Norway and having seen the manner in which the Norwegian Government and people have taken advantage of the oil finds off their coast I am convinced that, with proper management, planning and development of our technological skills, we could make major advances industrially in the event of even reasonable oil finds off the south coast.  Verolme dockyard can score heavily in this area in years to come, especially in the area of offshore supply and construction of offshore <Col N="1061" /> equipment, modules and platforms.  We must not make the mistake that Britain made in the area of offshore development. The Minister for Energy should have closer liaison with the Norwegian companies involved in offshore development.</P>
    <P>In the years to come we may make the tragic mistake of allowing multinationals to develop our oil fields and exploit our riches while, at the same time, underutilising Irish managerial and technical skills. The closure of Verolme was described last night by the Opposition as a national scandal.  It would have been a greater national scandal to allow further public moneys to be invested in Verolme without looking closely at the serious illness which was affecting the health of the yard.  I hope that the tragic events of next Friday will result in a new Verolme rising Phoenix-like from the ashes.  I will be watching developments closely over the next few months and I hope that the proud skills and experience of the workforce in Cork will be utilised once again. We must ignore speeches from the Opposition which dealt mainly with politics and we must plan for Verolme to open again. There are exciting opportunities for an efficient, competitive dockyard which will utilise all the skills available in the Cork region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's amendment but in doing so I should like him to consider suggestions which could contribute in some way towards the reopening and restructuring of Verolme Cork dockyard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it became known that Verolme was facing closure, I approached the Minister for Energy at the request of unions and management to see if he and the Taoiseach would be prepared to meet management and unions at Verolme.  I received a positive reply to my request and this meeting should take place before any further action is taken regarding Verolme. The management and workforce, as represented by union officials, can contribute something very definite in this area.  A number of suggestions have <Col N="1062" /> already been put forward which are worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not think the receiver should be called in until such time as this meeting takes place.  Every effort must be made by the same agencies to ensure that Verolme Cork dockyard remains viable.  We have a corps of engineers and engineering skills which are second to none.  Their equipment is of first-class quality although to bring the yard up to date would cost a further £20 million.  This can be deferred until such time as new business is generated.  Nothing should be done which will affect the future viability of the yard.  I hope this House will not take a decision which will affect the continued operation of Verolme.</P>
    <P>A serious effort must be made to ensure that a ship repairing business is carried on although it will not achieve everything that I would like to see at Rushbrooke.  The future lies in shipbuilding and if we are serious about reducing the numbers of unemployed, we must look at this area.  At present there is a surplus of ships throughout the world but if we adopt the attitude that things are going to get worse we will be defeated before we start.  No other industry here can create jobs or has potential to create jobs as quickly as the shipbuilding industry.  If even one order came on stream it would mean work for 700 people in a matter of months.  We cannot afford to ignore this.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider handing over to the National Enterprise Agency which is to be incorporated into the National Development Corporation and let them manage the yard and keep it up to date on a care and maintenance level until such time as we are able to create ship repairing and off shore engineering services.</P>
    <P>A new financial structure should be formed for the company.  It may be possible to acquire the shares which are now in the ownership of RSV.  The financial institutions should also take an interest. This is not without precedent, the Bank of Ireland took a share in Fieldcrest, Kilkenny, although that is not a very good precedent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> A sum of £8 million is to be paid out in redundancy at Verolme.  On Tyneside, workers were faced with a similar situation and invested their redundancy payments in the company.  Last year this company had a turnover of £2 million. Participation by the workers should be encouraged and to do that we should give them the same incentives as venture capital receives and they should get the £25,000 tax incentive.  I realise that it would be necessary to amend existing legislation to permit this but it could and should be done.  I do not dispute the case the Minister made that the Exchequer should get a return for its investment.  It would not be right to go on indefinitely putting money into a project that would not be successful.</P>
    <P>I have sufficient faith in the skills of the people to say that at this stage we should grasp the opportunity and allow the yard to continue in existence and to function.  As I suggested already, this would be best done by getting the National Enterprise Agency to do this rather than by involving Fóir Teoranta and a receiver.  It is absolutely essential that a care and maintenance operation be carried out in the dockyard immediately. There is the risk of depreciation of equipment that is exposed to the weather, especially in a seaside area where Verolme is situated.  The plant could become run down in a very short time.  By giving responsibility to the agency they could ensure that the equipment does not deteriorate.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties in the shipbuilding world I do not accept that we should give up the thought of restoring the strategically important skill of shipbuilding. There will be a need for such skill.  Last night there was mention of Irish Shipping. I regret to say that that company were not very loyal to Verolme dockyard. While I sympathise with the workforce of Irish Shipping, nevertheless I think they could have put more business in the way of Verolme.  There was a certain lack of loyalty in that respect.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to update our fishing fleet.  As a maritime nation we <Col N="1064" /> should develop the fleet.  There is also the possibility that in the near future a replacement will have to be found for Irish Shipping.  I should like to think Verolme will be there should it be called upon in an emergency.  It is generally accepted that while we have the tonnage of shipping we do not have the proper kind of shipping.  We have coastal ships and passenger ships but we have not in sufficient numbers the kind of ships used for bulk cargo.  There may be an urgent need for such ships in the not too distant future.  Should an emergency arise Verolme would be well placed to respond.</P>

      <P>It is with a tinge of sadness and regret that I speak tonight about Verlome dockyard, particularly when the gates of the yard are about to be shut.  The dockyard has been part and parcel of the town of Cobh for many years.  It has made a unique contribution to Cobh not only economically but also socially and from the point of view of the community.  Its closure will mark the end of an era but I am hopeful from the Minister's speech last night, which I welcome wholeheartedly, that what we are about to embark on will mean a new era for the Cork dockyard.  We know that no longer can we afford to run factories and companies that are losing money wholesale. The people who are losing are the taxpayers.  In an effort to rectify this situation the company has to close for a short while but every effort must be made to ensure that it will open soon again.</P>
      <P>Verolme dockyard is situated in my constituency of East Cork.  I regard the yard as a tremendous asset not only for the people of Cork but for the nation as a whole.  That is something we lose sight of very often.  It would be a crime if that yard were to lie idle but I do not believe that will happen.  We need that resource to create the jobs that are badly needed. It is of vital importance that the dockyard be kept going on a maintenance basis in the coming weeks so that when a new customer takes it over it can be ready to go into full operation immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to caution the Minister <Col N="1065" /> regarding the security of the dockyard in the interim.  Verolme dockyard is on an exposed site, with water on one side and the road on the other side.  I am expressing the views of the people of Cobh when I say that the most strict security must be maintained there in the coming weeks.  It is of vital importance that machinery and fittings are not removed.</P>
    <P>Added to the asset of the shipyard, in the Cobh area and in the Cork area generally we have a very valuable asset that has been built up over the years.  I refer to the skills of the workforce at Verolme dockyard.  Excellent training has been given to apprentices but that asset is lying idle at the moment.  In acquiring an interest in Verolme dockyard there is the asset of the dockyard itself and, secondly, a very skilled and talented workforce.</P>
    <P>Despite the gloomy picture of the shipping industry worldwide, the Minister should leave no stone unturned to ensure that Verolme dockyard will be opened very soon again.  I know he will do all he can.  He can be assured that Cork Deputies will not get off his back until the dockyard is reopened and the white smoke is coming out of the chimneys again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Speakers on the opposite side, in particular Deputy Allen, said we were playing politics but tonight we have seen very clearly the hypocrisy of Members opposite. This year on three or four occasions we listened to rhetoric from the other side of the House about what has been happening in Cork.  We put down motions regarding the closure of Fords and Dunlops and we heard the same expressions of concern and sadness from Members opposite.  The hypocrisy is on the other side and the people of Cork well know that.  Government Deputies <Col N="1066" /> are now being seen for what they are.  I give them credit for doing a good job in public relations but that is the only area where this Government have done any kind of good job.  However, their actions are catching up with them.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to avoid the closure of the dockyard.  The real test will be seen at 8.30 tonight when the sincerity of the people on the other side of the House will be tested.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy O'Sullivan for admitting that this was unnecessary and shortsighted, just like the case of Irish Shipping when the Government ran to take a decision as quickly as they could. We have had Ministers and Government backbenchers calling on the people to have confidence in themselves.  I ask Deputies over there what will they say to the people in this dockyard and to their families?  Will they ask them to have confidence in themselves and in their future when the Deputies have no confidence in them, as they are showing by this decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dockyard is being closed because of Government policy which does not change no matter how it affects people. That is why we have the notice I have just read.  People will not be bluffed by this Government's insincerity.  Cork and its special problems have been highlighted more than any other region but the Government do nothing about it and try to exonerate themselves.  When the Government had an opportunity to do something they did nothing.  We had all the optimism about Dunlops and Fords <Col N="1067" /> but what has come of it?  Nothing has been done to replace those two important industries and the employment they gave.  We have been told that somebody from outside will come in and that the dockyard will have a bright future.  We have been told that too many times before.</P>
    <P>The Government should show some sincerity.  The State owns 48 per cent of the shares.  They should buy the remaining 52.  Of course that is not favoured by the other side.  In the dockyard we have the people and the management to run the business, admittedly on a smaller scale.  A year or two ago it was realised that the dockyard could not be continued in its present from with its high employment content, that rationalisation was necessary.  This was agreed by management, unions and workers and the workforce was reduced.  Everybody then believed there was a future.  I am convinced that with a show of sincerity from the Government there is a future for the dockyard with a reduced workforce.  Carrigaline Potteries is a great example.  It was closed down but the workers got going with the assistance and advice of Deputies and others.  The business is thriving today.</P>
    <P>Have we any confidence in the skills of our workforce?  The Government's insincerity can be seen here.  Cork has an unemployment rate above the national average.  Not alone can the Government retain the yard but they can give confidence to the workers.  Whenever we on this side express concern we are accused of talking gloom and doom and people do not want to hear it.  We are accused of being political.  The Government know that the problems of Cork are chronic. Deputies opposite should join us and show sincere concern.  We are only carrying out our duty to our people.  That is why we were elected.  I am sorry we are not on that side of the House now because if we were this crisis would not have arisen.  We have never had a commitment to this dockyard from the Coalition parties.  This can be read in the record. Murphy's Brewery in Cork was going to <Col N="1068" /> the wall but they got assistance and advice and now they are flourishing.</P>

      <P>Since June of 1983 the people of Cobh and the workers in Verolme Cork Dockyard have been awaiting with fear and trepidation the day which has finally arrived.  I live within a stone's throw of the dockyard.  For the past 18 months I passed it nearly every day.  Day after day more gantries become silent, more sheds become empty, and fewer workers travel to and from the dockyard.  A cloud of doom has spread over the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Cork east and the people of Cobh know who is responsible for this. They know it is not Fianna Fáil.  They know the Government are responsible for what is happening, the closure of Verolme Cork Dockyard.  From talking to people and listening to their problems, it is clear that it is not votes of sympathy they want.  They cannot eat or burn votes of sympathy.  They cannot dress themselves with votes of sympathy.  They want <Col N="1069" /> work and they are not being given work. They are not being given any hope of getting work.  Hope is being eroded in my area and the whole south east area.  The Government will be remembered for that.</P>
    <P>On 1 June 1983 when we had a motion on the dockyard it was quite clear that it was only a matter of time before the gate would be closed.  I said then that there was not one shred of hope for the continuance of Verolme Cork Dockyard as a shipbuilding yard.  Some people derided that remark, but I am afraid it was true. At the beginning of 1983 1,100 people were employed permanently in Verolme. There were also a couple of hundred temporary workers in the spin-off services. Those jobs have all gone.  There are no immediate job prospects for those people.</P>
    <P>A number of options were presented to the Government to allow the dockyard to continue trading.  All those options were turned down by the Government. They did not deem it worthwhile to enter into direct negotiations or talks with the management to see if a practicable solution could be found.  This happened again in the case of the Irish Shipping fiasco.  I trust it will not happen in many other cases, but we have no guarantee of that.  More and more we are having Government by <i>Diktat</i>.  Democracy seems to have gone out the door for people who were considered to be the great white hopes at one time.  That was a publicity stunt by the Government.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that a business which is capable of paying all its creditors to the full can be closed down, a business owned to the extent of 48 per cent by the State. It is beyond comprehension why the Government would allow such a company to close down making thousands and thousands of people redundant.  It would be wise of the Government to take complete control of the shipyard.  In the near future it will be necessary to build new ships because our Irish shipping fleet has been sunk.  We should ensure that they still have a dockyard and the facilities necessary to start building a new fleet.  If they are given away within the <Col N="1070" /> next couple of months we will not have the facilities when we need them and it will cost us a great deal more to replace them.</P>
    <P>Many operations were carried out within the dockyard.  They did heavy engineering work.  They provided goods for the ESB stations at Moneypoint and Aghada.  They did work for the gasline. All that work has been lost to the area. The skills of many crafts were imparted to the young people.  Those young people will be lost to the area.  The facilities to train young people will also be lost.</P>
    <P>A receiver has been appointed.  I do not know whether that has been announced officially by the Minister but Deputy Allen notified the <i>Cork Evening Echo</i> of the appointment.  Has any independent valuation been made of the dockyard? Can the receiver sell off the dockyard piecemeal or as one lot for whatever he considers to be enough to pay off Fóir Teoranta?  The Government should ensure that the receiver will get full value for this asset if he sells it.  It is of vital importance that the Government should take the bit between their teeth and secure this most valuable asset for the benefit of the nation.  I urge all Deputies to vote in support of our motion tonight.  I should like to give Deputy E. O'Keeffe some of my time.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank my colleague for allowing me to speak for a short while about the disgraceful closure of one of the nation's finest industries. Cobh town is facing disaster with the closure of this fine plant, ending the opportunities for the use of the skills of the people of that area.  Someone mentioned that we are in a new era.  I wonder what is meant by that.  This Government are running away from their responsibilities to maintain Irish industry.  This is a very strong and viable industry if properly managed.  Side by side with it there is Irish Steel which possibly is not very far from the hatchet being used by this Government.  This will be known as the Government of liquidations and receiverships. Liquidation is the toughest but <Col N="1071" /> receivership is a more respectable way of doing the job.</P>
      <P>This morning's newspapers mentioned a threatened increase in interest rates. At the same time, the Minister makes a statement that the Government are inviting people into this country to take over the dockyard as a ship repair and maintenance area.  If the threatened rise of 2 per cent occurs in the interest rate, I do not think anyone will come here.  This is being brought about by the total mismanagement of the economy of this island because of the domestic borrowings of the present Government with their projections for the year 1985.</P>
      <P>We have seen the national plan, which I call the plan of codology and rubbish, prepared by Garret and Dick.  It would have sold as a good Christmas annual, if they had done a good job.</P>

      <P>All it wants are a few good cartoons on each page and with a glossy cover it would be a very saleable commodity for Christmas.  Deputy Allen has been talking about a slimmed down industry.  Is he sincere about his own constituency of Cork?  What will a slimmed down industry do for the workers there, or for their wives and families?  He was apologising for the fact that the workers will lose their jobs.  It is time they stopped talking about politicising.  They were the greatest political people when in opposition. Fianna Fáil are the party of development who will develop this country and build it up again.  We will build the Cork region and put it back on a sound footing. We are the only party who will give the people the incentive to develop and build, especially in the Cork region.  For some unknown reason, this Government have continuously attacked that area &mdash; with courage I would say, because they have a number of Cork Deputies.  I wonder what the fallout will be in the next general election, which may not be far away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Shipping were the pride of our <Col N="1072" /> nation, built in the forties to give us supplies and save us from a world crisis and they were successful.  For some unknown reason, the Government now take the ground from under them.  There were two Labour people who had the courage to speak out openly &mdash; Deputy Taylor, the Labour Chief Whip, and Senator Flor O'Mahony &mdash; who were prepared to meet the workers and try to salvage something for them.  There are some people with some bit of heart left in that party.  I hope that they will salvage Irish Shipping.  This nation cannot survive without a shipping line.  The decision to liquidate was taken for no reason.</P>
    <P>Our financial institutions must be extremely worried at the behaviour of this Government and the way they can pull the rug from under State industry. For the international banking people from whom we borrow money and the countries with whom we trade, we have lost all credibility.  That is very serious for a trading nation like ours.

      <P>I am grateful to the Opposition for giving me a few minutes of their time.  The impending cessation of shipbuilding at Verolme is certainly a serious setback for the Cork region.  Of that there is no doubt.  On the other hand, the state of world shipping has made the cessation of shipbuilding at Cork, as in many other parts of the world, especially Europe, virtually inevitable.  The main causes certainly are external.  However, it is well for us tonight, on this sad occasion, to dwell a little on some of the other causes.  I would have to say that successive Governments of both persuasions have contributed to the closure, through a lack of any consistent, clear cut maritime policy and because of a series of broken promises.  The record shows that both sides of the House stand indicted on these terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>It also has to be said <Col N="1074" /> that Verolme Dockyard have played a significant part in their own destruction. Poor industrial relations, management failures, restrictive practices, relatively low productivity and poor marketing have all contributed to the demise of this yard.  These are unpalatable truths for all concerned &mdash; politicians, management and workers.  I only raised these matters because I hope that we can learn something from them.</P>
      <P>I do not think that all the picture is gloomy by any means.  At the dockyard there are skills and facilities and standards of workmanship which are comparable with the best.  Further development of those facilities in the years ahead come to mind.  The market for ship repairing can be revived and tapped, provided the operation is streamlined and made cost-effective. As the Minister stated last evening, his Department have already received a serious inquiry about the establishment of a ship-repairing business in part of the yard.  That has come about without any marketing effort whatsoever. I am very hopeful on that count. The general engineering capabilities there are unsurpassed in this country, quite outside shipping.  They offer opportunities for development.  There are a group of professional designers in that area who have established a computer-aided design system which can be developed, not only in this country but abroad.</P>
      <P>The development of our offshore oil and gas resources will certainly offer opportunities in the future to utilise the facilities and skills, as well as the unique location and deep water of the dockyard.</P>

This effective Government control can be exercised in various ways and the Minister is proposing to do so through the appointment by Fóir Teoranta of a State receiver.  He has also provided £8 million for the payment of redundancy under the heading of a delivery incentive bonus for the P31.</P>

I know there will be plenty of help and advice available to him from the workforce.  I hope he will engage some of them in that operation.  Second, he should establish an effective security system.  It is not an easy place to do that.  Thirdly, he should obtain comprehensive insurance cover. Fourthly, he should actively promote the sale, with the assistance of the IDA, to one or more companies which would offer the best prospects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He should recover the preferential debts owing to the State, which is about £5 million, and complete the receivership within a specified time.

      <P>I recently made a suggestion that the State might acquire the majority Dutch interest.  I did that solely for the purpose of establishing a temporary holding company which would then find suitable purchasers to develop the assets.

      <P>At this time last year 1,100 people were working in Verolme.  Why did the Government not see fit to place an order with them during the last two years?  I will tell the Government why, and particularly the Labour members.  It is because Coalition Governments never had a commitment to Verolme.  We know what their commitment has been.  Séan Lemass rescued it and Sinéad Bean de Valera launched the first vessel.  I say to the Labour Members to come into the lobbies and vote with us, otherwise we will hang it around their neck at platform after platform in Cork.

He cooly said that the Government would not allow Fords to walk away from Cork.  He said he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs would go to Detroit and tell Fords what to do.  Months went by and the Ministers went to Detroit.  Their message to Fords was very meek and mild.  They allowed them to walk away from Cork.</P>

      <P>In the European Parliament we were successful in having a motion accepted for urgent debate two weeks ago.  That was some achievement when one thinks that it was taken in line with motions and problems such as the Chilean problem, the murder of the Polish priest and the famine in Ethiopia. Our motion was accepted as urgent, which indicates our commitment to have a debate there at the highest level.  It may be asked why we wanted to have a debate there.  Probably in 13 months Spain will join the EC.  The Spanish fishing fleet is enormous, equal in size to the entire fleet of the EC.  When they come in they will find it easier to get into Irish waters, whatever deal is negotiated, and we will watch very closely the deals this Government will be negotiating regarding our fishing grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need extra protection vessels and it would have made good comment for <Col N="1079" /> our Government to go to the EC and ask there for additional funding and place further orders with the VCD for two further fishery protection vessels.  Let me say to Deputy Coveney, Deputy Allen, Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Desmond, who are so critical of the management and workers of their own in this House tonight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that I am surprised at their attitude; it is strange coming from Labour Party people.  The <i>Eithne</i>, just launched, is probably the finest boat launched in the waters around this island.  She is a beautiful, most modern ship and a tribute to the workforce engaged on her.  She was built competitively, and the Minister should bear that in mind.  It is so tragic that immediately after the launching of that ship and two years in Government the people opposite could not see their way to place one order to protect our fishing grounds and negotiate further EC assistance and funding, as was negotiated by Deputy Lenihan when he was Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  That can be done and we need that extra protection.  Deputy Doyle said that, while he welcomed our support for two vessels, he would have preferred more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the receiver, Deputy Allen seems more familiar with the situation than the Minister himself.  Little information is forthcoming on what is happening in the <i>Evening Echo</i> of today's date.  In that newspaper Deputy Allen tells us that a British firm are interested.  That is more than the Minister told us last night.  The Minister did not tell us who the receiver is.  I presume we can take it that, like the appointments over the week-end, it is another old pal.  His name probably will be in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> in the morning. Who are the British ship repair yards that are not in trouble?  Many of them have made their workers redundant.  I ask Deputy Allen to tell us in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> in the morning who is that <Col N="1080" /> British firm.  Have they already laid off workers?  Are the Labour Party Members, who will be trooping in behind the Minister tonight, voting to support the purchase of that yard by a firm who have already laid off workers?  That is very probable.</P>
    <P>I want to return to commitments and promises that were made.  I refer to the debacle that was Fords and the promises made then by this Minister.  The embarrassment created then for many of the Members opposite will be increased all the more by this.  The Taoiseach was going to Cork in the week that Fords closed to address the Chamber of Commerce there and his handlers felt that something should be done to protect his image and to protect him for the week-end in Cork.  We saw the ballyhoo of a task force being appointed to tell us about a programme of jobs to recover the employment situation in Cork.  That task force met and they reported in May, yet no Member on this side of the House has received a copy of the report.  Why?  What is being concealed, what is concealed in that report?  Does that report tell us that the closure of VCD was imminent?  Is that why the report was not shown to us? What value was in that report for Cork? We are entitled to know.  This Government last week appointed a liquidator to Irish Shipping and this week appointed a receiver to VCD.  When will they appoint a national liquidator or receiver?  Perhaps they will single out the Cork region for such an appointment.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree about the necessity for a smaller operation.  I presume that it would not have been possible to continue with the 1,100 workers of a year ago, but think of the skills and the crafts that exist there, the traditions attached to the place.  Cork harbour has enjoyed the shipbuilding tradition down the years. The towns of Cobh, Rushbroke, Passage West, Glenbrook and Monkstown have depended heavily on employment at VCD.  This closure reflects on itself and also in the spin-off in the service industries and the shops which will not be felt immediately next month but certainly in a few months it will be felt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> I call to Members opposite, in order to ensure that the Minister is not going to catch them again tonight, to vote with us and show at least that they have some even belated commitment to employment on the Cork scene before it has been ravaged completely by the present administration.  It is a tragedy that, despite requests, no visit was made to the yard by a Government Minister.  The Cork Deputies appear to have failed to organise a meeting with management and workers and it all seemed to be a question of remote control with little interest shown by the Department.</P>

      <P>We know they were ashamed but while they were able to launch it without them at least a meeting on the ground should have been arranged.  I have no doubt that the expertise and skills there would have impressed this Government to the extent that they would have said that we must do something, that we could save the yard.</P>
      <P>We must accept that the world shipping is going through a difficult period. Despite that, Harland and Wolfe recently had to turn away an order simply because they could not deliver in time.  We all know how shipping is protected in eastern countries.  Our shipbuilding facility is so small by world standards that this Government have lost a golden opportunity. They sat by for two years, allowed nothing to happen, placed no order, gave no assistance.  Now the yard closes and we are told that a ship repairing firm are interested and will be pursued by the receiver.  Is a ship repairing firm a substitute or an answer for a yard with such expertise and equipment?  It is not.  It is an insult to the skills that exist there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our party leader on a recent visit was impressed, and he was received there as the only person who has shown an interest in that yard in the two years that we <Col N="1082" /> have been out of Government.  That is an indictment of the Ministers opposite, and the Deputies failed to get them to meet before the closure took place.  The name of a receiver is to be announced, I presume tomorrow or the next day.  Why was his name not announced here in the House today or last night?  Is there something to be covered up, to be concealed or is he another old pal?  Probably he is. If the yard closes we will be watching his actions.  I have no doubt that old pals are watching also and we are losing the independence of the shipbuilding industry and of a skilled repair yard, at least for the time being.  We are bowing again to the British.  That flight home in that RAF jet by our Taoiseach was the most expensive flight this country has ever had.  I say to the once proud Labour Party and to the Members opposite who at one stage were interested in employment and jobs: &ldquo;For goodness sake, do not be misled by the glib formula of words prepared by the then Minister for Industry and Energy&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not seem to be my day as far as getting across these questions.  We ran out of time at Question Time but thanks to the co-operation of the House we made that up to some degree but now, due to the normal working of the House, instead of there being a 30 minute debate we have only 15 minutes. In that time I hope I will have ten minutes and the Minister will have five minutes.  I only regret he will not have 20 minutes because the answers are more important than the questions.</P>
      <P>First, I want to put on record that I put down 11 questions, not ten and all were directed to where I believe they rightfully should have gone, to the Taoiseach, and not be shovelled across as they were to the Minister for the Public Service.  It was a neat sidestep prior to the summit.  I had these questions down before the summit. I want the Taoiseach to know that sending in a Minister, no matter which Minister, is dodging the issues raised in the questions on today's Order Paper which the Minister attempted to answer as best he could.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach through the Minister, through the Chair, whether he signed the memorandum of understanding, whether it was a secret memorandum of understanding despite what the Minister said because it was signed on 19 October but was not laid before the Houses until 24 October.  Why was it delayed five days?  Why was it not left with us for a time so that it could be debated before it was signed?  Was it just a sweetener for the summit?  If it was, it was not very successful as we know from the outcome of that summit.</P>
      <P>Questions Nos. 22 and 23 asked whether any members of the Army or Garda had been instructed or had been in the precincts of establishments in Britain or the Six Counties.  The Minister said categorically no to those questions.  When asked if they had been or if they will be in the future, the Minister again said no.</P>
      <P>I am asking for a solemn undertaking from the Minister on behalf of the Government, even if it is outside the memo of understanding that we heard about today, whether there have been Army officers in the establishments in the UK for a considerable time, whether they have been trained in various aspects of war by British Army officers and personnel and whether Garda members have, likewise, got the benefit of our great benefactors, the British, in the art of suppressing our people.  I want to know whether that is true because it is commonly believed that it is.  Our information is that Army officers have been so treated as well as Garda members.  If it is not true, so much the better but I should like the Minister to give that assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meaning no disrespect to the Minister, the constitutionality of what is proposed <Col N="1087" /> is in doubt.  It is not good enough that he or the Government are of the opinion that it is constitutional and that there is no method whereby it can be referred to the Supreme Court.  The very fact that the Minister added that strengthens the fears I have already that it is unconstitutional. A way should be found to bring it before the Supreme Court even if it necessitates a Bill being introduced in this House which can be referred to the Supreme Court through the office of the President. I am sure that legal minds will find a way of testing its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>A child would not be satisfied with this. The Minister said that the Official Secrets Act can be applied to members of another country or another civil service whose members come in here on an exchange deal.  His assurance that the Acts concerning treason and official secrets will apply in those cases is not worth the paper it is written on because it is when they return to their country of origin that there is a danger of treasonable acts and breaking of the Official Secrets Act.  What can the Minister or the Government do then?  They are out of the jurisdiction and they can talk at will as no doubt they will.  Knowing the disposition of the British over the years, months and recent days, they are desperately anxious to penetrate into the heart of our Government to add to the knowledge which they already have through their secret service and their SAS marauding gangs operating south of the Border.  Of course, our Government treat that as fantasy or mythology.  It is neither; they are there and the Government know this.  Why give them any more access by way of a memo of understanding that is neither constitutional nor wise? Are we in danger of being dragged into NATO and to the Western European Union by the activities and the knowledge gained by these people?  To exclude four sensitive Departments does not reassure me that these people will not have access to information which it is vital to keep from them.  As civil servants they will have access to information which they are not entitled to know as foreigners. <Col N="1088" /> We must ensure that this is not another effort, as has been tried in Europe, to drag us into NATO and totally nullify any power we have to retain our neutrality in the future.  Beware of Article 28.3 of the Constitution which says that we are the only people empowered to declare war or to enter a war.  Let us not cod ourselves that these people are not sufficiently clever, as they have displayed over the years, to manipulate access to information through their membership of our Civil Service.</P>
    <P>We want the British out of this country. Never mind the bull that is talked in the Forum, the Summit or otherwise.  Instead of trying to get them out we are legalising their coming into the heart of Government and it is a shame that this should happen.  Are we going to have a debate on this?  We should have a referendum on it also so that the people could express their opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perhaps a measure of the heat which is being generated on this matter as opposed to the reality that the House should have been twice in one day apparently seriously invited to hold a referendum on whether three Irish civil servants should attend on secondment to the British civil service in exchange for three from the British civil service attending here.  I do not believe that the Irish people would take kindly to being invited to the expense of passing their verdict on a matter such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exchanges between various administrations in other countries is a well accepted method of increasing training of administrators and encouraging mutual understanding.  As I explained to the House earlier today, the reason for this exchange and this memorandum of understanding arises from discussions which the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Haughey, had in May and December, 1980, as a result of which terms of reference were published for joint studies on 30 January 1981.  On that day it was decided that they should consider measures which the two Governments could take, jointly or separately, to remove <Col N="1089" /> such misconceptions and improve mutual understanding including measures in the field of youth and other exchanges, secondment of officials and co-operation over educational, scientific and cultural matters.  The comments made earlier in the day by the Leader of the Opposition, including his trice denying that he had anything to do with this matter can now be viewed in the light of that statement which was published in the document Anglo-Irish Studies Report which was laid before this House on 11 November 1981, a copy of which is in the Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now prepared to deny the printed word as well as the spoken word.  This supposedly secret memorandum of understanding was signed on 19 October, as Deputy Blaney correctly said, a Friday, at 5.30 in the evening at a function to which the press were invited and attended.  It was laid in the Library on the following Wednesday and I would have thought that that was reasonable.  The document is available for perusal by any Member of the House and was publicised by way of press release on the day it was signed.  So much for this secret document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It clearly states that it arose out of a meeting between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister in November 1981.  That is in the memorandum and the Minister should read it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read out the report of the joint studies group of 30 January 1981.  The Deputy may not recall it but he was Taoiseach at that time.  To represent that three civil servants who are sent here <Col N="1090" /> to encourage mutual understanding and that three others should attend in Britain are intending to subvert the authority of the State either here or in Britain is so ludicrous that it does not merit the time of the House.  The main difficulty in this country is that we are not prepared to try to understand the viewpoint of others and that any method which can be adopted which is designed to provide for better understanding on the part of officials, however few, of the British administration into the Irish viewpoint ought to be welcomed by Members of the House.</P>

The difference of £33,000 between the 1985 Estimate and the 1984 expected outturn is mainly accounted for by the inclusion in the 1985 Estimate of an amount needed to assess my liability in respect of pre-vesting day pension entitlement of former Department of Posts and Telegraphs employees and pensioners (no provision was required in 1984 for this purpose).  The remainder is in respect of some work needed in connection with the preparation of the Estimate and budget.</P>

Following correspondence with the taxpayer in relation to his claim it transpired that since his retirement he has been in receipt of a pension from his former employer and a social welfare pension.  On 20 November 1984 the taxpayer was requested to supply certain outstanding information regarding his social welfare pension.  When this information is supplied a certificate of tax-free allowances operative on a cumulative basis will be issued to him.  Any tax which may have been overdeducted from his income since 6 April last will be refundable by his former employer on operation of this certificate.</P>

      <P>The determination of eligibility to hold a medical card is a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board and it is not open to me to intervene in their decisions.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that the applicant in this case was found on appeal, not to be eligible as his income was in excess of the guidelines for determining eligibility. If any change in circumstances occurs the person concerned should re-apply to the health board at Community Care Area 7, The Health Centre, North Strand, Dublin 1, where the matter will receive immediate attention.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 644 and 645 together.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Department will spend £500,000 in 1984 on fees and expenses on consultancy assignments and other commissioned surveys and studies. The bulk of the expenditure arises in connection with the provision of technical support for the operation of the Department's computer systems (£109,000) and with the development of the existing and new computer systems (approximately £370,000).  The balance of the expenditure (under £20,000) relates to non-computer studies or services, e.g. research projects or specialist services which are commissioned by the Department from time to time and to the part-time services of an economic adviser to the Minister (£4,000).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The technical support for the operation of the Department's computer system is provided under an ongoing contract with the Department's main computer supplier. The usual tendering procedures are followed in engaging consultants for the development of existing and new computer systems.  It is not possible to give a reliable figure for the number of people engaged on the various projects as this <Col N="989" /> can vary for a particular project depending on its requirements, the stage of development and the availability of suitable personnel where an organisation is concerned.</P>
    <P>The consultancy provision for 1985 is broadly similar in its elements to the 1984 allocation with provision for anticipated increases in fees with most of it being provided for maintenance of existing computer systems and the development of these and new computer systems which will continue throughout 1985.  The increase of £28,000 cannot be attributed to any one project.</P>

    <P>If the person concerned considers that his circumstances have changed since his means were last assessed by the appeals officer it is open to him to apply to have his case reviewed.  A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local office.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for the award of prescribed relative allowance is that the relative is not working outside the home.  The claim of the person concerned, who is in receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension, to a prescribed relative allowance in respect of her son has been refused and she has been notified to this effect.  The grounds for the refusal were that her son is working on the family farm and is not therefore in a position to afford the required full time care and attention to his mother.</P>

      <P>It was decided by an appeals officer on 20 November 1984 that the person concerned is only entitled to an old age pension at the weekly rate of £28.80 from 17 August 1984, which includes an adult dependant allowance of £6.75 in respect of his wife and a dependant child allowance of £8.75 in respect of one qualified child.

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is subject to the condition that an applicant is available for work, and to fulfil this condition an applicant must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.  The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance from November 1979.  He failed to attend an interview arranged by Manpower Services and following the completion of inquiries in the matter his unemployment assistance claim was disallowed from 27 June 1984 on the grounds that he did not fulfil the condition of being available for work.  He was notified accordingly and has not appealed against the disallowance of his claim.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The precise arrangements for the policing of particular areas are a matter for the Garda authorities and the allocation of Garda manpower between foot patrols and other duties in any particular area is a matter for the local Garda officers having regard to available resources, local circumstances and other demands on Garda services.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that extra gardaí have been assigned to Kevin Street station and that there has been an increase in the level of foot patrolling in the St. Kevin's parish area during the past two months.  In addition, the area is receiving regular attention from mobile patrols operated from the local station and by the crime task force based at Harcourt Square.  I understand that the local Garda community relations inspector is in regular contact with local residents' associations and that he will be attending a meeting of St. Kevin's Community Council arranged for tomorrow at which crime and vandalism in the area will be discussed.</P>
      <P>As regards the incidence of crime in the St. Kevin's parish area, the Garda authorities report that provisional crime figures for 1984 to date show a downward trend in the level of crime in the area as compared with 1983.</P>
