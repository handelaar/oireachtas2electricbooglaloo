      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of civil servants in his Department who are currently on career breaks; the grades of the officers con cerned and the length of time for which the break was granted in each case; if any persons, while on career breaks, have been retained by his Department on a consultancy basis or any other basis involving financial remuneration; and if so, the numbers involved and the level of remuneration in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): There are four staff of my Department currently on career breaks as follows: 1 assistant principal for a period of two years from 1 October 1984; 1 higher executive officer for a period of one year from 24 September 1984; 1 clerical assistant (typist) for a period of three years from 25 June 1984 and 1 clerical assistant for a period of one year from 19 October 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of these officers has been retained by my Department on a consultancy <Col N="2008" /> basis or any other basis involving financial remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> That information was not requested by the Deputy.  I should say that the persons who got these career breaks complied with the criteria laid down by the Department of the Public Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the Minister of State is not prepared to answer any supplementaries, would he indicate whether he would consider it to be an abuse of the system of career breaks for civil servants to take such a career break and then be re-employed by the Civil Service in another capacity at a higher level of remuneration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he will intervene with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to ensure that no confiscation will take place in the cases of trawler owners who are trying earnestly to repay their loans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole) Paddy O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the policy of Bord Iascaigh Mhara to repossess fishing vessels except in cases where the board are satisfied that for one reason or another the skipper is unable and unlikely to meet his loan commitments.  I do not propose to intervene in the matter which falls within the day-to-day operations of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us an indication of what is the current arrears situation in relation to boat repayments and whether An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have any proposals at present to repossess any boats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2010" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Twelve vessels were voluntarily surrendered in 1983 and eight vessels in 1984.  This action was taken by the board having established that not only were these people not in a position to meet their commitments but, in many cases, did not even have insurance cover on such commitments.  In reply to the Deputy's question, I should say proposals are at present being examined in relation to this problem and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on this fairly shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Minister was not in a position to give us any information in relation to the proposals at present before either his Department or the Department of Finance.  Perhaps the Minister could avail of this opportunity to give us some details of the nature of the proposals, whatever they are, in order to deal with this crisis in relation to loan repayments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give details of the proposals because they have been put by the board to me.  I have had discussions with the board and I am now having discussions with the Department of Finance. Until these matters have been finalised it would be inappropriate for me to give details of what the proposals are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give the exact amount of money owed?  Is it in the region of £6 million or £8 million and is it true that the proposals are delayed in the Department of Finance because the Department are not prepared to sanction them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the number of boats repossessed is the highest ever?  Would he not accept that this is a clear indication of the serious position of the fishing industry? Would he ensure that the practice is not allowed to continue whereby boats are left lying and fall into disrepair?  They should be in good repair when they return to fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to say whether this is the highest level of repossessions because we are not comparing like with like.  The level of repossession in previous years may possibly have been lower but the number of boats in the fleet was lower.  It is difficult to make direct comparisons.  I agree that the laying up of boats over a long period is a bad practice since it leads to the deterioration of the boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister ascertain the number of the boats lying up and try to ensure that they are not left in a condition which would make it impossible for them to return to fishing? New boats have been left lying up for two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not give precise details of the size of boats and the areas in which they were repossessed. Could he give some indication of the areas in which these boats were operating and the exact amount owed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he will explain the total underdevelopment of the fish processing industry in Ireland; and whether there are any plans for State initiative to stimulate the development of fish processing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole) Paddy O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the establishment of fish processing plants is primarily a matter for private enterprise in the first instance.  In order to promote such development assistance is afforded by State agencies such as An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Industrial Development Authority and Údarás na Gaeltachta, as appropriate, for suitable projects.  Such projects can also attract grant aid under the EEC marketing and processing scheme.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the implication in the question that the Irish fish processing industry is totally underdeveloped.</P>
      <P>Capital investment in the fish processing sector has in the five years 1979-1984 (October) amounted to £26.7 million, of which State grants constituted £7.0 million and EEC (FEOGA) grants £5.9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that in relation to secondary processing there is a huge potential for job creation and benefit to the economy if a more vigorous policy is adopted.  Can the Minister indicate whether his Department or BIM have any arrangements or have had discussions with the IDA to ensure that more attention is given to secondary processing of our own produce with a view to creating additional employment opportunities and added value for the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>BIM encourage processing, particularly secondary processing. To this end BIM work closely with the IDA, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the ICC and AnCO.  BIM place special emphasis on product and process development, refrigeration, plant lay-out and quality <Col N="2013" /> control.  They at all times encourage processing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of promoters have sought to establish fish processing industries at Rossaveal, the only major fishing harbour on the west coast, and that they have not been able to proceed due to delays in the further development of Rossaveal harbour?  This has been held up for the past three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

      <P>Question No. 3 as drafted is a very general question and the Deputy is now raising a specific matter on which the Minister could not be expected to have information in his brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question seeks information on a State initiative to stimulate the development of fish processing.  I am asking whether the Minister is aware that there are promoters who are very anxious to establish fish processing plants at Rossaveal. Plans for the development of the harbour have been in the Minister's Department for perhaps five years.  We cannot understand why no decisions have been made on these development plans. Whatever delays were occasioned when Fianna Fáil were in office, two years have passed and the project should have been put out to tender and started.  Why is the Minister holding it up now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the lack of processing capacity is hampering the development of certain species.  Is he aware of the possibilities in a number of areas which are not being exploited and has he any plans to initiate <Col N="2014" /> in BIM a new drive to open up processing of species which have not been utilised up to now?  What does he proposes to do about it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the reasons that the position of acquisition inspector for County Galway in his Department has not been filled to date despite the fact that this position is vacant for the past four months; if he is aware that the public are not getting the type of service that they are entitled to on account of this situation; the date on which he proposes to fill this vacancy; and if he will make a statement on the entire situation regarding land acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In the present situation the filling of each vacancy must be considered in the context of the implication for the Department of the embargo governing the curtailment of numbers in the public service.  This inevitably entails deployment of available staff in such a way as to achieve the optimum benefit for the Department.</P>
      <P>The vacancy in question was filled on 22 October 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that, in all, some 5,000 hectares, 12,500 acres, of plantable land will be acquired by my Department in <Col N="2015" /> the current year, as against 4,000 hectares last year.  I am confident that the intake level will increase further during the period of the national plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason for the second biggest county, one that has to cope with a big disadvantage in that it has a lot of fragmented land, being without an acquisition inspector for a long period?  Is the Minister aware that proposals submitted to his Department were dealt with by remote control from Dublin?  Is the Minister aware that services for small farmers in those disadvantaged areas were not available during that time and that decisions were made that were not to the satisfaction of local farmers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The vacancy that arose there has now been filled.  As the Deputy realises because of the system we operate throughout the public service one does not fill vacancies overnight.  A certain process must be gone through for a Department to get a suitable person to fill a vacancy.  That has been gone through in this case.  The vacancy has now been filled.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that it represents a hopeless performance by my Department.  I should like to tell the Deputy that the scheme to which he referred, a very generous one carrying an 85 per cent grant level in relation to the small western package, has been very disappointing in that only 10 per cent of the money available has been taken up so far.  If the Deputy wishes I can give him the relevant figures.  I should like to tell the Deputy that 75 per cent of the area approved for planting in that period was not planted and that was not the fault of the Department.

      <P>In 1981, the first year, £61,000 was taken up, £74,000 in the second year and £110,000 this year and one would have thought that such an expenditure over those three years would have helped to get the scheme off the ground.  Is it not time to examine the fact that it did not get off the ground especially when the grant aid for it is so generous?  I understand that it is the highest grant aided scheme in any Department, Agriculture or Forestry.</P>

There are probably many reasons for the lack lustre performance of the scheme, historical and so on, but it was disappointing and I would like if Deputies tried to promulgate the message that the scheme carries a very generous grant level in relation to land which is not being used to its full potential.  The scheme is eminently suitable for land use in these areas.</P>

We have put in advertisements, provided personnel for lectures on the scheme where invited; we have published brochures, booklets and so on, and have been in touch with ACOT.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the disappointing response to the scheme, has the Minister any proposals to review it? Is he aware that probably part of the reason for the poor uptake were the very poor prospects and return for investment in forestry?  The Minister will be aware that recent statements by the Minister of State have added to the confusion because many farmers are under the impression that a new improved scheme is about to be launched.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>New proposals are being considered at the moment.  The Deputy asks if we are reviewing the scheme.  In <Col N="2021" /> normal circumstances a review of a scheme would imply an improvement of a scheme, but we are talking here about a current level of 85 per cent.  I do not think anybody could possible expect us to provide grant aid at a higher level.  In relation to the implication in the Deputy's question that the reason for the poor take up might be the fact that farmers must wait a long time for a return on their investment, I do not accept that, because at present many people are interested in purchasing established forests &mdash; six, seven or eight year old forests.  This is not a long time to wait for a return on an investment when one considers that an 85 per cent grant for forestry development is being made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable that small farmers and people in a position to avail of this scheme be encouraged to invest in this area, but even with the best will in the world the Minister must accept that there is a time lag between investment and first returns.  If this situation could be improved, it would encourage farmers to get into this scheme.  Has the Minister any plans to help farmers in the early years?</P>

Second, in relation to the National Planning Board's recommendations, I have scrutinised them in order to ensure that the industry get what they need, in other words, that they will be involved in deliberating on what is the best approach. I decided to establish a review group comprised of all interested parties operating within the industry.  That includes the Irish Timber Council, private growers, processors and so on plus public servants who would have an input and make recommendations.  I do not know what recommendations they will make in their report but all the interests within the industry have been included in the review group.  That is the best way to go about it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the damage caused by atmospheric pollution to major tracts of forests elsewhere, particularly in Germany.  However, I would point out that experts even in that country disagree on some of the factors that they attribute to this problem.  Some experts say it is due to bad husbandry but I am not prepared to disregard the dangers as lightly as that.  The monitoring of facets of acid rain in Ireland has been undertaken by An Foras Forbartha.  Atmospheric pollution is a matter primarily for the Minister for the Environment but, as the House will know, I have a deep interest in this for obvious reasons because of the dangers to our fisheries and our forests.  Five sites are being monitored on a daily basis in respect of wet and dry conditions.  The sites are at Glencree, County Wicklow, Dublin Airport, Kinsealy, Trinity College and monitoring on a site at Howth will commence shortly.  The research branch of my Department &mdash; the FWS &mdash; are co-operating with the Macauley Institute in Aberdeen and a project is underway to compare the situation in that part of Scotland with the west of Ireland.  The FWS are also co-operating with the ESB in setting up a monitoring post in the Slieve Bloom mountain areas.  The contacts are ongoing and the situation is being watched with some concern because of the danger involved.</P>

Will the Minister give his opinion regarding what I would call the disjointed effort at present undertaken by all Government Departments, agencies and local authorities?

      <P>I do not accept that little progress has been made.  Since 1980 the share of the market held by Irish sawmills has doubled.  This indicates that inroads are being made into the Irish market and that Irish timber is now being established as a commodity as good as if not better, in many cases, than the imported product. The problem here is that we have not enough to meet our demands.  There is, after all, a 40 per cent shortfall in our capacity to supply timber to the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2162" /> That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) the facts and circumstances leading to the preferment, on 1 May 1984, of criminal charges against Joanne Hayes, Edmund Hayes, Michael Hayes, Kathleen Hayes and Bridie Fuller, Dromcunning Lower, Abbeydorney, County Kerry in connection with death of an unnamed male infant and subsequent events which led to the withdrawal of those charges at Tralee District Court on 10 October 1984;</P>
    <P>(2) related allegations made by Joanne Hayes, Mary Hayes, Edmund Hayes and Michael Hayes in written statements to their solicitor on 23 October 1984 and by Kathleen Hayes in a written statement to her solicitor on 24 October concerning the circumstances surrounding the questioning and the taking of statements from those persons on 1 May 1984;</P>
    <P>(3) any matters connected with or relevant to the matters aforesaid which the tribunal considers it necessary to investigate in connection with their inquiries into the matters mentioned at (1) and (2).</P>
    <P>On Tuesday last, I announced in this House that the Government had decided that a tribunal should be established to carry out a sworn judicial inquiry into what has become known as the &ldquo;Kerry babies&rdquo; case.  In accordance with the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979 this decision can be implemented only if both Houses of the Oireachtas pass a resolution that it is expedient that such a tribunal be set up and that is why the formal resolution that I have now moved is before the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary or appropriate to attempt to go into any great detail about the factual background to this proposal, especially as it could reasonably be said that it is precisely to establish <Col N="2163" /> accurately as far as possible what that factual background is that the tribunal will be appointed if, as I hope, the proposal is approved by both Houses.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, some issues of substantial public importance have arisen in the case and, for that reason, the Government consider that it is essential that every possible effort is made to establish the truth of what occurred.  An investigation was ordered by the Garda Commissioner &mdash; and let me mention in passing that he had made the decision that an investigation was necessary before any public controversy arose.  The investigation that was carried out did not, however, succeed in resolving the conflicting versions of the events that have been given on both sides.  This was not the fault of the two experienced senior officers of the force who conducted the investigation, which was both entirely impartial and as thorough as circumstances allowed.  Because of certain comments that have been publicly made during the last week or two, I should perhaps draw attention to the fact that Garda investigators do not have the powers that this tribunal will have.  On the contrary, since they were carrying out an investigation against a background of allegations that included allegations of conduct that might, if supported, justify criminal proceedings, they were subject to all the constraints that apply in such cases.  That is the system under which we operate and the same problems would have faced any other investigation, whether from within the force or not, unless armed with the exceptional powers which the law gives to a tribunal such as is now proposed to be set up.  In referring to the constraints on the investigators, I am not to be taken as implying that I necessarily accept that every person involved was justified in extending to the two Garda investigators only the particular degree of co-operation which was in fact extended.  I am not commenting at all on that.  I simply want to make it clear, so that there may be no misunderstanding of what I have said, that it is a point that may need to be looked at separately at a <Col N="2164" /> later stage.</P>
    <P>The internal Garda inquiry had to be undertaken.  It was an essential first step and even if there had been no need to embark on it for the purposes of investigating the possibility that evidence might be obtained that would sustain a criminal charge &mdash; and there was such a need &mdash; the internal inquiry would have separately justified itself by the fact that the results, including many statements taken by the investigators, will be available to the tribunal.  However, there are, as I have said, conflicting versions of events and those conflicting versions have not been resolved.  Accordingly, there is a need to resolve them, or at least to endeavour as far as possible to resolve them, by testing under oath in a public forum the veracity of what is being said. It is only in that setting, where people can be examined on oath and subjected, as necessary, to cross-examination that there is now any realistic hope of getting at the facts.  That is what the tribunal will do.  It will have the power to compel the attendance of witnesses, to take evidence from them on oath, to compel the production of documents &mdash; in fact it will have all the powers of the High Court to enable it do its job properly.  Likewise, witnesses appearing before it will enjoy the same immunities and privileges as witnesses before the High Court.</P>
    <P>Care has been taken in drawing up the terms of reference of the tribunal to ensure that they are sufficiently wide to enable it to cover all relevant aspects of the issues involved in the case.  In examining the facts and circumstances leading to the preferment of charges against the members of the Hayes family of Abbeydorney, the tribunal will necessarily have to concern itself with the manner in which the investigation into the death of the baby found at White Strand, Cahirciveen, was carried out by the Garda Síochána.  Then there are the specific allegations of the Hayes family of ill-treatment during the period they were questioned by the Garda &mdash; questioning which led to the making of statements by members of the family.  Finally, there is what might be termed the &ldquo;catch-all' <Col N="2165" /> provision in paragraph (3) which will enable the tribunal to go into any connected or relevant matter not specifically alluded to in paragraphs (1) and (2).</P>
    <P>I am very glad to inform the House that Mr. Justice Kevin Lynch, Judge of the High Court, has agreed to constitute the tribunal and that the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Finlay, has agreed to make the arrangements necessary to release Judge Lynch as far as may be necessary from other duties.  I am very grateful to Mr. Justice Lynch for agreeing to act and to the President of the Court for his co-operation.</P>
    <P>I want to say a brief word about the question of legal representation before the tribunal and the related question of legal costs because these are matters in relation to which questions have already been asked.  The tribunal is empowered to authorise the legal representation of any person appearing to the tribunal to be interested.  It may also refuse such representation.  This is the effect of section 2 (b) of the 1921 Act.  It is, therefore, a matter for the tribunal and for it alone to decide who should be represented. Likewise, the 1979 Act authorises the tribunal to direct that the costs of any person appearing before it should be paid by any other person, including the State. It may so direct where, having regard to its findings and other relevant matters, it considers it equitable to do so.  Thus, there is a clear legal framework there &mdash; a framework that has been used and has proved satisfactory in other inquiries such as the Whiddy and Stardust inquiries &mdash; to deal with the question of legal representation and the related one of costs.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that the only issue before this House is the resolution and that therefore some other matters affecting the Garda Síochána which have recently been the subject of publicity are not relevant.  Accordingly, I do not propose to refer to any other case or cases except to say in passing that I realise that this present case is not the only one that has caused concern.  Having said that &mdash; having accepted and indeed underlined that fact, as I have just now done and as I also did as recently as Wednesday last <Col N="2166" /> in this House in reply to a parliamentary question &mdash; I think it is also right and necessary that the proposal before the House should be seen in its true perspective, and I would argue very strongly that its true perspective is not to be found just by looking at one or even at a number of cases where things have or may have been wrong but by looking at the record of the Garda Síochána day in, day out over the years.  That record speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State, the Garda Síochána have had a role vital to the maintainance of the institutions of democracy. The force have served this State outstandingly well and will, I am in no doubt at all, continue to do so in the future.  The members have done so often at great cost to themselves.  Since 1970 eleven members have been murdered. Last year we have had two such cases and this year another one.  Many members place their own safety at risk day after day in the defence of the community. These are stark facts of life and we need, I think, to remind ourselves of them from time to time and especially now.  Whatever the outcome of this inquiry may be &mdash; even if the result is unfavourable to one or more members &mdash; it should not cause us for one instant to forget what we owe to the force.  Furthermore, I can say with total confidence that the Commissioner shares fully, as indeed he has conclusively proved by his actions in this and other cases, my own commitment to ensuring that, if and where remedial action is called for, remedial action will be taken.  That, at the end of the day, is perhaps the most important point of all and is a major reason why I have no doubt whatsoever that the force will come through this difficult period without lasting damage.</P>
    <P>I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add to the motion the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2167" />&ldquo;and (4) making such recommendations (if any) as the Tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We welcome the establishment of this tribunal of inquiry.  We had to wait to hear the Minister's statement before knowing the details of the proposals.  So far as I can see these proposals are entirely satisfactory with the exception of the one element we are proposing to have covered by way of our amendment.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will be presided over by a judge of the High Court.  We welcome that.  Clearly, the tribunal will be independent. What we are to have is a sworn judicial inquiry into the case outlined in the motion.</P>
    <P>In concluding his remarks, the Minister referred to the record of the Garda.  I should like to join with the Minister in those remarks and to point out that the Garda have sought an independent inquiry into this matter.  The Garda Representative Association were forthright in seeking to have the matters made public and examined thoroughly and fairly in public.</P>
    <P>The Kerry babies case has raised serious questions by way of the alleged treatment and questioning of persons in custody and about the alleged conduct on the part of the Garda in the conduct of criminal investigations.  It has been alleged that Joanne Hayes and members of her family were persuaded to confess to crimes they did not commit.  It is alleged also that members of the Hayes family were slapped, punched, verbally abused and vilified for 12 hours after they were detained at Tralee Garda Station.</P>
    <P>In looking into these matters the Minister decided first that there should be an internal Garda inquiry under the direction of the Commissioner.  The Minister has set out in his statement to justify the steps he took, especially by saying that the work that has been done will be of value to the tribunal.  The internal investigation proved inconclusive.  It was beset by conflicting evidence.  It failed either to resolve the mystery surrounding the case <Col N="2168" /> or to allay public concern.  We on this side of the House have been patient with the Minister.  When he adopted the approach of having an internal investigation conducted, he promised that if that failed there would be an independent inquiry, which is what we considered necessary in this case.  If it had not been for the internal inquiry the independent inquiry could have been undertaken earlier, but we accepted the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> in the matter and today he is fulfilling his promise in that regard.</P>
    <P>Our main concern is that the course of justice will be seen to prevail by way of an independent and impartial judicial inquiry.  There is grave and widespread concern about this case and its implications. A number of questions arise.  For example, why did five members of a Kerry family confess to involvement in a murder which subsequent evidence indicated they could not have committed? Why did the Garda persist in their efforts to have members of the Hayes family stand trial and why, after the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that all charges be dropped, did a member of the Garda seek to have the case adjourned at Tralee Court for two months?  These are the questions that have caused considerable concern to thinking persons. We trust that the inquiry will establish the facts in the case and that it will deal also with such questions as why the Garda continued to press the charges when, first, they found the body of Joanna Hayes's baby where apparently she had suggested it would originally be found, and, secondly, when it was discovered that the blood group of the Abbeydorney baby was 0 while in the case of the other baby the blood group was A.  We must ask also how the Garda obtained signed statements from the Hayes family confessing to the murder of the Caherciveen baby and why the superior officers did not intervene to stop the case before the Director of Public Prosecutions intervened and what are the implications for the treatment of persons in Garda custody and for the initiation of independent inquiries?</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it clear that <Col N="2169" /> the complaints and allegations made by members of the Hayes family will be investigated.  We in this House are not in a position to make judgments on these matters but we must ensure that they are considered openly and impartially.  This is in fairness to the Garda as well as to all others involved.  We are calling also for a full, frank and public report, but we are seeking something more.  We wish the tribunal to make such recommendations, if any, as they may consider proper, and that is the purpose of our amendment.</P>
    <P>We accept this motion but in addition we want it possible for the tribunal to make recommendations if it considers it appropriate, especially in relation to the treatment of people in custody and in relation to the conduct of criminal investigations. If there are lessons to be learnt we wish to learn them.  Why has the Minister omitted to include the right to make recommendations?  It appears to have been done deliberately when we contrast the wording of the motion setting up the tribunal on the Whiddy disaster and the tribunal on the Artane fire disaster.  The Whiddy disaster is dealt with in the Official Report of 6 March 1979 at column 773 when Deputy Faulkner, then Minister for Tourism and Transport, moved:</P>
    <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for &mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    <P>and the matters are set out in three paragraphs. The report goes on:</P>
    <P>2.  making such recommendations (if any) as the tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper.</P>
    <P>There was no hesitation about requesting that recommendations be made if appropriate. The Artane fire disaster is dealt with similarly as reported in the Official Report of 18 February 1981 at column 1984 where the Minister for the Environment, Deputy R. Burke, moved:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2170" /> That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for &mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    <P>and the matters are set out in five paragraphs. The report goes on:</P>
    <P>2.  making such recommendations as the tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper in respect of the statutory and other provisions in relation to fire.</P>
    <P>The motion setting up this tribunal has omitted the paragraph relating to recommendations which was included in both other motions.  Why has the Minister chosen to omit the provision enabling the tribunal to make recommendations? Recommendations made in this case could have implications for the proposed independent complaints procedure.  The Members of the House and the public at large would be very happy to have recommendations.  One of the most important elements of the inquiry relates to what we can learn from it and how it can be applied in future.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to other cases and I will do likewise briefly.  Will the Minister say exactly what he intends to do about the Shercock case?  The Minister in his statement earlier insisted on coupling the two cases and I would ask him to assure the House that he is not ruling out the possibility of an inquiry into the Shercock case.  I appreciate that this matter is probably <i>sub judice</i> and that that will create difficulty for the Minister.</P>
    <P>We do not seek to score political points on this sensitive matter.  From the beginning we believed that an independent inquiry was necessary.  We were patient with the Minister and accepted his <i>bona fides</i> when he said that he wished to carry out an internal investigation first.  That has been carried out and now the tribunal is being set up.  We welcome the appointment of a judge of the High Court to conduct the inquiry but would ask the Minister to accept our proposed amendment. Otherwise we accept the Minister's motion as being quite comprehensive and <Col N="2171" /> I have no intention of arguing about how necessary it was to undertake the internal Garda inquiry.  It might have been preferable if the Minister pursued this line after a quick internal inquiry, nevertheless we are glad that the Minister has taken this step at this stage and we support him in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief, as I understand other people wish to speak.  I join with Deputy Woods in welcoming this inquiry.  Contrary to the view of very many people in this House I feel that the internal Garda inquiry should never have taken place for the following reasons &mdash; it slowed down the process of investigation and examination that the public badly wanted to see carried out; it was also evident, as the Minister pointed out in his speech, that the Garda did not have the powers that they required in order to carry out a proper investigation.  They did not have the power to oblige people to give evidence.  Everybody in the Dáil knew about that after our discussions on the Criminal Justice Bill.  It is very obvious that any member of the Garda Síochána who had been involved in the Kerry babies case would have taken advice and would have been advised to say nothing.  I understand, although I am not privy to the report which the Minister probably has as a result of the internal inquiry, that members of the Garda Síochána involved in the case did not cooperate. I do not say that in any offensive way.  Given the threat of a public inquiry and the threat of legal proceedings, I understand completely why members of the Garda would not rush out to make statements to their superiors in relation to a matter like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those reasons it was probably a mistake to have an internal Garda inquiry.  I am delighted it is over; I am <Col N="2172" /> sorry it did not work out better but I am pleased that a public inquiry is to be held.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that it is very difficult to arrange an investigation or to produce a report to an inquiry like that which is being established because it is only the Garda who have the resources to allow for investigations.  That is a fair point and it is something we need to change.  I agree with the suggestion made elsewhere that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions should be equipped with staff who would investigate cases like this.  If the Minister or any Minister should feel about any matter, because of sensitivity within the Garda or because of public concern or sensitivity, that it would be better that the Minister and the Government and the people, through the Office of the DPP, would have some investigatory staff available to him, I urge the Minister to consider that in the context of this entire problem.</P>
    <P>It bothers me slightly that there is no reference in the terms of reference of the inquiry to what would have happened if this story had not been given to the media or if they had not discovered the story themselves.  Would anything have happened? We do not know whether the prosecutions would have been brought against the Hayes family; we do not know whether the prosecutions would have been stopped by the authorities in the Garda Síochána or the office of the DPP. If the prosecutions had been stopped against members of the Hayes family what would have happened within the Garda about it?  I regret there is no specific provision in the terms of reference of the inquiry to try to establish what might have happened or what would have happened, so that we would be likely to know in future what might or might not happen when investigations of this nature are undertaken, which apparently have been fouled up by the Garda, intentionally or otherwise, with people being charged in court when manifestly, on evidence available to us and to the media, those people could not have been guilty of those crimes.  Surely we should consider what would have happened if <Col N="2173" /> this story had not appeared in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister and other Members, I have the greatest respect for the Garda. As a solicitor I have practised in many courts with members of the Garda in the past ten or 11 years and I feel great sympathy for them, and great sorrow that they should be subject to great vilification since this story broke.  The vast majority of them have performed their duties with the highest integrity and great dedication and have served the country in an incredibly good way.  Despite all the difficulties they face, they continue to do that and it is tragic that some few should cause difficulties, as we have seen in this and other cases.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am deeply disturbed &mdash; I have had this from a number of different sources &mdash; that spokesmen for the Garda at senior management level and at Garda representative association level have been offering the view consistently since this story broke that the big problem is how the media got hold of this.  They are asking whether they can track down what happened, why it happened, how and why the case occurred and what went wrong in the investigation against the Hayes family.  They are concerned about why the story broke.  The information I have about it is that this is coming from a very high level within the Garda Síochána both at representative association level and senior management. That frightens me.  I do not think I am the only Deputy who knows that, and we should be concerned that the inquiry will have a function in this.  I am dismayed by that view from higher levels in the Garda, though human nature being what it is, if there were leaks from my office or the office of Deputy Woods or the Minister's office we would be very concerned about them and we would try to get to the bottom of it, but it seems to me that in a case like this senior Garda members should say that it is a good thing this was exposed because this is the sort of thing they do not want to see occur.  I do not detect such a level of concern at senior Garda level.  I came in today <Col N="2174" /> specifically to make that point because it disturbs me greatly.</P>
    <P>For ten or 12 years there has been talk about heavy gangs of one sort or another in the Garda.  For a long time I believed that these stories or reports were the inventions of an imaginative media.  I find now that my belief was wrong.  I do not believe that there was ever an organised heavy gang system within the Garda but there have been a sufficient number of cases published which give us cause for concern.  What bothers me particularly about many of these cases is that there have been political overtones.  One or other illegal organisation have been involved and that gives the reports a certain taint.  However, there have been many cases in which statements have been made, apparently voluntarily, which afterwards have been proved without question to have been wrong. People have admitted committing crimes they did not even commit and obviously could not have committed given all the circumstances available to the courts.</P>
    <P>This Kerry babies case is not the only example we have had of this.  The Shercock case has been referred to but there are others.  I will refer to two.  There is the case of Amanda McShane in connection with a robbery in Tallaght in 1982.  She was charged with an offence.  Her solicitor went to meet her in a Garda station and she alleged that an attempt had been made to have her sign a statement earlier that day but she had refused to sign it. When the solicitor looked around the interview room before the interview had taken place at all he found a statement in the first person and in the name of Amanda McShane, unsigned.  Clearly that was the statement which she alleged she had been asked to sign earlier that day.  Ultimately, when the solicitor made that known in court the matter was adjourned and the DPP very properly entered a <i>nolle prosequi</i> and the prosecution was not proceeded with.  Has there ever been an inquiry about that?  Surely it is the same problem that arises in the Kerry babies case and surely it is something we should consider having an inquiry into.  Has there ever been an <Col N="2175" /> internal Garda inquiry into it?  Can we know whether the Minister or the commissioner or any authority has been given a result of such an inquiry?</P>
    <P>There is the case of Michael Ward, a 21 year old itinerant who in 1983 signed a statement admitting the commission of 26 burglaries.  The statement contained graphic descriptions of how he committed the burglaries.  The Garda alleged in their evidence and statements that he had been brought around in a squad car and he had pointed out the houses he had burgled.  When the matter came to court and when he was properly defended, it emerged that, in relation to some of the offences he admitted committing, he was actually in Mountjoy in custody at the time and could not possibly have committed those offences.  In relation to others, no crime had been committed at all.  One instance was reported in the media from the statement in which he admitted to stealing a certain amount of cash from a priest in some parochial house.  Inquiries from the priest indicated that no money had ever been taken, that no crime had ever been reported to the Garda.</P>
    <P>This 21 year old itinerant signed a voluntary statement admitting the commission of 26 burglaries, some of which he could not have committed because he was in prison, and others which he did not commit because no crime was committed. I wonder whether there was even an inquiry into that.  It is a classic example of a statement being made in circumstances which are highly questionable, a statement being made that is manifestly wrong.  It is an example of the problem we have in the so-called Kerry babies case.</P>
    <P>The Shercock case is completely different. I have mentioned two, the Amanda McShane case and the Michael Ward case.  I picked those two because the facts of those cases are so patently similar to the facts of the Kerry babies case.  I do not think the inquiry into this whole question is satisfactory.  Perhaps there are good reasons, in the context of this present case, why the Minister has to ask the specific questions he is asking. <Col N="2176" /> Mr. Justice Lynch has an awful job ahead of him if this inquiry is to be anything like some of the other inquiries which have taken place.</P>
    <P>I congratulate him on taking the job and I wish him the best.  If that eminent judge's time is to be absorbed in dealing with the questions arising in the Hayes case, there is a case to be made for extending the inquiry to include the examination of other cases.  I understand allegations have been made in the media that some of the Garda personnel involved in the Kerry case were involved in other cases.  I do not know whether that is the case.  I am simply reporting to the House what we have all seen in the media.  Issues like this are high in the public mind.  The vast majority of the gardaí are disgusted at what has happened. They want this cleared up once and for all.  We should take this opportunity to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech made by Deputy Molony can do nothing but good. I support what the Minister is doing, with the amendment mentioned by Deputy Woods from this side of the House.  It is important that all the procedures of the inquiry should be above board.  It is practically a cliché that justice should be done and should be seen to be done.  That is very important in our society.</P>
      <P>There should be no condoning of improper behaviour of any kind.  Even when the conviction is a good one in the sense that the criminal is caught and convicted &mdash; and I said this in the supergrass debate a couple of nights ago &mdash; we in this House can never go along with the principle that the end justifies the means. There should be no improper behaviour on the part of the Garda.  That is very important.  There should be no improper behaviour on the part of the State.  That is even more important, if we can make a distinction between the State and the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a passing reference to the case of Séamus Galligan, a raw, young recruit.  In this case justice was not done and was not seen to be done.  He is a young man who was a few weeks in the <Col N="2177" /> station.  He knew very few people in the town to which he went.  Before he went there he had been commended for good police work as a recruit in Pearse Street. He was held in high esteem in the community. The community put that on record.  He was highly regarded as an athlete and a footballer.  The newspapers &mdash; and he is a bloody fool if he does not sue them for libel &mdash; stated that he was tried in connection with the case in Shercock. He was never tried.  He did not have hand, act or part in what happened in Shercock.  <i>The Evening Press</i> carried a notice that he was tried.  RTE carried it. I was very upset about it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molony referred at length to two cases.  This House, the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice and the media, who are very important in this case, should take a closer look and see whether this man is being made a sacrificial lamb and a scapegoat.  Somebody talked about the Garda Representative Body.  If they have <Col N="2178" /> any guts, if they do not adopt a mealymouthed approach, they will stand up for their member in this case.</P>
      <P>I said I do not condone any improper behaviour or any improper procedure.  A terrible tragedy occurred in that town, but let us be aware of the sacrificial lamb syndrome.  Justice for an individual with a free conscience is very important to me and should be very important to everybody in this House.  He may have had a false sense of loyalty to someone as a raw rookie.  Perhaps we all have that.  What the Minister is doing here as of now, with the strengthening of the amendment suggested by Deputy Woods, will do nothing but good for the Garda and help them to maintain a position of credibility and integrity in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully endorse and support the majority of the points made by my colleague, Deputy Molony, but he is wrong on one point.  The Minister was right to wait until the full, internal procedures had been exhausted before deciding to go ahead with this tribunal.  We should not enter lightly upon a tribunal of this kind, not just in terms of the cost but also in terms of the gravity which that implies.  The Minister was right to wait until the full, internal Garda inquiry had taken place.  I do not believe that inquiry was bound to fail.  There was a very good chance that it might have found the truth. Had it found the truth, we would be spared the full inquiry.  Since that was not the case the Minister was right.  I think all parties here would agree it was better to do that, and go ahead now fully and clearly as we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all want the truth and justice from this inquiry.  It is vital that the public should be reassured, that nothing should be held back, that every facet and aspect should be investigated and that, in the end, the full, unvarnished truth should be told.  Only if the truth is told and seen to be told, will the public confidence which has been ebbing away so much in recent times from the Garda begin to be restored.  It is important that justice be done fully to those involved, whether it be the gardaí or others.  No one in this <Col N="2179" /> House will pre-judge the case at this stage.  The gardaí may well be innocent. The blame may lie elsewhere, or <i>vice versa</i>.  Whatever it is, we have to expect that the full truth will be told and that the names of those involved will be cleared.</P>
    <P>The importance of this tribunal must go much further than Kerry and the specific case it will examine.  The very questions it raises, questions about the methodology of the Garda, questions about truth, questions about other cases are fundamental to the entire workings of the Garda Síochána and to the administration of justice.  It is especially important, in view of recent events, that this be done.  What is especially central to this tribunal is the whole question of Garda methods and techniques about which there is widespread concern.  It is clear that such concern embraces possible abuses and indeed cases where clearly abuses have taken place.  Much of that disquiet was expressed in the course of discussing the Criminal Justice Bill and has been reiterated by others in the House this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Questions arise also about the whole methodology of the Garda in questions of crime and investigation.  It appears to people, looking at the workings of the Garda that, in spite of the great changes that have occurred in technology, in spite of their much increased manpower, in spite of the clarification of the law in many ways in recent years, it would appear that very little has changed in the way in which the Garda go about the job of investigating crimes of the sort about which we are speaking.</P>
    <P>In passing, I hope the tribunal will address itself to these wider questions which are implicit in what it will be examining. Without pre-judging its findings I believe the lack of appreciation which appears to have characterised the approach of the Garda in this case inevitably was bound to end up in consequences, to say the very least, which were highly open to question.</P>
    <P>The Minister has confined himself to this one case while my colleagues, Deputies <Col N="2180" /> Molony and Wilson, referred to other disquieting cases.  A fundamental question was raised by Deputy Molony, that was, had the media not raised this case, had a file not been sent to people in the media &mdash; as appears to have been the case &mdash; had journalists not got to the bottom and begun to unearth the story, what would have happened?  Would the case have died down?  Would the people involved have remained where they were, whoever may be guilty?  These are frightening questions to pose because there may well be others which have not come to public light in which there may well have been miscarriages of justice.</P>
    <P>I hope this tribunal will comprise the beginning of a process to dispose publicly and openly of the doubts and shadows under which the Garda operate today.  I know that most people in the Garda want this to happen.  The public needs it to happen if confidence is to be restored. But even more is needed.  I was encouraged to hear the Minister talk in recent days about radical changes to be effected in the whole of the training methods of the Garda.  These changes are needed at all levels, in their managerial training, incorporating changes in technology and leadership.  What the Garda themselves are maintaining is that what is needed is a radical root and branch restructuring of the entire force.  I believe this will have the entire support of all Deputies, the vast majority of the Garda and the general public in order to ensure that what is good in the Garda Síochána is built on and what is not good is eliminated.  I hope the establishment of this tribunal will see the beginning of the restoration of public confidence in the Garda Síochána.  That can be done only if the tribunal does what I know it will do &mdash; establish the full truth, having the axe fall where it should, allowing us to see that restoration of confidence in a force which has served the country well over the years.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister announce that he was establishing a sworn judicial inquiry into what is now know as the &ldquo;Kerry babies&rdquo; case.  It is important, indeed essential that <Col N="2181" /> every effort be made to establish the truth in this case.  There is great disquiet felt about this case in my constituency.  I am quite sure that this inquiry will resolve the matter satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>It is gratifying to note that both parties, that is the Hayes family and the Garda, have welcomed its establishment.  I should say that, when one lives in a constituency in which this type of case has arisen, it renders it somewhat more difficult to speak about it especially in view of the fact that one is familiar with and knows all of the parties involved.  I am sure other Members of the House would appreciate that fact were it to happen in their constituencies.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if this inquiry will take place in Dublin or in Tralee?  If it is to be held in Dublin what about the costs of the people involved? That would be especially important to the Hayes family.  I should like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment of Deputy Woods.  I should reiterate that I am delighted at the establishment of this inquiry, I am sure the House will understand that it is somewhat more difficult to talk about a case when the people involved are intimate friends.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I welcome the establishment of this inquiry.  However, like others, I feel it should have been done almost two months ago, when the matter was raised in the House on 16 October last.  Nevertheless its establishment is welcomed.  It is also gratifying to note that it has been welcomed by the parties concerned in the problem that gave rise to its establishment. It is clear from what the Minister said that the internal Garda inquiry could not possibly have extracted the issues and faults involved in this case given the limited powers Garda investigators have in these matters.</P>
      <P>The Minister had this to say in the course of his remarks:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I simply want to make it clear, so that there may be no misunderstanding of what I said, that it is a point that <Col N="2182" /> may need to be looked at separately at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Is he there referring to the giving of additional powers to Garda investigators, or to what is he referring?  I should like clarification of that point because it is not clear from the wording.</P>
    <P>I believe that the terms of reference of the tribunal as they stand are quite broad and will enable it to carry out a worthwhile investigation.  Like Deputy Woods I would be anxious to ensure that the tribunal would be enabled to make recommendations.  I do not know why the Minister did not include that proposal in its terms of reference which would have appeared necessary in order to ensure that recommendations be forthcoming and also that the situation that developed in this case would not recur.</P>
    <P>There are very few Members of this House who have had no reports or experiences of questionable tactics on the part of individual members of the Garda Síochána.  The fact that the Kerry babies case was of such a serious nature resulted in the public concern and the establishment of the public inquiry now announced. However, it must be admitted &mdash; despite our anxiety to protect the Garda and their good name &mdash; there are practices among the force warranting correction which have resulted in many young people, in particular, having been brought before our courts and sentenced which in all justice should not have occurred. Because of that this inquiry has much broader implications than those involved in the case to which it gave rise.  I hope it will bring forward recommendations which will ensure that the Garda, in their activities and practices, are seen to be above reproach in the future.</P>
    <P>Another point is the make-up of the tribunal.  The Minister has indicated that a judge of the High Court will be the chairperson of the tribunal.  Could he indicate whether the judge will select the other members or will it be up to the Minister?  Will he ensure that lay people will be involved, that it will not be confined to the ranks of the Garda or former gardaí or members of the legal <Col N="2183" /> profession?  It is important that there should be lay involvement in the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I would ask whether the gardaí who were involved in the Kerry case are still on duty.  This is a point I made previously in relation to another case.  It is important in order to allay public fears that gardaí who are under investigation should not be on duty.  That in no way prejudges the outcome of the inquiry.  It should be common practice where gardaí are under investigation for what are regarded as serious offences that they should not continue on duty.</P>
    <P>There is a final point which needs to be kept in mind by Deputies and the public in general.  A newborn baby was found savagely murdered, having been stabbed and its neck having been broken, and the perpetrators of that crime have not been brought to justice.  In all our concern about the injustice of the way the Hayes family were treated, we should also keep in mind the fact that the person or persons capable of this despicable type of crime are still free among us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion. Ever since the story of what happened in this case emerged in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> it seemed inevitable that there would have to be a public inquiry.  The journalist who made this matter public knowledge deserves the thanks of this House.  I mirror the comment made by Deputy Molony in wondering to what extent this matter would have been investigated and followed up without the attendant publicity. The Minister made the point that the Commissioner had made the decision that an investigation was necessary before the public controversy arose.  Was that a day or two before the story was printed in the Sunday newspapers or was it well before the charges against the Hayes family were withdrawn in the District Court?  The Minister might clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not appropriate to go into the details of this case but one of the most disturbing aspects was that this was not apparently an incident of an individual garda misbehaving.  The facts, as they <Col N="2184" /> appear to have emerged, indicate a whole breakdown in the chain of command within the Garda.  That has serious implications going beyond the implications arising from some of the other cases to which Deputies have referred which give rise to concern.  It is my view that a public inquiry has always been essential.  It is to be hoped that the tribunal will establish the facts.  The version of what happened which has emerged in the newspapers has seriously undermined the self-confidence of the Garda and the general public's confidence in the Garda, to such an extent that no matter how good a job the garda did in their own internal investigation it would not have been greeted with credibility by the public, no matter what the result.  The only way to restore confidence in the Garda and to satisfy the general public that the matter has been fully dealt with and properly investigated is by setting up this type of tribunal.</P>
    <P>This internal investigation has wide implications.  The failure of the internal investigation to get at the truth has copperfastened and confirmed the worries and fears of many Deputies which were expressed during the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill.  There is a belief that within the existing system of law, even with the added safeguards under the Criminal Justice Act, the Garda cannot fully and properly investigate themselves. That is a matter of concern.  I fully appreciate and accept that the Garda are entitled to the same protections as anyone else under investigation for an offence but it is quite clear from the Minister's speech, although he has to be circumspect in the position in which he finds himself, that the Garda investigators in this incident were not afforded the degree of co-operation necessary to enable them to reach final conclusions as to what actually took place in the context of the Garda dealings with the Hayes family.  That is implicit in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the tribunal is to be established and that Mr. Justice Lynch will be heading it.  I have no doubt that he will produce a very comprehensive report which should greatly assist this House in drawing conclusions which <Col N="2185" /> will be relevant, not merely in the context of this case but which will be directly relevant to the ability or capacity of any complaints procedure the Minister intends to establish under new legislation to deal with future problems arising where there is a conflict between gardaí and individuals who are the subject of investigation.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies who have spoken have referred to aspects of this matter to which I would otherwise refer. This is a short debate and in deference to my colleagues I will not repeat what has been said.  I want to take up one other theme which was touched upon briefly by Deputy De Rossa.  It is a point worth repeating because it is something that has been lost. The controversy surrounding the Garda dealings with the Hayes family and the shock which the public suffered on learning what happened have to some extent left somewhere on the sidelines the fact that a baby was found dead on Cahirciveen beach.  Deputy De Rossa properly and correctly referred to this.  Has all investigation into the death of that baby ground to a halt in the context of the controversy surrounding this case?  It seems to be conclusively established that Joanne Hayes and members of her family who were initially charged with involvement in that crime did not have an involvement in the death of that baby.  What continued Garda investigation has taken place into identifying the dead baby found on Cahirciveen beach?  What further steps have been taken to discover the relatives of that child?  What further steps have been taken to discover the perpetrators of the horrific death of that child on Cahirciveen beach?  This is a matter on which the tribunal cannot make a finding.</P>
    <P>It concerns me &mdash; and I say this in the context of the indication in the Minister's speech that there was not full co-operation in the internal investigative procedures within the Garda &mdash; that it may have been in the vested interest of some gardaí not to continue with the comprehensive investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of the baby found on <Col N="2186" /> Cahirciveen beach once it was established that charges could not proceed against the Hayes family and once this became a general matter of controversy because of the alleged dealings of the Garda with the Hayes family.  That is a matter of grave public concern.  I find it curious in a country in which we had a great debate 12 months ago, described as a pro-life debate, that somewhere in the context of the disturbing facts that emerged about the alleged dealings of the Garda with the Hayes family everybody forgot the fate of the baby found on the beach.  The fate of that baby is not a matter that has generated any public comment except as an incidental matter to the facts and controversy surrounding this issue.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline the position to the House?  Is there some special investigative unit of the Garda Síochána looking into the death of that baby?  What has been established about the baby?  Do we know where the baby was born?  Was the birth registered?  There are a series of unanswered questions relating to the tragic fate of that baby.  The tribunal has broad and important implications and not just in the context of the circumstances surrounding the Hayes family and dealings by the Garda with them.  It has important implications for the Garda. That point was well made by Deputy Molony.  Some Members take the view that an appropriate investigation into allegations of this nature in the context of alleged Garda misbehaviour could have taken place at an earlier stage, possibly before the recent events that were damaging to public confidence in the Garda and damaging to the confidence of the Garda.  From my contacts with gardaí I found that the vast majority of them do not want to do anything else but to perform their public duty.  They are anxious that the full truth relating to this case is made known and that any problems in the chain of command in the Garda, that any responsibility that attaches to these sorry events, is fully and properly investigated.  They are equally anxious that as a result of whatever report is produced by the tribunal immediate <Col N="2187" /> and appropriate action will be taken, where necessary by the Government, where necessary by the Commissioner and where necessary by the law officers of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Member representing the constituency in which this tragic case occurred I welcome the decision to set up the inquiry.  Only good can come out of the tribunal especially in view of the fact that the Garda and the Hayes family have welcomed this decision.  Care has been taken by the Minister when drawing up the terms of reference of the tribunal to ensure that they are sufficiently wide to enable it to deal with all relevant aspects of the issues involved in this sad case.  I should like the Minister to clarify a number of points.  He made reference to legal representation before the tribunal and the related question of legal costs.  I should like to know if the interested parties will be entitled to have full legal representation and, if so, will they be fully reimbursed?  Will the inquiry take place in Kerry?  I believe it should.  I appeal to the Minister to accept our amendment in the name of Deputy Dr. Woods.  The Garda and the Hayes family have been subjected to most unreasonable publicity as a result of this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make some brief comments on the motion and I am aware that some of my colleagues are anxious to contribute to this short debate. It seems that there is some fair merit in the amendment proposed by Deputy Woods.  The motion, as proposed, seeks to establish a tribunal of inquiry, an important and essential matter as far as it goes.  I welcome the fact that the tribunal of inquiry is being set up.  However, it is desirable that the inquiry should not only inquire but also publish its findings of facts.  It should not just take evidence of what happened and have a record of that.  I sincerely hope that that is not the intent but that the inquiry will act in a judical manner and find facts.  Where there are conflicts on facts and evidence &mdash; the indications are that there will be conflicts of evidence in this case &mdash; I hope <Col N="2188" /> the tribunal will give its finding as to which sequence of facts it considers correct. I would see no objection to, as the amendment suggests, it being open to the tribunal to make recommendations as to what improvements can be achieved in the scheme of things.  In this case some considerable trouble, time and State expense will be involved in inquiring into a matter of intense public interest, a matter that, unfortunately, is in no way unique.  It may be apropriate that the tribunal, having conducted an inquiry at great length, might be able to assist us in ensuring that the events in Kerry will not be easily repeated in the future.  Recommendations might be helpful and appropriate.</P>
      <P>As far as the events are concerned, it is clear from some of the cases we know of &mdash; some of them were referred to by other Members &mdash; that the events in Kerry, the dubious circumstances under which statements were made, are not unique.  It appears that these matters arise primarily as a result of certain elements in the Garda on various occasions trying to divise a solution they feel fits the facts available to them, working backwards in the investigation rather than forward, as it were.  An improper step might be taken at some stage and then a sense of loyalty, perhaps, might come into play from a superior Garda officer in favour of his subordinate.  That is one possible context in which this could happen.  The other is where a subordinate Garda officer would come across an improper situation and, through either a sense of loyalty to his superiors or a sense of fear of his superiors or a feeling that his prospects of promotion might be affected if he speaks out on an unjust matter he might come across, he might feel prejudiced in one of these ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The message should go forth from the House, and from the tribunal in due course, that the primary loyalty and responsibility owed by each member of the Garda force is not to his colleagues, his superiors or subordinates but to the public who set up the force through the operations of legislation.  That is where the primary responsibility and loyalty of <Col N="2189" /> each member of the Garda must lie.  It must be known and accepted at all times that it will not be an accepted excuse from any member of the force to say that any improper act he did, connived at, accepted or did not expose was on the grounds that he was acting under the orders of a superior officer.  The orders of a superior officer are right and proper where they are lawful and just, but if they involve injustice or impropriety in any way it must be clear at all levels that under no circumstances will the excuse be accepted that an officer was acting under superiors' orders.  Once that type of excuse is accepted or allowed into the system it will open the door to a very dangerous position.</P>

      <P>Like my colleagues I am happy that the Minister has finally decided to establish this sworn judicial inquiry into the incidents surrounding what is now known as the &ldquo;Kerry babies&rdquo; case.  I want to add my voice of congratulation to those of the journalists who highlighted this case and the journalists who, down the years, have drawn the attention not only of the Members of this House but of the public to instances of this kind.  They have not just done a great service to this House, but they have done a great service to the public.  If we did not have such good investigative journalists, one wonders if inquiries like this would be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molony referred to the Amanda McShane case.  During the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill I twice referred to that case because, like others, I was concerned about it, but there has been no inquiry into that case.  The Michael Ward case, the Nicky Kelly case, the Shercock case and the recent fingerprint case are all very disturbing.  There have been civil cases in the courts in some instances, but there has been no proper inquiry as far as I am concerned.  I wonder if this case got such great attention because there was a baby involved?  This case, more than any other, seemed to focus the attention of the public in a very unique and strange way and caused a <Col N="2190" /> great deal of concern, particularly among the female members of the public.  Is this the reason why this inquiry is being set up.  My answer is in the negative and I find that very disturbing.</P>
    <P>This case teaches us a lot about what might happen in investigations of this kind but it must draw our minds to the fact that in terms of social policy in Ireland, things have not really changed.  We all know the names Ann Lovett and Joanne Hayes, but nobody knows the names of the fathers.  This is particularly relevant in the Joanne Hayes case, because one newspaper saw fit to quote at length remarks made by the person who alleged that he was the father of the baby but they concealed his identity. Nobody saw fit to conceal the identity of Joanne Hayes or any of the mothers in these cases.  For that reason it is very disturbing that in investigative murder cases there do not seem to be female gardaí at senior level involved.  I submit that had there been a senior female Garda officer involved, the method in interrogating a young girl who had just given birth would not have been used.  It is obvious from what I have read and from what I have seen, particularly on the <i>Today Tonight</i> programme where Joanne Hayes at very great length gave details of the manner in which she was interrogated, that she was in no state, mentally, to go through the trauma involved in this kind of questioning.  We must be concerned about that.</P>
    <P>One wonders if this type of thing happened before and we must ask if it will happen again.  For this reason I feel Deputy Woods's amendment is very relevant. What is the point in having an inquiry if they will not be able to make recommendations as to how such a thing could be prevented from happening again?  If this inquiry simply gives the history of what happened but does not make any recommendations we will have missed a golden opportunity.  I do not want to see this type of case happen again, and I have no doubt the public do not want to see it happen again either, and the best way to ensure that is by giving the judge heading the inquiry the <Col N="2191" /> power to make recommendations. Nobody will doubt his integrity, impartiality or objectivity.  Nobody who sits through the inquiry will be be a better position than he to make the necessary recommendations.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Wilson, referred to the Shercock case.  I realise this is <i>sub judice</i> and I just want to make a few remarks.  It is not good enough that the gardaí would simply lose their jobs. That may be the easy way out but it is not good enough.  I want to know what happened in this case and I have no doubt many members of the public want to know too.</P>
    <P>I want to know how long this inquiry will take.  I do not want any inquiry that will sit for months or years.  There should be a time limit on this investigation.  I suggest three months would be sufficient in the circumstances.  The Minister recognised that the tribunal could get the facts only if people could be examined on oath and were subjected to cross-examination. I am delighted he recognised that because during the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill when I referred to the Kerry babies cases, I said the only way the matter could be satisfactorily investigated would be by having a judicial sworn inquiry.  It has taken almost two months for this inquiry to be established.</P>
    <P>I want to put it on the record that in my view gardaí, solicitors, lawyers, doctors and so on are not in a position to carry out investigations into their own activities.  This type of investigation is particularly disturbing in this case because we were not just asking gardaí to investigate other gardaí but we were asking a superior to investigate an officer in the rank immediate below his own. That was most unsatisfactory and it is no wonder the investigation did not come to a satisfactory solution.  As I said, this inquiry is two months late, but let us hope that we do not repeat our mistakes.  I want to ask the Minister if he will take the same action in relation to the Michael Ward, Amanda McShane and Nicky Kelly cases, the fingerprint case and the <Col N="2192" /> Shercock case.  We know the gardaí were dismissed but we want to know what happened and in that way we will ensure that such a thing will never happen again.</P>

      <P>I welcome the setting up of this tribunal and consider it fortuitous that we are not allowing a witchhunt to take place but simply creating the structures to restore public confidence in the Garda Síochána.  Because of the increase in the number of very serious crimes which have been committed recently, the restoration of public confidence in the Garda Síochána is very important.  The public must have the utmost confidence in the ability of the Garda to carefully investigate very serious crimes but at the same time the Garda must have regard to the fact that the accused is innocent until proven guilty and the Garda are not expected to be judge and jury.</P>
      <P>At this stage I am not falling into the trap of becoming judge and jury, but if the facts brought to light in the media are true, then this must be one of the most horrific cases we have had to deal with in recent times.  When the tribunal publish their findings I hope the call for this type of investigation will be vindicated and that it will be clearly understood by all that is is absolutely essential that the Garda's methods of detection and questioning be above reproach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> I am a little concerned that the internal Garda inquiry has been inconclusive. This was a very good opportunity to restore public confidence in the Garda but unfortunately that has not happened. I hope that as a result of this inquiry every man, women and child will have the utmost confidence in the forces of law and order, and the ability of that force to carry out their duties in an impartial and just manner.</P>

I hope that at the end of this public sworn inquiry, all the questions which remain unanswered will be answered to the satisfaction of the public.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am pleased that there is general welcome for the motion which I introduced today and I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I am sorry that some Deputies did not get an opportunity to speak but half an hour was wasted on the Order of Business and I hope Deputies will remember that in future when we could be effectively debating the business of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this motion is passed by the Dáil and Seanad &mdash; as I hope it will &mdash; I will by order or warrant appoint the tribunal. That warrant will ask the tribunal to <Col N="2194" /> report to me.  The judge will decide his own procedure and there is no question of not having a report as, by warrant, he has to report to me on the results of the tribunal.  The judge will be in a position to decide on his own procedure as to where and when he will sit.  In reply to questions from Deputies in the North Kerry constituency, I can only speculate that he will take evidence in Kerry.  I could see a case for the tribunal sitting in Kerry but also sitting in Dublin especially when it comes to concluding the report. However, that will be a matter for the judge who will be appointed.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the question of costs and representation in my statement but Deputy Foley raised it again.  It is a matter for the tribunal to decide who will be allowed representation and, having heard all the evidence, it will again be up to the tribunal to direct that costs should be borne by whatever persons he considers appropriate, including the State.  I do not think we should attempt at this stage to make any pre-judgment of where costs would lie.  If the tribunal direct the State or individuals to pay, that is a matter for the tribunal.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised by individual Deputies and many of them contained misconceptions.  Many Deputies have proceeded as if we did not need a tribunal.  They seem to know all the facts already and they spoke in a tone which suggests they have all the answers and that the tribunal should simply endorse their opinions.  That is not so. We should approach this in an open manner and we need the tribunal to establish the facts.  The report, which will be made public, will, I hope, establish the facts.  Great stress was laid by certain Deputies on the fact that the Garda investigation was inconclusive.  It was inconclusive because it did not reach conclusions but I do not think that everybody should immediately jump to the conclusion that this was because certain gardaí did not make statements.  Certainly certain gardaí did not make the fullest possible statements but there was also the question of members of the family not meeting the investigating <Col N="2195" /> officers.  Their statements were made to a solicitor and there was no possibility of the Garda cross-examining them or even meeting them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of whether people other than the Garda could have come up with a conclusive report, it is not just the people who are carrying out the investigation, it is in the nature of their powers and if there were lay investigators under a particular format without the power to <i>subpoena</i> witnesses or to cross examine them, I do not think they would have got any further than the Garda investigators, or maybe not as far. This tribunal will have the powers of the High Court and it would not be wise to set up investigating bodies which would automatically have the powers of the High Court.  In this case witnesses will have the same protection as they would have in the High Court as the tribunal will have the powers of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson referred to the Shercock case.  The case of one of the gardaí involved is <i>sub judice</i>.  In a recent interview I indicated that action had been taken by the Commissioner but, as Deputy Wilson pointed out, the individual garda he named was never before the courts and that should be said.  I do not propose to respond to the questions raised about other cases.  Some of them have been the subject of parliamentary questions and I have dealt with them and will be dealing with others shortly.  I have acknowledged that other cases caused me concern.  I do not think it proper to say any more about the Shercock case but I accept that Garda Galligan was not tried for any offence.</P>
    <P>I now come to Deputy Woods's amendment.  As I said, the warrant setting up the tribunal will be signed by me and it will involve a report to me by the tribunal when they reach their conclusions. In the meantime, the judge has the powers of the High Court at his disposal and he will organise the tribunal as he sees fit.  He will also report to me.  On the question of recommendations, if it emerges from the findings of the tribunal that a criminal offence took place, then <Col N="2196" /> the statutory officer who proceeds on foot of that is the Director of Public Prosecutions and it would not be proper for a recommendation to be made by anybody else.  It would be up to the DPP to examine it and to make recommendations as he sees fit.  If a question of Garda discipline arises, the statutory officer responsible in that case is the Commissioner and it would be up to him to make a decision.</P>
    <P>On the question of Garda procedures and safeguards necessary for people in custody, we debated pretty fully in the Criminal Justice Bill and many of us have a good idea of the safeguards required. It is not so long since we had the Ó Briain report which was specifically set up to indicate the safeguards which should be applied to people held in Garda custody. I said in the House that statutory regulations will be introduced here and this House and the Seanad will have ample opportunity to debate the regulations governing the treatment of people in custody.</P>
    <P>I also said in the House that I will be drawing very fully on the Ó Briain report.  We are great for making recommendations but we should implement some of them for a change.  We have had the recommendations of the Ó Briain report since 1979 and I have told the House that I am bringing in regulations to govern the control of people in custody. Deputies and Senators will have the opportunity of debating them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Convention and its two Annexes establishing the European Meteorological Satellite Organisation: EUMETSAT.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of this new organisation is to establish, maintain and exploit European systems of operational meteorological satellites.  No such specifically European organisation has existed hitherto.</P>
      <P>EUMETSAT is being set up under the aegis of the European Space Agency, Europe's primary organisation for space and related high technology activities. Ireland's membership of the space agency and our participation in its activities fall within my area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>On 24 May 1983, at a Conference of Plenipotentiaries held in Geneva the convention establishing EUMETSAT was formally adopted and opened for signature. The conference was attended by representatives of 16 countries, 15 of which have to date signed the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention will enter into force 60 days after the date on which countries whose contributions to EUMETSAT amount to more than 85 per cent of the <Col N="2198" /> total budget, have ratified the convention. Of the 15 signatories, two have thus far ratified the convention.</P>
    <P>By reason of Article 29.5 of the Constitution, the convention must be approved by Dáil Éireann before the State can be bound by it.  Approval of the present motion will allow the formalities for ratification by Ireland to be completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>In simplest terms, meteorology is the science of weather forecasting.  Its benefits impinge on a number of key economic sectors and, in particular, on agriculture, shipping, air transport and fisheries.</P>
    <P>Meteorological information has traditionally been provided by observation stations on land and on board ships of various kinds.  The data thus collected is collated and exchanged among national meteorological services co-operating within the framework of the World Meteorological Organisation.</P>
    <P>For a number of years now information obtained from ground based observers has been supplemented by data from American and Russian meteorological satellites.  This information, and in particular the satellite photographs showing cloud cover and frontal activity, has considerably improved the accuracy of weather forecasting.  It has been felt, however, and this country shares this feeling, that there should be an adequate availability of information from other than just these two sources, namely, the Russian and American sources.</P>
    <P>With the spread of advanced space technology, therefore, countries other than America and the USSR have embarked on programmes of space meteorology, such as Japan and India.  Indeed Europe itself, acting through its own European Space Agency (ESA), has also placed satellites in orbit.  Ireland is, of course, a full member of ESA.</P>
    <P>ESA has launched two satellites as part of its meteosat programme.  This experimental project was funded by a limited number of ESA's more developed member states.  While the meteosat programme provided a sound base for European satellite meteorology, it was <Col N="2199" /> obvious that once the programme ended with the expiry of the life terms of the original satellites, a more permanent structure would be required to ensure that Europe's needs in this vital area would continue to be met under a system which is under its own direct control in Europe.</P>
    <P>For this reason, EUMETSAT has been established as an international organisation capable of procuring, launching and maintaining a system of European meteorological satellites.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the organisation is being set up under the aegis of ESA and indeed, out of ESA, meaning that the personnel etc., are initially being provided by the space agency.  In a few years, as early as is practicable, ESA will hive off EUMETSAT which will then become a completely separate organisation.  In order to provide continuity in the meantime ESA's meteosat programme will be maintained until EUMETSAT is fully operational.</P>
    <P>Annex 1 of the convention describes the technical details of the satellite system which EUMETSAT will operate. The satellites will be of the meteosat type developed by ESA and will operate in what is known as &ldquo;geostationary orbit&rdquo;. This entails placing the satellites in an orbit 36,000 km above the earth.  At this altitude the satellite's orbital speed is equal to the speed of the earth's rotation and the satellite, therefore, has a fixed position relative to the earth's surface. This allows earth stations and the satellite to remain in contact &ldquo;around the clock&rdquo;. As a result, pictures from the satellite can be available every 30 minutes.  In case of weather satellites in low earth orbit, the meteorological service could only receive their signals as they pass over Ireland, six times daily.</P>
    <P>Because of this frequency of transmissions and because of being specifically positioned to serve Europe, the latest data can be uniquely valuable in the formulation of short-term weather forecasts. Furthermore, the science of meteorology and the related broader science of climatology can be progressed <Col N="2200" /> by enabling the formulation of more accurate models which demonstrate theoretically how weather systems operate.</P>
    <P>In the initial phase, which lasts for 12 years, Ireland under a special arrangement, will contribute to EUMETSAT at a rate of £25,000 per annum which is equal to approximately 0.1 per cent of the total financial envelope.  On the date of signing, this percentage figure was inserted in annex II of the convention, which is lodged with the depositing authority in Geneva.</P>
    <P>EUMETSAT will be governed by a council composed of not more than two members from each member state, each delegation having one vote.  Thus, each member state will have an equal say in the running of the organisation, irrespective of the size of its contribution.  One member of each delegation must be drawn from their country's meteorological service.</P>
    <P>The council will have the powers to adopt those measures necessary for the implementation of the convention.  The council will also be responsible for governing the conditions of accession to the convention, adopting the annual budget, and appointing the director of EUMETSAT.  The director of EUMETSAT will be responsible for the implementation of the decisions taken by council and as the legal representative of EUMETSAT will have the power to sign agreements and contracts approved by the council.</P>
    <P>Membership of EUMETSAT will guarantee this country greater range, accuracy and quality in weather forecasts as part of a continuing system into the indefinite future.  This will result in a substantial and continuing improvement in the weather forecasting services provided for a number of key economic sectors.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his outline of the new organisation known as EUMETSAT.  There are some aspects to which I should like to draw attention. Perhaps the Minister might be good <Col N="2201" /> enough to elaborate on some points raised in his introductory remarks.  He might give us some further details as to what is involved here, seeing that there is quite a considerable contribution to be made annually by the State.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the Minister states that there was no specific European organisation in existence heretofore dealing with this matter.  I was always of the opinion that our meteorological service has had quite a large tie-in with the ECMWF since 1975.  In fact, that organisation was ratified by 12 countries and, I believe was also subscribed to by 19 outer European countries.  Our meteorological service was an integral part of that organisation, as I understand it.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not say how many satellites there will be, or give any details in the annexe as to the schedule of launching of these satellites and, in effect, whether we will be asked for more money subsequent to the decisions being taken by the new organisation as to the number of satellites which they will require at any one time.  I take it that this new satellite is purely a picture taking satellite and that its job of work will be to transmit pictures to earth, where they can be adequately stored by way of computer and made available to the various subscribing countries so as to enable them to make better forecasts in the future.  The present position is reasonably reliable and quite good weather forecasting can be made some five or six days in advance. The Minister does not indicate this, but I take it that there will be an advance on this because of the new technology and that we may expect to have up to some ten days weather forecasting in advance with greater accuracy and that there will be increased information available to all bodies that have use of this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the European Space Agency are concerned and the number of satellites that they have been maintaining, perhaps the Minister might indicate if we were contributors to that scheme over the past number of years?  We have certainly been beneficiaries to quite a large degree. Perhaps there is some way by which we could continue our participation without <Col N="2202" /> the necessity for the contribution now requested for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>But not to any great degree of expenditure &mdash; nothing to what is being asked for here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in the Estimates for a contribution each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the whole point in setting up this new agency is that Europe will have a new independent meteorological service of their own. There are very many organisations which benefit from a good weather forecasting system.  I take it that the facility exists at present for our meteorological headquarters at Glasnevin to participate in the transmission of this information from the satellite &mdash; that we will not incur further capital expenditure other than the payment of £25,000 per annum which will be necessary.  The Minister might clear that matter up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very many uses to which this type of information can be put, not least of which concerns safety, but also in the area of farming, fishing, industry, air transport, surface transport &mdash; in particular, shipping &mdash; and offshore exploration. All these areas benefit to quite a large degree from the information and statistical data which come from the use of these satellites.  Of course, there is always the question of the military uses to which such a satellite might or could be put.  This is the area which I would like clarified. In particular, I am anxious to know if Plymouth Polytechnic were in any way involved in the financing of the arrangements for this new satellite.  They are funded by the British Military Research <Col N="2203" /> Unit and would have a direct link into&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy just repeat that, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Plymouth Polytechnic have a very considerable military dimension and I should be anxious to know if they would be contributing in any way either to the technical work or the information that would emanate from this new satellite.  Can this satellite, or these satellites, be used for military purposes and is there a dimension of a strategic nature attached to the placing of these satellites in permanent orbit, as suggested, at 36,000 km above the surface of the earth? In particular, does the Minister think this satellite could be used for submarine surveillance? Would it be available, taking a particular instance, if a Department other than the Department of Defence or any other Department requested or directed, if entitled to, that a certain picture be taken at a certain spot on the globe at any given time?</P>
      <P>According to the information available to me, this satellite is not just an orbiting satellite passing over Ireland every few hours.  It is in permanent location at 36,000 km above the earth's surface. Because of its fixed position, it would be capable at any time of making quite a considerable impact by way of surveillance on any particular object that would be requested of it.  Does the convention specifically debar the use of the satellite by agencies or Departments for military use of any kind in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial payment of £25,000, on the face of it, looks a reasonable price to pay for the amount of data which will be available to our meterological service, but if it is 0.1 of 1 per cent I take it that the initial capital cost would be in the region of £25 million.  What information will our contribution, small as it is, entitle us to and what participation can we have in the use of the satellite?  Will this figure fluctuate on a yearly basis, or is it a static figure?  For how many years are we committed to the payment of £25,000?  Does our passing of this law this evening enable <Col N="2204" /> the convention, after their formulation, to make other demands upon us to which we would have no alternative but to subscribe?</P>
    <P>The Meteosat system is beginning to terminate its life span and I take it that this satellite will be of a similar kind. However, we are given no details as to the number of satellites or the broad range of uses to which they might very well be put.  It is interesting to note that of the number of people who have shown a considerable interest in this arrangement, only two have so far ratified the convention.  It would appear that quite a number of countries are failing to meet their obligations so far as the contribution is concerned.  Do I take it that they are pinching the information being made available by having the necessary tracking equipment without paying their contributions? I support the point of view that if we are participating in some convention and having the benefit of statistical data we should pay our way, but it seems strange that some of the other countries who appear not to have complied with their obligations are better off than us.  Is any effort being made to see that right?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that we would benefit virtually indefinitely from these new arrangements, but as I understand it the budgetary envelope only applies for some 12 years.  What budgetary structuring will we have to comply with in future years? I can see great benefit accruing from participation in this kind of international arrangement particularly in the area of agriculture where advance warnings of storms and inclement weather will enable farmers to plan their programme of farming.  Now that we are guaranteed better forecasting things will also improve for the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed by statisticians in the meteorological service that weather moves in a cycle.  Computers are now in a position to identify small weather changes on an ongoing basis and they can pinpoint the similarities that have existed in meterological forecasting over a long number of years.  This information is now stored in computers and it reinforces the <Col N="2205" /> attitude that there is a cycle.  There will be great technological advances in this area in the next decade, and this will be of great benefit to everybody.</P>
    <P>I take it that the service will have to provide weather forecasting for statistical information and scientific advice on the application of meteorology.  Our existing network is involved in a very elaborate telecommunications system.  Irish weather reports are fed into the system to an international network and data is fed in from the US and European countries, from the Atlantic and from the Mediterranean to build up a first class weather forecasting system.  This involves considerable co-ordination and co-operation with the existing service in other countries. It is appropriate that we express our gratitude to the meteorological service for the good work they have performed over a long period.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us if our major airports are equipped with essential weather radar facilities?  I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that a lot of the necessary information required to build up a proper meteorological chart was gleaned from stations all over the country and from ships at sea.  Many ships on the Irish register have equipment for taking weather observations at sea.  I should like to know, with the demise of Irish Shipping, if any of those ships on the Irish register were involved in that business.  If they were, will the Minister assure the House that the necessary steps will be taken to see that we are not at a loss in this area?  I wish to know if the necessary equipment has been installed in all weather stations and if the necessary trained staff are available to enable us to benefit from our involvement in this new satellite arrangement.  There is no point in our paying £25,000 a year if we cannot back it up by our own capacity by way of personnel and equipment.  We must provide an efficient service for those in farming, fishing, shipping, offshore developments and for those involved in military manoeuvres who might need this kind of service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2206" /> This kind of advance weather forecasting is an essential requirement even for ordinary living.  We have all learned to enjoy good weather more because of advance notice.  We take it as an everyday phenomenon that we can be told in advance that we can expect one or two weeks of good weather.  This sort of information helps people to plan their lives in a better way.  Even in that mundane way, advance weather forecasting is of considerable advantage apart from the advantages that will apply to essential services.  In that regard I would ask the Minister to consider having a special type of programme either on radio or on TV for an extended specialised weather forecast, because with our participation in this new satellite arrangement we will be able to make long term forecasts.  The Minister might consider doing this as part of the existing transmission on our national channel and he might also favourably consider making certain post office lines available to the Glasnevin headquarters, perhaps even free of charge, to interested groups who could get information on an hourly or day to day basis for their strategy in relation to farming, fishing and so on.  I see no reason why the House should not welcome our participation in this satellite arrangement and I would be grateful if the Minister in summing up would allay some of my fears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion.  It appears that this agency does not have the ability to do political forecasting. If it did it would probably forecast that it is going to be very wet and windy not just for the Government but for the Opposition.  It is a good thing for us to be getting away from depending for information on a USSR and a USA source.  The further we get away from dependence on the super powers, not just for meteorological information but for security type information, the better it will be for everybody.  It is a good idea for smaller nations to band together to try to maintain their independent source of information.  In this regard this is the main benefit of this arrangement that the <Col N="2207" /> Minister is proposing here today.  I presume that there will be a certain amount of duplication with the sources of information already available and that the main objective is to ensure an independent source of information.  In that regard this is very welcome.</P>
      <P>The points about fishing and agriculture are well made and in those areas this could be turned to our advantage.  Many lives are lost annually not just on the seas but on lakes also and if we could be more scientific in forecasting weather conditions that could well result in safer seas, lakes and rivers, and agriculture would benefit also.</P>
      <P>Regarding security, I have no hangups about the use of an independent satellite for security purposes.  There has been a great deal of speculation recently that perhaps satellites are being used to track gun running or whatever.  If that is so and if we could not do that through the European Space Agency, then we would have to do it through the USSR and the USA.  Through this facility probably we could track gun running operations ourselves. I hope that the facility will be used to the total advantage of the country and not just in the areas of agriculture, fishing and weather forecasting, and if possible &mdash; it is not possible now &mdash; that it can be extended into the whole area of security, gun running detection and so on. Recently a ship was found running guns. The amount of ammunition and weaponary being used not just in Northern Ireland, but as it was used yesterday in my constituency to shoot the legs of three or four individuals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This satellite could be used in the interests of State security as well as for weather forecasting, fishing and agriculture.  We should not have any difficulty about extending our involvement in that regard.</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for the council of this new agency to appoint a director.  It seems to me that when such positions become available in Europe through whatever agency the Irish have not their hat in the ring for the top jobs.  We have trained personnel here who would be quite capable of taking up the position of director in this new agency, and I hope that we are not going to be offered third, fourth, or fifth secretary status in this agency.  We are at present playing a role in the Council of Ministers and a prestigious role in Europe generally.  We should be pressing for the directorship of this agency for an Irishman or Irishwoman. I hope the Minister will bear that in mind and will not allow the bone to go elsewhere too easily.  In the past we have taken a back seat in other agencies.  We should seek a specific role in this, particularly as an island State where weather forecasting and the other areas I have mentioned are so important.</P>

I made efforts over the last few weeks when this was first placed on the Order Paper to make contact with our Library <Col N="2209" /> here in the House and with the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, but to date I have not received the convention document.  Today I received an outline document which is very vague, a mere one-page document in relation to this very important convention. Is there something sinister behind the fact that we as an Opposition party have not been acquainted fully with the details of this convention?  Some 12 months ago we entered into a convention with the EUTELSAT operation, the establishment of the European Telecommunications Satellite Organisation which received full and detailed examination here in this House, and I was provided with a full convention document before the matter was debated in this House.</P>

      <P>In the last fortnight, and I sought the information.  I was dealing with a car importation case, and I mentioned to the official there that I was seeking information on this convention and said that I would appreciate a copy of the document.  Also I was in touch with <Col N="2210" /> the Library.  Is a copy of this convention document at present in the Library?  Is this convention document laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Twelve months ago the convention document was laid before the House and I obtained a copy before I came into the House to debate on it.  We are joining another organisation called EUMETSAT and we have not got the convention document here to go through it in detail.</P>
      <P>There are quite a number of advantages in obtaining the services of a meteorological satellite and also possibly there are advantages in joining the European Meteorological Satellite Organisation. Instead of entering into another European organisation which has satellite potential we could have obtained the services on a fee basis and, I am sure, we could have obtained exactly the same information without entering into another convention.  It seems that we as a nation are entering on a regular basis into European organisations, and we have no guarantee that these organisations will not be used with some regard for military purposes.  I appeal to the Minister today to reassure this House that on our entry into this convention, which I presume Dáil Éireann will ratify, we will get a guaranteed statement in relation to that.</P>
      <P>We have now been handed a copy of the convention document and I thank the Minister for it, although it is at the eleventh hour.  I do not know whether the Minister is responsible for this.</P>

      <P>I am quite surprised that if my Department were asked for a copy they would not supply it.  It is possible that the Deputy's query to the Minister of State's office, as it was in association with a constituency matter, may not have been transmitted.  I do not <Col N="2211" /> know.  I will have to inquire into it, but I am quite sure that if the Library were to ask for a copy of this convention document there is no reason why that should not be supplied to the Library on request. The formal requirement to lodge the convention document does not arise until after it is ratified, but I would expect that if in anticipation of this motion Deputies had requested a copy from my Department either directly or by the Library, they should have been supplied with it.  I assure the Deputy that I will investigate thoroughly what he has said as I would be as concerned as he is that Deputies should receive full information to enable them to contribute in a matter as important as this.</P>

      <P>Yesterday Deputy Vincent Brady telephoned me at my home to inform me that this convention would be before the House today.  I was aware that the matter would be before us at some stage since it had been on the Order Paper for the past two to three weeks.  I inquired of the Minister for Communications whether he would be dealing with the issue, having regard to the communications element of it, but he informed me that another Minister would be dealing with it.  I do not wish to labour that point but it is relevant so far as the House is concerned.  I appreciate that the Minister who is also the Leader of the House would be the last person to try to deprive any Deputy, especially an Opposition Deputy, of the opportunity of participating in a more detailed way in this debate. However, we are at a handicap in the sense of not having had the opportunity <Col N="2212" /> of discussing the convention at a parliamentary party meeting.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn seeks an assurance also in relation to the military aspects of this satellite.  Any satellite has military potential because when in orbit it can be used for bouncing off communications signals. We should be well aware of the difficulties that could arise for us as a neutral nation in the context of the new satellites. That is why we should emphasise at all times our clear neutrality and especially when we enter into negotiations with other European members who are members of NATO.  We should emphasise that not only will we not use the new satellites for any military surveillance purposes but that we expect all other subscribers to this convention to behave in the same way in this respect.  It should be stated clearly by our representatives who are attending meetings of the organisation in question that in no circumstances can the question of military potential or military use be discussed in so far as the satellite is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Weather surveillance and forecasting is of vital importance to armies and military organisations.  It can be of enormous importance to have satellites that can supply long term and detailed forecasts of weather conditions throughout the globe. However, this is an aspect which concerns us.  We are anxious that when the Minister is replying he will state clearly the ideological position of the Government in relation to EUMETSAT.  I sought and obtained a similar guarantee when EUTELSAT was debated here in November 1983.  We have joined that organisation but one wonders why there is not a global organisation to deal with all satellite development in the area of communications and meteorological services. It seems to be very much a waste of resources and a duplication of purpose to have so many conventions in this area and so many organisations involved.  I note that only two of the 15 signatories have already ratified this convention. When is it anticipated that the remaining parliaments will ratify the convention?  I note, too, that within the terms of article 29.5 of the Constitution the convention <Col N="2213" /> must be approved by Dáil Éireann before the State can be bound by it.  We must note also other provisions which relate clearly to our neutrality.  Nothing can change our position in that regard other than a decision of this House but I should hope that the question of such a decision will never arise.  We must have a clear and unambiguous approach to our position of neutrality.</P>
    <P>So far as the use of these satellites is concerned perhaps we could have obtained agreement with the organisation to obtain for meteorological purposes the information we require without entering into another convention of this kind.  Consequently, I should like the Minister to outline the benefits of membership as opposed to being subscribers to the organisation.</P>
    <P>I consider the present system of weather forecasting by RTE to be inadequate. The process has not improved very much down through the years.  However, with the advent of the EUMETSAT and the additional information that will be made available on a very regular basis, with perhaps photographs being taken at 30 minute intervals, RTE should have a much more up-to-date approach to weather forecasting.  They should have a more up-market and professional approach so as to make the weather forecast section of the news much more interesting and more important.  There could be for instance, a direct studio broadcast from the headquarters of the meteorological services instead of the present instudio approach.</P>
    <P>I support strongly the views put forward by Deputy Flynn in relation to the availability of information by way of the new satellite and to having telephone services provided by Telefís Éireann to the meteorological services at a special rate thereby allowing people direct access to information regarding weather conditions. This sort of information can be invaluable to the farming community, to fishing interests and to many other interests, including the building trade.  From my experience I am aware that access to such information could save this country countless millions of pounds especially in <Col N="2214" /> respect of crops which could be harvested before the advance of winds or storms. In addition, from a social point of view it would be of immense benefit to organisations to be able to obtain detailed information on weather prospects.  Also, RTE should bring in the CEEFAX system which is now available in TV organisations in Britian.  By the use of this procedure, up-to-date information and weather forecasting could be made available to the general public on a regular basis.  It is a simple and straightforward procedure but RTE are lagging behind other organisations in making these facilities available.  I recommend that with the advent of the EUMETSAT satellites they would have far more detailed information on a regular and consistent basis.

We are entering into an exciting era in relation to satellite communication generally. It is better to be in there and have a say.  We could have associate membership but if I was in the Minister's position, on balance, I would probably support full membership and ratify the convention.</P>
      <P>We support this because we will be involved in direct satellite broadcasting in the next two or three years.  That is an area which is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications.  We will have a lot to say about it in the months ahead.  We will have direct control of satellites.  There is the El Dorado of the future and an area where we can create many jobs.</P>

      <P>As far as the finality of the full operation of the convention following ratification is concerned which is what we are putting ourselves in a position to do, that has not been completed. There is no significance in the fact that only two countries have ratified it so far.  As I understand it, all countries are proceeding to ratify it and there is no problem in any country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the use of the information, it will be received in real time directly in the countries concerned.  The information does not have to be intermediated through any central organisation.  There is no way in which we can be prevented from getting information which any other country gets.  This arrangement will strengthen our independence as a country in overall terms in the sense that without this organisation we would be depending on the USSR or America.  If, as is the case in America at present, the system <Col N="2216" /> was being privatised and if in the financial dispute over privatisation the system ceased we would have no system.  As long as we have a European system we are proof against such a situation where for reasons outside our responsibility we could be cut off.</P>
    <P>I endorse what Deputy Daly said that it is better to be in this organisation than to be outside it.  The system is designed for the peaceful use of meteorology and satellites.  It is not designed for other purposes.  I understand that specifically militarily designed satellites would not be moving in this orbit.  They would tend to move in a lower or higher orbit and would move over countries rather than remain geostationary.  Once the information is received in a country there is no control over what use will be made of it.  It comes directly into the country concerned.  If information is broadcast within the country on the weather predictions, no one can say that the Army will not get that information, or that farmers will not get it.  Anyone who wants it can get it.  One cannot guarantee that the information will not be used for military purposes.  As Deputy Mitchell said, it is in our interests to use it, if it is appropriate, for any purpose it may serve in the defence of the country.  However, it is not designed for such purposes and the situations in which it might be used for such purposes will not be that significant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn asked a number of detailed questions.  As regards the telephone service into the meteorological service here, I understand the office already have a special service where in addition to being able to ring them during working hours they have an answering service whereby one can ring for forecasts through the weekend.  I will convey Deputy Flynn's views that this service be enhanced and improved in the light of the more sophisticated information that will be available.  We have the facilities and the technical personnel to make full use of any information we will receive. What is involved is a metal dish which is <i>in situ</i> on the top of the headquarters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have no specific responsibility for them but I understand that while they were available they were not of great significance as the ships were on the other side of the globe where the impact of local conditions on Irish weather was limited.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn asked about the limit to our contribution.  It is limited in cash terms to £25,000 in the annex to the convention. There would have to be renegotiation if that was to be raised.  It is not a percentage figure but a cash limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Salmon, Eel and Oyster Fishing Licences (Alteration of Licence Duties) Order, 1984,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 3rd day of December, 1984.</P>
      <P>Under sections 68 and 279 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, as amended, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is empowered to make an order altering salmon, eel and oyster fishing licences.  The order may not be made, however, until a resolution approving the draft order has been passed by Dáil Éireann and by Seanad Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Salmon, eel and oyster fishing licence duties were last increased with effect from 1 January 1983.  I am satisfied that a further increase in fishing licence duties is warranted in the light of the rate of <Col N="2219" /> inflation in the meantime.  On that basis an increase of 20 per cent in the fees would have been justified but bearing in mind the reduced level of catches of salmon this year I am restricting the increase in fishing licence duties to 15 per cent, to take effect from 1 January 1985.</P>
    <P>Income from fishing licence duties this year will amount to £280,000 approximately. The increase in these duties, which I have provided for in the draft order, will generate £40,000 approximately in additional revenue in 1985.  While some fishermen may feel aggrieved at having to pay more for their fishing licences next year I would ask them to bear in mind that the Exchequer is providing more than £5 million towards the cost of inland fisheries development for 1985.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend to the House that a resolution be passed approving the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister did not avail of this opportunity to give us an outline of his general policy in relation to the whole inland fisheries industry.  We are opposed to the increase in duties first of all because we believe it is not desirable at present to impose increases on fishermen in view of the state of the country in general.  It is inappropriate also because catches of salmon and trout were so bad this year that this additional imposition on licensed anglers, particularly salmon fishermen, will drive many of them out of the industry.</P>
      <P>There are genuine fears among responsible angling associations and fishermen that our salmon inland fisheries are in a seriously declining state and that this extra burden will result in many licensed anglers refusing to take out licences.  That will mean a fall-off in the numbers of applications for licences.  Therefore, I do not think the Minister will get the extra £40,000 he expects from this imposition. Anyway, everybody knows that £40,000 will not go anywhere when divided among the fishery boards throughout the country which are in very bad financial circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to increase the subvention <Col N="2220" /> to the boards immediately to enable them to carry out their statutory responsibilities in relation to enforcement of the fishery laws and to help them with the development part of their work under the new Fisheries (Consolidation) Act.  Development work on our inland fisheries is at a standstill.  It should be starting with the central board and involving the regional boards but they do not have the finances to deal with necessary development work.</P>
    <P>As I said, this new imposition will undermine the confidence of genuine anglers who have been having a very bad time, yet it will not in any way curtail the activities of illegal operators who have had such a damaging influence on our fisheries in the past number of years.  We need direct cash grants for the central board and the regional boards to help them to tackle the widespread illegal activities on our rivers and lakes.  Instead, what we get here is an order that will penalise genuine fishermen without curtailing the activities of those illegal operators who have been the scourge of our inland fisheries industry in recent years. The regional boards are able to provide only skeleton staffs for fishery protection. The waterkeepers are almost totally immobilised because they have not got the resources to fund the equipment which is so essential in the fight against illegal fishing activities.</P>
    <P>The fishery protection staff are not as effective as they should be, or as they want to be.  Many of them express the view openly that they are merely ticking over.  No pressure is being put on them by the regional boards because the boards themselves have not got the finance to carry on their own activities.  At Question Time a few days ago I said there was a crisis in some of the boards.  I asked the Minister to check the reports that some boards were unable to have regular meetings because they did not have the finance to meet the expense involved.  This is very serious and it should be rectified.</P>
    <P>Doubts have been cast on our pollution controls, especially during last summer. There is fairly widespread evidence that during last summer there was a significant <Col N="2221" /> increase in the number of fish kills.  The fish kills detected in 1983 were in the region of 109 or 110.  For the year up to September 1984 the figure was almost 107 or 108, probably more.  It is more than likely that a substantial number of fish kills which were not detected went unreported. This is very serious at a time when we must have strict controls on pollution.  During the summertime some of our more valuable fisheries are under threat on an almost daily basis because of certain activities we have spoken about here before and which I do not want to go into now.  We need vigilance and constant monitoring of our inland fisheries. The staffs of the regional boards cannot provide that monitoring because of the financial curtailments.</P>
    <P>I have spoken here before about the general dissatisfaction on the part of the staffs of the boards.  We had an unnecessary dispute which hampered development for quite a while in the regional board areas.  That has been resolved, but now the central board staff are dissatisfied because of the regionalisation scheme of the central board.  This may result in further industrial action.  I do not wish to say anything which might complicate that position.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to try to prevent further industrial action in the new year.  This would be a most undesirable development. It could involve the central board staff and complicate the delicate negotiations which were worked out with the regional board staff.  It might involve difficulties for the central board staff and spread into the regional board areas. We would all wish to see that avoided.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is limited in the extent to which he can play a role, but he has a very useful role to play in avoiding that problem.  Quick action might prevent that development in 1985.  I regret that we will have to oppose this motion. We see it as a very minor effort to deal with the finances of the regional boards. It will not help to resolve their problems and it may well alienate some of the most staunch supporters of the conservation people and the boards.  There is an urgent <Col N="2222" /> necessity for the Government to provide additional funds for the regional fishery boards and the Central Fishery Board to enable them to undertake their development responsibilities which have been clearly defined for them.  The way things are developing, there is no prospect of anything being done in 1985.</P>
    <P>Here we have a fantastic national resources which could be developed at very little expense to the State.  At a conservative estimate it could provide revenue of £20 million a year.  If we were to value the whole inland fisheries we would see that we have a very valuable national resource which is relatively unexploited.  There is no major development there and very little is being done because of financial constraints.  The central board and the regional boards are operating under difficulties.</P>
    <P>I want to impress upon the Minister the need to provide some funds in 1985 for the acquisition of some of our well known national fisheries.  The Minister will be aware that a time of stringent financial controls in the Department, it was possible to purchase the Erriff fishery which was a remarkable success.  The Galway fisheries have also been a remarkable success.  There is evidence that, when the central board are given the back-up to do the job, they are capable of doing it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the staffs of the boards on the work they are doing in spite of the handicaps they are suffering.  The Minister has an obligation to provide a proper funding system for them instead of this piecemeal proposal we have this evening. It will not do anything for the development of our inland fisheries which are crying out for development.  We will have to oppose the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague I will have to oppose the increase in the licence fees, despite the fact that on the surface it appears to be a modest increase of 15 per cent.  The increase should be in the same ratio as the increase in the price of salmon and the overall income of the fishermen over the past few years.  The drift net licence fee is being increased <Col N="2223" /> from £115 to £132.  While £17 may not seem to be very much, we must remember that over the past few years there has been a reduction in the price of fish, not because of a fall in the stock of fish or the landings of fish, with the result that the fishermen's net income is very well down on what it was in previous years.  We have to take into consideration the price of oil, diesel, gear, provisions, the maintenance of the boats and repayments to BIM or the banks.  All these factors must be taken into consideration.  The increase is 15 per cent this year.  This represents an increase of £17 on the licence which is most used in my area.  In Donegal there are 192 licences.  If we have a <i>pro rata</i> increase over the years it will not be long until they are talking about £400 or £500 and only the rich, and not the poor sections I represent, will be able to purchase salmon licences.  In the case of the regional fisheries board it would amount to an increase of between £5,000 and £6,000, which is very little when compared with the £5 million proposed to be expended on inland fisheries this year. However, the expenditure of at least that £5,000 or £6,000 would ensure that meetings could be held, because it is my information that throughout the country many meetings of regional boards cannot be held through lack of finance.</P>

      <P>I should have thought that the Minister might have availed of this opportunity to dwell longer on salmon in relation to which many contentious issues, on which he and I would not be at one, could have been discussed. I should have thought he would have availed of this opportunity to refer to the necessity for salmon fishing in daylight because of the number of large trawlers operating up and down the west coast. Even if only from a safety point of view daylight fishing should be reverted to. By so doing there would also be greater awareness of the numbers of fish taken each year, by which method we could <Col N="2224" /> ensure also that our fisheries stocks would be sustained.  At present we do not have any accurate record of our stocks of existing fish or of the numbers taken out. Nobody can tell us that there are X number fished annually, which number could be curtailed thus ensuring that our stocks are maintained.</P>
      <P>If not this evening perhaps on another occasion the Minister would deal with that matter.  I could substantiate my reasons for advocating a reversion to daylight fishing but time will not permit.  In that way we could be absolutely certain of the full co-operation of fishermen, which I would be the first to admit can be difficult to obtain on occasion.  A reversion to daylight fishing would ensure their 99 per cent co-operation.  Because of the difficulties encountered along the west coast in recent years fishemen are now prepared to co-operate to the full with officials of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and Defence.  These fishermen are quite happy to fish a five day week, ensuring that fishing would commence in daylight with their coming back ashore on a Friday evening, at the latest by 6 o'clock.  I would not here defend any fishermen caught fishing after 6 o'clock on a Friday evening or before 6 o'clock on a Monday evening.  That is how I feel about it and I know that is how all the fishermen regard the matter also. In recent years none of them feels happy going out through fear for their lives, not from anything malicious, but because of the prospective accidents at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might make officials of his Department available to continue the discussions initiated some years ago between the various interested groups.  I was pleased to note that at the beginning of last year the small fishermen &mdash; never before under any umbrella &mdash; came under that of the NFO.  Indeed I must compliment the NFO on the case they made on behalf of those fishermen.  Unfortunately none of their recommendations was taken into consideration and it would appear that rather than taking a step forward we have taken a retrograde step. With the next season not commencing until June there is ample time in which <Col N="2225" /> to pursue those discussions.  I believe fully that even if some of the NFO recommendations were implemented they would be to the benefit of the fishermen and the industry as a whole.  We should remember that we are not here talking merely about the eighties, but about years to come and we must act responsibly.  I would say to officials in the Department that it would appear that generally we are not prepared to look at any changes at all.  It would appear that we continue to live with an antiquated system that has obtained for many years.  Regardless of whichever Minister is in office, until such time as his officials are prepared to sit down and talk with the fishermen, come out and see exactly what is taking place along our coasts &mdash; I do appreciate that they do so periodically &mdash; and realise that the fisherman is prepared to co-operate fully with them many of the problems will not be resolved.  I know that one fisherman of whom I am aware caught only eight fish in the last season &mdash; this was because of fear of going to sea &mdash; at the end of which he had a loss.</P>
    <P>Since 1980 the number of licences issued in the Donegal and northern region has been reduced by approximately 50.  Who decides who is to receive a licence and who is not?  There are many small, traditional island fishermen who do not possess any licence at all.  The House will appreciate that they have no option but to go out and endeavour to make a livelihood for their families through fishing.  Special consideration should be given them.  The Minister will be fully briefed on their problems.  This is another factor which could be taken into consideration in regard to the issue of such licences.  I would recommend that the Minister speak to the fishery boards. I know that the regional fisheries board see no justification &mdash; and have gone public on this &mdash; for a reduction in the number of licences issued, particularly to the traditional small fishermen.</P>
    <P>As far as drift net licences are concerned there is a discrepancy in regard to the west coast and Lough Swilly, the same charge being imposed for Lough Swilly while its fishermen would not have <Col N="2226" /> the same scope as their counterparts along the west or north-west coast.  Perhaps the Minister would consider a lesser figure for the Lough Swilly licence than that for the west or north-west coast.</P>
    <P>All of us appreciate the tremendous work undertaken stocking our rivers by local organisations.  With the greatest respect to the fishery boards concerned and those people responsible for stocking our rivers, I would say that were it not for local anglers' organisations the industry would be a lot poorer.  Greater grant aid should be available to them in this work. The Minister will accept that their work is of vital importance and that they do it for absolutely no reward.  Surely out of an expenditure of £5 million on the part of the State and income from licences of something in the region of £280,000, a small percentage &mdash; if only 1 per cent &mdash; made available to such local organisations, would constitute money well spent.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that there is careful monitoring of pollution in our rivers. In Donegal last year there was an over-spill of slurry into the rivers there.  That could happen in any part of the country and we must be extremely careful or it could mean an end to our river fishing stocks.</P>

      <P>I referred earlier to an indication of our existing stocks.  Perhaps it would be possible for the Minister to give us now or at some later date an indication of the stocks obtaining, the amount of salmon we should take out each year whether by way of drift net, draft net or the various other methods, the bag net, snap net, the loop net or any other.  We should have some definite indication of the amount of salmon which can be fished each year thus ensuring that this area of fisheries is maintained.  Otherwise a hit and miss situation will obtain.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to immediately take the necessary steps to ensure that no loss of income from social welfare payments will be suffered by any family as a result of the proposed implementation of the EEC Equality Directive.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise clearly the commitment of Fianna Fáil to the principles of the concept of equality for men and women.  As a party we have consistently stated that we are totally opposed to discrimination in any form against women.  It did not need the women's liberation movement in any shape or form to extract from our party that principle of equality.  When the party was founded in 1927 it can be verified that on the committee of 15 people chosen to spearhead the political drive and impetus of this great national movement known as Fianna Fáil there were six women. This is a remarkable example of how this party even in its infancy recognised and implemented the principle of equality and the equal rights of women to participate fully and wholly in the affairs of the nation.  We have continued to recognise and observe that principle ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognise and accept that discrimination between men and women in social security systems is widespread. This obviously stems from the traditional image of the family which sees the father as the bread winner and the mother as the homemaker.  This results in unfair treatment of women, especially those with dependants.  This form of discrimination must be abolished.  We totally support its abolition.  Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome states that equal pay means not only equal wages or salaries <Col N="2228" /> but also equality for any other consideration whether in cash or in kind which the worker receives directly or indirectly in respect of his employment from his employer.</P>
    <P>In December 1978 the Council of Ministers adopted a directive ordering the gradual application of equal treatment for men and women in social security systems.  I repeat that this was to be a gradual application.  One could infer from the amendment put down by the Minister that this directive was to be implemented right away.  It was to be implemented gradually from 19 December 1978 and to be completed in each of the member states by 19 December 1984.  By that date all member states must abolish discrimination in statutory social security schemes covering illness, invalidity, old age, accidents at work, occupational diseases, unemployment and family allowances.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that since equality legislation is imminent and since we have a statutory obligation to comply with this directive we could all welcome its implications, knowing that the equal rights of women would be ensured in social security schemes.  Several attempts have been made by me as spokesman on social welfare and by other members of our party to extract information from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Welfare as to when the legislation would be introduced and as to the safeguards to be written into it to ensure that no family on social welfare payments of any kind would lose any moneys from these payments as a result of the implementation of the directive.  The only information relayed to us was that it would be produced &ldquo;very soon&rdquo; or &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.  With just one week left before the final date for implementing the directive we are still without legislation.  The Minister states that the legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation.  However, despite all the pleas from us, the Government and the Minister have said and done nothing to allay the worries and fears of the many thousands of families on social welfare payments who are convinced that a Government as miserable and unscrupulous as this will avail of the opportunity <Col N="2229" /> when implementing the directive of ensuring that substantial and very serious losses will be suffered by many families dependent on social welfare payments for a meagre existence.</P>
    <P>Are the Government and the Minister waiting to do another weekend job when the Dáil is closed before issuing an unpopular announcement?  Unfortunately this is the pattern they have followed. They wait until the weekend to deliver the bad news so that we are absent from here.  It looks as if it is their intention to take another stealthy, furtive action. Like thieves in the night they do their nasty work.  This is not the sort of social justice one should expect from any Government but it would be par for the course for this Government.  This has been their consistent style.  It is about the only thing on which they have been consistent.  They have consistently ensured that the living standards, particularly of the less well off, have been worsened.  For some reason beyond any comprehension this Government appear to be deliberately availing of the opportunity being given through the implementation of this EC directive further to reduce the incomes of working-class families.</P>
    <P>While there has been a demand over many years from trade unions and other organisations for equality of social welfare treatment for both men and women, there is a widespread belief now that because of the manner in which the Government propose to implement the directive, families already on low incomes will have these further reduced.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to state categorically here in this House whether this is so and to spell out clearly what the Government will do to ensure that families will not suffer any loss of income as a result of the implementation of the directive.  Is it a fact that when the changes are implemented very shortly an unemployed man will no longer be able to claim the adult dependant allowance for his wife, if she is working, and if so what does the Minister propose to do so as to redress that situation?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2230" /> It has been alleged, and I have seen no contradiction of it, that under the Minister's proposals, families where the husband is unemployed and the wife is working, either whole time or part time, will not only lose the adult dependancy allowance but 50 per cent of any child dependant allowance, which will result in a severe loss of income for that family.</P>
    <P>In Heaven's name, how can a family already on a very low income, particularly when women's earnings are already so low &mdash; on average they are two-thirds of men's earnings in industry &mdash; bear such an added burden of this kind?  I hope the Minister recognises that there is widespread confusion, uncertainty and anxiety among such families at present and it is time that the Minister spelt out clearly what their position will be when these changes are brought in.  Bad as the situation of these families now is, it seems as if their position will be infinitely worse when these changes are implemented.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that there is this fear, worry and concern amongst people because the Government have consistently assailed and attacked the rights of the less well-off sections of our community since they came to office.  They have consistently made every attempt that they could to ensure that those who are unemployed or sick got no extra support from the State to help to maintain their meagre incomes; that is the only thing that they have been consistent on.  The decision of the Coalition Government announced on 24 October last by the Minister for Social Welfare specifically excluded unemployed persons and their dependants from the double social welfare payments for Christmas.  This was a mean and shabby decision.</P>
    <P>That decision is the latest in a series of similar assaults by the Government on an already low standard of living of the weakest section of our community, namely the unemployed and their families. Last year, but for the pressure exerted on the Government from this side of the House, there is no doubt that the Government would not have introduced the double payment at all.  What kind of Government is this which in their <Col N="2231" /> quest for cuts in public expenditure decide to achieve that objective at the expense of the unemployed, their families and those who are sick?</P>
    <P>The reduction in subsidies on bread, butter and milk, announced last August, was a savage blow, not only to every category of social welfare beneficiary, but to the many thousands of others on low wages who already were finding it impossible to make ends meet from week to week.  Not so long ago we had the so-called national plan of unreality, one of the highlights of which is the commitment to the total abolition of food subsidies by 1986 with short term social welfare benefits, such as sickness benefit, to be taxed as income.  What appalling prospects face those who are unfortunate to be on social welfare in the future.</P>
    <P>Adding insult to injury is the proposed child benefit scheme with a mounting tax claw back for families on an income tax rate of upwards of 45 per cent.  Nobody would be greatly surprised if this latest contemptible decision was made by a Fine Gael Minister for Social Welfare in a Fine Gael Government.  But here we have the horrific spectacle of a Labour Minister for Social Welfare, within the Cabinet, doing Fine Gael's dirty work for them, while at the same time, pretending to protect the interests of workers and their families.  This is gross hyprocisy.  It is something that he as Minister should not be proud of.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition were seeking a Minister for Health and Social Welfare, they had a very easy conversion to economic &ldquo;Scroogery&rdquo; when they chose the Minister.  He is the classical archetype of political hypocrisy.  He has divested himself of any so-called political socialistic principles which he may have had &mdash; I wonder if they ever existed &mdash; to join the Mercs and perks brigade.  There are shock-waves spreading throughout the community as the implications of this directive become clear.  Many families are bitterly worried at what severe hardships will be brought to them as a result of the implementation of the directive <Col N="2232" /> without safeguards being introduced.</P>
    <P>What are the Minister and the Government, going to do about the adult dependant allowances?  I hope he tells us.  At present since most married women are automatically assumed to be dependent on their husbands the latter automatically receive allowances in respect of them on top of their own personal social welfare payments.  Are adult dependants' allowances to be discontinued where the partners are in the labour force?  For example, if they are working, ill or unemployed will the allowance be removed? This means that where a husband is on social welfare payments but his wife is either in paid employment or on social welfare herself, the adult dependant allowance currently received in respect of her will be lost, a loss which could vary between £21 and £36 per week.</P>
    <P>The other area of concern relates to the child dependant allowances.  Again, the discrimination against women stems from the assumption that the male parent is always the breadwinner unless he is physically or mentally incapable of performing this role.</P>
    <P>Children are, therefore, dependants of their father and should he be ill, unemployed or retired he will receive allowances in respect of them irrespective of their mother's financial position.  In future, however, this will not be so.  If the mother is in the labour force herself, each parent will receive half the child dependant allowances, if or when they claim social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>There would be a reasonable <i>rationale</i> to this if one had the situation where women's earnings in general were equal to men, or where there was genuine equality of opportunity in the employment sphere, but as things stand women's average earnings in industry are still only two-thirds of men's earnings.  While there is in general a pretence that there is a genuine equality of opportunity for women in the employment sphere this is not fully and completely true.  If one takes the hypothetical situation which will probably become a factual reality very shortly, where the man is on a social welfare payment and the woman is <Col N="2233" /> employed it looks now as if these families will suffer major losses which will have catastrophic effects on their living standards. For example, where a man is on unemployment or disability benefit and currently receives allowances for his wife and four children, his social welfare income would amount approximately to £116 per week, assuming a pay-related payment within that.  If his wife brought home an income of £80 to £85 per week after tax, from her job, the total household income for that family of six persons would be approximately £200 per week, roughly the average male industrial earnings. It is hardly a huge amount for six people to survive on.</P>
    <P>The effect of the proposed changes, without the Minister adopting our suggestion, would be to reduce this family's income by approximately £42 per week. In other words, the income of this family would be reduced from £200 down to between £155 and £160 per week.  Where both partners are on social welfare the losses will not be as great.  However, since such families are wholly dependent on social welfare and therefore have a low level of income in absolute terms, any reduction, no matter how small, could well be the straw that would break the camel's back.</P>
    <P>These are the facts that are causing so much worry throughout the community at present.  While the unfortunate people who are on social welfare payments worry and wonder what is going to happen, this Minister and his Government for some reason have left it to the very last minute before they announce what legislation they have in mind.</P>
    <P>There is a growing fear that in 1985 many of society's families on the lowest incomes will lose between £20 and £40 per week out of their social welfare payments. What an appalling travesty of social justice this will be should it happen. Why have the present Minister and his Government decided to specifically single out the unemployed for very special discriminatory action, action which is not to their benefit but which will have markedly deleterious effects on their standards of living?  For example, <Col N="2234" /> halving the food subsidies has caused enormous problems to them and, despite the supposed relief that the family income supplement would provide, this Minister and his Government have specifically and selectively excluded the unemployed from availing of the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>One would think the unemployed were not entitled to any help or any decent standards of living.  It appears as if this Government and the Minister totally disregard the unemployed.  They regard them as not worth looking after.  Many of these unfortunate people, through no fault of their own are out of work, and would give their eyes for a job but the Government have not the policies to create jobs.  It is as if these people have been specifically chosen by this Minister and his Government for very definite anti-social policies.  It looks as if the Government do not regard this section of the community as having the rights even to basic simple living standards. What an inhuman, uncaring, despicable way to treat the unemployed of this country. The Minister and the Government should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    <P>This Government specifically excluded the unemployed from availing of the family income supplement.  They also specifically excluded the unemployed for the first time from obtaining the double benefit at Christmas.  We all know that at Christmas there are extra essentials to be got to ensure that the family, and particularly the children, have an enjoyable time in the festive season.  But this wretched Government and the Department presided over by this wretched Minister have decided to exclude the unemployed and the sick from the double payments.  Surely this in itself is one of the greatest indictments that one has of his failure to implement any form of social justice in his Department.  Again this year, the Minister specifically stated in the memorandum sent from his Department that the unemployed were not eligible for the free fuel scheme.  This was the first time that this was specifically referred to in the memorandum.  What a shame.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2235" /> If this Minister has any decency or any honesty or any bit of social conscience left he will do the honourable thing and resign, as Mrs. Thatcher said to certain people.  Even if he resigns it will be too late because thousands of people will have suffered as a result of his policies. Just two years ago, Deputy Desmond, now Minister for Social Welfare and his Labour Party colleagues, issued an election document called <i>Where Labour Stand,</i> and in it they said:</P>
    <P>The main parties propose massive cuts in public spending, falling especially on Health and Social Services and affecting the weakest in the community. Labour rejects utterly any policy that makes the poor, the unemployed, the sick, the homeless and the young bear the brunt of corrective measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very short memory. He has forgotten the commitments he gave in the past.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party Manifesto, November 1982, entitled <i>Where Labour Stand</i>.  Then we had the Fine Gael/Labour Programme for Government which said:</P>
      <P>Unemployment and disability benefits will be kept in line with take-home wages and salaries.  Expenditure on Social Benefits will be maintained in the light of inflation so that, even if a drop occurs in the immediate future in the purchasing power of better off groups in the community, the living standards of the section of the community dependent on Social Welfare payments will be maintained.  Additional help over and above the standard increases will be provided for especially disadvantaged groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The track record of this Government in the areas of social welfare and health, as in so many areas, is deplorable.  The loss to any family on social welfare payments of the adult dependant allowance is between £25 and £28 per week and the <Col N="2236" /> loss of half the child benefit allowance of between £9 and £10 per week will cause enormous hardships and will reduce the standards of living in these families to a new low.  It will ensure that little children will not have even enough to eat as a result of these cruel and inhuman policies.</P>
    <P>Have this Minister and his Government any concern for the principles of social justice?  Are they in touch with reality?  Do they know anything about how people live?  Have they any concern for poverty?  Do they realise that we have thousands of people in this country living below the poverty line?  And here they are shamefully and shoddily without any care going to take a further step to ensure that this economic deprivation is going to be increased further.  It is hard to believe that this Government used to once parade themselves as a Government of care and concern.  That myth, like so many others, has now been well and truly exploded.  This Government could not care less about the people.  They have no shame.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to help those on social welfare, especially the unemployed and those who recently lost their jobs.  Over a number of weeks we have been arguing a certain line with the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very concerned about social welfare recipients, the unemployed who are suffering the brunt of this ongoing recession.  I am not sure if it really is a recession or if it is part of life under this Coalition Government.  This is our last opportunity before the recess to have this very serious matter debated, although we do not have the full details of the proposed legislation.  We were told last week that we would have this legislation before Christmas but I assume that will not happen now.  I am no longer Whip and do not know the legislative programme, but I know that so many Bills landed in the Opposition Whip's office at 6 p.m. yesterday that we are not too sure just what business we have.  We have been told of legislation about which we knew nothing when we left this House <Col N="2237" /> last week.  Obviously this is relevant to the present legislation which will do away with certain social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>Because we do not know exactly what is in the Bill, we can only discuss what was in the directive and what has been said by a number of concerned people over the past few weeks.  We are asking the Government to take the necessary action to ensure that no loss of income will be suffered by any family on social welfare as a result of the implementation of the directive.  I gather from the Minister's amendment that the legislation which was almost ready last week would have been included in the Social Welfare (Amendment Bill) which will be taken tomorrow, but there has been a rethink about that.  My sources tell me that this directive was to have been part of the wet time amendment and the two-and-a-half day week, but it was not possible to do that.  I am not saying there is anything sinister in that, but it went the rounds of several Departments for a few weeks.</P>
    <P>I understand that this directive will move from what was originally set down. I know the Minister will say that the 1978 directive was adopted as a progressive measure in regard to equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security in 1978 and that Fianna Fáil did nothing about it.  It is well known that this country waits until the last minute to put EC directives into effect and we had an example last week in regard to the Protection of Employees Bill.  Different circumstances apply now and the economy is not as healthy as it was in 1978.</P>
    <P>The directive deals with three matters: the calculation of contributions and benefits, including increases due in respect of spouses and dependants; the conditions governing the duration and retention of entitlements of benefits; and the scope of social security schemes and the conditions of access to them.</P>
    <P>We noted in October 1984 that the Minister was going to bring in this directive. According to the national plan, he said that legislation to implement the directive on equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security would be introduced shortly and that married <Col N="2238" /> women would be eligible for the full rates of benefit for the normal 390 days and would be eligible for unemployment assistance subject to the means test which applies generally.  However, if the Minister follows the directive, the impact of the proposals will be very serious.  For instance, married women on disability benefit will receive an increase of £4.50 per week under the directive, an increase in the maximum personal rate from £32.75 to £37.25.  Married women on unemployment benefit will be eligible for 65 weeks instead of 52 weeks.  Married men whose wives work or claim unemployment or disability benefit, will lose the adult dependant allowance, which ranges from £21.05 to £36.00 depending on their social welfare status.  Married men on social welfare whose wives work or claim unemployment or disability benefit, will lose 50 per cent of the child dependant allowance.  The total child dependant allowance will be unaltered if the wife is claiming benefits.</P>
    <P>The loss of the adult dependant allowance for a woman who is either working or claiming benefit and the loss of 50 per cent of the child dependant allowance to the head of the household where the woman is working will have a very severe effect.  I know the Minister made harsh decisions recently and it is obvious he is bearing the brunt for the Minister for Education who does not have to implement cuts in the same way.  Having regard to the speeches made by the Minister when in Opposition it is hard to see how he could enact this draconian legislation. Will he say how this directive is to be implemented?</P>
    <P>The net loss for a householder with six children, for a man on unemployment assistance whose wife is working will be £48.60 per week.  Where the woman claims benefit the net loss will range from £16.55 to £13.50.  These families are already suffering from the removal of food subsidies and are not able to claim the family income supplement.  They have also suffered as a result of increases in the medical card and free drugs limits. All these cuts are directed at people who are unemployed and who suffer most. <Col N="2239" /> The scheme to be introduced for 10,000 unemployed young people will not benefit the families which this directive is aimed at because it refers only to people who are single and who have been unemployed for 12 months.  The gains under these proposals will accrue to households where the man is working and the woman is claiming benefit.  However, the gain in such cases is a measly £4.50 as against the loss of sums from £16 to £30.  Where the man is working the woman may establish an entitlement to unemployment assistance, but under the present means test most women will fail to establish such an entitlement if their husbands are earning even a small amount.  Where a man is in receipt of social welfare and a woman establishes her claim to unemployment assistance, there will be a net gain of between 10p and £7.25.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clearly state what he is going to do.  I hope he will not follow the terms of the directive.  He has already tried to commit political suicide about six times in the last six months and he will not do so again.  He now has the image of being a ruthless and hard man &mdash; even more ruthless than the Minister for Finance, and that is saying something.  If the Minister follows the directive he will be betraying his political ideologies of two years ago.  To take up to £30 from people who are on long term unemployment or disability benefit would be inhuman.  The Minister has a glorious opportunity to issue a positive statement to the people who are suffering so much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that the EEC Directive on equality of treatment for men and women in matters of social security came into effect on 19 December 1978 when the Fianna Fáil party was in Government, that no real effort was made by that Government during its terms of office to implement the Directive and further notes <Col N="2240" /> that the present Government has legislative proposals at an advanced stage for the implementation of the Directive in a fair and equitable manner and which will involve substantial net additional social welfare expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From recent media coverage and inquiries received in my office, it is apparent that many of those who had been pressing over the years for the early implementation of the directive never bothered to examine what exactly would be involved in the application of the concept of equal treatment in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Now that in recent months it has been brought to their attention that some losses as well as very many gains are inevitably involved, they have reacted by attempting to give the totally false impression that the Government are going about the implementation of the directive in an unfair way or as a cost-cutting exercise.  They have concentrated totally on highlighting cases where losses will occur and have ignored the fact that well over 40,000 women will gain, in some cases very substantial sums, on implementation of the directive and that access for women to the social welfare system will be totally equalised, a move which constitutes the most radical reform of the system since its inception.  They totally ignore the fact that the Government have set aside over £17 million in a full year to pay for the net additional costs which will arise for the social welfare system when the full package is in operation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I welcome the debate we are now having for the opportunity it provides to clarify for many people the true and balanced position on the equality of treatment issue.  I had hoped, indeed planned, to have such a debate before Christmas on the Bill to grant equality of treatment.  Regrettably, because of a delay in preparing the necessary Bill, which admittedly is extremely complex, we will not have that opportunity until the next session in January.  I am very glad to be able to say, however, that the Government have today approved <Col N="2241" /> the text of the Bill.  It is being printed with all urgency and I hope to present it to the House and circulate it to Deputies before the Dáil rises for the Christmas recess on Friday next.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are now attempting to make political capital out of the situation. As I will demonstrate later on in my speech, they are in no position to do so, least of all the Leader of the Opposition in view of what he entered into the minutes of the Council Meetings when he issued direction as to how the directive should be implemented when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  Before going on to more contentious matters I should first like to outline for Deputies exactly what aspects of our social welfare code are comprehended by the directive.</P>
    <P>EEC Directive 79/7/EEC was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 19 December 1978, when the present Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Social Welfare.  It provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment as between men and women in matters of social security.  The directive relates to statutory schemes providing protection against sickness, invalidity, old age, unemployment and accidents at work and occupational diseases.  It does not apply to survivors' benefits nor to children's allowances.</P>
    <P>The areas of our social welfare code which are discriminatory by reference to the directive relate to the entitlement of married women.  Married women who are dependent on their husbands &mdash; and in our present system any married woman living with her husband is regarded as dependent &mdash; receive lower rates of benefit than other categories in the schemes of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefit.  In the case of disability benefit, for example, a married woman recives £32.75 per week as against a standard payment of £37.25 per week.  Furthermore in the case of unemployment benefit, such married woman can receive benefit for a maximum duration of 312 days only as against 390 days generally.  In relation to unemployment assistance, married women are effectively <Col N="2242" /> debarred from the scheme except where their husbands are invalided or where they are separated from and not dependent on their husbands.  The final area of discrimination &mdash; and this is by far the most complex area &mdash; relates to increases for adult and child dependants. Married women have conditions applied to them which, in effect, mean that they can rarely qualify for such increases, whereas married men at present get adult dependant increases for their wives even if their wives are in employment or themselves receiving a social welfare benefit in their own right.</P>
    <P>The Government have now approved the necessary measures to eliminate these discriminatory features and the Bill to give effect to them, as I have said, will be in the hands of Deputies within the next few days.  Obviously this means that the provisions of the directive cannot now be implemented by the 22nd of this month which was the deadline set out in the directive for full implementation. Lest there be any confusion on the point, I have no intention whatsoever of bringing in any changes in this area until the legislation I will be bringing before the Dáil is enacted by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The enforced delay will give Deputies the opportunity of examining the proposals to enable a full, frank and, I hope, balanced debate during the next session on this most wide-ranging reform of the social welfare system which will cost £17 million.</P>
    <P>Clearly I am not happy that the EC deadline will not be observed. During my two years in office &mdash; only a third of the total time provided for implementing equal treatment &mdash; the issues were clearly faced by me and the extremely complex task of drafting the legislation was given very high priority. Sweet nothing was done by my predecessors in this regard.  If earlier Ministers had done likewise an orderly phased implementation of remedial measures could have been effected within the time-scale envisaged in the directive and without the difficulties we now face in implementing the directive.  Now we get <Col N="2243" /> crocodile tears from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The proposals which have been approved by the Government will provide equal treatment in accordance with the terms of the directive in a balanced and equitable manner as far as I can manage and within the limitations of the money available at this stage.</P>
    <P>First, married women will be given the same rates of benefit as other categories. As a result, about 40,000 married women will receive increases in their weekly entitlements.  The vast majority would be on disability or unemployment benefit and these would, quite apart from the effects of the other proposals I will outline enabling them to qualify for increases for dependants, result in increases of the order of £4 to £5 per week for them.  In relation to unemployment benefit, it is proposed that married women will be paid benefit for the same maximum duration of 390 days as other beneficiaries, a measure which will extend the maximum duration of their entitlement by three months.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it is clear that married women must be given entitlement to apply for unemployment assistance in the same way as other unemployed people who are capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment.  The scheme is means-tested and, in common with all the other assistance schemes, the means of the applicant's spouse are taken into account in determining entitlement.  This amendment of the code will complete the removal of the discrimination that exists and give married women workers exactly the same entitlements as other unemployed workers.</P>
    <P>However, the most complex area in regard to equality of treatment is that relating to increases in respect of dependants. It is the area in which much of the media comment has failed to give proper weight to the need to remove a gross anomaly in the existing conditions which favours men, and to the impossibility of granting equal treatment by extending the same anomaly, which is unique in Europe, to women.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2244" /> The general framework of social welfare schemes has been in existence for a long time and the underlying concept is unfortunately that the husband is the breadwinner and head of the household and the person to whom the increases of benefit in respect of his wife and children should be paid.  This is paid only to the man, the breadwinner as he is classified, in our conservative society.  Any married women living with her husband is at present regarded as his dependant and any children are also regarded as his dependants whether or not the wife is working and contributing to their support. Only where the husband is incapable of self-support through mental or physical infirmity can his wife claim him as her dependant if she herself has a personal entitlement to a social welfare benefit.  This approach was undoubtedly regarded as relevant at a time when it was exceptional for a married woman to take up employment outside the home but this is no longer the case.  In present circumstances it results in many thousands of married men being paid adult dependant allowances in respect of wives who are either in employment or receiving a social welfare payment in their own right on the basis of an insurance record built up when in employment.</P>
    <P>Clearly equal treatment could not result in the present over-generous dependency conditions for male claimants being applied across the board to women also.  To do so would mean, for example, in the case of a married couple where both are absent from work due to illness that each would have a separate entitlement to disability benefit with increases for each other and for any child dependants.  Even more ludicrously, it would enable a wife claiming disability benefit, for instance, to get an adult dependant increase in respect of her husband and child dependant increased to boot, even though he was in employment earning a substantial salary sufficient to support the whole family in relative comfort &mdash; and it is all relative &mdash; on his own.</P>
    <P>It is of fundamental importance for the entire discussion of this element of the equal treatment package to understand <Col N="2245" /> that the existing criteria governing the payment of adult dependant increases discriminate not only against women but also against single income families, who are treated less favourably in this area than families with more than one source of income.  To simply extend the present conditions which men enjoy to women would mean that a wasteful and inequitable payment of adult dependant increases across the board on the other side would be expanded and would, indeed, reach gigantic proportions.  That is the problem I face.  To apply equal treatment on those lines would cost at least £100 million to implement.  No Minister for Social Welfare could justify the allocation of very scarce resources to such an approach.</P>
    <P>In implementing the directive it is absolutely essential, therefore, to apply genuine and uniform criteria of dependency in all cases.  That is why the Government have decided that in future adult dependant increases should be payable only in respect of spouses who are wholly or mainly maintained by beneficiaries. In principle, a spouse who is in employment, or is self-employed, or who is himself or herself a social welfare beneficiary, in his or her own right will not in future be regarded as an adult dependant. That is the crucial issue of general principle on this question.</P>
    <P>In relation to increases for dependant children, where one spouse is in the labour force, he or she will in future qualify for the full increases for children and where both spouses are in the labour force each will have an entitlement to 50 per cent of the appropriate increases when claiming benefit, an arrangement that will of course, benefit all married women.  This is important.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of these changes can be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where one only of a married couple is either in employment or claiming benefit, he or she when claiming benefit will be entitled to full rates of increases of benefit in respect of his or her spouse and children, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2246" /> (b)  where both are in employment or on benefit or one of each is in employment and on benefit, neither will be regarded as a dependant of the other.  Increases in respect of child dependants will be apportioned equally between both spouses when either claims benefit.</P>
    <P>That is the general principle.</P>

      <P>Some families.  I must point out here that where losses will occur it is the entitlement of married men which will fall as the benefit position of married women under the proposals will be enhanced uniformly and in many cases considerably.</P>
      <P>In the vast majority of cases, that is where only the husband in a family works, there will be no change whatsoever in his entitlement and he will continue to be entitled to full increases in respect of his dependants if and when he becomes a social welfare recipient.  I had to make a correction there, lest Deputies accuse me of doctoring the section.  The phrase is &ldquo;there will be no change whatsoever in his entitlement&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>About 75 per cent of all married men beneficiaries fall into this category and will suffer no loss whatsoever.  In the case where for want of a better term only the wife works &mdash; what is described as a reversal of the traditional roles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;she will now be entitled to the full adult and child dependant increases as long as her husband is not on benefit &mdash; at present she can only qualify if her husband is an invalid.  This would give married women with three children in such circumstances a gain of £51.10 a week compared with the present provisions.  She would, in addition, receive an extra £4 to £5 per week in her personal rate which would be brought up in that case to the current standard rate to which I have referred earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There will, as I have said, be offsetting gains and reductions in entitlement in families where the wife is economically active and thereby is <Col N="2248" /> gaining, or stands to gain, from the proposals to give married women increases in respect of children.  A married woman with three children, for example, whose husband is employed or on benefit would, when on benefit, gain about £13.50 per week in addition to the increases of £4 to £5 per week in her personal rate of benefit.</P>
      <P>Reductions in the entitlements of married husbands whose wives are working will occur, but reductions would have been inevitable in any event because the present adult dependency arrangement is simply not defensible.  As I stated earlier, it gives a husband an increase for his wife, not alone where she is in employment but even where she is entitled to benefit in her own right.  In effect, the social welfare system is at present paying on the double for the same person. Frankly, I had no option in the context of spending an additional £17 million for 40,000 married women to improve their overall position.  I cannot allow a massive further escalation of cost, of at least another £80 million to £90 million.  I do not have the money.  I do not think it would be fair to apply it that way.  If I had the money I would be spending it in other areas of social welfare where people are in far worse circumstances.</P>
      <P>There is no objective reason why such families should receive more from the social welfare system than families in which only one spouse is claiming benefit and the other spouse is not at work at all. In cases, therefore, where both husband and wife are at present separately entitled to social welfare payments the new arrangements will mean that the husband will lose the adult dependant allowance for his wife and 50 per cent of the child dependant allowances for any children. His wife will be given a higher personal rate and 50 per cent of the child dependant allowances.  For these families there will be a loss of around £20 a week.  I shall come later to the mitigating factors which I propose to bring in in respect of other families caught in that net.  I hope the Deputies will appreciate the point I wish to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where one spouse is at work and the other is drawing a social welfare payment the spouse at work will not now in general be regarded as a dependent and the social welfare recipients will have entitlement to only half the appropriate increases for children. Compared with the present situation this could result in a reduction in flat-rate benefit of up to £37 per week where a married man with three children is on benefit and his wife is at work.  As against that, his wife will now be entitled to increased benefits in her own rights if she ceases to work and is eligible for a social welfare payment.  In the case of a married man with earnings below the average, reduction in flat-rate benefit could be offset by increased pay-related benefit which had been stopped as a result of the wage stop and entitlement to family income supplement could also exist where one spouse is in employment. There are compensating factors and one of these which the Government have asked me to examine is the interaction of the family income supplement in those circumstances.  There will be a degree of interaction and protection but that has to be carefully examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that Deputies may put the equal treatment argument into perspective it is necessary that we look at who will be affected by the proposals.  Put simply, all married women beneficiaries will gain and the entitlements of some married men beneficiaries will be reduced.  As I mentioned earlier, in the case of about three-quarters of married men beneficiaries the wife would be engaged in what we classify as domestic duties.  She will <Col N="2250" /> continue to be regarded as his dependant and there will be no change in his entitlements. Of the remaining 25 per cent of cases, the information at the disposal of my Department suggests that up to 15 per cent would also have wives on benefit. In the remainder, the wife would be in employment.  Where the wife is also on benefit it must be accepted that on implementation of equal treatment, the social welfare system is providing fully for the family within the system and the level of payments provided.  It will, in most cases, continue to provide more for families where both spouses have a separate entitlement than for families where only one spouse has the entitlement and the other is his or her adult dependent.  But the differential will be much less than at present.  There is no question about the equity of the new arrangements.  I ask Deputies to note that I am taking a general power in the Bill which will enable me to make temporary and transitional arrangements on a limited basis within the moneys available to me which would reduce the income drop for certain families who would otherwise suffer a sudden sharp drop in income on implementation of the legislation.  What I may be able to do under those powers and under the Bill to be issued on Friday morning is a matter which I will be considering in detail over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Of the cases where the wife is in employment the records available in my Department suggest that in a large proportion of cases the wife's earnings from employment are substantial and by no reasonable standards could such persons be regarded as their husbands' dependants. I am at a loss to understand some of the representations I have received &mdash; in one case it concerned a wife who had an income in excess of £11,000 &mdash; complaining that such women will no longer be regarded as their husband's dependants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be unusual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that unusual. The average earnings are £80 per week but at least half have £100 per week.  I <Col N="2251" /> am very concerned about people on low earnings.  I accept that there are a small proportion of cases &mdash; I estimate they are no more than a few thousand in number &mdash; where the earnings of a wife would be very low and where the reduction in the benefit entitlement of the husband would represent a substantial loss of income to the household.  I have indicated clearly and from the very beginning that these cases are a cause of concern to me and that I am giving consideration to the effects which the equal treatment proposals will have here.  Among the options I am considering under this heading is the possibility of introducing an earnings floor below which a spouse in employment would continue to be regarded as an adult dependant.  This is of considerable importance.  This is an extremely complex matter from a policy point of view but we are dealing with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as important are the operational consequences of any such provisions for my Department in terms of the fact that the introduction of an earnings floor would further complicate the payments delivery system.  Its effects on the overall level of service which the Department can give to the public is therefore a crucial issue at a time when severe staffing restrictions and a massive increase in the claims load are already combining to put the system under enormous pressure.  There will, however, be a provision in the Bill which will enable me to modify the new adult dependancy conditions in a limited way which could be used to introduce an earnings floor if this proves possible on completion of the examination I am undertaking.</P>
      <P>I return now to the motion before the House.  I confess to be more than a little surprised at the attitude of the Opposition. Knowing how hiked up they are at present expecting a general election any minute &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey had a statement inserted in the minutes of the Council &mdash; they are available if anyone wants a copy of them &mdash; to the effect that the Irish delegation in accepting the adoption of the directive considered that nothing in the directive prevented arrangements being made to control dependency payments so as to avoid paying increases of benefit in respect of a spouse when that spouse is already receiving benefit or is in employment or to control payments of increases for children.  I am not a follower of Deputy Haughey and would have to see it in written terms before I would believe a word of it.  However, his word is there and is being implemented.</P>
      <P>Quite clearly the then Minister envisaged that a revision of the concept of dependency involving controls on the payment of increases for a spouse in employment or on benefit in his or her own right would be required.  His policy in regard to equal treatment was exactly in line with the proposals I have now outlined and I cannot understand how the Opposition can now turn around and expect this House to consider seriously, let alone pass, a motion directly opposed to their policy when they were in power and when they had an opportunity to advance the introduction of the principle of equal treatment.  Deputy Haughey in the Departments of Social Welfare and Health was too busy using them to become Taoiseach and leader of his party to get on with the job of implementing equal treatment.</P>

To suggest that it is a mean or penny pinching exercise is a false interpretation of the factual position and suggests that once again the Opposition have failed to think out their position on these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of equality in the EC directive could be described as a natural concept; it must be applied unconditionally to all.  We cannot apply it on a selective basis seeking to have equality here and there but not in the places were it does not suit us.  I greatly regret that some people should try to make political capital out of an issue such as this.  Most if not all of the problems lie in having to apply the concept of equality to a social welfare code which has particular regard to dependency provisions and which at present has particularly unfair dependency conditions.  We on this side of the House are aware of the difficulties that could arise in adapting our social welfare code to modern Irish conditions and the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of a commission, which I set up over 12 months ago, to review the whole social welfare system. In their deliberations the commission will no doubt take account of the underlying causes of the issues now arising under the equal treatment heading.  The commission are not due to report until late next year.  In the meantime, the proposals I have outlined are a balanced and equitable approach to equality within the structures of the existing code.  When Deputies have had an opportunity to study and analyse them fully in the forthcoming Bill which I intend them to have in their post on Friday morning I feel certain that they will conclude likewise and that the specious propaganda of the Opposition, which they should review, will not wash on this occasion.  In one year I am spending £17 million.  Not a <Col N="2254" /> penny of that was spent by the Opposition from 1978 onwards.  When they had the opportunity to do something about it they did nothing.</P>

There may be a hitch in regard to that, as very often there is in regard to a Bill.  This Government are supposed to be a Government of social change but since I came back after the last election I have not seen any of it. I have been at meetings here, there and everywhere and heard who will vote for this, that and the other.  That is why I am wary about what is going to be in this Bill if it is introduced on Friday.  I would like to see the contents of the Bill because the Minister in his statement is vague about it.  He states that he has to look into it in further detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know if it is to be implemented on 1 January next.  It is unlikely that this Bill will come before <Col N="2255" /> the House for discussion until well into the spring.  If it is well into the spring, will the Bill be backdated to 1 January? Will the Minister, or whoever replies on behalf of the Government, explain when this is going to operate?  Will it come in on a certain day in April or May or will it be backdated?</P>
    <P>Under the terms I have been given it would seem that the husband and wife with a large family &mdash; say, six children &mdash; are going to be at a heavy loss as a result of this, depending on the circumstances. We know the position throughout the country with very heavy unemployment. I estimate that for a married man with six children the reduction will be from £35 to £40, and nobody has denied that. That is a very severe cutback at this time. We have heard talk about a family income supplement and so on but nobody in the constituency of Laois-Offaly has approached me about this income supplement. The reason is that an eight-page form has to be filled in and you would need to be a barrister to complete it.  It goes into every iota of what a person has. When this measure was introduced by the Minister and the Government it appeared to be the be all and end all.  I was informed that approximately 35,000 people would qualify.  I am open to correction, but my information in a verbal conversation with the Department of Social Welfare is that only about 5,000 applications are processed and not many more applications are in.  If that be so, that is far away from what we were told. That was the information I got in a verbal conversation with the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear about it.  The Minister knows this and he is admitting it when he says that I am right. I am glad that he has qualified the situation. Now we know where we stand. These figures are all jacked up by those I would call the do-gooders.  The Government like to come in here and tell us, and the country, what they are going to give <Col N="2256" /> out to everybody.  But this is not what they told us it would be.  Many constituents in the Midlands to whom I have been talking do not qualify for this allowance.</P>
      <P>What are the problems here with the Bill?  The Minister points to a directive that was agreed some years back, but it is a matter for the Government of the day to decide how they are going to work that directive.  There is no use in blaming Fianna Fáil, who were in Government at the time, for approving a directive.  Who brings the Bill before the House?  The Government of the day.  It is a matter for the Government of the day to bring in a comprehensive and impartial Bill that will look after all our community, especially those in need.  The Government cannot get out from under that.</P>
      <P>In many cases this legislation is very anti-husband.  I thought that this Government wished to see husband and wife on an equal footing.  I was led to believe that this social Government would like to see them in that way.  They were going to see fair play for man, wife, children, single people and everyone.  That does not seem to be the case now.</P>
      <P>I understand that some amendments to the Bill are to be proposed by the Government so we shall have to reserve judgment until such time as the Bill is before the House.  Having been disappointed on so many occasions in regard to the production of Bills by the Government, I am not very hopeful that this one will be before us on Friday morning but I trust that when it is produced it will indicate that the Government have had regard to the views expressed on this side of the House.</P>

Bills are prepared and then when they are considered not to be capable of being put into operation, they are thrown into the wastepaper basket.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not agree with a Bill that proposed to give more autonomy to a husband than to his wife or <i>vice versa</i>.  We must provide for equal treatment.  We provide in our legislation dealing with the protection of the family that the marital home cannot be disposed of by a husband <Col N="2258" /> without the consent of his wife.

I was making the point that in the case of the marital home, husband and wife have equal rights.  There should be equal rights for them also within the terms of this legislation.  Is the Minister trying to play to the gallery?  Is he taking the line that women do not understand and that husbands are fools?  In any case the Bill to come before the House should provide for equal rights.</P>
      <P>It is the intention to back-date the legislation to 1 January 1985, assuming that it will not come into operation until the spring or later, or have the Government made up their minds on that?  I doubt that they have.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to understand how a figure could be put on the cost of implementing the legislation when the Minister is not able to tell the House the date of implementation. As we understand it, again those with the larger families will be the ones to lose under the terms of the scheme which we hear will be brought in. There has been no denial in that regard. Where a husband and wife have six children and unemployment is concerned, I estimate that they will be at the loss of between £35 and £40 a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the importance of ensuring that the rivers would be pollution free because if our rivers are affected in any way it can only be to the detriment of the salmon fishing industry, which is of vital importance. Deputy Wilson had hoped to refer to Lough Sheelin but time did not permit.  I would refer back to a time in 1980 when a scheme was introduced to remove excess pig slurry from the Lough Sheelin catchment. I accept that some improvements have taken place and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that there will no further pollution problems there.</P>
      <P>There is a great necessity for the utmost co-operation between the fishing interests and the Department.  The Minister referred to the increase of 15 per cent in the licence fees.  If we are to follow that logic and make 15 per cent extra available to the regional boards, then it is not £5 million which the Minister should make available to the boards but something in the region of £6 million.  In 1982 a sum of about £5 million was provided and taking inflation into account, the sum to be provided should be well in excess of £6 million.</P>

      <P>As I said here on previous occasions, it is a shame that we do not have more time for discussions on matters of this kind.  We are confined to the Estimates, and that is not a satisfactory situation. It would be much better if we had an opportunity tonight to review the whole working of the boards which were set up for the development of the salmon and oyster fishing industries.  If we were to be honest about it the progress report on development would not be satisfactory. The Inland Fisheries Commission did a tremendous job in the report they prepared and finished in 1974.  In page 88, paragraph 815 of that report on organisation they say</P>
      <P>We are acutely consious that the success of the new organisation will depend on it being acceptable on the whole to the various and often conflicting interests with which it will be involved. Active participation by representatives of the interests being served is not merely desirable but necessary and in addition there must be continuous contact and a cross flow of ideas between the staff at all levels on the one hand and the fishermen, anglers and fishing interests generally on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody close to the scene will know that is not the case, that the boards are no better than the old boards and that the operation of the board itself is merely carrying on the work of the bailiffs as we <Col N="2261" /> knew them in the past.  That is not a satisfactory situation and the wishes of the commission have not been met in that respect.  I could relate many stories about what I know to have been happening over the years in relation to the work carried out by the board.  It has not improved relationships between the fishermen and the officers of the board and we are often back to the situation which obtained when we had the landlords.  We are not getting the right kind of effort from everybody concerned in order to conserve stocks and ensure that the industry will be properly handled.  When the fishermen are harassed and molested in a way that brings conflict we cannot expect to see co-operation.  The Inland Fisheries Commission in their report stated that in 1974 the amount spent was £348,975.  I wonder if we can relate that to the figure spent today when we have £5 million from the State.  Is there any worthwhile increase in the amount being spent or given to the board to enable them to carry out their duties.  Various executives are getting salaries in excess of what they are entitled to.  I saw an advertisement for a regional director and one for a schools inspector in the national newspapers and the salary of the director was £3,000 greater than the salary offered to the schools inspector.  There is something wrong there because the qualification necessary for the jobs did not compare.  Far too much money is being spent on that kind of thing and on travelling expenses and so on for these officials. The Minister should look at this and try to ensure that we get the best value for money.</P>
    <P>I understood that the purpose of the board would relate to development and that they would make money available for things like spawning, watching our rivers, protecting the stock and so on. That is not what is happening.  We have the same old situation where the bailiffs go out and do the job they have been doing over the years.  I am not saying it is not necessary to do that but much more has to be done and it is not being done.</P>
    <P>There has been dissatisfaction in relation <Col N="2262" /> to appointments made.  The boards have been given autonomy, and this is good in its own way, but there is a recommendation in the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission that people already employed by boards would be retained as far as possible.  This has not happened.  I know a person who had worked for a long number of years with a board.  He was laid off and later when a temporary vacancy occurred he was not considered, but a man who never had had contact with fishing got the job.  It hurt the person very much.  Not only had he facilitated the old board by giving them land at small cost which assisted them in their development plans, but he had done excellent work during the years.  He was not given an appointment when it came up and he was forced to emigrate.  That does not help local relations between the boards and the people in the regions.  This man was treated most unfairly.</P>
    <P>If questioned, the Minister can always refer matters back to the boards and say it is not his problem.  It is highly unsatisfactory that there is not an appeal from the board's decisions.  Like many other State boards, the fishery boards can kick back in the teeth of authority.  Therefore, it is not a good idea that the Minister should leave all the power to the boards in many aspects of their work.</P>
    <P>It is terrible that we should have this increase in licence fees following the disastrous year fishermen have had.  Catches were down very much and some anglers did not even earn the price of their licences. I do not agree with people who say that salmon fishing is coming to an end. There seem to be cycles: 1983 was a good year with a good run of salmon but this was a bad year.  Perhaps the good weather had something to do with catches, but this year the 15 per cent increase cannot be justified.  If we were satisfied that the money would be used for the type of development I described earlier I would support this order but when I find that the money will be used to increase the salaries of people I spoke about at the beginning, I am not satisfied with the order.</P>
    <P>The time has come, if we want to see <Col N="2263" /> our inland fisheries developed, when the Minister will have to get money and see that a proper job will be done.  The potential is tremendous.  We have the rivers and the lakes and tourism can benefit immensely if we do a proper job on them. For instance, we should look at the position in England where they have a river board in charge of planning.  We must do something about pollution but there is very little the Minister can do without legislation that would cover many aspects of fishery interests which have been changing over the years.</P>
    <P>I will return to my theme that if we do not have good relations between the boards and the fishermen we will be adding to our problems.  It is a pity we do not have more time to discuss these important matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion the Dáil had an order of this kind before it I spoke of the threat of decline in our fisheries without proper protection.  I understand there are financial limitations but a special means of providing finance must be considered.  I, too, am worried about the increase in licence fees for drift net fishermen on inland rivers particularly following the disasters of 1984.  The Minister should consider amending the legislation so as properly to define drift and draft nets.  There should be a more firm definition because cases have been brought before the courts seeking to define the difference between drift and draft nets.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied about the original intention in regard to draft net fishing which has been extended to the sea.  At the moment there is a race of salmon in the sea to the north-west but when those salmon arrive in the Shannon Estuary they will have dwindled by 20 per cent.  I am deeply disturbed about fishermen who are full-time fishing for salmon in inland fisheries.  I hope the Minister will make a special note of their case and issue directions to the boards to examine hardship cases among them.</P>

      <P>Táim buíoch de na Teachtaí <Col N="2264" /> a thóg páirt sa díospóireacht.  Mar adeir Deputy Gallagher, tá sé soiléir nach bhfuil ár ndóthain ama againn chun an cheist seo a phlé mar ba mhaith linn.  Níor aontaigh mé leis nuair a thagair sé do rudaí nach bhfuil déanta.  Ar aon nós ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do na pointí ar leith a pléadh i rith na díospóireachta.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to Deputy Daly's contribution.  He said the probable result of the increase in the licence level would be a loss of revenue because people would lose interest and no longer seek licences.  When we look at the figures involved, I do not think the increase will result in that kind of drastic action being taken by people with a genuine interest in the industry and in the sport.</P>
      <P>The regional boards are getting sufficient funds.  If we look at the 1985 figures versus the 1984 figures we find that there is an increase in the pay element.  In the non-pay element, which is the development area, there is an increase of 46 per cent in the 1985 figure over the 1984 figure.  It is increased from £775,000 to £1.134 million.  In the total vote under subhead B there is an increase of ten per cent, from £4,072,000 to £4,445,000.  I am sure Deputies opposite will be delighted that the bulk of that is in the non-pay area, the development area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Daly talked about the undermining of confidence in the industry.  I do not think that is so.  We can talk ourselves into the ground but there is a hard core of sensible people interested enough in fisheries to ensure the future of the industry, provided they get assistance and have a proper approach.  Deputy Daly also referred to the staff scheme difficulties ahead.  The House will appreciate that this is a delicate matter.  The central board have refused an offer of compensation and the scheme has been referred to the Labour Court for decision.  I have been in touch with the central board and the union representing the regional boards.  I left them under no illusion about that matter.  A great deal has been put into the scheme to bring it to this stage, and it would be unfortunate if a <Col N="2265" /> straw were allowed to break the camel's back, as would seem to be the case in this instance.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of fisheries was referred to by Deputy Daly.  He knows as well as I do that two fisheries have been acquired, the Galway fishery and the Erriff fishery, both of which have been very successful.  The represent a very good investment for the State. People can be very simplistic about this issue.  There are two problems.  The first is a question of finding the resources to purchase these fisheries.  Secondly, there is the problem of finding a suitable fishery on sale on the market.  It can be said that anything is for sale if you pay enough for it.  That theory is true but we are not in that league.</P>
    <P>There is also the very basic right of private ownership.  If we try to upset the balance we are into fairly serious consequences. I am not saying it was mentioned in this context by Deputy Daly, but I am amazed at times at the utterances of people outside the House who make blanket statements about the acquisition of fisheries, and that Irish fisheries should be in Irish hands.  That is a grand aspiration with which I would agree, provided we had the ways to do it legally and without causing any trouble or breaking any law.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Gallagher mentioned daylight fishing.  The reduction in the amount of the salmon catch this year represented about 45 or 46 per cent which is a very serious reduction.  Daylight fishing is a euphemism for monofilament nets.  I have no qualms about using that word. Perhaps Deputy P. Gallagher has.  He goes around the problem in a circuitous route.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be hard to be more circuitous than the Minister. That is a compliment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know whether he is talking about the legalisation of monofilament nets.  That is what daylight fishing is all about.  Let us call a spade a spade.  If the Deputy is not happy <Col N="2266" /> about using that word so be it.  I do not mind.</P>
      <P>He also referred to the distribution of the licences.  There are times when I feel that people who do not get licences should get them.  It is a matter for the statutory board.  Their function is to issue licences to suitable applicants.  They lay down the criteria upon which applicants are judged.  I do not get involved in that. He also mentioned Lough Swilly and the different levels of licences.  There is a problem here.  When you are given a licence in a district, you can fish in any part of that district.  In other words, we could not have one level of licence operating in one area and another level in another area.  The licence covers the whole area. There would be difficulties in applying two levels of licence in the one area.</P>
      <P>Lough Sheelin was mentioned by Deputy P. Gallagher.  The Department of the Environment are in the process of finalising a new management committee to cope with the problem of pollution as and from January 1985.  Deputy Carey spoke of his concern about the increase in the level of the licence.  This gives me no joy.  It is quite a small increase.  It is far below the inflation rate for the period involved.  We ought to try to keep close to that level of increase.</P>
      <P>On the change in the definition from draft net to drift net, there are areas like the Deputy's area where there is no great difference, but there are major differences in other regions and other areas between draft and drift.  The Deputy may be right in saying we should try to see if this can be defined more clearly in order to ensure that there is no confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Denis Gallagher was very critical of the boards.  On the one hand he mentioned conservation and the hope of increased catches, while on the other hand, harassment and perhaps even molestation.  First of all, I do not accept that but, if that is happening, of if there is any form of harassment, the Deputy can take it that it is because they are acting illegally.  The board officials have a duty under the Act, that is what they <Col N="2267" /> are being paid for &mdash; being paid the so-called big salary to which the Deputy referred &mdash; to ensure that the law is upheld.  I cannot &mdash; and I am sure if he were standing here, he would not &mdash; condone breaches of the law of this land. It is their function and I am assuming that he is not condoning or encouraging breaches of those laws.</P>
    <P>What I am doing is very much within the limits available to me.  It will provide extra revenue badly needed.  I can safely say that the people who are critical of the level of allocation being made to the boards for development work &mdash; at the end of the day when they find that there has been a 46 per cent increase in the allocation direct from the Exchequer &mdash; will discover that this money will also go into the development area for which they sought.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware, this is the most significant part of this Bill in the sense that sections 70 and 71 of the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act, Ireland, 1860 provided for the re-instatement of a tenant if he paid all arrears and costs within six months of the execution of a decree for possession and applied to <Col N="2268" /> the court for re-instatement.  It is felt that a lessee who is in breach of the terms of his lease and against whom a decree for possession has been executed should have no further claims on the leasehold and the lessor should be entitled to resume undisputed possession of his land. There are other aspects of other Land Acts that enter in here.  We are repealing this law, as such, so that the provisions of the new Bill will mean that whatever contract is arrived at between the lessor and lessee will be deemed to be the legal position between them.  It creates a situation between the lessor and lessee of an equal trading balance.  As the Deputy is well aware, heretofore that balance, as new legislation was added in the earlier part of this century, for obvious historical reasons, swung in favour of the tenant.</P>
      <P>The reasoning behind the repeal of those sections of that Act in this section of this Bill is to ensure that there will be an equal trading situation obtaining between the lessor and the lessee. Obviously that will ensure that whatever agreement is struck on a man to man contract basis between them constitutes the proper way to proceed.  It is against that background that those sections are being repealed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Would the Minister of State agree that the repeal of sections 70 and 71 of the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act, Ireland, 1860 changes the emphasis which is now being transferred from the lessee to the lessor, in other words, that the landlord now will have rights at the expense of the tenant who leases the land?  Would it mean also that at the end of the day, or perhaps at the end of the lease, whether it be medium or long term, a lessee's rights would be questionable?  Would the Minister of State say what rights a lessee would have?  I accept the principle behind the repeal of those sections but I contend that there appears now to be no protection for the tenant at the end of his lease and it is about that that I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason for this Bill is that under certain parts of <Col N="2269" /> legislation going back to the years 1860 and 1861, certain circumstances could arise, in medium to long term leasing, under which a tenant need not necessarily leave the land of which he was a tenant. This is a problem which has been identified by the legal profession on many occasions, when the question of disturbance, compensation for improvement etc., arose.</P>
      <P>When this Bill is passed I hope a completely new situation will obtain in which we shall then have, as the Deputy is well aware, master leases which we did not have until last year which are basically, if you like, contracts.  This may be more a matter for the legal profession.  But there are now master leases available that cover practically every possible angle in so far as leasing between two people is concerned, that is lessor and lessee.  We want the law implemented to state the following: that whatever agreement is reached between a lessee and lessor that, as such, will become the law of the land, that they will both be equal trading partners.</P>
      <P>I must accept what Deputy Noonan said, that at the end of a lease, a tenant, as such, will have no right.  This Bill would not be worth a tráithnín if it happened that a farmer believed that, at the end of a tenancy, a tenant had certain rights enabling him to remain on that farmer's land.  At that level the provisions of the Bill are clearcut, in the sense that no farmer in any part of the country who genuinely believed he would be unable to get a tenant off his land at the expiry of a lease would not involve himself in long term leasing.  This Bill and its provisions are designed to give categoric assurance to every farmer interested in leasing his land to others, for a medium or long term period, anything above the 11-months conacre system, that he will get his land back at a pre-determined time, as will be stipulated in the lease to be drawn up by the two of them when making the relevant agreement.  That is the basic principle of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to what the <Col N="2270" /> Minister said in relation to the arrangement between the lessor and the lessee, there is a great danger that during the last two or three years of the leasing period we will get back to the difficulty which has existed in respect of the conacre arrangement which has bedevilled the development of agriculture for many years.  There is a temptation to run down the quality of the land by not using the required amount of lime and fertiliser pending the negotiation of a new lease. There is an inherent weakness in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kirk.  This was the problem with the land which was held by the Land Commission. In my county, land was held for ten years and allowed to run down.  The amount of fertiliser used on it was negligible and it was practically useless when it was allocated. In the case of a seven-year lease there will be an incentive to the lessee to build up the fertility of the land during the first few years and to re-seed it to get the maximum benefit.  I would fear that the land would be neglected in the latter years of the lease if the lease was not renegotiated in the fifth or sixth year.  I hope there will be long-term leasing when the scheme gets going.  If the lease is for fewer than seven years very few people will build up the quality of the land in order to achieve maximum productivity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to master leases but I am sure he will agree that most master leases do not have any standing in law, certainly under this legislation.  I am also concerned about whether this legislation will succeed in promoting land leasing in an effective manner.  I heard what the Minister said today at another function but time will tell whether what he has promised will come about.  As of now we do not have an incentive for the promotion of land leasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year on Second Stage the Minister referred several times to the new role of the Land Commission.  Under the national plan the Land Commission are to be abolished.  What vehicle will the <Col N="2271" /> Minister now utilise to promote land leasing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kirk and Deputy Leonard asked what was likely to happen towards the expiry of the lease. I am positive that this legislation will be most beneficial and that we will get over the problem of the 11-month system which has impoverished more land than any other system of farming.  If the period of a lease is extended and the lessee pays the going rate and has to make a profit, it is safe to assume that if the land is run down when he gets it he will build it up to a very high level of productivity and fertility.  The big selling point of medium to long term leasing is the spreading of the fixed cost over a considerable number of years.  It makes economic sense.</P>
      <P>I hold the view that in the next few years we will see leases of five, six or seven years.  There is always a tendency to talk about the ten or 12-year leases but they were not very successful in the early seventies.  We should move slowly because there is too big a gap between 11 months and ten or 12 years.</P>
      <P>I am certain that under the master leases a certain standard will be expected of the tenant when he is handing back the land.  In some leases this can be taken care of.  The owner of the land will be very well protected in so far as it is possible to protect a possession like land.  I am confident that it is possible to do that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan said that the leases would not involve a legal obligation. After the passage of this legislation such a lease will be a binding contract on a man to man basis.  Some of the leases which are available are very involved. They certainly cover most of the things that could possibly happen in the duration of the lease and some of them cover some things that are unlikely ever to happen.  Under the conditions we are speaking about both the tenant and the owner are very well protected.  For this reason I believe the scheme will be very successful.</P>

      <P>What would be the position <Col N="2272" /> where improvements were carried out by the tenant?  What about the possible option to renew the lease?  Does the Minister believe that just by repealing legislation land leasing will take off, without any changes in social welfare or tax incentives?  He hinted during the Second Stage debate that he might be amenable to proposing some changes in social welfare and taxation to the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan mentioned the role of the Land Commission.  During the Seanad debate last April the Minister of State spoke about the important role of the Land Commission in land leasing but when the Bill came back to the Dáil we had been told that the Land Commission were to be abolished and there was little mention of it in the Minister's speech. We are very concerned when we hear that up to 100 inspectors are to be transferred from the Land Commission on staff release to assess plans for a farm tax.  How many inspectors will be taken away from dealing with the important matter of land division?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has assured the House that there will be no difficulty for a farmer who leases land over four or five years, that he can apply at any stage to get the land back to the expiry of the lease.  It is important that an absolute assurance is given on that issue.  I did not notice any provision in the Bill entitling anybody to renew the lease.  I am not advocating that such a right should be conferred on somebody, because that may create fear in the minds of those who may wish to lease land, but there should be a provision giving a greater right to the person who has leased the land over a person applying to lease it for the first <Col N="2273" /> time.  The owner should certainly have the right to take the land back at the expiry of the lease.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that young farmers anxious to lease land under the scheme are given an incentive.  Provision must be made to ensure that on going into milk they will not be expected to pay the superlevy from the first day.  Under the new taxation system for farmers, the adjustable acreage, who will be responsible, the lessee or the lessor, for the payment of the tax?  Has the Minister given any consideration to that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with the question of the maintenance of the fertility of the land to a certain standard.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the original land leasing proposals were intended to get away from the old mould of the conacre system.  There is no guarantee under these provisions that the land fertility will be maintained at a certain standard because of the problems mentioned.  The Minister has admitted that that deficiency exists but he did not dwell on the matter too long.  One way of overcoming the problem would be to establish an annuity repayment to cover the cost of fertiliser to be borne by the lessor.  That should be built into the land leasing provision and it would go a long way to eliminate the great deficiency</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I doubt if there is any provision to encourage land leasing.  The Bill, strictly, is a legal matter.  The problems of land ownership and leasing cannot be examined in isolation. They must be looked at together if we are positively encouraging land leasing. We must consider another aspect, the way farmers live.  In this regard one must consider the social welfare system, the income tax code and the availability of credit.  Decisions taken, or not taken, in the Departments of Finance and Social Welfare will determine in a big way if this legislation will be successful.</P>

It would have been ideal had the Land Commission been allowed to continue to administer and monitor the scheme in conjunction with continuing to take over lands and allot it to farmers. Those officials were well versed in the distribution of land and in assessing a farmer's ability to farm land.  The provisions in the Bill would have been ideal if they were worked in conjunction with a revamped Land Commission.  Many young farmers had hoped to gain security by way of adding to their holding but that is gone.  Farmers do not have an incentive to go in on a leasing system now.  It would have been better if farmers could hope to obtain land in their district from the Land Commission.  This is a backward step and the Land Commission should have been allowed continue with its policy in conjunction with these provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to respond to the suggestion I put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four or five important aspects to be considered. I should like to bring to the notice of the House that we are discussing, as Deputy Noonan pointed out, a legal Bill.  It could not have been framed in such a way that it would go any further than that.  Many people in agriculture down the years have complained that the problem we are seeking to rectify has been an impediment to progress.  We are getting over that impediment by repealing some of the provisions of the old Land Act.  I should like to refer to the criticism of the decision to <Col N="2275" /> abolish the Land Commission.  All the activities and responsibilities of the Land Commission are being transferred to the Department of Agriculture.  The only thing worth mentioning is that for obvious reasons there will have to be a change of direction <i>vis-á-vis</i> a land policy. All Deputies have been clamouring for this for years.  That change is embodied in the legislation before us.  I will give the House a guarantee that personnel will be provided.  Last year I gave direction to the Land Commission local offices to promote this scheme to individuals, associations and co-operatives and they have been getting a very good feedback.  This will continue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kirk had a novel idea of this annuity.  He said a certain amount of the annuity could be withheld as a hedge against the final result to see in what condition the tenant would leave the property.  If the lessee and the lessor decide to do that there is no problem. There is nothing to stop them from entering freely into a particular type of arrangement.  This Bill is very important because it gives a degree of flexibility which did not exist heretofore.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I have a mental block about leasing for mid-terms of about five or six years, but let us not forget tillage where there are three-year rotations.  This is very important.  In this Bill I have made sure there is no curtailment after a certain number of years because I would like to have the flexibility where the lessor and the lessee could decide these matters for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important question mentioned was young farmers.  This scheme will provide an opening which did not exist up to now for young people highly trained in agriculture.  I am making representations to the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Finance for various concessions which in my view will be necessary when this Bill is implemented to make it more attractive.  Lest anyone run away with the idea that taxpayers' money should be used to bolster up this scheme to an artificial level, that is not intended.  In this stark world reality <Col N="2276" /> reigns supreme, and it is very important that the leasing of land be on an economic basis because it suits a particular farmer over a specific number of years to lease the land and it suits the tenant to take on this extra responsibility.  I am sure that in the years to come we will see the introduction to Irish agriculture of farmers who will make a living on long-term leased land.  This has happened all across Europe.  It will be difficult for many young people to do this but this can happen under certain conditions.  This is a real opening for trained young landless people to get into agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that when the initial agreement between the lessor and the lessee is arranged an annuity repayment system should be established to cover the cost of the lime and fertiliser to maintain the land at a certain standard for the duration of the lease and it would be the responsibility of the lessor to meet the repayments rather than the lessee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If we get involved in this type of situation everything will be more complicated.  I would like protection for the person who manages a certain acreage over a four or five-year period and brings the land up a certain level of productivity and if the lessor wishes to continue to lease the land a new lease could be drawn up in his favour.  He should have a right to renew the lease over a man who wants to lease the land for the first time because he can see the advantages to be derived from the land which was been managed so well.  I see a danger in the extension of long leasing, although I may be wrong, but I think this will perpetuate a form of absentee landlordism. That situation existed before and this fear is now being expressed.  I would like to see this fear dispelled by the Minister. I would not like this scheme to be bogged down because people might say we were going back to the nineteenth century with absentee landlords.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to deal with mobility of land.  Everybody agrees with that.  I hope every member of the Cabinet has the same <Col N="2277" /> feeling because I think it is the Minister's wish that not alone would land be made available for leasing but that land held by older farmers would be made available to their sons through inheritance.</P>
      <P>I heard of two incidents in my constituency in the past few months &mdash; perhaps the Minister would comment on this &mdash; where agreements had been reached between sons and fathers that the farm should be made over to the sons and the fathers would get the old age pension. We should encourage this type of move. It has been said that the average age of a farmer getting land is about 40 and the average age for a farmer to marry is 40. As somebody said, two millstones around his neck in the one year.  In the two instances I mentioned the fathers were refused the old age pension even though they had no means.  It was said that they had means from the farms because the sons were in part-time work.  They had to work part-time to finance the development of the land.  That is disgraceful.  This was simply because Deputy Barry Desmond&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I agree with the Minister that land leasing is taking off in a very big way across Europe but the situation there is different from here in so far as it is positively promoted by the various governments and they avail of the EC structures and finance to positively promote land leasing. I doubt if the Minister can give any guarantee in that regard.  Earlier this year he spoke in the Seanad about guarantees in regard to the Land Commission and that they would have a new role and soon after the Land Commission were abolished.

I should like the Minister to explain in detail what protection either party has when land is let and whether either party has an option at any time during the lease to withdraw from the lease, because my understanding of a lease is that when it is signed, sealed and delivered there can be no withdrawal by either party although the lease may be disposed of to some other party by the lessee.  If a lessor, a single, old age pensioner, leases his land to a young farmer and he dies half way through the term of the lease without making a will and the lessee refuses to leave the land and claims squatter's rights, what is the position?  If the lessor dies and leaves his land on date of death to a member of his family and the lessee refuses to vacate the lands, what is the position in regard to the rights of the lessee or the legality of the lease?</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling said that a tenant who looked after the land very well should be given some priority at the expiry of the lease.  I cannot accept that because of the fundamental thrust of the Bill.  If I were to do that I could not give an undertaking to landowners that they would get their land back without any strings.  That is very important and I do not want to leave the House under any illusion in that regard. In so far as this legislation is concerned, it means a very definite end to a particular contract at the end of the lease period. There is no priority written in unless, of course, they arrange something between the two of them at the beginning of the lease.  It is a trading agreement between two parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is missing the point.  If that were the case, unless certain conditions suited, you could not have an agreement between two parties. That is the great flexibility of this scheme. This will give a legal standing to an agreement on long-term leasing between the tenant and the farmer, the lessee and the lessor.  If they want to write particular conditions into the contract they are free to do so but, obviously, after signing it, they will be held to what they have signed.  That applies to all legal agreements. Deputy Treacy asked about the power to withdraw and referred to squatter's rights but this will not arise because if a lessee or a lessor dies during the term of a lease, it can be written into the lease that there should be some type of compensation.  Equally, it can be argued that if all that is not taken into account when the contract is being signed it means that the tenant will be there until the expiry of the lease which he signed originally. However, on the last day of the lease, even if the owner is alive, the tenant should not and will not be there because somebody will claim that land. It is against that background that this legislation is of immense benefit.  I am trying to get across the importance of the <Col N="2280" /> flexibility which can be inserted in various contracts.</P>

      <P>There will be no such thing.  There are specimen master leases &mdash; the first we have ever had &mdash; by various bodies who went to the trouble of making them available to the public. They set headlines to cover certain eventualities perhaps in nine or ten years time. They are there to help the lessee and the lessor to come to an agreement and they are not legally binding in themselves. What the lessee and the lessor decide to sign at the commencement of a lease will be legal.  The only reason the master leases are on display at present is because they point the way.  Of course, many leases will be entered into which will not be nearly as complicated as those which are in existence at present but that is up to the lessee and the lessor.  That is the degree of flexibility to which I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dewling mentioned landlordism. I categorically assure the House that there will not be a return to landlordism because if we acknowledge the status quo of 97 per cent ownership of Irish farms by the farming population, for obvious reasons if we are enacting legislation here that will ensure that the farmer will get <Col N="2281" /> his land back at the expiry of the lease, we will be no worse off in ten years' time. We are making certain that the owner will get his land back.  We cannot say enough publicly about the important matter of the contract between the farmer and the tenant.  I should like to think that the people involved in such a contract would take note of what Deputy Kirk was talking about.  A farmer would like to think that on the expiry of the lease his land will be in a much better condition but there is no way that could be written into the Bill.  However, I am sure there will be occasions in the future when it will form part of the agreement between the lessor and the leseee.</P>

      <P>With regard to fertilising the land, under the existing 11-months system there is no incentive for the person taking the land to apply the necessary fertiliser because there is always the possibility that the land will not be leased to him after the expiry date. However, where the contract is for seven years it would be in the interest of the person taking the land to ensure that the necessary fertilisers are applied to the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>All this Bill is doing is repeating the provisions in a number of Acts.  The variations the Minister mentioned are legal matters to be dealt with by the solicitors for the parties concerned. Those variations or conditions could be, and probably are, in many leases at the moment where the contract is for two or three years.  This Bill is not doing anything new.  Deputy Kirk spoke about applying lime and fertiliser to bring the land to an acceptable level of fertility. In the past 20 years a scheme was in operation &mdash; I do not know if it has been abolished &mdash; where fertilisers and lime were provided on a charge against the annuities.  I take it the Minister will recommend that system to ensure that the land is brought quickly to an acceptable level of fertility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely in that that I see a danger unless the lessor clearly <Col N="2282" /> understands the situation.  Sometimes solicitors are not the best people in the world to protect their clients and they make mistakes.  Standard leases have been drawn up by the interested organisations and people who are considering the possibility of leasing land should know that there is one safe way of doing that and that there are unsafe ways.  If people draw up their own leases there could be certain loopholes.  This section clears away some old sections in Acts dating back to the latter half of the last century.  By virtue of such measures where land was improved people had the right to renew their leases against the pressure of landlords who tried to increase the rents or to take the land from them.  All this section is doing is removing some difficulties.  I would advise any farmer or owner who wishes to lease land for a period in excess of the 11-month conacre system to be careful with regard to the form of lease he signs.</P>

      <P>If this Bill and if land leasing are to be successful it is vital that a standard statutory land lease be drawn up to be used throughout the country and with open-ended conditions that will allow amendments suitable for local situations. Unless that is done we will not succeed in increasing land mobility.  Section 3 (2) is the identical parallel of the situation at the moment with regard to the letting, leasing or renting of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>For obvious reasons the 11-month conacre system is not an actual contract in the leasing sense.  The period was less than a year or less than a full season's crop and this was the people's way around particular legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have queried the master lease and obviously farmers will also have queries about the matter.  There is no possibility, nor was it ever intended, <Col N="2283" /> that we would legislate here for a particular lease.  That is not possible.  However, the IFA, the AIB banking group and the ICOS brought out specimen forms that are floating around the country at the moment and they can act as a guideline. Obviously any arrangements between the lessor and the lessee will be a legal matter but the guidelines are clearly signposted. It is essential that we also allow a degree of flexibility.  In the years to come other people will decide on master leases that will be more in keeping with the times then but what is important is what happens on the day the lessor and the lessee sign a contract.  Deputy Leonard said we were not doing anything new in this Bill but that is not so.  This is a complicated Bill and it took a long time to go through the various Land Acts.  The point we have reached now is a crucial one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Would the Minister elaborate very quickly on paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e)?  Would he also reply to my question regarding the positive encouragement of land leasing? Would he avail of the aids under EC structures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (d), which refers to sections 7 (3) and 30 (2) of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881 gives the lessee the right to sell his interest in the leasehold.  Here, in line with the general thrust of the Bill, the parties themselves should prescrible the terms of the lease, including any provisions regarding sale, subdivision and subletting by the lessee as may be agreed.  We have fully covered that.  Section 4 of the Landlord (Ireland) Act of 1881 provides that a lessee from whom a lessor demands an increase in rent is entitled to compensation to be fixed by the court in respect of the fall in sale value of the tenancy in consequence of the increased rent.  One can imagine the problems if that were the legal situation.  There would be mayhem all over Ireland.  We must repeal that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again section 13 of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, permits the lessee to <Col N="2284" /> sell his interest within six months of the execution of a decree for possession for non-payment of rent.  The intention here is to ensure that the lessor is entitled to regain undisputed possession of his property on termination of the lease for whatever reason.  That is the central thrust of what we have been talking about.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 22 of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, renders void an agreement by the tenant to contract out of any rights conferred on him by Statute provided the holding concerned has a PLV not exceeding £150.  As the Deputy is well aware, the PLV system was found to be unconstitutional.  It is possible that that provision would be no longer operative. It is included here to put the matter beyond doubt.  The intention is that the terms of the lease will be those agreed between the parties and will not be subject to any overriding statutory provision.</P>
    <P>To come back to the Deputy's point of view on aids for leasing, while these are not contained in the Bill structures are being negotiated this very day in Brussels. We shall have to see what comes out of these deliberations.  I am keeping more than a keen eye on the outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention there is a sensible one.  At present the collection fee on an annuity payment of £2 amounts to £3, so it was time to start waiving such charges and that is what happened as far back as 1977.  For the benefit of the House, there were something like 68,500 accounts representing a total collection of £73,000.  Those were written off.  One could argue that a Bill should have been brought in at that time but because it was not, we are giving legal backing in retrospection to what happened then.  It is important to point out that because of inflation and so on, a stage will be reached in the not too distant future when annuities larger than £2 will not be worth collecting. It is also intended to waive these when those circumstances occur.</P>

      <P>No.  That subsection is not related to the Bill, but we took the opportunity from another Department because of the relevance of mortgage societies with regard to prior mortgages.  Heretofore building societies and, I assume, other bodies involved in house loans, in the case of any annuity or annual payment to the Land Commission which was a mortgage on that part of the land, were very slow to grant a mortgage on that ground and, in fact, would not do so.

      <P>This section provides for the winding up of the purchase annuities fund.  Broadly speaking all sums received and payments in advance made prior to 1933 were made to the British Government and paid into the purchase annuities fund.  The original idea was that these sums would be transmitted to the appropriate British authority, in this case the British National Debt Commissioners. The Land Purchase Annuity Act, 1933 provided that the proceeds of the fund be paid into the Irish Exchequer. For accounting convenience and at the suggestion of the Comptroller and Auditor General it is proposed to wind up this fund and have the sums paid to the Exchequer and the land bond fund as appropriate.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Section 6 deals with the situation that arises where Land Commission allotees would not be fully registered as owners of their property until the problems that arise with regard to title and so on are sorted out, and this could take time with the Land Registry.  At the moment, according to the explanatory notes, the allotees will be paying only interest.  As far as I can gather this section is to ensure that the allotees, even though they are not registered owners of the property in question, would be paying the annuities as outlined by the Land Commission from the moment they take up occupation of the land as tenants.  Am I correct in assuming that?</P>

      <P>Because of some possible mix-up in drafting many years ago, until an allotee was vested &mdash; many Deputies know that that takes quite a <Col N="2292" /> long time &mdash; the law as it stood then meant that as far as that farmer was concerned he was paying only interest; he was not paying back the principal.  The Land Act, 1936, introduced a device known as listing by which the allotee who signed the purchase agreement was granted the benefit of this sinking fund virtually from the date of allotment and so he began to repay his advance immediately. There was a problem at that time and now we are regularising this.</P>

      <P>This is the system that applied for many years.  The proceeds from the Irish Church Temporalities Fund would have been channelled into the Department of Finance.  That is a system that we have and there will be no difference in it now.  All that this does is that under the provisions of the Irish Church Act, 1869, the temporal property of the established Church, including its revenues, passed to the State.  The Act also set up a fund known as the Church <Col N="2293" /> Temporalities Fund into which the former revenue of the Church was paid. In 1881 the administration of the fund devolved on the Land Commission.  That is the situation we have had ever since then.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same principle. In this section proof of title is involved. As the House is well aware, heretofore it could be a very costly item to be registered.  Over the years the moneys were very small.  Section 63 (2) of the Irish Land Act, 1903, provides that, if the redemption price exceeds £30 but does not exceed £100, it may be paid to the same person, or to trustees, subject to an undertaking to apply the money as capital.  It is now proposed to increase those figures to £1,000 and £3,000 respectively. The Land Commission are bound by stringent statutory requirements before they can pay out moneys due under various provisions of the Land Act.  These requirements have to do with proof of title.  Where the amounts of money involved have been so small as <Col N="2294" /> not to compensate for the legal expense of proving title, there is a statutory provision for payment with less strict proof and, therefore, less expense.  The limits on the amounts were last fixed in 1965, the date of the most recent Land Act. The proposal is to update these limits in the interests of both those to whom money is owed and of the Land Commission for accounting purposes.  The limits we propose were calculated on the basis of the increase in land prices between 1965 and now.  These data are taken from a Foras Talúntais study.  It is another item that we are trying to clear up.  Because it was very costly to prove title, we are trying, in this Bill to get a less expensive way of doing it to ensure that people can become registered.  It is another legal provision.</P>

For one reason or another some of that land was not registered properly at the time of purchase and the cost of registration now would be so immense that to leave the limits as they are would mean that it would not be worth anyone's while to effect registration.

      <P>A lot of Acts are covered in the Schedule and it symbolises the whole Bill.  This is basically enabling legislation that has been brought before the House to give some air of respectability to the principle of land leasing but I doubt if the Bill protects either the lessor or the lessee to the extent that they need <Col N="2302" /> the security of legal protection.  Under standard letting agreements signed between farmers and tenants, lessors and lessees and/or their agents heretofore, in order to protect title for the owner of the property incorporated in that agreement was usually a provision that the owner of the property should be responsible for the payment of all rates, tariffs or levies to which this land would be subject, and further on in the agreement would be a provision whereby the tenant would be responsible under Department of Agriculture regulations for the cutting of all abnoxious weeds and so on.  There is nothing about them in the Bill and such provisions are very important to show that the lease is legally binding on both parties.</P>

What will be the position in view of the Government's proposal to have a land tax on adjusted acreages? Who will be responsible for the tax, the lessor or the lessee, under new leasing arrangements?  Unless farmers can get this clear I do not think land leasing will be very successful in future, and we do not want to see that happening.</P>

It can be argued that it has been given all the publicity necessary for this type of thing but I can tell the Deputy that a contract entered into is a legal document once it is signed properly by the two parties.  That is the principal part of the Bill and if the Deputy says otherwise he has been misreading the legislation.  We have been asked to identify the aspects of land legislation which acted as impediments. We have done that.  I repeat that a contract signed by both parties is a legal document.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> This Bill goes a certain way towards removing the legal impediments to land leasing, but that is all it does.  It does not promote land leasing in any way.  The Bill should have been designed to encourage the maximum production from every acre and to provide as much employment as possible on family farms and outfarms. This Bill will not do that and therefore it will fail in its main objective.  It is only a poor shadow of what the Minister had promised in his statements and in the preceding publicity.  Of course, the Government have no land policy, no plans, and they are merely trotting out the old clichés.  There is not a single concrete proposal which would give reasonable access to land to young, ambitious farmers.  All the Government are proposing is to abolish the Land Commission without any organisation to put in their place.  I agree that the Land Commission need to be revamped&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tunney has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the failure of Dublin Corporation to provide public lighting in relation to attacks being made on old people in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for giving me the opportunity <Col N="2305" /> to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I will not take the 20 minutes to which I am entitled.  I do not want to be emotive about this but there are areas in Dublin city &mdash; I cannot speak for the Minister's constituency &mdash; which are without public lighting.  I made representations to the corporation alerting them to the facts.</P>
      <P>One does not need to have any great imagination in the times in which we are living to realise the consequences of not having public lighting.  I have to say this in his absence but I would also say it in his presence, that the engineer in charge of public lighting is one of the most outstanding officials of Dublin Corporation. Everybody who has had any dealings with him over the years knows that he is always patient and considerate. He has gone out of his way to ensure that this service is provided.  He wrote to me very bluntly saying that he has no money to provide this service.  I have copies of two letters referring to Poppintree in Ballymun and another area in south Finglas.</P>
      <P>Those areas are no different from any other place.  The people who live there are normal, law abiding people.  They are entitled to the protection which is afforded in any urban area of public lighting. We all know about the spate of attacks on people.  There is an increase in rapes and robberies.  People are being exhorted to live in villages.  I heard people saying on the radio in the past couple of days that the problems of old people throughout the country could be solved if they all lived together in villages.  I presume it is envisaged that they would have the benefit of that great invention which turns darkness into light and the protection of public lighting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very annoying and frustrating that I or any public representative should have to come in here and take up the time of this House with a matter like this which should be dealt with as a matter of form. It is amazing that, in the times in which we live, the engineer charged with the provision of this vital service has to admit to a public representative that he has run out of money.  The staff and the machinery <Col N="2306" /> are constant factors.  It must be that he has not got the price of bulbs to provide public lighting.  Because of a lack of imagination on the part of people who design housing schemes, young people can remove covers fitted to the bottom of standard lamps and put the service out of action.</P>
    <P>Vandalism is a feature of present day living and in all areas there is a need for certain replacements.  He has admitted that he is not in a position to provide this service.  Without dwelling on the dangers for people living in the area, young and old, but treating the matter from an economic point of view, suppose some people suffer personal injuries, they will be sent to hospital; there will be a court case; money will be spent; there will be claims for malicious damages.  Even from the economic point of view, the best value for money would be to provide the engineer with whatever bulbs he wants or whatever equipment is necessary to provide public lighting in Barnamore in south Finglas and in Poppintree in Ballymun. At one time it would not be tolerated that people should attack and rob others. Freedom was respected.  Now apparently tyranny is the norm.  The need for public lighting was always accepted as a <i>sine qua non</i> of modern living.  Now at the height of all our problems and frustrations, people living in the city of Dublin must go without the vital service of public lighting.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State.  He and I have the pleasure and honour of serving on Dublin Corporation.  He will not give me any bureaucratic spoof in his reply. The facts are as I have given them to him. I have the letters from the corporation confirming that there is no money to provide public lighting in these two areas.  I am not saying it was not provided initially, but it is not there now.  It has always been accepted that public lighting must be provided and maintained.  Mr. Pickett has been efficient and sympathetic in every case about which I or any other public representative made representations to him.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to stretch this point any further.  I will not go on to give a litany of <Col N="2307" /> the other areas in which the Government have failed.  I will forego whatever warped enjoyment I might get out of doing that.  I am concerned about the people living in these areas.  I am sure there are other areas in which public representatives got the same reply.  I am asking the Minister to provide money for this service.  Dublin Corporation should be told tomorrow that money is available for this vital service and that it will not be a case of locking the door when the horse has gone, that it will not be a case of the usual pious platitudes we hear, it will not be a case of our delaying action here.</P>
    <P>I would not wish that anything might happen that might bear out my fears; everybody knows they are ever present. Everybody knows that there are many people nowadays, some of their nature, some claiming that they are driven to it, who move into that which is not their own, to devastate society as we know it. These are people who follow a certain selfishness helping them to have that which does not belong to them.  They contend that that motivation is heightened when they have the feeling that they will escape being identified or being brought to justice.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister and to his being as brief as I have been in reducing the time allowed me by half. I hope he will give the House good news, not just for my constituency, but for all the constituencies in Dublin, that whatever else they may be without between now and Christmas, they will not be without public lighting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say how much I deplore the attacks on elderly people in their homes and I wish the Garda every success in bringing those guilty to justice.  I think the Deputy implied in some way that such attacks in Dublin city were due to the absence of public lighting.  I am afraid I would have to express doubts as to the weight of that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, the provision of <Col N="2308" /> public lighting is essentially a matter for Dublin Corporation.  As Minister of State in the Department of the Environment I am involved only where the corporation propose either installing or improving public lighting on traffic routes with the aid of the usual Exchequer road grants. In such cases the role of my Department is related to the general standard of lighting proposed, its suitability to a particular location and its acceptability as a charge on road grants.  All other matters in regard to public lighting fall within the discretion of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Traffic route lighting provides a very high level of illumination, as we see as we drive.  Its function is the safety and convenience of traffic at night and is recognised as conferring a measure of benefit in terms of accident reduction because 30 per cent to 50 per cent of night-time accidents are reduced as compared with the unlighted situation.  That will give the House an indication of what good lighting does.</P>
    <P>A change from amenity type lighting to traffic route lighting also produces benefits, again in relation to road safety. The amenity type public lighting which is provided on a wide scale on roads, other than our major roads in cities and towns and also through some villages and isolated clusters of houses, provides a lower standard of illumination.  Its value in terms of accident prevention is difficult to assess.  Its principal function is to assist pedestrian traffic at night and to provide a sense of security.</P>
    <P>Public lighting in Dublin is regarded as being of a reasonable standard.  Nobody can doubt that.  Public lighting in Dublin is not bad.  I will not say that it is not without fault or that some areas may not have it but, overall, when one travels throughout the city, it will be seen that there is a good degree of lighting in Dublin.  In the Dublin area we know that some of the thieves and muggers deliberately knock out public lighting in order to facilitate their unlawful activities.  All due credit to Dublin Corporation and their engineering staff in that for some time now, and with considerable success, <Col N="2309" /> they have selected vandal-resistant lanterns and other specialist items to counteract such actions.  Like all of these things, they are not completely vandalproof but they have brought about significant improvement in that area.</P>
    <P>In the present year Dublin Corporation will have provided £75,000 for the improvement of public lighting.  I intend to examine this figure further.  A figure of £4,500,000 is provided for maintanence and repair, in which there is included a figure of £1.3 million for electricity. Therefore, one is talking about £4.2 million for the maintenance and repair of public lighting.  If Mr. Pickett, or whoever is the relevant engineer, writes and says their money is not being provided I would have to contend that that constitutes a considerable sum of money being expended by an local authority on pure maintenance and repair. Indeed, its size has surprised me.  I should say that earlier I had asked my officials to examine that figure, to examine the whole aspect because I am not satisfied we are receiving that kind of value.  I want to establish why that sum of money or a large amount of it cannot be expended on improvements rather than maintenance.  However, that is for another day.  But one can say that that constitutes a reasonable sum for the maintenance of public lighting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made the case that there was no money, contending that some official had so written to him. I will be taking up that matter with Dublin Corporation on the basis of the information <Col N="2310" /> I have here.  But the amount of money provided represents a substantial figure.  My argument is that I do not believe we are getting value for the kind of money at present being expended. That is why I intend taking up this matter with Dublin Corporation because I am not satisfied that with the kind of money level being expended on maintenance we are getting value.  I am not happy with the position and I intend to pursue it fully.  Indeed, I thank the Deputy for having raised this matter this evening on that basis alone.</P>
      <P>I should say also that there has been no cutback on the number or standard of public lighting, nor has there been any reduction in the period of lighting.  In other words, there has been no cutback on standard or in the period of lighting time.  It is important to make that point. I am informed also that every effort is made to effect repairs with the greatest possible speed particularly where the needs are greatest and special attention is given to calls or complaints from the elderly or from other problem areas.</P>
      <P>While I am glad the question was raised, the fact that some official might contend that money is not being made available I would have to argue is wrong. As the Deputy is aware, in most of the areas about which he would be speaking other than the main traffic routes, which are the responsibility of my Department, we shall investigate and if we receive a particular request, we will make money available.  They get their block grants and make decisions at estimate time as to how to spend that money.  The Deputy is aware of this since we were both members of the same local authority.</P>
      <P>This is a matter for the local authority. I intend to take up the matter with them on the basis of the kind of money they spend on maintenance to see if we are getting value.  If additional moneys are there it is a matter for the local authority to decide how to dispose of them.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 and 185 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government established a Sub-Committee of the Central Development Committee following its decision in February of 1979 regarding measures to improve conditions on the inhabited non-Gaeltacht islands off the West coast.  The primary purpose of establishing the committee was to monitor the implementation of the various elements of the Government decision and to assist in resolving any difficulties that might arise in the course <Col N="2039" /> of such implementation.  The sub-committee met regularly through 1979 and 1980 at the end of which time positive steps had been taken by the various agencies concerned to implement the main specifics of the Government decision. Since then the view has been taken that the sub-committee, which is composed of representatives of the large number of agencies affected by the decision, should meet only when issues requiring multi-agency attention in relation to the islands arose.  The Committee last met in March of 1983 to review progress in relation to the islands generally.  Both prior to then and since then island issues involving single state agencies have been handled by the agency concerned with where the occasion arose, the assistance of the Secretariat of the Central Development Committee and the County Development Team concerned.</P>
    <P>As will be apparent from the foregoing it was not a primary function of the sub-committee to make recommendations regarding conditions on the islands but rather to monitor the implementation of Government decisions already taken; this the sub-committee has done.  However as I informed the Deputy in the Adjournment Debate on 31 October 1984 the Government continue to be keenly aware of the special difficulties which confront the inhabitants of off-shore islands.  In this regard I am happy to report, as evidence of the Government's concrete commitment to improving conditions on the islands that money was made available this year to enable the commencement of improvement works to the pier at Roonagh Point which serves Clare Island, County Mayo, and that the preparation of contract documents for the construction of a new pier at Inishbofin, County Galway, is nearing completion. Given demands on the capital allocation to the Office of Public Works for 1985, however, it is not yet possible to say when work will commence on the Inishbofin project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the Sub-Committee on <Col N="2040" /> inhabited non-Gaeltacht off-shore islands of the Central Development Committee made any recommendations regarding the provision of an air service to Inishbofin, County Galway; and if any steps will be made to implement such recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Sub-Committee of the Central Development Committee to which the Deputy refers was set up by the Government in 1979 to monitor the implementation of the Government's decision of February 1979, regarding measures to improve conditions on inhabited non-Gaeltacht islands off the West coast.  As the measures covered by the Government's decision did not include any reference to the provision of an air service to any of the islands concerned the sub-committee did not subsequently make any recommendation in relation thereto.</P>
      <P>However as a result, among other things of representations by the Deputy the Secretariat of the Central Development Committee and the Galway County Development Team examined in some detail the possibility of providing an air service to Inishbofin.  The conclusion of that examination was that the provision of an airstrip given the physical conditions on the island would be prohibitively expensive and that in any event there was almost no prospect of a viable service being established to the island even if an airstrip were constructed there.  In the event it was decided by the then Minister that the better way to improve communications to Inishbofin was to provide better landing facilities on the island.  As the Deputy will be aware the Office of Public Works is currently finalising contract documents with a view to seeking tenders for the construction of a new pier on the island.</P>
      <P>I might mention in passing that the conclusions of the examination carried out by my Department and by the Galway County Development Team were accepted by all of my predecessors since 1979 including a number of Ministers for Finance from the Deputy's own party.</P>

      <P>With the agreement, in principle, of the Government, the Office of Public Works is planning major restoration works for Dublin Castle.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, refurbishment works have previously been carried out in the State Apartments and in the east crossblock and the present plans are a logical continuation of there works.  The plans include provision of a conference hall to meet the needs of an expanded EC in 1990 and future presidencies.  When completed the scheme will not only provide much needed accommodation to meet the State's obligations in regard to the EC Presidency requirements, but will also ensure the survival of a major landmark of our heritage in historical, social and architectural terms.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to give an accurate estimate of cost for the scheme.</P>
      <P>As well as a conference hall and ancillary accommodation, the proposed scheme will provide some office space together with improved facilities for the State Apartments.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the milk cessation scheme, in the event of applications exceeding seven million gallons, preference will be given to those producers whose deliveries ceased prior to April 1984.  The balance of milk required will be obtained by conducting a ballot among the other applicants.  Successful producers who have supplied milk since April 1984 will only be granted payment on the balance of their quota entitlement for the first year.  They will of course receive payment on the basis of their full quota allowance for the remaining four years.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Government, at their meeting on 30 May 1984, approved the modified version of the ESB's five year strategic plan.  The plan set out the measures seen by the ESB as necessary to achieve substantial improvement in the economics of its operations, and was drawn up by the board and management of the ESB on their own initiative and responsibility.</P>
      <P>The original plan included proposals to close certain peat fired generating stations. Because of the obvious implications for Bord na Mona the Government insisted that the boards should get together and jointly consider the ESB proposals, and following negotiations the modified proposals, ensuring that the generation of electricity from peat fired stations is to continue with little change, emerged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2051" /> The ESB also put forward modified proposals relating to the four small 5 MW sod peat stations including that at Screebe, County Galway.  These proposals, which have been accepted by the Government, are that the stations at Gweedore and Cahirciveen would continue in operation and the stations at Miltown Malbay and Screebe would close, as proposed originally.  The ESB pointed out that the load factors at Miltown Malbay and Screebe have been low for many years due to the unsatisfactory level of sod peat deliveries.  The cost of a unit of electricity sent out from the stations is also very high &mdash; in 1983-84 a unit of electricity sent out from Screebe cost 11.09p.  The stations at Gweedore and Cahirciveen have a better unit cost.</P>
    <P>The ESB has now decided that the Screebe station will remain open to use the 1984 and 1985 turf harvests in order to afford the local producers time to seek alternative markets for their turf output.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy in the course of a debate in the House on 11 April 1984 (columns 1922&mdash;33) the procedure for assisting illiterate electors is set out in the electoral law.  Under the law the presiding officer, in marking the ballot paper of an illiterate elector, must do so in the presence of the agents of the candidates and of no other person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the booklet of instructions issued to presiding officers is to set out in layman's language the main duties to be discharged by that officer. Obviously, the booklet cannot contain any instructions which would not be in accordance with the law.  The law does not require specifically that the poll clerk or member of the Garda Síochána be excluded from the polling station while the procedure for assisting an illiterate voter is being carried out, and no difficulty appears to have arisen on this point apart from the particular case which the Deputy has raised.  The relevant paragraph of the instructions for presiding officers which was used for the European <Col N="2057" /> Elections in June, was, however, revised so as to make it clear that what is required is that the illiterate elector is not overheard in indicating his voting preference, and suggesting a general procedure for this which would not involve exclusion from the polling station of the poll clerk or the member of the Garda Síochána.  I hope that this will meet the Deputy's difficulty.  If there is need for further clarification of the legal position I will be willing to avail of a suitable occasion to bring forward proposals to achieve this.</P>

I am confident that, provided local authorities play their part in increasing efficiency and make adequate use of the powers they have to raise funds from their own resources, this level of Exchequer funding will enable services and employment to be maintained at a reasonable level.</P>

    <P>The reduction to which the Deputy refers is due to the fact that no provisions is being made in 1985 for the environment improvement works scheme.  A provision of £1.6 million (recently increased to £1.7 million) for this scheme was included in subhead G of the 1984 Vote but as this subhead has been amalgamated with the Miscellaneous Services subhead in 1985, the expenditure in question is for comparison purposes included in the 1984 provisional outturn for the latter subhead.</P>
    <P>In the context of the termination of the environment improvement works scheme it should be mentioned that local authorities will be the main sponsors of the new social employment scheme of the Department of Labour under which it is the objective that 10,000 part time workers will be employed, as announced in the national plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i></P>

At the meeting, which was held at my request, I expressed concern about the additional burden which any increase in the mortgage rate would impose on existing borrowers and at the adverse effects it would have on the housing programme, the building industry generally and potential house purchasers.  As the Deputy will be aware, the societies have since announced that a decision on any change in their mortgage rates has been deferred for the present and that the matter is being kept under review by the societies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if (a) his Department is aware that the price of coal in the Drogheda area, County Louth, has increased by £21.12 per ton plus £1.06 VAT, a total of £22.18 per ton which is an increase of 26.47 per cent from mid-January 1984; (b) if the National Prices Commission has recommended a total of £22.18 per ton since mid-January 1984; (c) if he gave sanction to the merchants in the Drogheda area to apply this total increase since mid-January 1984; (d) the amount and dates of increases granted; (e) if his Department is aware that a further increase was notified to the Drogheda Bellmen's Association of £3.08 per tonne plus VAT from 3 December 1984; (f) if an application to the National Prices Commission was made regarding this further increase; (g) if he is aware that this would mean that the price of coal will now cost £109.20 per ton including VAT; that this is a total increase of £24.20 per ton or 30.33 per cent since mid-January 1984; (h) if he agrees that these increases should not have been applied without his consent; (i) if he will make an order fixing the maximum price of coal in the Drogheda area and removing any increase effected without his consent; (j) the action if any he can take against any merchant or supplier who has been in breach of any regulation or order made by him; (k) if he is aware that this matter has been reported to the National Prices Commission on a number of occasions and that no positive action was taken against the traders concerned; (l) if he is aware of the hardship this has created in the Drogheda area and in Counties Louth and Meath; (m) what the price of coal per ton and per eight st. bag should now <Col N="2065" /> be in the Drogheda area as per his Department regulations; and (n) if he will now make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 631 and 632 together.</P>
      <P>The wholesale coal prices of the main coal importer in the Drogheda area are subject to price control.  Control on coal prices at retail level by way of maximum prices order is applied only to coal sold in sealed bags.  The current wholesale price approved for the Drogheda area is £111.38 per tonne inclusive of VAT.  This is based on the most recent recommendation of the National Prices Commission. Increases recommended by the National Prices Commission and approved since January 1984 have been as follows:</P>

    <P>The approved price per tonne prior to July 1984 was £106.79 including VAT. Approval for this level was granted in November 1982.  This price included a margin for retail selling costs which no longer applies to the main importer who I understand is no longer engaged in retail sales.</P>
    <P>The major factor which has influenced coal price movements in Ireland over the past few years has been the fluctuating cost of purchasing coal abroad and this has, of course, been influenced by movements in the value of the Irish pound relative to both the US dollar and £ sterling, the currencies in which most coal is traded.  An additional factor during the past months has been the UK miners' strike as a result of which distributors who might normally be selling English coal may have had at times to change to higher priced supplies.  Of the total <Col N="2066" /> increases approved some 93 per cent is attributable to increases in import costs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the prices recommended by the National Prices Commission were fully supported by documentary evidence of increases in costs and that a current wholesale price of £111.38 per tonne can be justified.  As this is a wholesale price an additional margin would be warranted, to cover delivery costs etc., in arriving at the retail price.  I have no evidence that retail prices charged in the Drogheda area are excessive and in fact current prices compare well with prices in other areas of the country.  In view of this, I see no need at present to make changes in the current arrangements for price control on coal in the Drogheda area.  As indicated above prepackaged coal sold in sealed bags is subject to control at retail level by way of maximum prices order.  The current VAT inclusive maximum price for a 50 kg sealed bag is £7.05 which is the equivalent of £141 per tonne.</P>
    <P>In reply to the Deputy's first question I would point out that the price of slack in the Drogheda area has not been subject to detailed price control for some years.  I understand from the main importer that the wholesale VAT exclusive price of slack increased from £53.50 to £70 per tonne during 1984.  However, as this increase was broadly in line with movements in the price of coal during the same period and since the current wholesale price is comparable with slack prices applying elsewhere in the country, I see no need to impose controls on the price of this commodity in the Drogheda area.</P>

      <P>The application in this case relates to the installation of water and sewerage facilities, the building of a chimney and the provision of an extra bedroom.  A water grant cannot be allowed because the applicant is a member of a group water scheme in respect of which a grant has already been paid by my Department.  Also since there are adequate sewerage facilities and two existing chimneys in the house, grants cannot be approved under these categories. Finally a bedroom grant cannot be approved because there is no overcrowding in the house.  The applicant was so informed on 5 April 1984.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the allegation <Col N="2076" /> in the question about chaos in the salmon fishing industry.  I am aware that in certain areas some fishermen persist in fishing illegally to the detriment of the industry and their fishermen colleagues. This illegal activity must be strongly condemned and I will not refrain from using every possible effort to deal with the situation. Fishermen are not immune from the law and those who openly defy the law governing the conservation of salmon stocks leave themselves open to heavy fines and jail sentences if convicted.</P>

In February 1983, following a competition, a letter of intent to issue such a licence was sent to a company.  As the company concerned failed subsequently to comply with the terms thereof the letter of intent was treated as withdrawn.  A second competition, the closing date for which was 31 October 1984, was organised.  The applications received are being examined and I hope to be in a position to make a decision in the matter in the near future.</P>

Prior to April 1980, some of this traffic was also processed at Drumbilla frontier post.  Records are not maintained in such a manner as would enable separate figures on the lines requested to be given in respect of the customs station in Dundalk alone, without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of official time.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the length of time required for a certificate of tax-free allowances to be issued in the case of an employee re-entering employment would depend entirely on the circumstances of the individual case.  Where all the instructions contained in Chapter 10 of the Employer's Guide to PAYE are followed there should be no appreciable delay in issuing the required certificate.  However, delays could arise where, for example, the taxpayer fails to provide all the information required by the inspector of taxes.  If the Deputy has any particular case in mind and supplies all the relevant details, I will have the matter investigated.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer's husband is in receipt of a social welfare invalidity pension, which is chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with standard practice, the aggregate tax-free allowances under PAYE are reduced to take account of the social welfare invalidity pension which is paid gross.  As the couple's total tax-free allowances for the current year are allocated for use in connection with the invalidity pension, there are no allowances available to the taxpayer for use in connection with her employment earnings.

      <P>The new extension to Ballinspittle national school is occupied and the works to the existing school are nearing completion. In October 1984 the manager of the school signified his agreement with certain revisions to the plans for the front boundary and car parking which the local authority had requested.  The manager intimated recently however that he wishes to discuss the matter further with the local authority before he reaches a final decision.  This is holding up completion of all the site works but the Office of Public Works will do all it can to bring the contract to a satisfactory conclusion at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>Medical cards are issued to persons who are unable without undue hardship to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.  The issue of a medical card is a matter for determination by the chief executive <Col N="2084" /> officer of the appropriate health board who has regard to all circumstances, relating to both income and expenditure, which may be relevant to eligibility.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up to assist chief executive officers in determining applications for medical cards and to ensure uniformity of decisions between the eight health board areas.  For the purposes of these guidelines account is taken of all income of the applicant and of his or her spouse with certain exceptions such as children's allowances.  Allowance is made for the marital status of the applicant and for the number of dependants differentiating between those aged under and over 16 years of age.  There is a special age allowance for persons over 66 years of age and this allowance is increased for persons over 80 years.  There is also an allowance for fixed outgoings on the house and for expenses necessarily incurred in travel to work.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not available in the detail set out in the question.  Several institutions cater for children as well as adults, or for more than one of the categories listed, or for one of these categories and other patients. One the basis of the information available it would not be possible to provide an analysis which would show, for instance, centre by centre the number of mentally handicapped adults and the staffs appropriate to these particular persons, distinguishing between the categories of staff mentioned.  The preparation of such an analysis would take considerable time and resources because of the latitude of the question. However, if there is some aspect of it on which the Deputy particularly wishes to obtain information, perhaps he would communicate with me and I will consider it further.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the surgical unit in the General Hospital, Wexford, is accommodated in a very old building and that the operating theatre and other facilities are very inadequate.</P>
      <P>In November 1982 the provision of a new surgical unit at the General Hospital, Wexford, was approved by my Department. The proposed new unit will consist of two new theatres and ancillary facilities, together with two ward blocks and accommodation for x-ray and casualty services and will replace the existing unsatisfactory facilities in the hospital. On 28 August last approval was conveyed to the health board to proceed to stage 5 of the planning process, i.e. preparation of bills of quantities, tendering procedures and conditions of contract.  The contract for the site development was awarded in July 1983 and this work is now complete.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at the moment to say when this project will commence. Given the time that it will take to complete the planning process it would not be possible to start the building work before January 1986 at the earliest but the precise timing of this work must await determination of the health capital programme for the next three years which is at present being considered in my Department.</P>

The figure for administrative staff includes staff employed in the Department of Health, staff at health board headquarters and staff which are closely associated with the provision of services at hospital and services levels).</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's question concerning services levels I would direct his attention to the relevant sections of the national plan <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>In relation to the health services a number of objectives have been specified in the plan.  These include a greater emphasis on health promotion, the provision of services on a community or outpatient basis wherever possible, the maintenance of a wide range of care and support services, with particular reference to children at risk, low income groups not availing of services and the disabled, and continuation of efforts to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  The health services have been substantially improved in the period since 1971.  It is intended to ensure that within the framework of the national plan the essential fabric of the services will be maintained and effect given to the proposed reorganisation of services to the extent that resources permit.</P>
    <P>The increases in costs arose from (a) the increases in staff numbers which were associated with improvements in the levels and scope of services, shorter working hours, etc. (b) pay increases and (c) price inflation.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of a contributory old age pension requires a person in the age group of the person concerned to have entered into insurance before he reached age 58 years. The Department's records show that contributions were first paid in respect of him in the 1979-80 contribution year when he was over age 60.  The local social welfare officer has been asked to investigate to ascertain if he was in employment prior to 1979 which would enable him to satisfy the qualifying conditions and a decision will be made when the investigation is completed.  In the meantime his entitlement to a non-contributory old age pension is being investigated.</P>

      <P>A claim for contribitory old age pension was received from the person concerned on 24 September 1984.  One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a claimant to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from the beginning of the year in which he entered into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached pension age.  There is no record of reckonable contributions having been paid in respect of him since 1953 and, consequently he does not have an entitlement to old age contributory pension. The PRSI Class J contributions paid in respect of him since 1980 are not reckonable for either old age contributory pension or retirement pension.  The local social welfare officer is being asked to investigate his entitlement to a non-contributory old age pension.</P>

      <P>There are a variety of means tests to determine eligibility for various social welfare, health and other services. Means assessment for social welfare entitlements, including unemployment assistance, is carried out by social welfare officers in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts and these provisions vary for different services.  The issue of medical cards to persons who are unable to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants is, under the Health Acts, a matter for determination by the chief executive officer of the health boards and means assessment for this purpose is carried out by officers of the boards.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking a person who is in receipt of unemployment assistance would also be entitled to a medical card. However, this does not necessarily follow in all cases because of the different criteria which apply and because reviews of entitlements under the two schemes are not carried out simultaneously.  The question of different means tests for different services is an area which will be addressed by the Commission on Social Welfare. However if the Deputy is aware of any particular case where he considers that hardship has occurred the matter will be investigated.</P>

      <P>As indicated in a written reply on 6 December 1983 to a question from the Deputy about this case, the claim of the person concerned to a deserted wife's payment was refused because two of the qualifying conditions for receipt of payment were not met.  A husband must have left his wife of his own volition and she must have made reasonable efforts to prevail on him to support her.  The claimant was held not to have satisfied either of these conditions.</P>
      <P>She appealed against the decision and following an oral hearing of the case an appeals officer disallowed the appeal. The claimant was notified to this effect on 22 February 1984.  An appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed in the light of new facts or fresh evidence not available to the officer at the time of the appeal hearing.</P>
      <P>A further application was received from her in August 1984.

      <P>The persons concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 21 November 1983.  Their claims were disallowed on the ground that they had insufficient contributions paid at the appropriate rate to provide cover against unemployment.  They were advised to apply for unemployment assistance on 21 November 1983, they declined to do so at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first person named by the Deputy subsequently claimed unemployment assistance on 2 July 1984 and following investigation of her means her claim was allowed from that date at the weekly rate applicable in her case of £30.90.  The second person named by the Deputy claimed unemployment assistance from 4 November 1984 and her case has been referred to a social welfare officer for determination of means.  The two applicants have requested that their means be assessed with effect from 21 November <Col N="2120" /> 1983 and the social welfare officer is making additional inquiries in this connection. When these inquiries are completed the effective date of their assessments of means will be determined by a deciding officer and any arrears of unemployment assistance due will be paid.</P>

The profit from his holding was calculated on the basis of a gross income of £2,760 per annum less £810 per annum by way of expenses incurred in earning that income.  Accordingly he was deemed to enjoy a profit of £1,950 <Col N="2135" /> per annum from his holding.  His capital amounted to £418.40 and was calculated in accordance with statutory provisions at £21.84 per annum.  On the basis of a total annual income of £1,971.84 his weekly means were calculated at £37.90 by dividing his total income by 52.  He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and on 16 October 1984 an appeals officer reduced the assessment of his means to £34.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit in respect of the period from 30 January 1984 to 9 June 1984.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is not intended to pay Gaeltacht allowance to gardaí serving in the Macroom area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the allowance was introduced in 1934 it was decided that it would be paid only in areas where Irish was the general medium of speech and where all the members of the force where proficient in <Col N="2144" /> Irish and were required to perform their duties in Irish.  The areas where the allowance was to be paid were determined on the basis of districts.  These are Garda administrative areas &mdash; each comprising five or six stations &mdash; under the supervision of superintendents.  It was not regarded as practicable to arrange for members of the force in any particular station to conduct all their duties in Irish if Irish was not also in use at the district headquarters.</P>
    <P>The allowance has continued to be paid to members at stations where it was originally paid and no change has taken place other than those brought about by the closing of stations.</P>
