      <P>Would the Minister let the Chair explain, please?  So far as the Chair knows about the matter, the Chair yesterday received a request for a debate under Standing Order No. 30 &mdash; I mentioned the number of the standing order subject to correction &mdash; on the bugging matter.  At the same time, the Chair got notice of the intention of Deputy Haughey to seek to put a Private Notice Question.  The Chair considered both matters and conveyed to the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip, Deputy Ahern, who came to his office, that both matters were under consideration.  To try to be helpful, the Chair stated that it it were decided to allow the application for a debate under Standing Order No. 30, the Private Notice Question would not be allowed because the Chair would regard it as anticipating the debate.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> What actually happened was that on the Order of Business yesterday Deputy Haughey endeavoured to ask the Tánaiste for special time for a debate.  The Taoiseach was not present.  I accepted the Chair's ruling that such a request could not be accepted on the Order of Business.  After the Order of Business, I went to the Taoiseach and suggested to him that, in view of the Leader of the Opposition's request to have a debate, I would recommend to the Taoiseach that he allow that debate in lieu of a Private Notice Question because it would be more satisfactory for the Opposition to have such a debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> In order to be helpful, I persuaded the Taoiseach to accept that, which he willingly did.  I went back to the Chief Whip of the Opposition Party and put to him that to facilitate everybody, we could extend the sitting of the Dáil by an hour-and-a-half, if necessary, in order that people on the other side and on our side could prepare properly for such a debate, if this was acceptable.  He came back and said that it was not.  It was not a pre-condition that the Private Notice Question should be withdrawn.  It was a debate in lieu of a Private Notice Question to help both sides.  It was not a threat as was suggested. It is very unfair to the Government to try to give that impression.</P>

I am absolutely clear on your ruling yesterday.  It was a perfectly fair and just ruling.  We fully accepted it.  I said by way of reply to the Taoiseach that arrangements were conducted between the Whips.  Your position was absolutely in accordance with Standing Orders.  I am asking the Taoiseach, in view of the very unsatisfactory nature of his replies yesterday and in view of subsequent information which has come to light on television and elsewhere, if he will now give us a six-hour debate.</P>

    <Title>Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Copyright Act, 1963 to increase the penalties for breach of copyright provided for in that Act.</P>
      <P>Copyright protects all kinds of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, including sound recordings, cinematograph films and broadcasting against unauthorised copying or pirating.  The Copyright Act, 1963 provides that owners of copyright protect their rights by civil actions.  There is, however, provision for certain penalties in the criminal law.  Section 27 creates offences in respect of the making, sale, hire, public exhibition, importation, except for private and domestic use, and the distribution of infringing copies of a work.  Offences are also created in respect of the making of, or possessing, a plate for making infringing copies and in respect of causing an infringing performance of a work to be given in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the offences relating to the first category which I have mentioned, the penalties provided are, on first conviction, a £5 fine for each infringing article and, on subsequent convictions, <Col N="369" /> the same fine or six months imprisonment, subject to a maximum fine of £100 in respect of articles comprised in the same transaction.  For offences relating to the making of, or possessing, a plate for making infringing copies, or the causing of an infringing performance of a work to be given in public, the penalties are, on first conviction, a fine of £100 and, on subsequent convictions, the same fine or six months imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for prosecution by summary proceedings only and the Bill before the House does not alter this position.  The Bill, however, substantially increases the amount of the fines to which I have just adverted by the substitution of £50 and £800 for the £5 and £100 fines.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the imposition, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, of a six months term of imprisonment as an alternative to or in addition to the new fine.  This is an added deterrent as the existing legislation only permits of a fine or a term of imprisonment. The objective of these increased penalties for which the Bill provides is to combat piracy of copyright works, particularly &mdash; this is most relevant in these times &mdash; through the medium of video tapes.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, section 27 of the Act contains provisions about seizure and search for infringing copies of copyright works.  If the District Court is satisfied by information on oath that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that an offence is being committed on any premises, the Court may grant a search warrant authorising a member of the Garda Síochána to enter the premises, if need be by force, and to seize any copies of any work or any plates in respect of which he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence is being committed.</P>
    <P>The Act also provides that the District Court, if satisfied by evidence that there is reasonable ground for believing that infringing copies of a copyright work are being hawked, carried about, sold or offered for sale, may by order authorise a member of the Garda Síochána to seize the copies without warrant and to bring them before the court which may order <Col N="370" /> them to be destroyed or delivered up to the owner of the copyright.</P>
    <P>I believe that the increased penalties proposed in the Bill, coupled with the existing provisions in the legislation relating to seizure and search for infringing articles, will go a long way to meet the problems being caused particularly for cinemas, film distributors and legitimate video dealers whose businesses are being damaged at present by the operations of video pirates.</P>
    <P>The additional provision enabling the courts to impose both fines and imprisonment terms is intended as a strengthened deterrent to counter the more serious copyright infringement activities which deprive the rightful owners of copyright in the works concerned of the royalty payments that are their due.  It is apparent that employment in the cinema industry is being eroded by the present upsurge of illegal screenings of video films.  The persons who engage in these unlawful activities often obtain pre-recorded cassettes produced by film makers specifically for private use and show them in public without the authority of the producer or copyright owner.  Alternatively, these lawbreakers may get illegally copied cassettes at cheap rates.  These could be of an inferior quality which do not reflect the full artistry and technical skills put into the original work by the producer which cost him perhaps many millions of pounds to make.</P>
    <P>It is claimed by interests in the cinema industry that recent well-known films, such as <i>Gandhi, E.T.</i> and <i>Tootsie,</i> had country-wide distribution in Ireland on illegal video tapes.  This is a situation of serious concern both financially for the cinema trade and because of the employment implications for that trade.</P>
    <P>Illegal video cassettes are also a matter of concern to legitimate video dealers who can show that pirated copies are circulated before the films from which they are copied are issued for general release to the cinemas in the State.  This leads to serious loss of sales of legitimate tapes.  It is a matter of concern to the Government that pirate cassettes carry no royalties for legitimate business interests, and VAT or corporation tax are not <Col N="371" /> paid to the Exchequer.  I understand from figures made available to me that a pirate cassette can be produced for as little as £8 and sold at up to £29, a profit of £21.</P>
    <P>It must not be overlooked that the central concept of our copyright legislation is that enforcement of their rights is a matter for copyright owners themselves to pursue through the courts.  This has, in fact, been happening.</P>
    <P>The increased penalties contained in this Bill will strengthen the hand of legitimate interests in protecting their rights and accordingly I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I regard this legislation as quite important for the development of legitimate film making.  Many of us here in the House will be aware that very considerable costs are involved in making a film and we have been trying here in Ireland, so far with only relatively modest success, to develop a native film industry.  Clearly it is very important for the development of a native film industry that people who invest their time and money in making a film would feel that they would be able to achieve an income from that film in the form of royalties from the display in public of the film.  Present copyright legislation does not provide an adequate assurance of a return to the film maker for the very substantial expenditure he will have undertaken in making a film.</P>
    <P>I regard this legislation not just as undoubtedly necessary to protect existing rights but also as providing a useful foundation for the development of a native film industry here.  I regard the possibility of the development of a native film industry in Ireland as quite considerable.  The marked success of the Australian film industry from very modest beginnings is clearly an indication of what is possible in this area.  All that is necessary is for one to get a reputation for being a source of good films on the basis of a number of good products and one can see quite quickly the development of an industry here and the development of an anxiety by people who have film scripts and ideas to have those films made in the country where success has been marked.  Also worth noting in the case of Australia is <Col N="372" /> that many of the films produced there have been based on insights into the Australian way of life and I am sure that we also have much to recommend us in this regard as a base for film making.  I hope to give considerable attention to this in the future.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the present Bill is concerned, <i>inter alia,</i> with the pirating of films for which increased fines are being provided.  When I was considering this matter during the preparation of the Bill it occurred to me that it would be desirable to have a national repository where copies of all films of Irish interest could be kept.  Shortly I will be having discussions with the Irish Film Board about the details of such a film deposit arrangement.  The Irish Film Board Act, 1980, has a provision enabling the board to engage in such an activity.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should inform the House that I am considering a few other legislative provisions which I hope to finalise shortly and to deal with by way of amendment on Committee Stage of this Bill.  I have still to settle the terms in consultation with the Attorney General, but I will arrange that the necessary amendments will be circulated well in advance of Committee Stage, if they are to be circulated, to give other Deputies in the House an adequate opportunity of considering them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this Copyright (Amendment) Bill as a totally inadequate response to a well-documented problem that exists in Ireland today.  It is extraordinary considering the penultimate remarks of the Minister, that he did not take the opportunity afforded him of doing something entirely more detailed as far as the original Bill of 1963 is concerned. Not only is it inadequate, but the amendments as outlined by the Minister in the Bill will not deal in any substantial way with what is now a national problem, that is, piracy.  The easiest way to put that to the Minister is to tell him that an illegal operator can duplicate 100 tapes a day &mdash; that I understand from the trade, is easy going &mdash; and he can sell them at about £25 each.  Consequently that indicates in easy figures that the illegal operator <Col N="373" /> can make tapes to the tune of 2,000 per day and his outlay would be no more than £500 for the blank tapes.  Therefore, it is possible to make £2,000 profit per day and this can be accommodated with the use of no more than 10 machines which can take up an area which I understand is no bigger than a room ten feet by eight feet.  That is the basic problem that should be considered.</P>
      <P>Enormous profits are to be made in the piracy business.  The response of the Minister in this amending Bill of increasing the fines is certainly not a deterrent to those in the business.  It rules out the old axiom of making the punishment fit the crime.  The legitimate business is going bust and cannot compete with the pirates, and the Bill does not offer them any consolation.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that the original legislation which was introduced in 1963 was in need of updating when one considers the technological advances that have taken place since then in that area. This is an appropriate time to deal in a comprehensive manner with the copyright issue.  I regret the Minister did not avail of this opportunity to deal with that. Video piracy now accounts for more than 50 per cent of the total video market.  I am not just concerned about the effect it is having on the film industry or the video making industry because we must also bear in mind the huge loss of revenue to the State as a result of the operations of video pirates.  When one takes that into consideration, and the fact that a 35 per cent VAT rate applies to videos, one can see the huge loss of revenue to the Exchequer because of the inefficient and ineffective measures outlined in the original legislation and the amendment before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that video piracy does not operate to a great extent in the reputable stores and retail outlets but the Minister can take it from me that a large proportion of the total throughput in stock of the small outfits is pirated.  That is well documented and I understand that a submission on that has been sent to the Minister by interested parties.  Most of the stock held by small operators is pirated. The worst form of piracy, as indicated <Col N="374" /> by the Minister, is the pirating of major feature films.  That piracy is forcing major film companies to release on screen and video simultaneously.  There is no doubt that this dual release is affecting cinema receipts.  There has been a fall off in cinema receipts and it is well recognised that one of the reasons for that is that pirates are bringing forward for sale and hire copies of the original film long before the distributors or makers of the film consider it economically advisable to have the videos released.</P>
    <P>It is possible for publichouses, and such places, to show videos that have not been released for general video release.  The Bill before us will not deter such people from continuing to operate in this way.  It has long been recognised that the law should be brought up to date to deal with video piracy.  It was expected that the penalties in the Bill would go some way towards dealing with that problem and that the offences being committed by the pirates would be dealt with by the imposition of penalties that would equate to the offence.  Large sums of money are being made by video pirates here.  A lot of it is underhand but I should like to tell the House the amount of money we are talking about.  The legitimate market here for video sales and hire is about £5 million per annum in the hiring business and the remainder in the retail.  We must bear in mind that 95 per cent of the traffic in videos is in the hiring area with only 5 per cent in the retail area.  It is easy to recognise from that that considerable sums of money are lost to the Exchequer because we do not have adequate deterrents to deal with video piracy.  It is well known that the illegal market, particularly in the hire of videos, is as large as the legitimate side of the business.</P>
    <P>The distributors have complained relentlessly against the operation of piracy. To date about 50 cases have been brought against illegal operators and it is estimated that those cases meant £100,000 in costs on those seeking to redress the rampant piracy here.  Damages have been granted but they have not been sufficient to put illegal operators out of business.  That is why the Bill is so disappointing.  It is estimated that the <Col N="375" /> provisions of the Bill will not be a sufficient deterrent to put these people out of business once and for all.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that £1,000 per week is not regarded as an enormous amount of profit to be made by a single operator in the piracy business. It only takes 1,000 customers at £1 each in the distribution ring to give that type of profit.  I am not referring to the manufacturing side of piracy but the distribution side.  Therefore, huge profits are being made in the manufacture and distribution of these videos.  When one considers that a distribution ring of 1,000 is very small one can imagine the huge loss of revenue in that area as well as in the manufacturing side.  I can bet that tax is not being paid on the purchase of such pirated videos.  I have no doubt that neither VAT nor income tax is paid by the perpetrators of this devilment.  Certainly, royalties are not being paid to the film producers who make the original film. The penalties would have been the short-term solution to this problem. Unfortunately, the limits in the Bill will not deal with it.  In the long term the Minister should indicate that he is prepared to review the legislation dealing with copyright because it is out of date in this and many other areas such as international literary, artistic and musical arrangements.</P>
    <P>As the law stands &mdash; this may interest the Minister &mdash; the making of home copies by ordinary individuals could be deemed illegal under the 1963 Act.  Section 18 (4) (a) should be looked at in regard to this.  All legitimate owners of videos could be held to be acting illegally if they use their machine to make a copy of anything.  The Minister said he would support a film industry growing up similar to the one that has proved successful in Australia and I am sure there are some incidents that would form the basis for some good films here if we took note of all the happenings in the political arena in recent days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, if he was serious, could have availed of the opportunity to make changes in the Act dealing with copyright and that might have made money available to help out that flagging industry.  It would not be too difficult to suggest one means whereby quite a bit of money could be generated.  If there was a small levy on some of the blank tapes sold that money could be channelled back into the film industry by way of grant. This would mean we could create many new products and there might not be such a great need for Exchequer funding for a filming industry which is all the time looking for Government support.</P>
      <P>We are not just talking about videos which are being shown on video machines at home and in other places; there are also audio tapes.  A substantial Irish industry is being ripped off by up to about 50 per cent of the total market.  This can be easily established when one considers that the blank tape sales in this country exceed the recorded music tape sales. You can bet your life that those who are using a substantial number of blank tapes in the cassette area are not paying recording rights.  There is a question to be answered &mdash; home taping as against commercial use &mdash; and I do not think the Minister's response will deal satisfactorily with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the Deputy suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalty limits outlined by the Minister bear no relation to the extent of illegal profits being made by illegal operators.  It could be said that piracy of all kinds dealt with by the Copyright Act 1963 is a growth industry, with no Exchequer revenue take.  I would have thought the Minister would be conscious of the money that could have been made available to the Exchequer if he had gone about his business in a more determined way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give the figures.  A recent raid by those trying to suppress the continuing escalation of piracy produced 700 tapes. The original fines outlined in section 27 referred to £5 per tape to a maximum of <Col N="377" /> 20 tapes, making £100.  Does this mean that the £50 fine for each tape can be multiplied by 700?  That would be a substantial penalty, or does it mean that the maximum for any one transaction in any one take, irrespective of the number of tapes taken, would be £800 in fines?  If it does, this is a reduction in the <i>pro rata</i> scaling of the original fines, or does the £800 cover one raid and all tapes scooped in that raid can be classed as one transaction under section 27 of the Original Act?  This would mean that the thousands of pounds that could have been taken could be quantified as £800.  If the Minister thinks an £800 fine is a deterrent to illegal operators who can make £2,000 profit a day making these tapes and £1,000 a week from hiring them, he has another think coming.</P>
    <P>There is no problem as far as I am concerned in marketing pirated merchandise in this country.  Most of it is done by way of under-the-counter operations.  I would like to enlighten the Minister as to the current way of disposal and hiring of videos both in this city and in many of the larger towns throughout the country. They are being hired out of the backs of cars in a systematic way in local authority and bigger housing estates.  This is well organised and well funded, whether internally or externally.  The fines proposed today are a joke as far as those people are concerned.  The biggest loser is the Government.  No income tax is being paid by any of the people operating this illegal business, and there is no VAT on returns or purchases.  The other big loser is the Irish public.  In the first instance they have to endure a second-rate product because the quality of many of these pirated tapes is appalling.  Firstly, these tapes are illegally procured and good copies are not being made because they do not have the proper originals. The extent of this problem has to be highlighted, and in his speech the Minister did not give it the prominence it warranted.</P>
    <P>It is reckoned that duplication of videos is going on at a very high level north of the Border.  This is evident from a series of raids which took place not so long ago.  In one day 35,000 copies of <Col N="378" /> illegal pirated tapes were scooped by the authorities.  Let us come a little closer home: in County Kerry seven premises were raided in one day and 2,500 illegal pirated tapes were taken by the authorities from houses, public houses and some legitimate shops as well.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Federation against Copyright Theft have been very active in this area and they expect the support of the Government and the Minister in dealing with what is for them a crisis situation and they have expended enormous sums of money proceeding against illegal operators. But it is very difficult under the existing legislation to take the action necessary to get a quick result.  First, they have to prove to the court the infringement of copyright.  They get a court order, show it to the proprietor of the place where the illegal viewing is going on, and take back the infringing material but a very substantial burden of proof has to be made before it is possible even to get that permission to move.</P>
    <P>Section 27 (4) concerning the application of the owner to the District Court says that the court may authorise the Garda to seize the copies without warrant and bring them before the court.  Under subsection (5) the raid has to be conducted by a Garda inspector and accompanied by members of the Garda.  Is it not ludicrous that subsection (5) suggests that a premises can only be entered for the purpose of getting these illegal tapes between the hours of 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.? That is somewhat outdated.  If the Minister was serious in bringing forward a deterrent whereby the Garda could deal with this speedily and effectively, then there are certain subsections of this Act that warranted attention other than section 27 (1) and (2).</P>
    <P>It would appear also that there is very little restriction on movement of goods across the Border in this field of activity. A lot of dealers simply cross the Border bringing back these pirate video tapes with them; they are being made here, they are being made beyond.  There is obviously a very lucrative cross-Border business going on as well.  One can bet one's life that these are cash operators with no return to the State as far as they <Col N="379" /> are concerned.  Whatever the Minister says about <i>Gandhi, E.T.</i> or <i>Tootsie</i> as presenting considerable difficulty in that the original films were copied and pirated &mdash; and as the House is aware that can be done even in an existing cinema with the most rudimentary equipment and subsequently recopied; ten machines can yield one a profit of £2,000 a day &mdash; there is a much bigger problem being encountered with regard to other types of films.  Those to which I refer are those commonly referred to as the nasties.  Whether we like it or not there is a substantial market for this kind of rubbish in this country today.  I put it to the Minister that if the Government or his office will say to the legitimate distributors what is acceptable in this area and what is not, those distributors will not import matters that will infringe his or their recommendations. Everything barred in the United Kingdom in so far as these nasties or blue films are concerned is not being brought into this country by legitimate distributors.  If the Government would only say what titles they do not want imported then the legitimate distributors would be more than happy to accommodate them as far as their importation is concerned.  The customs people will not say what are the banned titles because it is obvious that they have not been educated as to what is on or what is not.  Have the customs or the people at entry points to this country been informed or have they got a list of the titles not acceptable for distribution here?  They have not and they cannot say to the legitimate distributors what is and what is not permitted.  They should be told and the legitimate operators should be given the opportunity of coming to terms with what is a very difficult and worsening situation.</P>
    <P>The Irish public now have available to them, through the piracy network, the most astonishing range of blue movies. This may be part of the under-counter under-cover operation, but we might as well face the fact that this is now taking place in substantial proportions.  It is important that the Minister be on record as discrediting this illegal operation in filth affecting many of our towns and <Col N="380" /> cities today.  The unfortunate thing about it is the effect these blue movies are having on individuals and groups.  We must take whatever measures are necessary to protect the innocent from their worst ravages. It will have to be said &mdash; and I am pleased that the Minister for Justice is present &mdash; that there must be and there is some direct relationship between these violent and horrific videos and certain types of crimes being committed in some of our larger urban areas.  These blue movies are horrific in the way they depict violence against the person in areas of sexuality, so that young, impressionable people are encouraged to accept the standards being exploited by these blue movies.  It is giving a misguided view and encouraging a misguided attitude amongst impressionable people of what proper sexual relationships should be between men and women.  They are having a disastrous effect on young people. These blue movies brutalise women and the feminist cause as well.  They glamorise a distorted attitude of what should be the proper attitude between the sexes. They glamorise also high living standards that can be attained, according to the substance of these blue movies through burglary, murder and illicit areas.  The time is long past for taking the most serious action in dealing with the perpetrators of this filth in our towns and cities. This Bill is not sufficient to meet that demand.</P>
    <P>As we know &mdash; and the Minister for Justice knows this &mdash; the percentage of films censored is very small anyway.  I am not trying to take away from the fact that parental control is vital in making available to young people only what they should see.  But when films of this nature are being shown in public places, when huge profits are being made, then the traffickers of dirt and filth will take the chances and risks because the profits are so high.  We should deal with them in similar fashion and the only way to do so is to break them financially.</P>
    <P>There is one matter appertaining to the principal Bill I should like to raise.  It does not concern piracy or video nasties but it is one that might very well be of considerable importance before too long. <Col N="381" /> I should like the Minister's advice on this matter, that is about the publication of the <i>Official Reports</i> of these Houses.  I take it they would be regarded as a literary work, in most instances anyway.  As I understand the definitions section of the original Bill they would come within the scope of what would be regarded as literary work.  If that is the case, could it not be established, under the original Act, that their copyright be vested in the Government or in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?  Does permission have to be sought from the Controller of Government Publications or from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to allow reporting of proceedings in these Houses to be written up in newspapers, periodicals and whatever and as well stills of proceedings here to be shown either on television screens or video without acknowledging the fact that permission had been sought to use the copyright?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I am anxious to put on record that I do not regard the amendment as outlined by the Minister as a sufficient deterrent to deal with what is a great problem, for all the reasons which I have given.  Perhaps the Minister, as he has indicated that there might be some amendments which he will be considering in this regard, would consider amending the fines and penalties as outlined in the Bill before the House?  I can readily see that it is only a stop-gap measure to deal, as the Minister says, with questions of <Col N="383" /> piracy and perhaps nasties, which have become very prevalent in our society. However, I do not think that this Bill will go anywhere near making the punishment fit the crime.  For that reason, although I accept the Bill in principle, it is necessary to update the fine to deal with this very serious problem.  I do not think that the Minister has gone far enough.  Perhaps he might give me some consolation by saying that he would consider putting in a Government amendment to adjust these penalties?</P>

      <P>Deputy Flynn has made two suggestions as to how the Bill to which he is referring could be improved to provide more effective remedies, in his view, to the problem of video piracy.  These two were, firstly, an overall review of the copyright legislation and, secondly, an increase in the penalties.  It is all too easy for Deputies to grandiloquently say that there should be an overall review of the legislation.  I would have hoped that Deputy Flynn would have been more specific in saying precisely what aspects of the existing legislation he would have liked to see changed.  One should not resort to the let-out of talking about an overall review unless one has something rather more specific in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall deal now with the one substantial point which he made in this area, that is in regard to the level of fines.  The fines in respect of the events described are being increased substantially.  In the case of crimes for making, selling, hiring or exhibiting in public, importing or distributing material, the fine is being increased from £5 to £50 &mdash; an increase of 900 per cent.  The fine for having a plate for making infringing copies or for causing an infringing performance of a work to be given to the public is being increased from £100 to £800, which is an increase of 700 per cent.  I can tell the Deputy and the House that I am prepared, between <Col N="384" /> now and Committee Stage, to examine whether or not fines could be further increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that we have carefully considered in advance the possibility of having slightly larger fines. However, the scope is not perhaps as great as might be thought, particularly in regard to fines for the making of a plate for making infringing copies or causing an infringing performance of work to be given in public.  That is now £800.  I am prepared to contemplate going up to £1,000 on Committee Stage, without much difficulty.  However, if it were increased beyond £1,000, I am advised by the Attorney General that no longer would it be possible to bring proceedings on a summary basis.  One would have to seek conviction by indictment.  Because of the substantial delays involved in the courts and in preparing a case for indictment, which is a more comprehensive procedure than that concerning summary proceedings, I am advised that one could, in fact, be waiting for up to a year.  The Attorney General has consulted on this matter and his view is that trial on an indictment charge could take over a year to come to court, leaving the pirate free to continue his activities during that time. Meanwhile the offender under our law can be summarily charged from time to time, leaving himself liable on conviction to a maximum fine of £800 on each occasion. In the Attorney General's view this appears to be an adequate deterrent because the pirate could be taken to court more often on summary proceedings. This is an important consideration which Deputy Flynn might like to bear in mind in preparation for Committee Stage debate.  However, I would indicate that I am quite willing to look at the level of the fines within that constraint to see if they can be increased somewhat further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are provisions under section 27 (5) for the seizure of the goods in question, which provisions are quite important.  It should not be ignored that, in addition to the criminal proceedings which I have mentioned, the owners of the copyright have the right to take civil proceedings against these people. That could be quite important, also Deputy Flynn also asked whether the provisions under section 18 (4) (a) prevented ordinary video owners from making a film for their own use.  I am advised that the private recording of a film for private use is not an offence under existing legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the very worrying problem of video nasties which contravene the censorship legislation and which can cause serious psychological damage to young people who see them. In reply to a parliamentary question on 30 November 1983 the Minister for Justice told the House he was having the adequacy of the law for the control of such video films examined so that decisions could be taken on new legislation or administrative measures to deal with the problem.  He also referred to convictions for the display of uncensored video films in public places and the successful efforts by the customs authorities to prevent the importation into the State of a considerable number of objectionable films.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently the Minister of State at the Department of Justice dealt more <Col N="386" /> fully with this issue in a debate in the Seanad towards the end of the year.  The Deputy can be assured that the Minister for Justice is taking this matter as seriously as it deserves to be taken.  I hope that, to the extent that this legislation is helpful, it will also move in the same direction in tandem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

Recently they suggested that the proposed five year review pattern is still unsatisfactory since there is no genuine market for leases of this nature.  They said the only leases of this sort regularly granted are those created by Dublin Corporation on industrial estates.  They felt that, even if the review at five year intervals was going ahead, since there seemed to be general acceptance of the five year standard care should be taken to monitor the five year period with a view to keeping it in line with the practice in the market.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland must have a flexible economy if it is to increase its share of world trade. Unless we increase our share of world trade we will not be able to create jobs.</P>
      <P>This message must be constantly hammered home.  We must compete, we must win orders, we must have the most efficient production system in Europe.  Only on this basis can we provide jobs for a population that is increasing much faster than is that of our neighbours.</P>
      <P>Appeals to sentiment carry no weight in the marketplace nor does it serve any purpose to talk about our &ldquo;rights&rdquo; to work, to access to markets, or to regional aid.  These rights are only valuable if we have the strength to avail of them.  We must build that strength by building a competitive industry, a competitive agriculture and a competitive service sector.</P>
      <P>We must put our present unemployment problems in context.  In part they are the result of the success of our economy.  Our economy has been a success in developing some very highly productive businesses in the export sector. Our economy has also been a success in beating the emigration problem and in providing a basis for population growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this success we are now going through a transitional phase wherein there is a growth in unemployment. This growth in unemployment can be overcome if we are flexible enough <Col N="390" /> and prepared to take risks in adopting new approaches to the problem.</P>
    <P>The growth in unemployment is in large measure due to growth in population. This has occurred because of the ending of emigration which has been a feature of Irish life from 1800 to 1960, and to a rapid growth in the birth rate rising from earlier age of marriage in Ireland since about 1960.</P>
    <P>The existence of these factors is borne out by the fact that while unemployment grew by 28,000 in 1983 only 10,000 of this was due to the recession and 18,000 to the growth in the labour force.  Each year, 18,000 more people seek jobs for the first time than retire.</P>
    <P>Seen in this context, the growth in unemployment is part of the price we must pay for the transition to a much more successful Irish economy than was the pattern from 1800 to 1960.  This does not minimise the problem or make it any easier to solve, but it does provide an antidote to the mindless pessimism and hopelessness that is displayed by some commentators in the face of the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>We are also confronted with changes in technology which are changing the nature of work.  Many of the boring and repetitive tasks which people did in the past can now be done by machines.  The educational system must now prepare people for more creative and challenging work in a competitive environment.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken a number of important steps in this context which will help us beat the unemployment problem. First, we have introduced an Enterprise Allowance Scheme which will help unemployed people to set up their own business.  Secondly, we are reforming the education system through the establishment of a curriculum board which will make education more in touch with modern employment demands.  Thirdly, we are encouraging investment in productive business by tax incentives and removal of tax-breaks for unproductive activity like bond-washing.  Fourthly, we have appointed a team of Ministers of State, from Fisheries, Agriculture, Industry and Trade and Foreign Affairs to work out an <Col N="391" /> integrated strategy for the development of the food industry.</P>
    <P>The accumulated difficulties with public expenditure could well be illustrated by the following facts.  First, all of this year's income tax will be used up in servicing the interest and capital of debts inherited from previous years.  Thus, to run the State, the Government will have to rely either on new borrowing or on the revenue from other taxes apart from income tax.  Secondly, we have become accustomed to higher levels of public expenditure than we really can afford. Britain has a national health service, yet there are only nine beds per thousand of population in Britain whereas in Ireland, without a free health service, we have almost 14 beds for every thousand people in the population.  This is why so much of our money is absorbed every year in the health service costs.  Government spending thus needs a very searching examination if we are to achieve a long-term reduction in tax levels.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the new Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure is doing a very good job in getting to the root of the excess of Government expenditure.  It is working on an all-party basis which is very valuable indeed.</P>

I have a letter here from a girl aged 14 or 15 asking me if there will be any jobs for her and her contemporaries when they leave school in 1987 and, if not, what kind of life they can expect as unemployed people.  These two questions have more and more been occupying our minds.  If the expectations of young people have been raised to expect that <Col N="392" /> Government can automatically supply jobs for them, they will be greatly disillusioned. I do not believe that Government can create jobs for all our young people.  The private sector will be the main source of employment in the future. It is important that young people be told that whether they obtain jobs will depend on their own genius.  I answered this young girl by telling her that she would have to do well in the leaving certificate examination in 1987 because she would be competing with other people for the jobs available and would have to rely on her own talents.</P>
    <P>To her second question regarding the kind of life to be expected as unemployed people I replied as follows:</P>
    <P>If I may say so, you are showing a somewhat defeatist attitude in assuming that you will be one of those who will be unemployed.  However, if you are prepared to sit back and let someone else find work for you you may well be waiting for a long time.  You have natural talents.  You may well be called on to use them, whether they be musical, academic, mechanical.  There are plenty of opportunities to further your education and if you are an ambitious person then nothing should hold you back because very few people who are really ambitious enough to be prepared to work to carve out a career for themselves do not succeed.</P>
    <P>It is important to create a climate where people can succeed.  Our tax structure makes this very difficult.  Profit has become a dirty word.  We want successful firms which will expand and take on more employees.  Our tax system is now structured in such a way that for every employee a firm take on they are futher taxed.  The employers' contribution to PRSI has been increased by 0.5 per cent, bringing tax on employment to 12 per cent.  It would be in the Government's interest to examine carefully the whole question of corporation profits tax and other taxes which are levied against firms.</P>
    <P>Recently I made representations to the Minister for Finance in relation to firms which employ travellers.  I referred to one <Col N="393" /> company which employs 35 travellers and supplies them with cars.  In 1974 the allowance to a firm for the purchase of a car was £3,500.  One cannot buy any car for that sum these days.  The minimum would be about £5,500 for the very simplest of cars and travellers who clock up considerable mileage in the course of a year cannot use the cheapest cars.  I would ask the Minister to increase the allowance to these companies; otherwise they will have to let some travellers go, thus adding to the numbers unemployed. It is reasonable to allow a company an increase in the amount which can be claimed for the purchase of cars for employees.  It is a vital part of any company's business strategy that they have sufficient people selling their goods around the country.  Perhaps the Minister would consider this matter before bringing in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>A matter to which I have given some thought is the number of young people on the dole.  I listened yesterday to a radio interview with the Minister for Labour and I was very much in agreement with what he said about young people wanting to work.  It is soul destroying for a person to leave the education system and fail to find employment. The Government should work out a scheme for environmental works which would give employment to young people. The work might not be what they want or suitable to their educational qualifications but it would be far healthier to employ them on such schemes rather than let them sit at home doing nothing, staying in bed until late in the day because they have lost all confidence.  It would be better for these people and for the country generally if they were given work. They should be given an amount of money equivalent to the dole.  I disagree with the Minister for Labour when he said that the amount payable should be in accordance with trade union rates.  The therapy of work would be far more beneficial than payment for doing nothing.</P>
    <P>In 1956 Dublin Corporation introduced special works schemes to deal with the high rate of unemployment.  We must do likewise.  We should have some form of public service by these young people. <Col N="394" /> We are not a wealthy nation and we have considerable financial difficulties.  Our roads are in a very bad way and many other works need to be carried out.  We have the manpower, and the Government will have to tell the trade unions where any resistance occurs to these special schemes that they will have to allow these young people to work.</P>
    <P>People today have to face the high cost of foodstuffs.  I am glad the Government did not remove the subsidies on food.  I believe they should continue to keep a very careful eye on certain basic foodstuffs such as bread and milk.  They should make sure that the price of these items is not allowed to rise.</P>
    <P>It has been said many times that our future lies in our young people.  We must be much more realistic about what we tell them.  The most important thing is to encourage them to create their own opportunities.  Our whole tax system needs to be looked at again.  If we fail to make some strong decisions and take whatever action is necessary, we will live to regret it.  It is important that we recognise this.  There were a number of other things which I hoped to say but I did not expect to have to speak so soon.  I did not expect the Bills before us this morning to be finished so rapidly.  I have not my notes with me and I have just tried to recall most of the things I would like to say.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Road Traffic Bill yesterday there was an important point which I omitted to make and I would now like to refer to it.  I would like to suggest to the Minister for Finance another good way to raise money since the precedent has been set by the Revenue Commissioners. People can have their cars confiscated for smuggling goods across the Border or for driving a car owned by anybody else, so the precedent for confiscating cars is already there.  Perhaps the Government might have a look at confiscating the cars driven by uninsured drivers. There are some people who own old bangers and they will not worry too much about losing them so they will not insure them.  It will not stop some people driving around in them by increasing the penalties for driving uninsured cars to £1,000. <Col N="395" /> When their premiums are £400 and £500 they will not be so much out of pocket if they are caught.  The Minister in the House at the moment might convey this suggestion to his colleagues because I doubt very much if my speech will be read by any of them.  As a way of making sure that money is paid for taxing and insuring cars, confiscation of cars might be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will convey the suggestion to my colleagues. Ba mhaith liom i dtosach an cheist maidir le Vóta Roinne na Gaeltachta a phlé.</P>
      <P>Is léir go bhfuil ag éirí leis an mbeartas ar ghlac an Rialtas leis an bhliain seo caite agus gur féidir linn a bheith ag súil le dul chun cinn níos mó fós i mbliana. Dá bharr sin d'fhéadfaí a rá go raibh cáinaisnéis na bliana seo níos boige ná cáinaisnéis na bliana anuraidh ach ní ion-ann é sin agus a rá nach bhfuil fadhbanna againn fós.  Tá éirithe leis an Rialtas méadú mór sa leibhéal cánach a sheachaint trí dhiansmacht a choimeád ar mhéid na n-iasachtaí agus trí ghearradh siar a dhéanamh chomh fada agus ab fhéidir ar chaiteachas i gcúrsaí riaracháin. Dá thoradh sin beidh ardú níos lú ná 1 faoin gcéad sa bhliain reatha ar an gcostas maireachtála de bharr na cáinaisnéise, rud a thabharfaidh deis dúinn dul i ngleic tuilleadh leis an ráta boilscithe a bhí mar a bheadh bró muilinn timpeall orainn chomh fada sin ag creimeadh aon dul chun cinn a bhí á dhéanamh.  Don chéad uair le fada tá éirithe linn tabhairt faoi réiteach a fháil ar chuid dár bhfadhbanna bunúsacha agus céimeanna dearfacha a ghlacadh lena réiteach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh áthas ar gach duine a thuigeann na fadhbanna a bhí romhainn anuraidh go bhfuil ré na n-iasachtaí &mdash; mar leigheas ar an ngátar airgid a bhí ag brú orainn &mdash; thart agus go bhfuil cúrsaí airgeadais an Stáit á gcur ar shlí a réitithe.  Má éiríonn linn bonn buan seasmhach a chur faoi chúrsaí eacnamaíochta na tíre, agus tá dóchas agamsa go bhfuil dul chun cinn nach beag déanta, beifear in ann na toscaí <Col N="396" /> a sholáthar a chuirfidh fostaíocht shoch-rach ar fáil de réir mar a fheabhsóidh cúrsaí &mdash; go háirithe do dhaoine óga.</P>
    <P>Aithnítear go coitianta, ar ndóigh, an fhadhb atá ann ó thaobh na fostaíochta de, agus dá bharr sin, táthar ag iarraidh féachaint chuige go gcaithfear an t-airgead atá ar fáil ar bhealaí fiúntacha amháin d'fhonn torthaí réalaíocha a bhaint amach agus poist sheasmhacha a chruthú in ionad an t-airgead sin a bheith á chur amú ar thograí nach mbeadh inmharthana choíche.  Tá beartais nua glactha freisin chun cúnamh a thabhairt do na tionscail sin a bhfuil deacrachtaí orthu faoi láthair agus le spreagadh a thabhairt do thionscail nua.  Tá scéimeanna tábhachtacha ceadaithe freisin ar mhaithe leis an tionscal tógála, rud a chabhróidh go mór le fostaíocht a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá iarracht déanta chomh maith sa cháinaisnéis chun cúnamh a thabhairt do na daoine sin ar ioncam íseal atá ag íoc cánach: ní bheidh cáin le híoc feasta ag 15,000 de na daoine sin.  Tá éirithe leis an Rialtas na liúntais chánach a ardú agus, gí beag an faoiseamh a d'hféadfaí a thabhairt, is tús maith é nach mór fáilte a chur roimhe.  De réir mar a éireoidh linn smacht ceart a fháil ar chúrsaí caiteach-ais, tá dóchas ann go bhféadfar cur de réir a chéile leis an bhfaoiseamh sin ar mhaithe le lucht cánach Íoc mar a Thuillir, sé sin PAYE.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar déanta sa cháinaisnéis freisin le haghaidh méaduithe sna rátaí leasa shóisialaigh.  Nuair a smaoinítear ar na harduithe a tugadh anuraidh agus nuair a ghlactar leis go bhfuil an ráta boilscithe á smachtú is léir go mbeidh cosaint mhaith don bhliain atá romhainn ag na daoine sin atá ag brath go mór ar an gcóras leasa shóisialaigh.</P>
    <P>Táim sásta go mbeadh sé soiléir do dhuine ar bith a dhéanfadh scrúdú ar an gcáinaisnéis go bhfuil comharthaí dóchais le feiceáil inti do na blianta atá le teacht. Is léir nach sárófar fadhbanna na tíre mura dtuigfidh an pobal go soiléir géarchéim na faidhbe agus mura mbeidh a gcomhoibriú ar fáil lena réiteach.  Táim sásta go mbeidh an comhoibriú sin le fáil agus, cé go bhfuil roghanna deacra romhainn fós, beidh forbairt agus dul chun <Col N="397" /> cinn i ndán dár muintir uile má éiríonn linn tarraingt in aon iarracht amháin ar mhaithe lena chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá beagnach £18 milliún á chur ar fáil ag an Rialtas i mbliana lena chaitheamh chun leas na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  B'fhearr liomsa go mbeadh níos mó ar fáil ach, le cúrsaí airgeadais mar atá, níorbh fhéidir é sin a dhéanamh.  Táim sásta áfach go mbeifear in ann dul chun cinn maith a dhéanamh ach cur chun oibre go stuama, críonna, tuisceanach.</P>
    <P>Cuirfear breis is £11 milliún ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta i mbliana lena chaitheamh chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.  Bíonn teacht isteach ag an Údarás ó fhoinsí eile chomh maith, mar shampla, ó chíosanna agus ó Chiste Sóisialta na hEorpa, rud a chiallaíonn go mbeidh níos mó ná £1 milliún le caith-eamh ag an eagraíocht gach uile mhí den bhliain 1984 ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus leis an nGaeltacht.  Le soláthar mar sin táimse sásta go mbeidh ar chumas an Údaráis obair mhaith a dhéanamh chun fostaíocht a chaomhnú agus a mhéadú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is cúis sásaimh dom gur cuireadh arís anuraidh leis an bhfostaíocht lánaimseartha i dtionscail a fuair cúnamh ó Ghaeltarra Éireann agus ó Údarás na Gaeltachta le cúpla bliain anuas.  Tuigim gur cruthaíodh timpeall 530 post nua i rith na bliana 1983 i dtionscail faoi scáth an Údaráis agus gur cailleadh timpeall 430 post, rud a d'fhág méadú glan de thart ar 100 post.  Is toradh fónta é sin ar iarrachtaí leanúnacha an Údaráis chun daoine a chur agus a choinneáil ag obair sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ní beag an dul chun cinn atá déanta ag an Údarás chun an drochthionchar ón gcúlú eacnamaíochta a mhaolú.  Cé go ndéanann daoine comparáid díreach idir an Údarás agus an Údarás Forbartha Tionscail, is é sin IDA, ní mar a chéile an dá chás. Forbairt tionsclaíochta amháin atá mar aidhm ag an Údarás Forbartha Tionscail ach tá cúraimí i bhfad níos leithne ar Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Cé go bhfuil forbairt tionsclaíochta mar fheidhm ag an Údarás, ní foláir dó freisin aire a thabhairt do chúrsaí sóisialta agus cultúrtha.  Bíonn deacrachtaí le sárú ag <Col N="398" /> an Údarás chun a chuid feidhmeanna a chomhlíonadh. Mar shampla, bíonn an tÚdarás in iomaíocht le heagraíochtaí eile Stáit in iarrachtaí chun teacht ar thionscail lena mealladh chuig na ceantair Ghaeltachta agus, ar ndóigh, ní chuidíonn iargúltacht na gceantar sin leis an Údarás.</P>
    <P>Tá ceithre bliana imithe anois ó bunaíodh an tÚdarás.  Tharla athruithe suntasacha sa tréimhse ama sin agus is mithid athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an gcaoi ar éirigh leis an Údarás a chuid oibre a chur chun cinn.  Beidh struchtúr na heagraíochta le scrúdú agus réimsí freagrachta le leagan amach go soiléir. Beidh plean le réiteach, spriocanna sainiúla le socrú do gach réimse freag-rachta agus slata tomhais le ceapadh i gcaoi go bhféadfar dul chun cinn a mheas sna réimsí éagsúla.  Beidh gá le comhoib-riú ó chomhaltaí agus ó fhoireann an Údaráis san obair thábhachtach seo.</P>
    <P>Ó tharla an tÚdarás a bheith ann &mdash; agus Gaeltarra Éireann roimhe &mdash; bhí an claonadh ag áisínteachtaí náisiúnta neamhshuim a dhéanamh de na ceantair Ghaeltachta ar bhealach a thabharfadh le tuiscint nár tháinig na ceantair sin faoina gcúram.  Déanfaidh mise mo dhícheall lena áiteamh ar áisínteachtaí mar sin páirt níos gníomhaí a ghlacadh, i gcomhairle leis an Údarás, i gcúrsaí na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is Bord an-neamhchoitianta é Bord an Údaráis sa mhéid go dtoghtar formhór na gcomhaltaí agus go gceapann an tAire an chuid eile díobh.  Is coincheap nua é sin agus é mar aidhm aige ionadaíocht a thabhairt do na ceantair éagsúla Ghaeltachta. Cé nach féidir locht a fháil ar an gcoincheap féin bíonn deacrachtaí áirithe le sárú ach táimse sásta gur féidir réiteach a fháil orthu má chuirtear chuige go ciallmhar agus le dea-thoil.  Cé gur tharla fadhbanna áirithe toisc an tÚdarás a bheith páirteach i ngníomhaíochtaí arbh fhearr iad a sheachaint, is deimhin liom go bhféadfar dul chun cinn fiúntach a dhéanamh ach na ceachtanna cuí a fhoghlaim ón taithí go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfaí, mar shampla, ceist a chur an ceart do Bhord Stáit baint dhíreach a bheith acu le reachtáil tionscal.  Cé go dtuigim na toscaí a thug ar an Údarás páirt mar sin a ghlacadh, shamhlóinn go <Col N="399" /> bhféadfaí tarraingt siar de réir a chéile ó ghníomhaíochtaí mar sin.</P>
    <P>Tá sé curtha i mo leith go bhfuilim ag iarraidh dochar a dhéanamh don Údarás i gcaoi go sroichfí an pointe nuair nach mbeadh an dara rogha ann ach eagraíocht forbartha de shaghas éigin eile a chur ina áit.  Níl aon fhírinne sa líomhain sin agus go deimhin is mian liom a dhearbhú go bhfuil rún agam féachaint chuige go mbeidh an tUdarás ag feidhmiú mar eagraíocht lán-éifeachtach ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus lena muintir.  Tá páirt ríthábhachtach ag an Údarás i saol na tíre seo agus go háirithe i saol sóisialta, cultúrtha agus eacnamaíochta mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Beidh gá le toghchán arís i mbliana chun deis a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeltachta seachtar comhalta a thoghadh ag an Údarás.  Ní foláir an toghchán sin a bheith ann ar an 12 Nollaig ar a dhéanaí nuair a bheidh cúig bliana imithe ón gcéad toghchán.  Is é atá ar intinn agamsa faoi láthair ná toghchán a chur ar siúl i mí Dheireadh Fómhair, mas feidir.</P>
    <P>Tá sé mar chuspóir ag na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht sin saoráidí breise a chur ar fáil i gceantair Ghaeltachta ina gcleachtaítear an Ghaeilge mar theanga theaghlaigh agus mar theanga phobail.  Cuidíonn na scéimeanna le feabhas a chur ar bhunstruchtúr na Gaeltachta &mdash; scéimeanna uisce agus séarachais, muiroibreacha, hallaí agus coláistí Gaeilge, áiseanna chaitheamh aimsire, cúnamh do chomharchumainn agus saoráidí eile.  Is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil an soláthar airgid do na scéimeanna sin méadaithe ó £1.38 milliún sa bhliain 1983 go £1.55 milliún don bhliain reatha &mdash; sin méadú de bhreis agus 12 faoin gcéad.</P>
    <P>Tá deacrachtaí móra airgeadais ag cuid de na comharchumainn Ghaeltachta d'ainneoin na fial-chabhrach Stáit atá faighte acu.  Le deis bhreise a thabhairt dóibh bhunaigh mé coiste eile i lár na bliana seo caite chun a bhfadhbanna a scrúdú: chuir na fadhbanna móra airgeadais a bhí ag brú ar chuid mhaith de na comharchumainn iontas ar an gcoiste fiú. Tá cúnamh speisialta breise tugtha do chomharchumainn áirithe ar oileáin ach <Col N="400" /> faraoir níor éirigh le cuid de na comharchumainn a léiriú don choiste go bhféadfaí tarrtháil á dhéanamh orthu ar airgead réasúnta agus go mbeadh gníomhaíochtaí inmharthana ar siúl acu dá éis sin.  Tá mo Roinnse agus Údarás na Gaeltachta i gcomhairle leis na comharchumainn sin faoi láthair d'fhonn deis a thabhairt dóibh a chruthú go bhféadfaí gníomhaíochtaí áirithe dá gcuid a bheadh inmharthana a tharrtháil ar chostas réasúnta.</P>
    <P>Is é an ceann is tábhachtaí agus is cos-tasaí de na scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha a bhíonn á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse ná scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge faoina n-íoctar deontais díreach le mná tí sa Ghaeltacht a mbíonn fogh-laimeoirí aitheanta ar iostas acu.  Bhí ar mo chumas an deontas sin a mhéadú go dtí £2.25 in aghaidh an lae do gach dalta sa bhliain 1982.  Fiú le cúrsaí airgeadais mar atá i mbliana tá socruithe agam an deontas a mhéadú go dtí £2.50.  Is minic atá ráite agam nach bhfuil sa deontas a íocann mo Roinnse ach cuid den teacht isteach a bhíonn ag dul do na mná tí i leith na bhfoghlaimeoirí: bíonn an chuid eile le fáil ó lucht na gcoláistí Gaeilge a ghearrann táillí cuí ar na tuismitheoirí. Ní beag é an cúnamh a thugann mo Roinnse faoin scéim seo &mdash; beidh £900,000 ar fáil dó i mbliana: íocann Roinn na Gaeltachta suas le £60 i leith gach dalta a fhreastalaíonn ar chúrsa Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá dóchas agam go gcuirfear nuachtán fiúntach Gaeilge ar fáil do phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta i rith na bliana seo.  Lorgaíodh tairiscintí ó iarr-thóirí a mbeadh ar a gcumas nuachtán náisiúnta Gaeilge a fhoilsiú in aghaidh na seachtaine le cabhair Stáit agus is cúis áthais dom go bhfuarthas seacht dtairiscint. Tá na tairiscintí sin á scrúdú faoi láthair agus tá súil agam go mbeidh ar mo chumas cinneadh a dhéanamh fúthu go han-luath.  Tá soláthar i meastacháin na bliana seo don nuachtán nua.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teach tá an Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge 1983-1986 a d'ullmhaigh Bord na Gaeilge curtha i láthair an phobail agus tá obair iontach á déanamh ó shin leis an nGaeilge a chur ar aghaidh ar bhonn náisiúnta pleanáilte <Col N="401" /> mar a mholtar sa phlean sin.  Tréaslaím a saothar le Bord na Gaeilge agus tig liom a dhearbhú go dtabharfaidh mé gach cabhair is féidir mar thacaíocht leis na hiarrachtaí atá ar siúl acu.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith le Bord na Gaeilge bíonn deontais le fáil ag eagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge as Ciste na Gaeilge agus is deimhin liom go mbeidh lánchomhoibriú le fáil uathu san obair atá idir lámha ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a lua go bhfuil an-áthas orm go bhfuil an Biúró Eorpach do Theangacha Neamhfhorleathana lonnaithe anois i mBaile Átha Cliath &mdash; an t-aon fhoras Eorpach den chinéal seo atá bunaithe sa tír seo.  Táim cinnte go mbeidh ar chumas an Bhiúró obair fhiúntach a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leis na teangacha neamhfhorleathana agus is cúis áthais dom go mbeidh ar mo chumas cúnamh beag airgid a chur ar fáil i mbliana dó.</P>
    <P>In relation to Fisheries, a significant sum of £17½ million has been provided in the Fisheries Estimate for the current year.  This represents a net increase of 9 per cent over the 1983 outturn.  By and large the State has, over the years, been generous in aiding the fishing industry in relation to its size and the availability of resources and the situation in the current year is similar.  I would, of course, wish to provide more funds for the industry &mdash; both sea and inland &mdash; but this unfortunately is not possible in the present financial climate.  Included in the Estimate is a sum of £1.3 million to cover the interest subsidy on fishing boat loans. This will enable BIM to maintain the subsidy at its existing level and with possible reductions in commercial interest rates this could mean a net reduction in repayments by fishermen.  The grant-in-aid of capital development to BIM has been increased by 20 per cent as compared with the 1983 outturn and this provision will be used largely to help modernise the fleet with a view to diversification to more remunerative species and new fishing grounds.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have heard many references to doom and gloom in the industry.  The people making the criticisms give no credit for the investment by <Col N="402" /> the State in the industry or the assistance in relation, for instance, to training and marketing given by my Department and BIM.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that arrears on boat loans have increased considerably in recent years.  This trend is very worrying and the reasons for the situation are very complex.  It is rather significant that in all ports some boat owners in every size category are up to date with repayments while owners of similar craft are in serious difficulty in the same ports.  In contrast to that the overall position in some ports, for example, Greencastle, is completely satisfactory.  There is no instant solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, unfortunate that the long-awaited agreement on a Common Fisheries Policy came at a time of economic depression when demand and prices for fish are not particularly high and when the cost of inputs is relatively high, resulting in the economics of fishing not being attractive for the time being.</P>
    <P>We have reached a situation in the industry where a change of direction is necessary.  In the past it was essential to concentrate on the expansion of the fleet and the training of fishermen.  Now the situation has been reached where the emphasis must be placed on research and in particular on marketing.  Diversification of effort to other fish species is also desirable.  It is for this reason that I await with interest the report of the Sectoral Development Committee on the industry which I expect very shortly and which I have no doubt will enable the Government to make the most appropriate plans for the future.</P>
    <P>Improvement of fishing harbours and landing places around the coast to meet existing requirements of fishermen and to keep pace with other developments in the fisheries sector will continue to receive my full support.  Such improvements are planned in such a way that the landing places in most need, having regard to the amount of fishing activity from those landing places, are given priority.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall the major breakthrough last year in the EEC with agreement on a revised Common Fisheries Policy <Col N="403" /> which will govern the management of European fisheries for a period of 20 years at least.  This agreement was brought a stage further just before Christmas when the Fisheries Council agreed final figures for quotas in respect of 1983 which left the way clear for discussions to begin on the quotas to apply in 1984. Those discusions had a successful outcome at the meeting of Fisheries Ministers on 31 January 1984, when, I am glad to say, agreement was reached on the 1984 quotas.  The original proposals presented by the Commission to the Council were inadequate in a number of cases but I was able, with some difficulty, to get these raised to levels which take care of our industry's essential needs.  This was particularly so with mackerel where we have 85,300 tonnes for 1984 as against 80,000 tonnes in 1983.  We could do with more of this species but having regard to the stock situation the outcome this year must be regarded as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I can also report that pressure on the Commission succeeded in having their proposal for a tiny quota of horse mackerel dropped. The position now is that there are no national catch quotas for this species and I hope that the Irish fleet will now become actively involved in this fishery and enable me to claim a substantial part of the stock for 1985, when I am sure efforts will be made to apply for imposed quotas.</P>
    <P>Another positive result of last week's Council meeting is that it was agreed that the EEC Commission would carry out a study of the Community's herring market which has been severely depressed of late leading to low prices and lack of demand for our herring production here.  We will be participating in this study and I hope that the outcome will enable the Commission to make proposals to improve the situation considerably.</P>
    <P>Another matter of current interest in the EEC sphere is the question of fishing by Spanish vessels in the waters of EEC member states which has been suspended since the beginning of this year because negotiations between Spain and the Commission broke down late last year. <Col N="404" /> We are continuing to take a careful interest in this matter as the Spanish fishing effort has a particular impact on our fishing zone and we are pressing for further reductions in Spanish fishing for 1984. We must also ensure that our special interests are protected in the negotiations to take place over the coming years on the accession of Spain to the EEC.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, very pleased to be able to report that the measures taken by the Government last summer to control the activities of ex-Spanish fishing vessels registered in the United Kingdom under a flag of convenience have been completely successful and that the threat of a large fleet of such vessels operating in our waters never really materialised.  A lot of scepticism was expressed in some quarters at the time as to whether the measures would be adequately watertight but as they say &ldquo;the proof of the pudding is in the eating&rdquo;.  I should perhaps at this stage say that a further Bill is in course of preparation and should be before the House shortly which will, <i>inter alia,</i> increase the general level of fines for offences of illegal fishing in our waters.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps unfortunate that the long-awaited agreement on a Common Fisheries Policy that I mentioned earlier should come about at a time of economic depression when demand and prices for fish are not particularly high and when the cost of inputs is relatively high resulting in the economics of fishing not being very attractive for the time being.  It is, therefore, appropriate that at this stage we should take stock of our situation and try to establish what can best be done to get us through the bad times with least damage to the fabric of our fishing industry and to organise ourselves to take best advantage of the recovery when it takes place.  I have referred before in this House to the Sectoral Consultative Committee for the Fishing Industry representing all sides of the industry which was set up under the aegis of the Sectoral Development Committee over a year ago.  I understand from their very able chairman, whom I met recently, that this committee hope to report to their parent committee very shortly and I look forward to the considered recommendations <Col N="405" /> of both committees which I have no doubt will enable us in Government to make the most appropriate plans for the future.</P>
    <P>Mariculture is still making good progress up and down the country and following my bringing into operation late last year of the new legal framework provided for the industry under section 54 of the 1980 Fisheries Act my Department are currently making arrangements for the holding of the first public inquiries in connection with the making of appropriate designation orders under that Act.</P>
    <P>Fish processing is an area that offers the best prospect of increased employment in the fishing industry.  The Government's policy is to encourage better coordination between the primary production and the processing sectors of the fishing industry in order to enhance continuity of fish supplies which is a necessary prerequisite to increased added-value output and employment.</P>
    <P>While the export performance of the fishing industry has been impressive in terms of total value to the economy, the export figures point to the heavy reliance on commodity exports to one or two major markets and the need to diversify into new markets and higher added-value products.  Progress has been made in the past and you can rest assured that this very important area of market research and development will continue to receive my special attention.</P>
    <P>Fishing is today extremely energy dependent.  The rapidly increasing energy prices in recent years, over which we have no control, have borne heavily on the fishermen and must be expected to provoke a change of structure in the fishing fleet towards less oil intensive methods.  I am glad to say that the increases in fuel prices announced in this year's budget do not apply to marine diesel oil used in fishing operations.</P>
    <P>The central and regional fisheries boards, which were set up in October 1980, continue to work for the better conservation, protection and development of every aspect of our valuable inland fisheries.  Under section 32 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, the introduction of a staff scheme for the staff of the central <Col N="406" /> and regional boards is well under way. Also I am glad to say that a superannuation scheme for the staff of the central and regional boards was implemented in July 1983.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of our inland fisheries is our salmon fisheries. Catch figures for 1983 show that the total weight of the salmon catch by all methods was approximately 1,512 tonnes valued at approximately £6.7 million as compared with 908 tonnes valued at £3.9 million in 1982.  The overall weight of our salmon catch in 1983 showed an increase of almost 67 per cent on the 1982 catch. While this increase in our salmon catch is welcome, there is no room for complacency in regard to the overall salmon stock position.  Illegal salmon fishing continues to be a cause of grave concern.</P>
    <P>I have recently had a meeting with representatives of all those engaged in salmon fishing at which views were expressed on the main salmon conservation measures at present in operation.  I am having these measure reviewed in the light of the divergent views expressed by the interests represented.</P>
    <P>While responsibility for the control of water pollution rests with the Department of the Environment, the fisheries boards continue in the forefront of the battle against water pollution in order to protect fish life.  Much interest continues to centre around the problems of Lough Sheelin.  The slurry transport subsidy scheme, operated by the Lough Sheelin Management Committee, is working satisfactorily and I am pleased to say that almost 44 million gallons of excess slurry have been removed from the Sheelin catchment under the scheme since its introduction in late 1980.  No effort will be spared to restore Lough Sheelin to its position as one of the best natural trout fisheries in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Salmon Research Trust of Ireland Incorporated, which is funded jointly by my Department and Messrs.  Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Company Limited, continue their research into the biology of the salmon and the factors bearing on its future survival as a species.  A grant-in-aid of £56,600 is allocated to the Trust for 1984. <Col N="407" /> An amount of £130,000 is included in the Estimate to meet our contribution towards the expenses of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  The money will be used to offset the commission's estimated financial deficit in 1984.  The commission's increasing deficit is due mainly to increases in expenditure on wages and salaries.  I am satisfied, however, that the commission are continuing to make every effort to reduce their annual deficit.  To that end, the commission have increased the licence duties payable for fishing licences in the Foyle area for 1984.  I am satisfied that the commission are continuing to do everything possible to keep their annual deficit to a minimum consistent with fulfilling their obligations under the Foyle Fisheries Acts to conserve and manage the fisheries in the Foyle area.</P>
    <P>Turning to forestry, the gross amount allocated for forestry development in the 1984 Estimates, about £47 million, is an indication of the importance which the Government attach to the development of an indigenous natural resource and also of their commitment, notwithstanding current constraints, to maintain the level of funds for forestry at the highest possible level.  Despite the efforts made over the years to encourage an expansion of the private forestry, the State plantations still account for over 80 per cent of the afforestated area of the country.  The total area of land held by the Forest and Wildlife Service will in the near future exceed 400,000 hectares, of which some 350,000 hectares will have been afforested. Expenditure on forestry activities is largely on goods and services within the country and the import content is low, with the result that a very positive contribution to the gross national product is made by the State afforestation programme.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of land for planting continues to be a primary concern.  After taking account of the carry-over from 1983 of £1 million, there will be some £4½ million available in the grant-in-aid for land purchase for forestry in the current year.  At present the area for which price agreement has been reached with vendors <Col N="408" /> stands at over 9,200 hectares &mdash; 23,000 acres &mdash; and it is expected that a substantial proportion of this land will come into the possession of the Forest and Wildlife Service in the course of the year.  It is also gratifying to know that offers of land representing an aggregate area of some 12,000 hectares &mdash; 30,000 acres &mdash; are at present at various stages of investigation.</P>
    <P>I aim to reverse as quickly as possible the unsatisfactory situation that has arisen in recent years in regard to the reserve of plantable land and thereby enable the Forest and Wildlife Service to increase and accelerate its planting programme.</P>
    <P>I am also keenly aware of the necessity for a greater involvement in forestry by the private sector.  As I mentioned earlier, the progress of private forestry to date has been disappointing despite the existence of financial assistance and a free technical advisory service.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I regard private forestry as being generally complementary to and not in conflict with the State afforestation programme.  My main reservation in this regard would relate to properties bought for private planting which could more appropriately be incorporated in existing State forests to facilitate their more efficient management. Indeed, in a country which &mdash; in terms of soil and climate &mdash; has such tremendous natural advantages for growing trees, it is a great pity that such a vast amount of land, which is marginal for agriculture but eminently suitable for forestry, is still left unplanted, especially when the incentives to which I have referred are so readily available.</P>
    <P>I hope very soon to introduce some innovations which should lead to an expansion of the national afforestation programme through a more positive participation by private landowners.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the most exciting aspect of the afforestation programme is that the results of the planting undertaken over several decades are now becoming evident as the State forests begin to mature.  At the same time we should not be deluded into thinking that there is an over-abundance of timber in the country. <Col N="409" /> We cannot ignore the fact that some two-thirds of the State forests are still under 20 years of age and not producing marketable produce in the form of thinnings much less the more profitable sawlog.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless the prospects for the remaining part of the century are extremely encouraging, with the total output of timber doubling during the present decade and re-doubling to over 3 million cubic metres by the end of the nineties.  The disposal and utilisation of this indigenous natural resource will provide substantial opportunities in the spheres of revenue generation, employment creation and import substitution.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism in recent times &mdash; much of it unjustified &mdash; about the disposal of State-owned timber and from time to time various suggestions are made for improving our marketing arrangements.  A lot of the criticism is based on a misunderstanding of the situation and a lack of appreciation of the fact that timber is not a homogenous product but rather a commodity with three different elements, namely, pulpwood, small sawlog and large sawlog, each with different end uses.</P>
    <P>The problem &mdash; especially in relation to the sawlog sector &mdash; is not so much a marketing one as a need to cater for increasing demand within a limited supply. Indeed as regards the current annual production of either sawlog or pulpwood by the Forest and Wildlife Service there is really no marketing difficulty.  Sawlog production is fully committed to existing sawmills for some years ahead.  As the total capacity of the mills exceeds the national sawlog supply, no sophisticated marketing strategy is needed at this juncture. Needless to say, that does not mean that we should not be looking ahead and planning for the future.</P>
    <P>The real marketing opportunity, as I see it, lies in the area of sawnwood.  With prices of imported sawnwood tending to rise steadily in recent months there is a major opportunity for the sawmill industry to consolidate and expand its market share of construction timbers.  To this end, constantly higher standards of accurate dimensional sawing, drying and presentation, <Col N="410" /> coupled with prudent cost production schedules and commitment to meeting specifiers' deadlines are the essential ingredients for market success. From meetings I have had with the saw-milling industry I am quite confident that the progressive mills recognise the economic opportunities for Irish timber on both home and export markets and are gearing their operations accordingly.</P>
    <P>An inter-departmental committee, representative of the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and my Department, are at present reviewing sale procedures to identify how best the flow of sawlog can be improved for those mills geared to achieve greater efficiency and profitability and to secure a bigger share of the vast constructional sawnwood market with its added vital dimension of import substitution.</P>
    <P>Arising from a recent mention once again of timber being exported at £1 per ton, may I kill that ill-founded notion once and for all.  On a previous occasion in this House, I have clarified this matter. I am surprised to find the subject being raised once more in certain quarters.  I do not propose to go over the ground in detail but let me say categorically that these temporary exports were fully justified at the time from both the silvicultural and economic standpoints.</P>
    <P>The £1 per ton was not the export price: it was a price paid for young thinnings standing in the forest.  At the point of export, the price would have been nearer to £25 a ton.  These exports were for a limited period only and provided a valuable short-term outlet for excess pulpwood at a particularly critical time in Irish forestry.  They also provided many jobs in harvesting and transport as well as earning valuable foreign currency.  I hope that we have now heard the last of this type of misguided and out-of-date complaint which, in my view, borders on the mischievous.</P>
    <P>On the wood processing side, I am glad to see that production at the new MDF plant in Clonmel is well on schedule.  I am very impressed by the company's market approach and I am confident that this new mill will afford a secure market <Col N="411" /> for a large proportion of the thinnings from the State forests and for the residues produced by the sawmill sector, so crucial for the viability of the sawmills.</P>
    <P>I hope that there will be an early and satisfactory resolution of the difficulties of the chipboard mill in Scarriff.  My Department are co-operating actively with the IDA and the Receiver in efforts to find a purchaser with the requisite technical expertise and investment potential to operate the plant on a viable basis.  As a Deputy for a western county who fully realises the basic necessity for infrastructural development, I need hardly say that I am only too well aware of the trauma caused by the closure of the factory but I do not believe that acrimonious public debate on the merits or otherwise of selective accounting figures can serve any useful purpose.  Indeed I fear that it could be prejudicial to the success of current efforts to secure the basis of a viable industry in Scarriff.</P>
    <P>I know that the House, and, in particular, Deputies from County Cork, are concerned over the failure last year of Home Grown Timber Ltd. in Fermoy. Indeed, local Deputies from all parties have quite justifiably sought to have all necessary steps taken to have it taken over and reopened as soon as possible.  I can assure the House that both the Receiver and the IDA have, in the meantime, elicited quite a degree of interest in this mill.  In addition, I and my Minister of State and officials of my Department have met the Receiver and several interested parties and assured them of my Department's wholehearted co-operation in the matter.  While, contrary to any impression conveyed in the media, no absolute guarantee of supplies could be given in specific instances I am very hopeful that the Receiver will find a purchaser for this valuable mill which will help the employment situation in the area.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I should like to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Has that not been done already?  The Minister of State made an announcement in the newspapers that a purchaser had been found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that <Col N="412" /> the negotiations have almost been completed and I am hopeful that a satisfactory conclusion will be reached.  Indeed, I wish to express my gratitude to the workers in HGT for the way in which they have co-operated with a view to the eventual successful reopening of the mill. I also express the hope that the former employees in the Scarriff area will do everything possible to ensure that negotiations now being undertaken will also have a successful conclusion.  I am sure that Deputy Daly would like to see that come about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister of that co-operation.  The workers in Scariff have stated quite clearly that they are prepared to accept reduced wages in an effort to get a satisfactory result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.</P>
      <P>In so far as timber technology research is concerned, I feel that the time is ripe for a commitment by the industry to make its own financial contribution for research, development and promotional programmes to supplement basic research work by my Department.  My Department, in responding to the need to exploit the ever-increasing output of the maturing forest estate, finance a programme of timber technology and native timber promotion by the IIRS, designed to encourage the substitution of well-cut, well-finished and well-presented native timber for imported sawnwood.  This programme, funded by my Department this year to the tune of £225,000, seeks to achieve this objective by improving the image of and by setting standards for native timber and by educating designers and specifiers in its use.</P>
      <P>Like my predecessors, I must ask the public to be patient in seeking a quick pay-back on the considerable investment by the nation in afforestation &mdash; in terms of revenue, industrial employment and foreign exchange earnings.  Trees, even with the exceptional rate of growth in Ireland, take 20 years to reach the thinning stage and 40 to 45 years to fully mature.  As I have already mentioned, a substantial proportion of our plantations are still immature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> The realisation in recent times, however, that, while these forests are developing, they can, with foresight and imagination and at relatively little expense, be utilised as a major source of public recreation and tourist attraction has led to the provision by my Department of a very valuable and much appreciated range of public amenities within the forests. Despite the financial constraints, my Department will continue to exploit, as far as practicable, this multiple-use dimension of the State afforestation programme. In illustration of this I was very pleased to announce a few weeks ago an imaginative and innovative project for the construction of a major holiday chalet centre in Killykeen Forest Park in County Cavan which should be completed in about a year's time.</P>
    <P>Most of what I have said in relation to forestry is concerned with the commercial activities of the Forest and Wildlife Service and inevitably these must continue to be the dominant feature.  However, it would be remiss on my part if I failed to mention developments in relation to wildlife conservation both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The Forest and Wildlife Service have participated actively in international initiatives in the field of nature conservation. We are now implementing</P>
    <P>&mdash;the EEC Council Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds which came into effect on 1 April 1981;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, effective from 1 August 1982;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the EEC Council Regulation implementing the Washington Convention on Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Bonn Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals effective from August 1983.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is expected that the International Whaling Convention will be ratified by Ireland in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> On the domestic front, the work of the Forest and Wildlife Service continues to progress.  I am very gratified at the high success rate in enforcing the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  Research into wildlife habitats and species is a major element of the conservation programme. Particular attention is directed towards problem species such as seals, mink and foxes.  In addition, a major study is under way on the Greenland white-fronted goose for which Ireland has a special international responsibility.</P>
    <P>On the habitat conservation front, the network of nature reserves has now been increased to 19, with some others in the pipeline.  I am aware of growing concern about the threats to natural habitats of international importance.  The Forest and Wildlife Service have identified sites of different ecosystem types around the country &mdash;&mdash; particularly peatland sites &mdash;&mdash; which are worthy of nature reserve status. Most of these sites, however, are privately owned and the cost of acquiring them &mdash; or of entering into management agreements with the owners &mdash; poses particular difficulties at this time of financial stringency.  However, I am confident that some progress in that sphere will be made in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of forestry and wildlife conservation I would like to go on record as deploring what I can only describe as a persistent campaign against the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department in relation to the disposal of timber from the State forests.  I have never been one to discourage constructive criticism of any aspect of my Department's activities, but I must vehemently refute the tiresome repetition of inaccuracies and half-truths about timber marketing which seems to have become something of a hobby horse in some quarters in recent times.  Nowhere has this situation been better exemplified than in a lengthy article in one of our newspapers as recently as last Sunday &mdash; an article for which the writer appears to have drawn material from every conceivable source except the one which would and could have supplied the relevant facts, namely the Forest and Wildlife Service.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to take up the time of <Col N="415" /> the House in rebutting the many inaccurate statements made in the article in question. However, let me say that any reporting is all the more damaging when, either through failure to get a proper understanding of the situation or by neglecting to check out material, it results in a one-sided &mdash; and often misleading &mdash; public presentation of the case.  I hope that this sets the record straight in relation to this problem and that the publication of such inaccuracies will discontinue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been participated in by the Minister of State, who has been making irresponsible and hysterical statements in recent times which are not in accordance with the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute on the 1984 budget here today.  We have had many contributions from all sides of the House since the Minister for Finance introduced this budget.  The main point coming through is that a serious economic and social problem faces this country.  I accept that we have a worldwide economic recession, but most countries have made a determined drive to tackle that.  We do not appear to have made a serious effort or, if we have, we have failed.  The time is now opportune to forget political divides because we are reaching a crisis, with approximately 215,000 unemployed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will reconsider his decision to remove pregnancy testing diagnostic material from the list of prescribed items available under the general medical services scheme as this is causing both unnecessary delay and expense in diagnosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Diagnostic materials such as these are part of the normal facilities provided by a family doctor in his practice and used by him in diagnosis. The items retained on the list of items reimbursable under the General Medical Services are for use by or to be taken by the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very high cost of this diagnostic pregnancy material, which can cost as much as £80, and assuming 40 per cent of the population are covered by the general medical services there would be a 40 per cent usage of these materials and would it not be reasonable for the Department to make some subvention towards the cost to general medical practitioners because it is important diagnosis should take place as rapidly as possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what cost the Deputy is talking about.  One test costs about 20 pence according to my information.  The others take longer and cost more.  I do not know where the Deputy finds this cost of £80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some concern about this.  It is a rather grey area and may I ask the Minister if he will consider the decision to remove these facilities because while the vast majority of normal patients have a normal physiological development, such as a pregnancy, it is important to be able at times to differentiate between the physiological normality of pregnancy and the pathological <Col N="419" /> abnormality of a gynaecological disease where rapid instant diagnosis should be available rather than awaiting laboratory procedures which entail a certain amount of delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The materials referred to are part of the normal facilities provided by the family doctor.  These items were on the general medical list and were removed from it.  By having them added to the list again I do not see how that would improve the position for the simple reason that they are part of the facilities available to doctors and are, therefore, available to patients also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that as a result of the high cost of these materials many family doctors have ceased to provide the facilities in their own surgeries because of the added expense to their already costly list.  In order to diagnose pregnancy many doctors are now forced to send the actual test through the normal procedures of laboratory testing, which in some cases entails being sent 40 and 50 miles to the regional laboratory.  This adds quite an amount on to the cost of testing which has to be borne by the Department in due course. The most important thing about this is that there is a delay of two or three days before the diagnosis is established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the reason a personal medical card has not been issued by the Midland Health Board to a person (details supplied) in County Offaly as he applied last December and supplied documentation of income which was certified by the inspector of taxes for the year ended 5 April 1983 which confirmed that the gross income as certified by him was well under the limit set by the health board; if, in view of the circumstances, the card <Col N="420" /> should also cover the father, mother and rest of the family; if he will now confirm the position in regard to certified income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what income the Minister of State is talking about because he has not clarified the issues on this.  The income agreed by the inspector of taxes qualifies a person for housing loans and various other things. What is the criterion laid down because the Department of Health recently issued guidelines in this respect?  The income of the father in this case is within the guidelines and qualifies that child for a medical card.</P>

      <P>The guidelines are laid down by the Government and they are operated by the health board in the particular geographical area the Deputy is referring to.  The health board made inquiries into the means of the family in the case the Deputy is talking about.  The family holding is 136 acres although the applicant described himself as a small farmer.  At present the family home is being extended.  The family comprises of the parents and three children, the youngest of whom, I presume is the person the question refers to more than anybody else.

      <P>There are certain guidelines laid down by the Department of Health.  They are passed on to the health boards who determine who is entitled and who is not entitled to a medical card.  The health boards have responsibility for providing a medical card or not providing one.  The guidelines are laid down and it is up to the health board to operate the scheme.  In relation to the case the Deputy is talking about, it is possible in regard to the three year old child who suffers from asthma that if there is undue hardship on the family as a whole in paying their medical expenses the case will be reviewed.  If they do not think there is undue hardship on the family as a whole the parents can make application for a medical card for the three year old child.  If in the view of the health board there is undue hardship on the family in relation to that child a medical card will be provided and if in the eyes of the health board the individual in question is entitled to it.</P>

      <P>I understand that, despite advertising in the past, there has been difficulty in getting suitable candidates for these positions.  From the Minister's reply am I to understand &mdash; I am concerned more directly with the Eastern <Col N="427" /> Health Board area &mdash; that suitably qualified candidates are applying for the vacancies in the Eastern Health Board area and does he anticipate the making of an appointment in the near future?</P>

Would he accept that it is totally unrealistic to expect that one orthodontist for the Eastern Health Board area, which is far and away the largest health board area, will be able to work for the North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas also as he himself has stated?

Whereas the Deputy may be critical of the fact that only five positions have been advertised, certainly it is a move in a direction.

All the health boards avail of the services in providing orthodontic treatment for eligible persons. However, for more than two years private orthodontists have not been used except in a few extremely urgent cases to provide fixed appliances in orthodontic treatment.  There are two types of appliances involved in this treatment, those that are fixed and those that are not. There is only a small problem with regard to some appliances but there is a bone of contention between the Department of Health and private orthodontists about the fixed appliances.  The Department have failed to get agreement with the private orthodontists on a scale of fees for this type of work.  Recently, when a scale of fees was accepted by both sides, the orthodontists indicated that they were not prepared to implement it unless they could be guaranteed that a specific sum of money would be made available by health boards for this type of treatment on an annual basis.  Negotiations are in progress between the private orthodontists and the Department to try to iron out the problem.</P>

The reply I received was to the effect that the Minister does not propose to comment on the policy.  I asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he has views on this subject, does he intend to make an approach to the Minister for Finance whose job it is to deal with this area and for his views on this issue which has been aired in the media recently?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to comment on the question of taxation policy because it is part of the overall taxation policy.  The Minister for Social Welfare is responsible for the administration of social welfare policy and not taxation policy. As far as taxation affects social welfare policy and administration, the reply stated that there are practical difficulties in the implementation of any type of taxation on social welfare payments.  That being the case, whether one expresses other opinions on the taxation or not, I do not think they are all that relevant.  It is just not practical at present to carry out any policy in relation to the taxation of short-term social welfare payments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.  At a meeting with representatives of Coolock Community Law Centre on 1 December 1983 I explained that I could not give any long-term commitment to funding the centre as there were no funds available to my Department from which such funding could be given.  I referred, however, to the Combat Poverty Organisation which I propose to establish in accordance with the Government's programme and I suggested that the centre might make application for funding to this body in due course.  It would of course be for the organisation themselves to decide whether and to what extent funding should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the establishment of the organisation I undertook to examine the <Col N="434" /> possibility of providing interim funding and for this purpose I have obtained the sanction of the Minister for Finance to make available a sum of £10,000 to the centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Coolock Community Law Centre is the major community resource on the north side of Dublin and provides advice on a whole range of social issues and takes on more than 450 cases each year?  If the Minister is so aware, he must be concerned if such a centre were to close.  The commitment appears to be that interim funding will be provided until such time as the new poverty agency is set up.  Could the Minister tell us when that agency will be set up and if funding will be provided to the law centre to enable it to remain open until such time as it can apply to the new funding agency?</P>

      <P>As I told the Deputy, pending the establishment of the combat poverty organisation, I undertook to examine the possibility of providing interim funding and for this purpose I have obtained the sanction of the Minister for Finance to make available a sum of £10,000 to the centre.  When the Combat Poverty Agency is set up &mdash; and proposals for the setting up of this agency are going before the Dáil &mdash; it will be for that organisation to decide whether and to what extent funding should be given to this centre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this £10,000 will keep the centre going only until the end of next March? In view of recent financial difficulties experienced by the Coolock Community Law Centre &mdash; it was on the verge of closing in December &mdash; will the Minister give an undertaking that towards the end of next month a further grant will be given to the centre until the anti-poverty programme is established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of the centre are in the area of legal aid services which do not come within the ambit of the Department of Social Welfare. Nevertheless, down through the years the <Col N="435" /> Department have given aid and have made it clear on more than one occasion that the particular funding at different times was to be the final funding.  Now arrangements are being made to make this further payment of £10,000; then it will be for the Combat Poverty Agency to examine the situation and to decide whether and to what extent they will make any allocation that will assist the centre.</P>
      <P>No voluntary organisation should expect full funding from the State and the centre should be expected to raise at least a proportion of the necessary funds by their own efforts.  Despite statements on a number of occasions that the centre would not continue to be funded by the State, no effort appears to have been made to raise funds otherwise than by way of State grants in one form or another.  The Deputy will agree that my Department and the State have contributed very generously to this centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Coolock Community Law Centre would not exist if State services were adequate to cope with the needs of the people in the area?  Would he also not agree that it is because of the existence of this centre that the State is being relieved of a considerable amount of expenditure which it would otherwise have to make in that area?  Could the Minister say why his Department accepted responsibility for the financing of that centre last year but this year they blankly refused to accept any responsibility? Does he consider it fair that the people of this area are being treated in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the centre was funded in 1976 from the then combat poverty programme and in 1977, 1978 and 1979 it obtained funding from the Department of Justice.  That indicates the value the State places on the work being done in that centre.  One of the arguments in reply to the point the Deputy raised about what he called the inadequacy of the State scheme of legal aid is that, if the State were to continue to fund in a big <Col N="436" /> way centres such as this, the State would never provide a proper State system because money would be diverted from a proper State system to such centres&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will extend free travel facilities within the Republic to certain categories of persons living in Northern Ireland who would have the same qualifications as people living in the Republic except that relating to residence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The free travel scheme applies to all residents of the State who are aged 66 or over, to blind persons aged 18 or over and to persons receiving a social welfare-type payment as a permanently incapacitated person.  Extension of the scheme on the lines proposed by the Deputy would have very significant cost implications and would not be possible in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In this age of co-operation, with all good intentions toward a better relationship between North and South, would the Minister not consider that it would be a gesture on our part to extend the free travel facilities to people who fall into that category but who just happen to live outside the jurisdiction, that is the jurisdiction that on this occasion is ignored by the Constitution but which would be on other occasions recognised by the Constitution?  Without getting too political about it &mdash; and I did not even intend to mention that point &mdash; does the Minister not consider that it would be a gesture on the part of the Dublin Government to people living north of the Border in that age group, when they come south if they could travel the same way as their age group in the Republic?  I cannot see how it would cost anything extra because the buses are travelling anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has said is appreciated and borne in mind. But the decision in relation to this request is based on the practicalities of implementing it as well as the significant cost factor at present.  It was agreed in principle by the then Government in October 1981 to extend free travel facilities to elderly and disabled Northern Ireland <Col N="438" /> people travelling within the State.  That proposal was discussed with transport companies and a plan was submitted to the then Government in March 1982 but that proposal was not proceeded with. The proposed extension is estimated to cost £3.4 million in a full year at current rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE are costing the State an enormous amount of money at present and it will not cost us one extra penny to extend this facility.  For the information of the Minister &mdash; and for the benefit of the House &mdash; I might say that this was one of the requests specifically put forward by our separated brethren, as it were, people from the minority community on the island of Ireland but the majority community in Northern Ireland when they attended the Forum.  If the Minister of State wants to put himself on record as implementing something that the New Ireland Forum is talking about or is considering, I would ask him to reconsider the position and suggest to the civil servants in his Department to stop being book worms or bureaucrats and start using a bit of common sense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reconsider the position in view of the plea I am putting forward?  It would be a gesture on our part which would be deeply appreciated by both communities in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been very effectively considered since October 1981.  I can assure the Deputy that it will continue to receive the fullest consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House again the costing arrived at in relation to that particular proposal?  Can he say how that figure was arrived at because I agree with Deputy Harte that this could be implemented at a very low cost to the Exchequer.  Indeed it would generate a lot of goodwill in relation to the communities in Border areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1982 there were some 40,000 people over 66 years of age from Northern Ireland who travelled to and stayed in the Republic for more than 24 hours.  Allowing for the fact that accompanying spouse would be covered, the cost of the proposed extension is estimated at £3.4 million at current rates. That does not take into account &mdash; because there is no information available &mdash; disabled visitors, so that that would constitute a further addition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State telling us that it would cost over £3 million for travel within this part of the island, or is he including in that travel in the North as well?  Would he not accept that it would be in the interests of all the people on this island if there were easier travel facilities available to the elderly to travel both northwards and southwards as they wished?  Has this proposal been considered by the Government since March 1982?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There would not be any disagreement about the fact it would be in the interests of everybody but there is a cost factor involved and the fact also that there are other aspects and other pressures to extend the free travel which, in some people's minds might be of a higher priority, such as to the widows or widowers of the holders of free travel passes who lose their concession when their spouse dies.  That is just one but there are others for which one can always make a very deserving case.  All of these extensions are always being considered but they must be considered in the light of the available resources and their cost factor.  The cost factor, estimated and based on 40,000 people in 1982 who visited and stayed in the Republic for more than 24 hours, was how that earlier figure was arrived at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if the embargo on filling vacancies in the public service is causing delays in the processing of applications <Col N="440" /> for unemployment assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>13.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the long delays in processing applications for unemployment assistance because of the centralisation of the decision-making system in Dublin and of the hardship to applicants arising from these delays; if he will consider streamlining the process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.  Entitlement to unemployment assistance depends on the means of the applicant and individual investigation must be made in each case.  It has not been possible to obtain the staff that would be necessary to deal with applications for unemployment assistance as promptly as I would like.  This, combined with the continuing rise in the numbers claiming assistance, inevitably gives rise to delays in certain areas.</P>
      <P>The effects of the embargo on staffing recruitment are kept under continuous review and are mitigated to the greatest extent possible by reviewing administrative practices and by the reallocation of staff.  Since the embargo began in 1981 additional staff has twice been allocated to the unemployment payments area.  It is my intention to seek further allocations of additional staff for that area.  Among the administrative measures taken has been the devolution of decision-making to a number of local exchanges.  This process is being continued to the greatest extent possible where resources allow.  It does, however, involve additional work on the offices concerned which they are not in general in a position to undertake at present without additional resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us the number of social welfare officers there were working in 1981 when the embargo came into operation and the number of social welfare officers working at present?  Would the Minister not accept that the length of time people have to wait at present to have their claim to <Col N="441" /> unemployment assistance processed is entirely unacceptable?  In reply to a question in this House yesterday I was told that a man applied for unemployment assistance on 13 September 1983, that his claim warranted extensive inquiries which are still proceeding and that when those extensive inquiries are completed a decision will be taken.  Is the Minister telling the House that we should be satisfied with that situation?  The number of people unemployed has doubled since 1981 and I should like to know if the number of staff has increased to deal with the claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how the Deputy could have interpreted from my reply that the Minister or I was satisfied with the position.  The reply stated that the Minister got increased allocations of staff on two occasions and that he is at present seeking further allocations of staff.  I want to make it quite clear that the seriousness of the delays is fully appreciated by me and by the Minister and that every effort is being made to get additional staff.  In a time of recession the workload in the Department of Social Welfare increases in proportion to the depth of the recession.  There has been and continues to be unsatisfactory delays in dealing with claims, particularly with regard to unemployment assistance because each case has to be visited and examined and information compiled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's concern.  Will he tell the House how many social welfare officers were working in 1981 and the number at present in view of the fact that unemployment has doubled in the three years?  I have no doubt that the reason people have to wait six months to have their claim processed is that the Minister has not appointed more staff.</P>

The Chair should allow me to ask the question because the Minister did this dirty trick in taking the two questions together shortly before 3.30 p.m.  Has the Minister any intention of appointing deciding officers locally to make decisions rather than sending the matter to Dublin?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the pressure on the system, formal decision making on the officers' reports and the award of qualification certificates in the more straightforward cases has been devolved to the exchanges at Cork, Drogheda and to Gardiner Street and Werburgh Street, Dublin.  It is in the process of being devolved to Thomas Street and Navan Road exchanges.  While this process can bring about an improvement in the time taken to deal with cases, nevertheless it imposes an extra burden on the exchanges which are overburdened already.  However, extension of the process will be made to other exchanges as circumstances permit.  The need for the referral of cases by branch offices to their parent exchanges is being examined closely with a view to its elimination where possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>The time is now opportune to forget political divides as we are reaching a crisis situation with 215,000 of our people at this moment unemployed; and present indications are &mdash; and this is accepted by the Minister for Finance and the Government &mdash; that these figures can reach 240,000 by the end of this year. The vast majority are in the age group 18 to 25.  It is now the duty of politicians, especially in Government, to seek to tackle this serious problem.  I hold that an all-party committee embracing the present Government Task Force should be set up immediately to spearhead the creation of worthwhile employment.  The unemployed do not want a handout. They want work and job satisfaction. Agriculture, our largest industry, is responsible for 20 per cent of total employment and contributing 13 per cent of GNP merits only three paragraphs in a Budget Statement running to 61 pages. No measures have been taken to alleviate the financial difficulties facing farmers who have borrowed to expand their operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>When we compare this with industry we see that a rescue service is <Col N="481" /> provided.  No attempt is made in the budget to ensure that the same alternative is available for agriculture in the light of the milk super-levy.  We have only to contrast this with the Minister's sketching of the future directions of his tax policy. The levy is the most serious threat to our largest industry and merits serious analysis not a throw-away line.  There is no response in the budget to the need for Government involvement in establishing Irish food industry brand names in international markets.  The Telesis Report, CTT and major business people have called on the Government to share in the risk associated with breaking into new markets.  These markets are so large that even a small contribution from the Government would generate a massive number of new jobs throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of Government involvement takes place in other countries such as Italy and France.  The cost of such a venture is beyond the resources of Irish firms.  What is the point in employing consultants such as Telesis if their recommendations are ignored?  When we look at documents such as the Fine Gael election manifesto, the Labour Party election manifesto and the Joint Programme for Government and compare what was promised with what has been implemented in the 1983 and 1984 budgets, there are several serious contradictions and turn-abouts in relation to agriculture. Agriculture suffered a mini budget some time ago with the decision to impose disease levies under which farmers will now contribute £5 million. The IFA made repeated calls on the Government to alter this method of assessment of farm incomes for levy purposes from gross net income.  While the Minister acknowledged the problem he made no effort to resolve it.  Many small holders over the past nine months have been deprived of their small farmers' dole and this has caused great hardship in many areas.  I know of farmers in North Kerry who are under severe financial pressure at this moment due to borrowing large sums in order to build up their small family farms to viable holdings.  I appeal to the Minister to seriously consider such <Col N="482" /> cases of hardship by providing a supplementary allowance to help them over this crisis.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not consider the serious plight of our tourist industry.  Our hotels employ over 26,000 people in 700 hotels and 85 per cent of these jobs are outside Dublin. The Hotels Federation made several submissions to the Minister with regard to a reduction of VAT on hotels, which now stands at 18 per cent and 23 per cent.  The VAT rate on hotels in this country is the highest in the EEC.  In the UK it is 15 per cent and 3 per cent for long-term stays. In France it is 7 per cent and 9 per cent for de luxe hotels; in Germany it is 13 per cent; in Italy 19 per cent and 14 per cent; in Belgium 6 per cent; in Holland 4 per cent; and in Spain, which is one of our main competitors, sales tax on hotels is as low as 3 per cent.  Why should the hotel industry have to pay 15 per cent corporation tax while it is only 10 per cent for the manufacturing industry?  It is regrettable that the price of drink has again been increased.  Our drink costs are discouraging to visitors coming here.</P>
    <P>A rescue service like that provided for industry to assist hotels in financial difficulties is now absolutely essential to protect the jobs that are involved.  A scheme of improvement grants for existing hotels and guest houses is also essential.  In this way many new jobs can be created. Another cause of concern in the industry is the new fire authority regulations &mdash; I referred to this last year &mdash; which must be implemented.  Special grants should be made available and also special loans at special rates of interest.  The Bord Fáilte statistics for 1982 show the Cork and Kerry region as the major one of the eight regions with 1,500,000 visitors and total spending of £131 million.  I hope the Minister and Bord Fáilte will take note of the figures that have been published and consider the Cork and Kerry region for a much fairer slice of the money available for marketing.</P>
    <P>Local authorities this year will face serious financial problems because of the shortfall in the rates support grant which this year has been reduced from 15 per <Col N="483" /> cent to .8 per cent.  In Kerry alone it will mean a shortfall of approximately £1½ million.  The only way this shortfall can be made up is by reducing the services, reducing the work force or increasing many service charges and introducing many more charges.  This is not on.  The concept of local charges is not a solution to supplementing the shortfall from central government to local authorities.  Some new form of funding has to be found.</P>
    <P>From the figures available the Minister can anticipate an increase of over 20 per cent in income tax of which the PAYE sector are contributing 85 per cent. Forty per cent of people are now in the 35 per cent bracket.  The Minister has not accepted that there is a need for drastic change in the whole system of taxation. The PAYE workers are still carrying the big burden which this year will mean £300 million extra over last year's figure.</P>
    <P>Health cuts this year are very serious. The budget for the Southern Health Board for this year has been cut by £4.6 million on top of a shortfall from the previous year of £2.2 million, which is a total of £6.8 million in two years.  This is a very serious situation and in no way can the Southern Health Board continue to provide the services and facilities within the Cork and Kerry area.  The chief executive officer made a statement at a meeting on 3 January pointing out that unless extra capital allocations were made available he would be forced to close many wards in the hospitals in both Cork and Kerry.  Furthermore, possibly it could mean a reduction in the work force by anything up to 400.  I hope the Minister will not allow that to happen and that he will make provision for extra finance for which the Southern Health Board are calling.</P>
    <P>Last year the IDA's allocation was cut by approximately £6 million.  This year the Government tell us that the IDA have vacant factory space and as a result they are cutting the allocation to them.  In this time of recession that shows a lack of confidence by the Government in the IDA.  What is the alternative to the IDA? They have given a good return for investment over the years.  They have been <Col N="484" /> recognised as a job-producing agency up to now, but it is obvious that the Government do not accept this.  In their report for 1981 the IDA stated that they were in the process of formulating a special plan for the period 1982-92 to highlight the development opportunities and to ensure that the IDA are geared to operate efficiently in the changing economic environment. The IDA have over 600 acres of land available in the Ballylongford area of north Kerry.  Planning permission has been granted by Kerry County Council for an oil refinery in the Tarbert area.  I appeal to the Minister to make funds available for the setting up of this refinery because of the massive unemployment in the area.</P>
    <P>On Monday of this week a Kerry industrial report was released by the Kerry County Manager highlighting the present serious unemployment in the county which now stands at 20.7 per cent, and 25 per cent of that figure are under 25 years of age.  On a county by county analysis that shows that Kerry has the second highest percentage rate of unemployment. This is a crisis which calls for immediate action by the Government. We are heading for an explosive situation in Kerry.  The Government have taken steps to redress this situation in Cork city and I appeal to them to extend this special effort to include Kerry or, if that is not possible, to appoint a special task force to explore all avenues and harness all resources to reduce this level of unemployment in Kerry, with the age group 18 to 25 years of age especially in mind.</P>
    <P>The budget is disappointing.  It offers no help or confidence for the future.  It gives no incentive to business and no attraction for capital investment into our economy.  It offers no job opportunities, to young people particularly who are looking to us politicians and to the Government.  This is a budget of no concern which underlines a policy of despair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of an opportunity to speak on the budget and the general economic situation.  We in this House came into this budgetary season when we had conditioned the public generally to expect that the economic measures <Col N="485" /> to be taken in the budget would be hurtful to most sections in our society. We made a case about our economy and the people were pleasantly surprised to find that the Minister had put together a package of policies that were not extremely severe in their effect on the ordinary citizen, and at the same time he has satisfied the public with a budget that can contribute in the year ahead to working towards a solution to our economic problems.  A number of factors have created this mood of optimism throughout the country.  Last year, the very strong performance of our industrial sector and the improvement in exports in the region of 25 per cent in price and 9 to 10 per cent in volume of manufactured goods, have made a very significant contribution. It has convinced us that the policy of industrial development pursued by successive Governments over the years using principally the IDA grants and tax incentives has been relatively successful and that, in spite of many adverse economic factors, this new manufacturing industrial sector that was introduced in recent years to the Irish economy and attracted here by the IDA has been successful up to the moment.  We should not place too much confidence in this trend continuing. It must be possible for the IDA to sit down and study carefully the number of factories that have been established, the number that have achieved full capacity and the number in the pipeline to find out whether this increase in manufacturing output is likely to continue or whether it is obvious already that it must cease at some date.  I get the impression that this trend will not continue indefinitely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the interruption I was making the point that we had several items of good news on the performance of our economy in the run up to the period when the Minister was preparing his budget.  The improvement in the export of manufactured industrial goods should not lull us into a false sense of complacency because I have got the feeling that this industrial development has already slowed down.  In the years to come we will have to look to our own resources, to native indigenous industries and services, to provide employment rather than rely too heavily on continued growth in the establishment of foreign firms.</P>
      <P>Another item of good news was in regard to our balance of payments.  Our public finances are in better order and at least we have lived within our projected targets.  There is considerable evidence that the Government have introduced the type of discipline into the management of our economic affairs that will give us confidence that we can live within the limits of the budgets we prepare and work within the plans and policies we adopt. Another matter which gave us encouragement was the fact that interest rates have dropped, and we hope there will be a further drop in those rates soon.  That will encourage investment.  Up to now investment has not been a profitable proposition because of high interest rates.  Agricultural incomes improved last year, another reason for optimism.  International economic observers recently placed our economy as the seventh most rapidly improving one in the world.  That is a change from the type of news Ireland has been making in recent years with observers focusing more on the size of our national debt and the fact that our economy was not growing.  The news about our economy has been better in the final six months of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must recognise that the Minister in preparing his budget found himself in an economic cul-de-sac that the economy has been moving down in recent years. The ground in front of us was getting shorter each year as wrong policies were pursued.  Our options became fewer and <Col N="487" /> one could not but sympathise with the Minister for Finance who in a period of recession had to prepare a budget without the option of carrying out a programme of reflation or being able to do much to solve our unemployment problem by loosening up the financial position and producing policies to create jobs. Money is required to implement those policies but it cannot be raised in the form of taxation because we recognise that we have come to an end as far as increasing taxation and providing budgetary finances are concerned.  We all recognise the difficulties involved in raising money.  We know we cannot reduce the profitability of companies at the moment.  That would be the third step the Government take when they are on the way down, and we already passed that stage more than two years ago.  We recognise that money invested is not giving a return and that industry in Ireland or other European countries is not profitable by comparison with Japan or the United States.  Therefore we do not have the possibility of raising money from the industrial sector because they do not have any money.  That is why the Minister finds himself severely restricted.  At the moment there is a tendency for us to pin our hopes on what we see as an improving economic situation in the world generally.</P>
    <P>Those who are optimistic and look around the world to see where improvements in our situation will come from are looking towards Europe and America and watching for the upturn in the world economy.  Experts have been forecasting this upturn and saying how it will affect us.  They are looking to the United States to drag Europe after them.  In the last six or eight months people have been saying that 1984 will be the year to export to the United States because the dollar will be strong, that this is an election year and prospects for exporting to America can only improve.  One can only hope that the dollar will hold firm but it must be recognised that the United States has an immense budget deficit in the region of $200,000 million, and a balance of payments deficit of around $100 billion <Col N="488" /> and the prospects for the long-term maintenance of economic growth in the United States are not as bright as they were some time ago.  It would be a mistake for the people of Europe, and particularly the people of Ireland, to believe that an extended period of growth in the American economy will solve all our problems.</P>
    <P>Recent studies have shown that America did not have the same unemployment problems we had for two reasons.  Their labour market is more flexible and since the oil crisis some years ago wages in real terms in the United States and Japan have tended to reduce rather than improve while in Europe wages and salaries retained their value.  American companies have been making profits of the order of 8 or 9 per cent above the European average.  This kept the American economy moving but it has been recognised that when compared with Europe, modernisation of industry and labour productivity in the United States has not improved in the last five or six years.  In my view, the immense optimism which has been generated in certain circles here that this improvement in the American economy will bring Europe with it might not be well founded.  It might be a mistake if we were to say that because other economies are improving ours will follow. Our economy will improve only if we take advantage of our opportunities to export to this market, if companies invest and if our industries are run profitably. We are assuming that when there is this upturn in Europe and America, they will not fill the demand from the over-capacity which is obviously there.  I do not think there will be any automatic improvement simply because there is economic growth in the United States and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We have to look at our problems and try to solve them.  If the international climate is not right an open economy like ours will find it extremely difficult to generate the kind of economic growth that will solve our unemployment problems. The present Government and the previous Government have taken credit for the fact that inflation dropped during their periods in office.  This is a hopeful <Col N="489" /> sign, but I doubt if either Government can honestly claim that the rate of inflation was reduced because of actions they took.  There must be something in the theory that inflation must burn itself out in an open economy if it continues at a pace ahead of that of its trading partners. We should recognise that it is not the rate of inflation that is important; what matters is the difference between the rate of inflation in one economy and that of its main trading partners.</P>
    <P>If we measure our performance against that of America and the trade bloc with whom we do business, we have to recognise that our performance has not been good.  Last year our inflation rate was almost twice that of our main trading partners, the Federal Republic of Germany, Britain and the United States. Even though our inflation rate has dropped a certain number of points, we are still lagging behind our main trading partners.  This means our economy is suffering from disadvantages which have increased over the years.  It must be recognised that if our inflation rate is twice that of our trading partners it will be very difficult for us to sell to those markets.  It has been estimated that over the last five years we have lost 11 per cent because of labour costs compared with our trading partners.  Recently the Leader of the Opposition said that take home wages in real terms have not improved for Irish workers.  That is one point of view, but it is probably true.  The cost for Irish industry of employing somebody is another question but it has to be recognised that that cost has increased here by 11 per cent more than in the countries with whom we trade.  This has led to the difficulties we have been experiencing.</P>
    <P>In the course of this budget debate the problems have been discussed by Members who were quite sincere in what they said.  Most people recognise that it is not easy to solve the unemployment problem. Very few people put forward solutions to the problems that have created this severe unemployment except such solutions which would be obviously popular with their constituents.  No solution has yet been dreamt up which is at the <Col N="490" /> same time popular with the public and effective in resolving our economic problems, in so far as the public are able to perceive what are the correct policies to be pursued.  Unfortunately there has been so much jargon, so much talk, so many easy solutions put forward that the public are rather confused at present about who has and who has not the solutions.</P>
    <P>In this House we have an obligation not only to put forward solutions but to make some effort to rid the public generally of the sort of confusion surrounding the whole debate about how our economy performs and what affects its performance one way or another.  If we could but create public awareness of what is important and what is not in regard to the generation of jobs and all concerned with it, we would have gone a long way towards resolving the nation's problems. Here I do not propose to debate the educational system but I should like to see greater effort within our educational system at least to explain the basic elements of economic policy to young people so that they would be able to differentiate between those offering real solutions and those people merely proposing popular policies regardless of their long-term effect.</P>
    <P>I was talking about the competitiveness of labour-intensive Irish industries, those that have been penalised by our taxation policies.  All sorts of social schemes have been introduced in recent years, schemes like the pay-related benefits, redundancy moneys and so on; indeed, there are so many schemes in operation it is difficult to remember all of them.  But, on the other side, have been the increasing charges demanded from employers, whether they be in the industrial or services areas, large or small.  The cost of employing people has risen enormously. Some people break down these charges into personal income tax payable on the salaries earned and the social charges.  In addition to the wages the worker takes home with him all of these must be seen as a charge on the job.  Such charges can be broken down into the employer's and employee's portion, but that is all irrelevant. It is popular belief that it is the <Col N="491" /> employee's share of wages that is deducted and passed on to the State.  I would accept it if the State said: &ldquo;We will allow an employee to take the decision about whether he or she takes home that money with them or whether they give it to the State, whether they provide for themselves in their independent way for the future security of themselves and their families&rdquo;.  But the State says: &ldquo;No, we know better.  We will take that money from you and we will invest it for the security of yourself and your family in the long-term future and you may or may not get benefit therefrom&rdquo;.  By no stretch of the imagination can this be described as employees' money.  It is a tax on employment. The State, in its wisdom, has decided to give certain social benefits and they have decided that these will be paid whether people want it or not.  There is no freedom about it.  If this is the employee's money, then the employee must be free to take it home and invest it himself or herself for their security and future.</P>
    <P>This has led to a situation in which the native market for clothing has been penetrated to the extent of 70 per cent today, as against 40 per cent in 1947.  In the same period Irish markets for textiles have been penetrated to the extent of 70 per cent today as against 50 per cent in 1947, while our food industry has been penetrated to the extent of 30 per cent today as against 18 per cent at that time. It should be remembered that in the last five years Irish labour costs have risen 11 per cent higher than those of our trading partners.  It is fair to point out that no industries have suffered more as a result of these increased labour costs.  I want to underline that this has not necessarily resulted in an improved position for the workers since labour costs involve money that the worker is not allowed to take home.  This burden has weighed extremely heavily on the sectors that are labour-intensive, above all on leather goods where labour costs are extremely high, as they are in the clothing, footwear, food processing, biscuit-making and confectionery industries, all of which have suffered severely.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> The industries that have done well and which have contributed to our improved balance of payments, the high technology industries, have suffered relatively little because their labour costs constitute a small proportion only of their production costs.  For example, our share of the British market in traditional manufactured goods fell by 26 per cent in the last five years, a further indication of the deterioration of the competitiveness of our industries because of the economic policies we have pursued because of inflation and those higher labour costs.</P>
    <P>If we are unable to come to terms with this problem we shall not resolve the unemployment situation about which every Member has wept when speaking in this debate in recent weeks.  It is not alone a question of some sectors of Irish industry demanding higher wages, more than their share; it is also the effect of Government taxation policies and others which have continued to demand the payment of VAT at entry points.  There are also our high interest rates.  Therefore it will be seen that there are a number of elements inherent in the problem and unless we take positive action it will continue.</P>
    <P>The other element making it extremely difficult for us is the consistently higher interest rates we have had than those of the economies with which we compete. It has been said generally that there is nothing we can do about these interest rates, that they are regulated by market influences, that they constitute a very difficult problem.  The USA can be seen as the origin of much of the pressure put on interest rates in Europe in recent years.  If the combination of pressure put on the United States Government by the member states of the European Communities cannot encourage them to divert from the policies creating these problems, then there is no prospect of an Irish Government being able to exert such pressure.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand how people can justify those high interest rates on the grounds that our inflation has been running at a rate faster than that of most other developed countries while at the same time rejecting the argument <Col N="493" /> put forward that, if we are to achieve improved competitiveness or get back to the situation that had obtained, there ought to be a corresponding rate of devaluation. It is the only way by which this difference in the rate of inflation can be worked out of our system.  Not only must we be concerned about the rate of inflation last year, which was twice that of our trading competitors, but we must also remember the 10 per cent already built in during the previous year and the 9 per cent in the year before.  This has accumulated in our system and has created a problem in that it is making it impossible for our industries to compete.</P>
    <P>We have not had an exchange rate policy.  We have put our heads in the sand and have assumed that it is the business of Government to protect our currency regardless of the performance of the economy.  If our currency was traded on the international markets it would not have the value that is put on it at the moment.  We cannot look to the money markets to find out the value of our currency. We have the ability to trade in the world which indicates something but our unemployment situation shows we need to think out some solutions and many considerations will have to go into the mix of policies that will succeed in the end.  The Opposition and the Government should give serious thought to our policy in this area.</P>
    <P>New Zealand has adopted a policy of devaluing its currency by the rate of difference in its currency and that of its trading partners.  A few years ago the World Bank issued a report which indicated that in the lesser developed countries those who pursued policies of readjusting their currencies made more economic progress than countries that maintained their currencies at a higher level.  If we do not think it would improve our prospects for better terms of trade, why do European countries complain that the Japanese have consistently maintained their currency at too low a value? Of course it would not have the same effect on a small open economy like ours. The counter-argument to that is that a strong dollar has not prevented the United States from making economic <Col N="494" /> progress but we can say the same thing about that country as about Japan.  The United States economy is not so open to the pressures that could affect us because of an over-valued currency.</P>
    <P>Last year we had a small devaluation. When we examine the reason for our improved performance in industrial exports last year we will see that this was one element that helped to make our goods more competitive.  The returns from the agricultural industry last year showed that the devaluation had a considerable impact on improving the climate in that industry.  The answer always given is that it will create further inflation. However, if the Government and those of us here who have responsibility for directing and controlling our economy impose the kinds of disciplines that are required that should have considerable effect.</P>
    <P>When we joined the EMS we joined a system which contained some stable and some not so stable currencies.  However, we expected, and this was reasonable, to hold the parity of our currency if we exercised the same disciplines in our economy as did other countries.  If we are to be part of a monetary system that includes countries such as Holland, Belgium, Germany and Italy &mdash; the latter is a different type of economy in that it is not so open &mdash; and if we are to maintain parity, we must have the same kind of discipline and the same kinds of wage increases.</P>
    <P>I remember saying in our party room in 1975 when national wage agreements were becoming popular that if we pursued a policy that a person was entitled to an automatic wage increase because of inflation regardless of the performance of the sector or industry in which that person was working we would get into trouble eventually.  We should get back to having some kind of discipline in the system.  Directors and workers of an industry should be compensated according to the economic performance of that industry.  If this is not done businesses will not be able to survive.  I had the experience of talking to the directors of a clothing company who established an industry without State assistance, who <Col N="495" /> did not take exorbitant profits but who paid the staff a fair wage in relation to the return given by the industry.  The decision of the Government was that if such industries could not pay a living wage they should close and the Government were forced to maintain the workers at home.</P>
    <P>We should adopt a more sensible and flexible approach to the labour market. Industries should pay what they are able to pay and that should be negotiated between the workers and management. I would argue for more openness.  Directors should have an obligation to give information to workers so that they know what can be got.  When workers and employers work out agreements, if the employer goes too far the industry will close down but if the worker goes too far he loses his job.  Only on that sensible, balanced basis can people decide whether their jobs are worth working for and worth fighting for.  The notion that people can be compensated for the rate of inflation is a very foolish one.</P>
    <P>People have spoken about our serious unemployment problem.  Many phrases and clichés have become very popular in recent years.  When I became a member of the European Parliament five years ago the idea of work-sharing was taking off there and in the intervening period it has become very popular in Ireland. People say we cannot solve the unemployment problem because of the growth in technology.  I was not in the House last week when the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, spoke on the subject but I read his speech.  His speech was not making a political point but was searching for sensible solutions to the economic problems. I recommend those Members who did not hear the speech to read it because it was a thoughtful, responsible and well-researched contribution on the subject of unemployment and how we might solve it.  Work-sharing has been adopted by those who always have looked for simple solutions.  This was trotted out on all occasions as if the way to solve our unemployment problem was to push up the <Col N="496" /> cost of industrial goods by involving more people in the production of a particular number of units at one time.</P>
    <P>People will argue that we can have work sharing without a reduction in wages.  That does not justify an answer. Nevertheless, it is a popular myth.  Earlier retirement is a close relation.  Somebody has said that the idea of work sharing as a solution is based on the fallacy that a lump of labour exists, that there is so much work to be done and that if you involve a greater number of people in doing that work the unemployment problem will be solved &mdash; that rather than expand demand for goods and services and create more work in that way, there is only so much work to be done and when it has been done there is no more.</P>
    <P>It might be beneficial to remind people these days that in the eighteenth century there was a movement whose avowed intention was to prevent technological development: they believed at that time that such development would deprive people of the opportunity to work, and gangs of people roamed the fields of Britain and France breaking up machines, new ideas for threshing corn and churning milk, because they said they would prevent the development of a labour market. In the first half of this century, technological development was much more rapid and exciting even than it is today, yet the population of western Europe was increasing rapidly then.  That led to full employment rather than the opposite. Therefore, the case does not stand up that the numbers employed will be fewer with the development of new technology.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that early retirement can solve our problem.  I hope that through the years we can make it possible for people who wish to do so to retire earlier by, of course, the introduction of new technology.  That means that if there are goods and services required and that we do not wish to expand production &mdash; by the introduction of new technology we can expand production to a certain degree anyway &mdash; we can allow some people out of the labour market and, from the wealth generated in industry and services, we can afford to pay those people, or they can afford to live from <Col N="497" /> their savings.  That would be a very welcome thing but I would not force young people with talents and energy into retirement with the idea that in that way we can resolve the problems of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>We cannot underline sufficiently that we have not run out of work to be done. It is obvious that the work is there and that what we must do is to reorganise ourselves to be more competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> the economies around us.  If we cannot propose solutions to the problems of 300 million people in the European economy, at least we can propose solutions to the economic problems of 3½ million people in this part of Ireland.  That can be done by making ourselves more competitive instead of the other things that have been recommended.</P>
    <P>However, we will not do it by pushing up the cost of our goods and services through a programme of work sharing. We must appreciate that already there is a certain amount of income sharing.  We are paying people who are not working. The popular concept is that we should create public works with the money which we give through social assistance and benefits.  I do not think that is a solution, but we could reduce taxes progressively on employment and allow some of the money back into the private sector where that is wise &mdash; where the public sector is efficient I am not against encouraging more employment there &mdash; but it is not a solution to our unemployment problem to put the people who are unemployed into public works.  If that were a solution our problem would be a simple one.</P>
    <P>One thing we must not do is to lead the industrial countries with whom we compete in the race towards a reduction in working time, thereby putting up the cost of the goods we manufacture and sell abroad.  We must be the last of the developing countries to embark on this because we are not quite as efficient or productive.  Therefore, that is not a solution open to us in the short term.</P>
    <P>Another popular solution is to buy Irish.  I have always favoured supporting Irish industry as far as we can.  When we are buying goods and services we should <Col N="498" /> patronise Irish industry.  We should first consider the jobs of our fellow countrymen and our neighbours' children by buying Irish products, but if anybody thinks that a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign can be a solution to our problem it is a great mistake. It is one more soft option being proposed.  If we decide to buy Irish goods regardless of the cost, we naturally encourage Irish industry to be less efficient, and automatically we reduce our standard of living.</P>
    <P>We had the popular myth that Ireland lost 40,000 or 50,000 jobs directly as a result of joining the EEC, involving the opening up of free trade with those industrial countries.  I do not accept that.  Our entry to a free trade agreement was not arranged by a Fine Gael or a Coalition Government but by a Government under Seán Lemass many years ago.  That was a wise approach.  The late Mr. Lemass recognised that if we were to come out of the doldrums of the forties and fifties we had to go out into the world and learn to compete if we were to have a decent standard of living.  If we propose protectionism as a solution to our problems, as sure as night follows day we will suffer as a consequence.  Particularly, a small economy like ours cannot rely on such a proposed solution.  I would appeal to everybody as far as possible to buy Irish goods, but I would not ask anybody to buy from Irish manufacturers goods which those manufacturers cannot sell anywhere else.  It would be embarking on a course that could only lead us backwards into lower standards of living if we encouraged domestic manufacturers to produce and seek to sell goods and services that are not competitive and not up to standard.</P>
    <P>The IDA have done a good job to encourage industry into Ireland.  Because of the increasing cost of labour here we had a race by manufacturers to automate and to re-equip their industries so that they could reduce labour and labour costs.  The IDA have been giving generous grants to industrialists and in some cases this has had the effect of encouraging industrialists to reduce employment, although in other cases the grants were used to increase competitiveness. <Col N="499" /> The IDA and the Government generally in their policies must be extremely careful not to give grants to industries which can have the direct effect of reducing employment, except where this is absolutely necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to the speech made earlier in this debate by the Minister responsible for Forestry, Deputy O'Toole.  Because I come from an area in which this subject can generate much discussion, I welcomed his promise of an announcement of a scheme which would encourage greater involvement of landowners in the development of our forestry resources.  In the EEC, in industry and in agriculture, a self-sufficiency has developed in many areas &mdash; in milk, in cereals, in beef with the exception, for the moment, of sheep.  We begin to ask what we can produce.  It is time we sought alternative land uses, and afforestation is one of them.  I have always regretted that the ordinary landowners did not see afforestation as another crop which could be produced, albeit over a long period of time but which within their lifetime would be of some benefit to them.  I regret that the introduction of the new scheme for private afforestation by the Community was not brought sufficiently to the attention of the public so people did not take up the scheme.  The grant is fairly generous and if the ordinary farmer had been encouraged to avail of this grant the scheme would have been more successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is particularly difficult in the part of the country which I represent, where private individuals and companies are buying up land for afforestation. This, in itself, may not be a bad thing &mdash; in fact, I am convinced that it is not. However, when it is in direct conflict with the aims and aspirations of small farmers who already live in the area with regard to extension of their holdings, we have an obligation to try to resolve that potential conflict of interests.  One way in which we can do this is by developing policies <Col N="500" /> which will involve farmers and landowners with the Department of Lands in the development of our forestry resources, which in the end can give the prospect of employment to young schoolgoers of today and at the same time not necessitate a change of ownership of the lands concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to see an acceleration of the research programme which is being carried out by the Agriculture Institute on the development of short rotation forest crops &mdash; another land use with immense prospects for reducing our reliance on imported energy.  There were a number of comments which I had hoped to make, but as my time is now exhausted, I shall conclude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested to hear the last Member speak about forestry and the proposed incentive of the Minister for Forestry and Fisheries to assist those who might utilise their lands for increased afforestation.  This is a great lack in rural areas in the sense that much of our land lies fallow, is under-utilised or not utilised at all.  That part of our land which has been planted with trees has given us a reputation for having the proper type of climate to grow trees and to grow particular species rapidly. Because of that I would encourage the Minister to continue apace with his proposed programme.  However, in doing that he should consider the possibility of moving the Department of Forestry out of the hands of the bureaucracy and into the control of a semi-State body like Bord na Móna who have done a magnificent job with the bogs in the midlands.  Whatever else may be said about afforestation and the clothing of our countryside and hillsides with trees, our history in this respect has been little short of failure and we have not performed very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this from my own personal knowledge and experience.  There is absolutely no reason why, given a properly trained corps of hard-headed managers, our afforestation programme could not succeed. I am not in any way underrating or criticising our bureaucracy.  It has never been found wanting in the service of the country, but bureaucrats by their nature move <Col N="501" /> slowly and anything within bureaucracy moves slowly.  I believe that to be the reason for the lack of success of our afforestation. I do not say it is a total failure because there is the evidence of trees planted with the compliments of the tax-payer's money over the years, but it certainly has not been successful to the fullest extent.  I urge the Minister to grasp the nettle.  This is a cliché, but it explains what I mean and I shall use it.  He should do the decent and honourable thing from the nation's point of view and shift the Department to a semi-State body.  I wish him every success.</P>
    <P>My main reason for speaking here today &mdash; and I shall not be detaining the House for long and shall preserve them from the pain of my oratory &mdash; is that I wish to speak about unemployment.  I am speaking generally on behalf of Dáil Deputies living in urban areas and conurbations, in particular, young people, school leavers of yesteryear, school leavers of 1984 and of successive and subsequent years.  It will be an ingredient for revolution if we do not employ our young and we shall have very serious problems on our hands.  With all the will in the world I do not think bureaucracy has the capacity to deal with the problem of unemployment.  The Government should have a new look at the situation.  Schemes are bogged down in the system.  Now I am not being critical of civil servants. They do their job well.  We provide them with a system and they work within that system with a political will.  That is as it should be.  What I suggest is that the Government should have a look at the system to see if there is a possibility of introducing a new system, a system more in keeping with the times.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Dáil is doing its duty to youth today.  I do not think we discharge our leadership properly.  We have not shown any direction.  We have not given any will.  We have not provided any opportunity.  The possibility is that young people will show their disapprobation. The present situation has in it all the ingredients for revolution.  I certainly do not want that to happen and we must do everything we can to avoid such a situation. But the seeds are there.  Public and <Col N="502" /> private property is constantly being vandalised. I talk now about a minority, but it is a growing minority.  Fortunately the majority of young people are good people.  But the minority is growing. Blackrock is in my constituency.  There is no public telephone in Blackrock because of vandalism.</P>
    <P>Young people in urban areas with ideas must be encouraged to get together in small co-operatives of five or ten to develop their ideas.  They must be given the requisite financial assistance.  If every Deputy set himself or herself the task of increasing employment by finding employment for five young people between now and this time next year, this time next year we might be able to paint a very different picture.  We might be able to stand up and, with our hands on our hearts, say that between the budget of 1984 and the budget of 1985 each of us has been directly responsible for putting five young people into employment.  None of us could have said that over the last number of years.  We have the IDA who tell us the number of jobs that will be provided and the number of factories that will be opened.  That is not enough.</P>
    <P>As a matter of urgency in my constituency I am calling together all interested parties concerned about youth unemployment. I am holding a seminar and, as a result of that, I hope to pursue a programme which will ensure that, as a minimum between now and 1985, a number of people will have found employment in that area.  That will be my contribution towards solving the problem of unemployment. I am not now talking about the leader of Fianna Fáil, or the leader of Fine Gael, or the leader of the Labour Party, or the two-man party that sits up there.  The Workers' Party.  I am talking about each individual Deputy who has an obligation to devote himself fully and wholeheartedly to solving the unemployment problem, and the most important section of that problem is youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>We have been presented, unfortunately, with an unimaginative bureaucratic budget which does nothing to give hope to anybody.  It is a budget produced <Col N="503" /> by civil servants.  It bears the hallmark of civil servants.  We had reason to be grateful to civil servants in the past and we will, I am sure, be grateful to them in the future; but this budget was created by civil servants, not by the Minister for Finance.  There is no doubt about that. Perhaps it should have been the civil servants who came in here and delivered the budget.  They are good civil servants and those in the Department of Finance are the high priests of the Department.  That is wrong.  This budget is an unfortunate budget.  It holds out no hope to our young people.  The idea behind the seminar I shall hold is to give young people an idea of what we can do for them.  I hope others will follow on the same line.  No one should be afraid to do unpopular things, just as no one should be afraid to say unpopular things.</P>
    <P>Youth unemployment is perhaps our greatest social ill and unless we tackle it we may face dire consequences. I can see young people moving in a direction in which no one wants to see them move.  I do not want to see them supporting the half-baked Workers' Party. That is not the direction in which I would like to see them move.  The Labour Party no longer gives them any leadership.  It is in decline.  So far I have been quite unable to understand The Workers' Party though I think I am beginning to understand its origins.  The Labour Party served the nation well down through the years and it would be very sad if those who should support Labour were enticed away towards The Workers' Party.  I would rather see people in The Workers' Party than in the Provisional IRA, the INLA or some of those other terrorist organisations. I have no time for the Provisional IRA, let me say from the backbenches of the Fianna Fáil Party, but I can see young people being attracted to them.  That is bad for democracy and for the country. Successive Governments can take the blame for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartin tried to play down the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Campaign.  I have no apology to offer for the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Campaign. We should pursue a ruthless campaign <Col N="504" /> in buying Irish.  The tragedy is that it has not succeeded because the Irish people have not supported it.  If they had supported that campaign it certainly would have succeeded.  There are certain stores in this city and county who quite genuinely set aside specific areas of their premises for Irish products and who do their best to push them.  That is the way the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Campaign will succeed. I am not talking about shabby Irish products but guaranteed quality Irish products.  We have succeeded in anything we have done with a will.  We are not a bad nation generally.</P>
    <P>We have the brightest and the best at our disposal in the Civil Service, in Government, in Opposition, in our universities and in our technical colleges. This is the sort of brain power we should utilise.  Is it really beyond us, rather than having allowed the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Campaign to abysmally fail, to make it succeed? Large quantities of money have been spent on this campaign and it is not for want of genuine effort on the part of the people engaged in the campaign that it has failed.  The reason it has failed is that the Irish people have not supported it.  We seem to have some sort of a hang up in relation to Irish made products. People throughout the country seem to regard Irish goods as second-class goods and feel they do not compare with what our former British masters have to give us.</P>
    <P>If our retail outlets, supermarkets, hyper markets, mini markets, or whatever one likes to call them, sell Irish goods the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Campaign will succeed. That is the best place to sell Irish products, assuming the manufacturer produces the goods on time to those outlets. Some of our retailers have not seen fit not only to actively encourage the selling of Irish products but to actively educate their staff and the people behind the counters to push Irish products.  We should continue ruthlessly with the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Campaign regardless of any EEC regulations.  The French are masters at economic nationalism and the British are past masters at it.  We bow the knee at the altar of some anonymous regulations dictated to us from Brussels instead of <Col N="505" /> getting on with the job of surviving on our own.  Nobody else will look after us. This comes back to the whole question of leadership.</P>
    <P>I must pay tribute to two Members on the Government benches, Deputy Molony and Deputy Maurice Manning. I know it may be unusual for somebody on this side of the House to praise somebody on the other side and <i>vice versa</i> but their role in exposing the petrol price increase racket has been commented on favourably by the general public.  If the campaign could be conducted on an all-party basis it would be seen as an all-party community effort.  Every time petrol prices are increased we are treated to the explanation that those increases are because of the increasing strength of the dollar against the punt.  When we hear that the dollar has decreased in strength against the punt does the price of the gallon of petrol reduce?  That only happened once or twice.  When the Minister sees the strength of the dollar lessening against the punt he should take action and reduce the price of petrol. Could we get it into the minds of everybody in this House that the car is no longer a luxury?  The unfortunate motorist is being humiliated, embarrassed and oppressed at every hands turn.  He is treated to petrol price increases almost on a weekly basis, on the spurious grounds that the dollar is strengthening against the punt.  When the punt strengthens against the dollar the unfortunate motorist has to continue carrying petrol price increases.</P>
    <P>The price of a car today is an outrage in relation to the money the Exchequer takes off, which amounts to 50 per cent in most cases and in others it is in excess of 50 per cent of the cost of a new car.  In this year's budget we have also had an increase in motor taxation amounting to an increase of £10 for an eight HP car and even a larger amount for higher HP cars.  The motor industry is being treated with utter contempt.  I do not have any business associations with the motor industry but I have personal associations with that industry.  I have good friends in that industry and they have now decided that as far as car sales are concerned it <Col N="506" /> has reached the stage of the law of diminishing returns as the Minister will no longer be able to make a profit out of the sale of cars.  He should come to the aid of that industry.</P>
    <P>The car was a luxury at one stage and it could have been seen as socially just that money would be taken off the motorist every year.  That is no longer a reality. When you go to a middleclass area you will see two cars outside the doors of most houses and when you go to a local authority area you will see quite a number of cars in that area.  I would like to see a car outside every person's home.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider giving the car industry a break?  He should certainly have a look at the harm done, particularly during the past year to that industry.  The Minister reduced VAT on car repairs and car parts.  That is right.  It is not in this budget but it was provided in previous budgets.  It should not have been imposed on car parts or car repairs, and it should be abandoned altogether in regard to them.  If in addition to the expense of car repairs people are asked to pay VAT on those repairs it is understandable that they will not go as regularly as they should to have their cars repaired.  That comes back to my point about road safety which I dealt with last evening.  People bring cars in poor condition onto the roads when tax is imposed on car repairs. I ask the Minister to look at this and to abandon what is left of that in relation to car repairs and car parts.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at this on the basis that people have been asked to pay increased motor tax and perhaps make the payment of that tax more convenient. We were told here last night that outside River House beside the Four Courts one is treated to the sight of large queues of people waiting to tax their cars.  People might come along and, seeing those queues, might go away without taxing their cars because of the difficulty of getting to the tax counter.  Of course I do not support such practice.  However, I can suggest a simple solution to that, but it is a matter of will, of leadership from the Minister concerned.  He should instruct the officials in his Department to instruct Dublin Corporation to issue car <Col N="507" /> tax discs through the post offices.  This simple procedure should be done easily if the will to do it were there.  I am saying this not in criticism of the good people who operate the car tax office at River House and I hope that my remarks will be seen in ease and aid of their situation. They are an extremely overworked, courteous group of people.  I was in with them recently and I saw the problems.  If the Minister is not prepared to operate car taxation through post offices at least he should set up a few small tax offices around the city and county of Dublin to make it convenient for people to tax their cars and so eliminate the necessity for them to haul from Little Bray or Shankill or to come in from Skerries over to River House to tax their cars.  The Minister might consider my proposal in that respect.</P>
    <P>The people I represent have asked me to raise on the budget debate the question of the house property tax.  I can understand that the Minister must raise revenue and as long as we have the present tax system we will be always critical of it and we must be forced by law to pay our taxes.  We pay our taxes, not with a good grace.  However, of all the taxes that the Minister or any Government has ever introduced in this House the house property tax is the most despicable.  The home is fundamental to day-to-day living, to an individual's right to enjoy the privacy of a family within it, and now people are being asked to pay tax on the property. Some houses bought for, say, £4,000 or £5,000 about 20 years ago are now valued well in excess of £65,000 to £70,000.  The rate of inflation and the depreciation of the £ has taken care of that and people who went into these houses many years ago are now being asked to pay property tax on them. It is grotesque.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to comment on the proposed case before the Supreme Court because it is on appeal from the High Court and it would be improper for me to make any point in that regard and I will leave that topic now.  However, the case brought by Mr. Patrick Madigan and a number of other people to the High Court did not succeed in that court, it is <Col N="508" /> under appeal to the Supreme Court and so the matter is <i>sub judice</i>.  In relation to the house property tax generally I hope that when the next Fianna Fáil Government are elected they will abandon that tax immediately as they abandoned rates on houses when they were elected a few years ago.  That tax is dreadful.  It is demoralising and unjust and an attack on private property which I find offensive as do the people who made representations to me.</P>
    <P>Effectively the people being attacked by the house property tax are paying quite large and substantial sums of money in tax anyway and now they face the added burden of the Government acting as a landlord.  The tradition of British landlordism has found its way through to the Coalition Government in 1983 onwards to 1984.  I am surprised that anyone with the historical background of the Taoiseach would be party to this form of landlordism.  The next logical step would be that if you do not pay your house property tax the Government bailiff will come along with his battering ram and knock your house to the ground.  I know that that scenario will never occur, but the whole thing smacks of that part of our history which we would prefer to forget.  This tax has been seen to fail.  I understand that the Minister anticipated that he would get in excess of £10 million in one year from it and that he has accumulated only £1 million or so.  I am open to correction on that, but if that is so it would be interesting to know the cost of the collection of the £1 million.</P>
    <P>The form that householders get in relation to the house property tax is the greatest piece of gobbledegook ever produced in any civil servant's mind in our history.  It is a landmine.  It is very long and very difficult to understand.  In addition, many people have to go to the expense of having it interpreted for them. So much for making it easier for people to pay their taxes.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that unemployment is increasing and, as the working week gets shorter, we hear people issuing glamorous statements about the necessity for educating for leisure time.  That is very nice, but I would have thought we should <Col N="509" /> be educating our people to be employed. However, I understand the thinking behind this suggestion, that as we progress technologically in terms of the computer and microchip people will have more free time.  It is important that we support what could be called the leisure industry, which is growing daily.  The Government should not tax it at infancy or strangle it.  It should be permitted to grow apace.  As unemployment increases and the working week gets shorter it is more important that our young people and older citizens learn how to utilise their leisure time.  The Arts play a central role in the area of leisure.  Fianna Fáil have a very good record in regard to the Arts.  They have been very supportive of the Arts in encouraging the best creative artists to live here tax free through the exemptions we have.  Long may those exemptions continue.  It is important that we should consider following this philosophy through to its logical conclusion by extending the concession to our interpretive artists such as those in the field of music and theatre.  It is a great pleasure to watch or listen to our top performers live in such centres as the National Concert Hall.</P>
    <P>We should be deeply grateful to those artistes who have chosen to live here.  By their presence they have helped to improve the quality of our theatre.  The National Concert Hall is a very democratic place and is not set aside for a particular section of the community who would represent themselves to be upper middle class.  It is quite the contrary and is open to all, as it should be.  Admission fees should be maintained at a level that will not prevent people going there.</P>
    <P>There is great pressure on top performers who continue to live here because if they go abroad they will receive astronomical fees for their talents.  We should be encouraging them to remain here by extending the tax exemption to them.  I am referring to such artistes as Bernadette Greevy and John O'Conor.  We should be very proud of Mr. O'Conor and it is wonderful to think that he has stayed here. We have also Charles Lynch, the great Siobhán McKenna and others of great quality. Some of our artistes <Col N="510" /> have gone abroad but they would be encouraged to return to live here if the tax exemption was extended to them. One can visualise cities like Cork, Galway and Dublin becoming major centres of culture in Europe.  Now that we have a magnificent concert hall in Dublin the possibilities are endless.  The number of people who would rank as top interpretive artistes is small with the result that the cost of extending the tax concession to them would be infinitesimal but the benefit to the country would be substantial.</P>
    <P>Remaining with the topic of music I notice that the Taoiseach appointed two people under that heading to the Arts Council, one from the North of Ireland and the second a person who lectures at Trinity College but is from outside the country.  I accept that the individuals concerned are worthy of such appointments but I wonder why we could not have found Irish people of similar quality.  I avoided mentioning the latter's nationality because I do not wish to be seen to be chauvinistic or silly in that regard, but the Taoiseach when making such appointments should look to our own people.  I am not criticising the reputation or the integrity of those appointed but I am concerned about the principle of appointing Irish people before non-nationals to such an important group as the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a plea for the aged in our society, particularly those who live alone.  Will the Minister for Finance encourage the Minister for the Environment to examine our existing housing stock in terms of providing indoor toilets?  I can bring the Minister to a number of housing estates in my constituency that do not have that facility. That is crazy.  Many of the people living in those estates have to go to a hut at the bottom of their garden to perform their ablutions in appalling conditions.  That is not reasonable in 1984.  We boast a lot about the number of houses we build annually but we should examine our existing housing stock with a view to bringing them up to 1984 standards.  I am aware that in the Dún Laoghaire area many people live in houses that do not <Col N="511" /> have indoor sanitation facilities.  Such facilities are so basic that there should not be any question of not having the money to provide them.  The Minister for Finance should give the money to the local authority for them.  I have been pressing Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation for 20 years to deal with this problem.  I do not know if I will be representing the people of that area in 20 years' time &mdash; that is a matter for the people of the constituency &mdash; but I will continue to press for indoor sanitation facilities for all people.  Can any Member imagine the hardship it is for an old person not to have such facilities indoor and having to run to a hut at the bottom of a garden during a harsh winter?  People should not be asked to endure that in 1984.</P>
    <P>My final <i>cri de coeur</i> relates to the depressed tourist industry.  The industry was encouraged by the decision to increase the funds for promotion work by £300,000 and reduce VAT on car hire by 5 per cent.  However, disappointment has been expressed that the budget did not do anything worthwhile in reducing VAT for hotels, which is the highest in the EEC.  They do not have export relief which is available to other industries. There is 50 per cent corporation profits tax and 10 per cent for manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>Now we come to another problem &mdash; drink.  The price of drink in Ireland is ludicrous when compared with what is paid in Britain.  This country benefited from British tourists until the mad campaign in the North took off in 1969.  Now the British tourists will not come here in the numbers we would like.  I would be delighted to welcome British tourists. They are a generous people and very good spenders.  The average British citizen is a decent person.  We should do everything in our power to urge Bord Fáilte to continue with their programme to attract British tourists.  But hotels must charge high prices to survive. We should reduce the taxes hotels have to pay in the interests of tourism.  If we have the highest VAT rate in the Common Market, <Col N="512" /> how can we expect to attract European tourists when they can get far cheaper holidays at home?</P>
    <P>My colleague from the Government benches points out the heading in the <i>Evening Press</i>&ldquo;Reagan Visit Bonanza for Irish Hotels&rdquo;.  I welcome President Reagan and hope his stay here is fruitful. I also hope it will be financially fruitful for the people of Ballyporeen.  They deserve the greatest commendation for the way they are pushing their community to cash in on the President's visit.  It is only right that they should get the support of all areas in the country.  As I said, President Reagan is welcome and I hope his visit does a lot for Irish tourism by encouraging Americans to spend their holidays here.</P>
    <P>As part of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, I urge people to spend their holidays in Ireland.  We have some of the best guest-houses in the world, their charges are reasonable and they provide very good food.  This is a side of the tourist industry which does not get enough recognition. People with families who cannot afford to stay in the larger hotels have seen the advantages of staying in these guest-houses. I am not suggesting that people should not go abroad, but as a patriotic duty we should encourage our population to take holidays at home.  Perhaps those who go abroad might take one holiday in three at home.  This would be of benefit to the nation.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the House for speaking so long but I did not think it would take so long to express my views.  I want to tell the House how disappointing, unimaginative and conservative this budget is.  As I see it, it does not bring the country any further along the road to national recovery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to concentrate on the areas of my specific responsibility but before that I will respond to points raised by Deputy McCartin and Deputy D. Andrews.  A number of references were made by Deputy Andrews to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Campaign.  He adverted to the fact that there were legal problems and then proceeded <Col N="513" /> to dismiss them.  It would be nice if they could be dismissed as easily as that but I am not sure that that is the case. This is an area where much is being done at voluntary level.  I refer in particular to a group of young people &mdash; in the main second level students &mdash; the Young Ireland group based originally in Oatlands College not so far from Deputy Andrew's constitutency, which has now spread nationwide.  If we were never faced with a situation where there were legal constraints on what was available to the Government, the approach taken by that group of young people would offer grounds for optimism.</P>
      <P>In the past we had umpteen &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaigns but they have never been conspicuous successes.  This group offer some ground for hope because it is up to the young people to appeal to their peers and their parents and say &ldquo;Behave in a particular fashion, purchase in a particular way and there is something in it for me&rdquo;.  If we bring this to that level there is greater reason to hope that something will be achieved, rather than a much more general exhortation to one and all to buy Irish.</P>
      <P>My experience over the past year from talking to young people indicates that they have been meeting with some success. When addressing a meeting in the south Dublin area one parent told me she had changed her purchasing habits as a direct result of the pressure brought by her teenage children.  They persuaded her to sign a contract committing her not to spend more than a specified amount of money on foreign imports in any given week.  It is a sign of the changing times when people are in a position to exert that sort of pressure.  I do not know what would happen if the Ceann Comhairle or other Members of this House had sought to do anything of that nature.  Given that the options available to Government are, for legal reasons, limited organisations like Young Ireland are entitled to have the moral support of Members of this House and I urge Deputies to consider how they can assist the spread of that organisation in their constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews and Deputy McCartin addressed themselves to the relationship <Col N="514" /> of work and leisure, work and jobs. This is a very appropriate issue to feature in this budget debate.  There has been a marked tendency to decry full employment as a realistic goal for Irish society. However, there is every reason to be optimistic enough and determined enough to create a future where there will be work for all.  I reject, and I ask the House to join with me in rejecting, defeatist and negative thinking.  Perhaps I can explain what I have in mind.  It has become commonplace now to say that we are in the midst of a transition, a transition to a new economic Europe.  There are a number of different scenarios put forward by experts of one sort or another about the future of employment in a highly technological era.  There is what might be described as the unemployment scenario in which most people will be unemployed as a result of technological developments.  As an alternative there is what might be described as the leisure scenario.  There most people will pursue leisure and they will do so along-side a relatively small number of highly skilled workers in the mainstream economy. Then there is an employment scenario which presupposes that we share around, on as equitable a basis as can be devised, whatever work is available so that as many as possible have access to and the opportunity to participate in meaningful and rewarding work.</P>
    <P>I want to advance another possible scenario, what might be called a work scenario in which all of our people will be given the opportunity to engage in meaningful and rewarding work in the future.  What does such a scenario involve?  First of all, it involves a revaluation of all the &ldquo;work&rdquo; which is currently performed in the economy as a whole, that is work paid and unpaid, work perhaps in the social services area, work in the local community.  Every one of us in this House knows that there are great opportunities for work in almost every area of Irish society; there is no shortage of work, we are tired telling ourselves that.  The problem is &mdash; and this is the nub of it &mdash; that we find we cannot afford to pay people to do the work which is crying out to be done.  That work may <Col N="515" /> be in the area of infrastructural development, perhaps in the area of education, in the social services, health and community care.</P>
    <P>If we take that as a starting point then it seems to me that the first requisite &mdash; if the work scenario is to become a reality &mdash; is that we must maximise the wealth creation from the primary producing sectors of industry and agriculture.  The key task there is to produce sufficient products that can be competitively marketed worldwide.  We must hope, look to and demand of the market economy that it produces more and more jobs.  But we must also accept that perhaps it will not achieve anything like enough in order to attain full employment, at least full employment as it has been traditionally understood.  Its key role is to produce sufficient wealth to support the full development of work opportunities in a parallel economy, in a social economy, in an area in which we know we can provide work for all that is worthwhile, creative, rewarding and meaningful.  If that is so then the work scenario is linked to some new deal on the distribution of rewards which will offer everyone the status and satisfaction currently enjoyed only by paid workers in the mainstream market economy or indeed people in the public sector.</P>
    <P>It is often forgotton, though, by commentators who realise that sufficient jobs &mdash; as traditionally understood &mdash; are not going to be created by economic development alone that we must still &mdash; and this is absolutely essential &mdash; concentrate on that wealth-producing economic development if we are to have any basis at all for a &ldquo;work for all&rdquo; policy in the social economy area.  That demands of us that we start thinking.  It demands that we start questioning ourselves.  It demands, for example, that we address ourselves to questions such as: what sort of work are we prepared to pay for?  How is that work to be distributed?  How will that distribution of work relate to the generation and distribution of wealth?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there are examples that, however tentative, show the direction in which we are beginning to move. <Col N="516" /> One example is the youth employment levy.  In effect that was an earmarked tax paid by those in jobs which transferred 1 per cent of their income in order to create fresh opportunities for the young unemployed. We are all aware from the debates we have had in this House over the last few months and from the operations of the agencies in the youth employment area that very frequently those opportunities arise in the social economy. More recently and perhaps more specifically, the enterprise allowance scheme has shown the tremendous interest there is amongst the recipients of unemployment benefit or assistance in creating work opportunities for themselves at local level.</P>
    <P>There is room to examine, in a sensitive manner, the whole question of State benefit paid to the unemployed in order to ascertain how meaningful work can be created rather than demand of the recipients that they be unemployed, stamped and registered as such.  Obviously that would demand that the examination be sensitive.  It would demand consultation with the social partners. It could very easily get off the rails and we could find ourselves in a situation of something bordering on famine relief.  But I do not think that need happen. It is an area we are beginning to open up, that deserves to be pursued very seriously in coming months and years.</P>
    <P>We have an absolute obligation to break the connection between the idea that seems to be prevalent that if one is not holding down a job related to production for the market, one is not entitled to an income, that one is entitled to welfare only.  I have doubts as to the extent to which orthodox thinking will significantly influence or have an impact on the unemployment statistics.  We need a coherent, broader policy for growth, employment and, then, organisation of work and rewards in society generally. The industrial and social challenge in reality are not as separate as they are all so often presented but rather constitute two sides of the same coin.  Technological development alone does not generate economic growth, long-term competitive capability, or social wellbeing.  As well as <Col N="517" /> a vigorous industrial and agricultural policy, and a vigorous policy of technological development simultaneously we need social innovation, reform of institutions, perhaps changes in our inherited system of values.  I venture to suggest that the area of land reform is one where traditional cultural values have perhaps inhibited full utilisation of our natural resources.  Traditional economic thinking will not provide all the answers.  In addition to alternative economics we need also an alternative social policy.  I welcome the beginning of a public debate in that area.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the main thrust of my remarks, which is the area of my specific responsibility.  I welcome the fact that the Opposition recognise me as being such a reasoned and responsible debater that they know I will not give rise to any controversy and do not find it necessary to come in to pull me up on any errors of fact or otherwise in which I might engage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am far too modest to put such an interpretation on it but it may be so.</P>
      <P>Very shortly after being appointed I made a speech in which I set out my ambitions, hopes and targets for the period in which I would hold office.  I suspect that was a fairly unusual thing to do.  Probably it is more orthodox to make such a speech during the course of an election campaign and then do whatever one can to retrieve as many copies of the script that remain in the public's grip in the hope that it will be forgotten as quickly as possible.  Whether or not it was naive, I made such a speech and I set out the areas in which I hoped to make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested then that it would emerge quickly that this Government had a distinctive policy approach directed towards building a comprehensive youth service. In that speech I set out a number of specific targets on which I hoped to move fairly rapidly and it seems to me this is a <Col N="518" /> reasonable time to come back to the House and report progress.</P>
    <P>I indicated then what I saw as the major areas in which movement was required. One was the drawing up of a national youth policy.  Another was with regard to developing the role of youth as a social partner.  Another was with regard to rapid progress in developing youth work services.  I referred to the role I envisaged for the Youth Employment Agency and I indicated my determination to secure a solution to the development officer controversy that had been simmering for some years.</P>
    <P>Let us start with the question of resources because that is central to any discussion in this or any other sphere of Government activity.  We entered Government with the commitment of support for the voluntary youth services as a priority.  When we entered Government the Estimates for public expenditure had been published by the outgoing administration.  We found that the increase provided for the voluntary youth sector was a miserly 1 per cent and that was wholly unsatisfactory and quite inconsistent with our stated policy commitment to regard this area as a priority.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget it was possible to allocate additional resources to the youth service area and that allowed a substantial expansion in the level of State support. For example, it meant that a number of new youth organisations for the first time were brought into the net as recipients of State grant-in-aid.  It meant also it was possible to take a number of initiatives in support of organisations and groups at local community level who were dealing directly with disadvantaged young people.  All told, the extra cash made available under various headings amounted to 36 per cent and that allowed for the most dramatic expansion yet in the youth service.  This year the provision in the Estimate under the relevant subhead is £2.122 million and that represents a substantial increase on last year's outturn. In addition, the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement was able to allocate a further £100,000 to youth affairs targetted specifically towards furthering the initiatives taken last year in <Col N="519" /> support of those dealing with disadvantaged young people, particularly in urban areas.</P>
    <P>It will be of interest to the House to give some indication of how that money is likely to be spent, but before dealing with that I wish to remind the House of another provision in the budget that is of particular importance to the voluntary youth sector and youth organisations, namely, the change introduced in the administration of the travel tax.  This tax which was payable by everyone travelling outside the State had proved to be a serious burden on youth organisations, particularly groups such as boy scouts and youth clubs who as part of their normal routine undertake a fair amount of travelling.  A number of them raised the matter with me during the year and, in turn, I raised the matter with the Minister for Finance.  I am delighted to say that the budget has taken account of their concern and young people under 18 years who are going abroad either on a school trip organised by a primary or a post-primary school or on a trip organised by a voluntary, non-profit making organisation established for the purpose of promoting the educational advancement or welfare of young persons will be exempt from that tax.  That will give a considerable boost to youth organisations and it has been welcomed warmly by them.</P>
    <P>Let us see how the £2.12 million will be spent during the next year and in doing so indicate the extent to which it represents the fulfilment of the programme outlined by me on taking office.  The Government entered office with the commitment to introduce without delay a comprehensive youth policy that would seek to meet the needs of all young people.  We had a number of more specific commitments: one was that we would establish a committee to assist us in that task, that that committee would have a high youth representation and that it would have adequate resources and research facilities.  It was also suggested it would be useful if a discussion document could be published in advance of the committee setting down to work to assist it in its task and to provide a focus <Col N="520" /> for submissions.  In September last year the committee was established under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Declan Costello. It contained representatives of all of the Government Departments that relate to and serve young people and it also had representatives of the National Youth Council and other youth organisations. Incidentally, included in its membership is a member of Ógra Fhianna Fáil because we were determined it would not be seen as a partisan group but that it would enjoy the respect of all sides of this House and the nation generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned last night I referred to the greatest problem in the area, the unnatural Border which has been there for so many years.  If one looks at the figures, one will discover that the highest rate of unemployment is in the Border counties, the highest rate of all being in my county, particularly in west Donegal.  Until such time as we have a definite commitment of intent from the British Government in relation to the Border we can only try to implement many aspects of this report, all of which I would agree with, and many other projects not included in that programme. I will refer to these in the few minutes left to me.</P>
      <P>The report states that the Irish Border area is severely handicapped and has a definite claim for assistance from Europe.  The income of the people is exceptionally low, there is high unemployment, the farms are small and the soil notably poor.  West Donegal epitomises all that is stated in the report.</P>
      <P>In relation to road infrastructure, it has been suggested that many roads require immediate attention.  Having read the report I am disappointed that the most underdeveloped part of that underdeveloped area has been forgotten completely &mdash; west Donegal has not been mentioned and neither have the islands.  Some of the main roads have been referred to, but there are no main arteries out of west Donegal.  During the last few years the block grant which we received for road improvements has not been increased.  If that continues, we will have great difficulty in travelling out of west Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should consider this seriously.  My colleagues will bear me out when I say that the biggest single problem in efforts to entice industrialists into west Donegal is its distance from the harbours of Larne, Dublin and Derry.  I hope that <Col N="522" /> such deep water ports as Rathmullen, Killybegs and Burtonport will receive attention and money from the Border funds which have been recommended in the report.  That might enable us to survive and to import and export our raw materials and our finished products, because we are not in a position to do this by road.</P>
    <P>The main raw material &mdash; and it has not been mentioned in the report &mdash; is peat from our bogs.  Ten acres of bog can produce produce 250 tons of turf, and at £25 per ton it would provide reasonably high wages for one man.  They bogs are there but this report does not suggest that money should be made available for access roads to them.  Bord na Móna have made money available for private roads but there is no fund for the provision of access roads to turbary plots.  We should be thinking along the lines of the war years of 1939 to 1945 when various county councils made money available for this purpose.  The report should have taken into consideration the provision of roads into west Donegal and particularly for access roads to turbary plots for the general use of the community.</P>
    <P>I was extremely disappointed last night to hear the Minister for Finance say he did not think money should be spent on Border regions until the overall financial position of the Community has reached a certain level.  Is the Minister for Finance looking after the affairs of Ireland or the affairs of the EEC?  He is making a bad job of what he is doing, but at least while he is there I hope he will look after our affairs, particularly our Border regions. I am fully aware of his interest in those regions because when I made a simple request last year to make a case to the EEC to extend the period in which further aid could be obtained for tourist promotion in the Border areas, he flatly refused to go to Europe to look for an extension.  I had no doubt that if he had done it his request would have been treated favourably.  I hope other Ministers and the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies from those regions will exert every pressure on the Minister for Finance to accept this report in principle.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed not to see reference <Col N="523" /> in the report to fisheries and agriculture. We should note the importance which the State has attached to farm modernisation, but this Government last year in the budget suspended farm modernisation grants, leaving many people in my county in the lurch, people who had arranged bank loans on the basis that they would get those grants.  The Government have made some money available this year but on a very limited scale, of no advantage to Border region farmers.</P>
    <P>The report is biased in favour of Eglington Airport.  The Government must lead the way, because if the Government provide 50 per cent towards the acquisition of a site purchased by Donegal County Council I have on doubt Europe will provide the remainder and furthermore ensure that moneys are made available to give Donegal its required airport, main arterial roads out of the west, and deep-water ports.  In conclusion, I welcome this report in general. With some aspects I would not agree, but I hope that moneys are provided where necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this report because it confirms the view of an international institution that along the Border is one of the most depressed economic areas of Europe.  Those of us who live there and who represent such areas are already aware of this, but it is good and positive that an organisation like the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities should be willing to say that.  I have no doubt whatsoever but that lack of development and economic depression in that area have been caused by the Border which partitioned that area 60 years ago.  On looking at the map one can see the ancient city of Derry cut off from its natural hinterland, which is County Donegal, East Donegal.  Further south along the Border towns like Strabane and Lifford are cut off from one another and, indeed, as far south as Pettigoe. In one of the maps in this publication the rate of unemployment is given for the various areas along the Border. County Donegal has in excess of 20 per cent of population unemployed.  It is <Col N="524" /> obvious that this is higher than any other of the other Twenty-six counties.  Admittedly, there are a few darker spots on the other side of the Border, but it has confirmed what we have always said in this House and outside it, that we have there this problem.  County Donegal is in the unique position of being geographically in the North of Ireland, politically one can say it is in the South of Ireland but economically it is nowhere, except in the darkest corner.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that this plan covers the entire county of Donegal, and that is as it should be.  My only regret &mdash; and Deputy Gallagher mentioned this, I believe &mdash; is that going through the finer details of this report there are very few plans for development in west Donegal. I refer particularly to that area from Creeslough in the north to Killybegs. Dunkineely and Donegal town in the south.  Mind you, there are mentions of other areas in the county, Rhode and so forth, but that vast area, which is probably larger than County Louth, is completely ignored.  One of our difficulties with some of the most densely populated rural areas of this country &mdash; I talk about the parishes of Gweedore, the Rosses and Cloughineely &mdash; is that we have not a proper road into or out of the area. That is putting a definite damper on any development which could take place there.  I have had the experience for these last few years &mdash; and I am sure other Members will agree &mdash; of driving behind fish lorries and other articulated lorries for 20 or 30 miles without being able to pass them.  One of the first priorities is to build a proper network of roads in Donegal, and especially into west Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the telecommunications system should be improved within the county.  When I last had occasion to ask a parliamentary question towards the end of 1983, there were 47 manual exchanges in the county, a higher number, I believe, than in any other of the Twenty-six counties. I know that a major plan is in progress at the moment and hope that in the not too distant future, probably before the end of this year and certainly it is hoped before the end of 1985, the entire <Col N="525" /> Donegal county will have automatic exchanges.  Then, if one wants to contact someone outside the county it will be much easier to do that by telephone than to travel the roads in their present condition.</P>
    <P>One of the paragraphs in the report mentions tourism.  Another interesting map shows the tourist areas of the Border region and almost three-quarters of Donegal is considered to be a tourist area.  These last ten or 15 years, however, especially since the troubles in Northern Ireland began, no part of this country has suffered more as regards tourism than Donegal, simply because we were always dependent on the people from Northern Ireland coming into Donegal, which was looked upon as their playground. Because of the economic difficulties in Northern Ireland and the difference in prices between Northern Ireland and the South, especially in these last few years, we are finding it increasingly difficult to attract the Northern tourist into our county, even though 60 per cent of those from Northern Ireland who do take holidays in this island of ours still go to Donegal.  During the sixties and seventies many of the hotels developed and extra rooms were built and accommodation provided.  The hoteliers are finding it very difficult at the moment to meet their repayments of the borrowings made at that time.  One of the recommendations which I would make for this Border region is that the Government &mdash; and the Minister for Finance in particular &mdash; would consider treating it as a special area and give some concession to tourists who come into it.  Many of the hoteliers whom I have occasion to meet are finding things very difficult and, indeed, some are on the point of going out of business altogether.</P>
    <P>I think it was the Minister of State at the Department of Finance who announced recently that we are expecting 40,000 extra American tourists into the Twenty-six counties this year.  I just wonder how many of these will get as far as Donegal.  Our experience is that they come into Shannon, go south and north as far as Galway and to Dublin, but very few go as far north as our county.  For <Col N="526" /> that reason, some special concessionary schemes should apply to hoteliers and people in the tourist business in Donegal.</P>
    <P>In order to create employment there must be more investment in infrastructure, whether it be roads, telecommunications or transport.  We should focus on the natural resources in that area.  We have the largest fishing port in the country, Killybegs.  In this report it is stated that there is a damper on fish processing development there because they have not an adequate supply of water.  I hope that some action will be taken to remedy that.</P>
    <P>As I have a limited time available and know that other speakers wish to contribute, I finish by saying that it is good that this report has been published.  There are shortcomings, one being that west Donegal is ignored.  Nevertheless, there are some good recommendations in it. This may not be the master plan, but it is a blueprint to work on.  I hope that if some of the recommendations are carried out it will do more to bring the people together and generate goodwill, understanding and trust among the people on both sides of the Border.  I believe it would do more in that line than some of the empty rhetoric spoken over the last 60 years about the Border and how to solve it.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an phlean. Tá súil agam go léifidh an Rialtas go cúramach é agus go ndéanfaidh siad roinnt beartanna dá bharr.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government welcome the report of the Economic and Social Committee without reservations.  The Minister for Finance explained here last night that we will of course have to study the implications of the report and also that the process of transferring the recommendations of the Economic and Social Committee into operational decisions on the ground can be a long and complex one.  The Irish Government will support a positive outcome to that process with the Commission and at all levels of the Council of Ministers.  I feel sure that all Irish members of the European Parliament North and South will support that <Col N="527" /> process in the European Parliament.  This is an issue on which all shades of Irish opinion throughout our island should unite and work.  I believe that that is what will happen.</P>
      <P>The Government had, prior to the publication of the report, discussions with the British authorities with a view to ensuring that both Governments would take a positive attitude to the report.  I am glad to note that a spokesman for the British authorities said that the British Government regarded the report as helpful.</P>
      <P>I would like to say in passing that the Government Information Service have pointed out to a respected national daily newspaper that, contrary to their report this morning, the Minister for Finance did not express opposition to the report here last night.  On the contrary: the Minister for Finance welcomed the report as does every Minister in the Government and every Teachta Dála in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want to turn to the remarks of Deputy Collins last night directed against me, my Department as well as the Minister for Justice and the Department of Justice on the issue of cross-Border roads.  Those remarks were factually wrong and irresponsible.  I had explained the situation in full to this House on 16 February.  This Government not once but repeatedly pointed out its objections to road closures to the British Government. We did so once we got wind of a possibility of road closures and we did so as recently as the morning of the day of the closures, 15 February.  When we first learned that actual closures were taking place &mdash; that was at 4.00 p.m. that day &mdash; we communicated our objections both in Dublin and in London.  It is an unfortunate fact that, because of a failure to observe correct procedure, those three road closures were agreed to by a member of the Garda Síochána speaking to the RUC on 8 and 10 February.  Deputy Collins last night accused me of hiding behind a member of the Garda Síochána. Let me state quite clearly that both the Department of Justice and the Garda Commissioner require, and have so stated in their letter of instruction of <Col N="528" /> 1980, that any contact between the Garda and the RUC regarding the closure of cross-Border roads must be reported immediately to Garda Headquarters. This was not done in relation to these three roads &mdash; L4, L5 and L6 on the Monaghan-Fermanagh border.</P>
    <P>Now, Deputy Wilson, who contributed to a debate on the lunchtime news programme on 17 February, implied that I was a liar.  Deputy Collins repeated last night to the House the substance of Deputy Wilson's charges.  Referring to my replies in the Dáil on 16 February, &ldquo;It seems to me&rdquo;, said Deputy Wilson on RTE, &ldquo;that the Minister for Foreign Affairs told a cock and bull story to us&rdquo;. I have to say that I bitterly resent and totally reject Deputy Wilson's remark.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson relied on a quotation attributed in a report on 17 February by Mr. Peter Murtagh in The Irish Times to a Garda source in Monaghan, denying that the Garda Síochána had agreed to the road closures.  Mr. Murtagh directly contradicted his story of 17 February the following morning in The Irish Times. Mr. Murtagh concluded his report on 18 February: &ldquo;The version of events outlined by the security sources confirm Mr. Barry's statement and contradict what local gardaí said&rdquo;.  Mr. Murtagh was a good enough authority for Deputy Wilson on Friday last but did not rate a mention by Deputy Collins on the record of this House last night.  It seems to me extraordinary that he does not know what day of the week it is.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Wilson in his radio broadcast last Thursday and, more particularly, Deputy Collins, who had more facts available to him, here last night, behaved in a most irresponsible manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson alleged on the same news programme that &ldquo;we have reliable information that the Government was consulted on Tuesday, 14 February&rdquo;. Unlike himself, I am not going to imply that Deputy Wilson is a liar.  I am prepared to believe that he was mistaken. There was no consultation with our Government by the British on 14 February: what happened was that at 4.00 p.m. on that day we were told that three road <Col N="529" /> closures were taking place.  We were not consulted.  That is not the only mistake Deputy Wilson made.  Apparently he thought the closures took place on Wednesday, 15, when, if he had read the Official Report and the papers, he would have known the closures took place on Tuesday, 14 February.</P>
    <P>Let me try to sum up.  Yes, three road closures took place.  Yes, these three closures were unfortunately cleared by a member of the Garda Síochána who was wrong to do so.  No, the Government were not consulted at Ministerial or official level about these closures.  We have asked that all three roads be reopened. We have repeatedly and trenchantly made our strong opposition to road closures clear to the British.  In response we have been told that not alone the Garda Síochána but the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be consulted in future on possible road closures.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Opposition have chosen an issue, this report of the Economic and Social Committee, on which all sides not alone in this House but on this island are united, to play party politics. Last night the Minister for Finance outlined some of the actions already taken in the Border region under the aegis of the Community.  Much has already happened.  Our Government will be the first in the Council of Ministers to press for a speedy and successful outcome to the process initiated in this instance. In other words, we will work to ensure that much more is done.  It is quite clear that a united rather than a divided message from Dáil Éireann will help to ensure this desirable progress.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border co-operation to the maximum extent possible is an important element in the policy of successive Irish Governments on the Northern Ireland problem.  Although important, it is only one aspect of our policy.  A further important element is our encouragement of a strong role for the European Community in helping to solve the Northern Ireland issue.  It so happens that issues that arise from Community membership often provide a focus for consensus in the otherwise deeply divided society in Northern Ireland.  We have often seen the three <Col N="530" /> MEPs from Northern Ireland working together on the same side in Strasbourg and they have often had the support of all of the members of the European Parliament from this State.  This process of working together must be encouraged at every opportunity.  This report provides a perfect opportunity for developing a sense on the part of our politicians and our people that we can create prosperity by working together, whatever our political differences.  &ldquo;Ar scáth a chéile 'sea mhaireann na daoine&rdquo;, as our ancestors so wisely held: we might all profitably follow that excellent precept.</P>
    <P>I think it quite opportune that this report has emerged at the same time as the Draft Resolution proposed by Mr. Niels Haagerup.  One of the clauses of his resolution coincides with an important element of the report before the House. Mr. Haagerup proposes that the Parliament should:</P>
    <P>ask the Commission and the Council of Ministers of the European Community to undertake a major review of all its current and planned projects in Northern Ireland and in the Border areas of the Republic, to present an integrated plan for a major contribution to the development of Northern Ireland, in conformity with the overall objectives of the European Community and to report to the European Parliament on the progress achieved as part of this plan.</P>
    <P>Again I am confident that all sides in Ireland, North and South, will be glad to support this particular proposal.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that, quite apart from the interest of the European Community in the region, and quite apart from our commitment to cross-Border co-operation with or without Community involvement, this Government are actively committed to the development of the area contiguous to the Border in this State.  Important examples are:</P>
    <P>In telecommunications, automatic subscriber trunk dialling has been introduced and gradually extended throughout the Border area.  It is expected that by the end of the year virtually the entire telephone network <Col N="531" /> will have been converted to automatic working.</P>
    <P>In transport, the road infrastructure has been improved and developed. The Government are committed to further improvements and upgrading.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, mentioned one such instance in his speech: the Newry-Dundalk road.  The Lough Swilly Bus Company have continued to receive a substantial subsidy from Government so as to ensure that Inishowen and North Donegal have a regular bus service.</P>
    <P>In energy, the Government have concluded an agreement with the British authorities for the supply of Kinsale gas to Northern Ireland.  The extension of gas supplies from that pipeline is under consideration.</P>
    <P>In tourism and amenities, work has commenced on a feasibility study of restoring the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  Tourist facilities, for example at Glenveagh National Park, have been developed.  The Special Border Areas Programme has been of assistance in many fields of tourist activity.</P>
    <P>In drainage, schemes for the Blackwater and the Finn-Lackey systems are under way.</P>
    <P>This report of the Economic and Social Committee is only the latest in a series of reports on development in the Border area by different Community institutions. Both Governments are actively engaged in implementing the Derry-Donegal Communications Study of 1977 and the Erne Catchment Area Study of 1979.  There are of course other Community-wide regional aid programmes of special application to Border areas which we are involved in, notably the European Community's Cross-Border Drainage Programme and the European Community's Special Border Areas Programme which concentrates on tourism development and the development of small businesses.  There are other cross-Border programmes which have been undertaken by the two administrations themselves, notably the East Border Region Tourism Study and, of course, the Kinsale-Belfast gas pipeline. <Col N="532" /> What is most useful about the latest report is that it draws together the work that has already been done and puts it in a new overall context.  As such it will serve as an indispensable reference work for everyone concerned with this area of development, Ministers, Teachtaí Dála, Government Departments, local authority representatives and local authority officials.  The report records appreciation of the input made by local politicians, including Members of this House on both sides of the Border and I commend all those politicians for their important contribution to the future of their region.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Committee recommend an ambitious expansion of existing activity in several cases and also a number of new programmes.  They also recommend the creation of special budgetary provisions for carrying some of their recommendations into practice.</P>
    <P>Let me make the Government's position very clear.  We welcome these recommendations and will do everything we can within the limits of our financial capacity to ensure that the greatest possible effect is given to the report.  We will work as a Government in Brussels to ensure that the report is implemented in the best and most realistic way possible. We will support in any way we can the efforts of all members of the European Parliament from this island to win the support of their colleagues in the European Parliament for the implementation of the report.  That is our commitment.</P>
    <P>Now there is nothing more irresponsible, and there are few actions more cruel, than for politicians to raise the expectations of the people beyond what is realistically possible.  In inviting all sides of this House and indeed all shades of opinion in Northern Ireland as well as the British Government to work with us for the implementation of this report to the fullest extent possible and in the shortest possible time span, could I ask all my colleagues in the House, and particularly those from the Border counties, to explain to their constituents the procedures which are involved in Community decision-making.  These procedures are elaborate, lengthy and often frustrating. They are not, however, insurmountable. <Col N="533" /> To my mind, the approach taken by the Economic and Social Committee in this case is the right one.  It is an approach that helps consensus, indeed it commands consensus.  The New Ireland Forum is engaged at a more fundamental level in the far more difficult task of creating ground for consensus in which peace and stability can take hold and flourish.  I believe that all parties involved in the Forum are endeavouring sincerely and impressively to achieve success in this great work.  I think they should be encouraged by this report and other initiatives of the European Community, a Community of which all Irish people of all Irish traditions are full European citizens, a Community committed in the words of its founding fathers:</P>
    <P>to substitute for age-old rivalries the merging of their essential interests; to create, by establishing an economic community, the basis for a broader and deeper community among peoples long divided by bloody conflicts; and to lay the foundations for institutions which will give direction to a destiny henceforward shared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to what the Minister had to say.  He was very conciliatory towards the motion put down by Fianna Fáil.  He said:</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that a united rather than a divided message from Dáil Éireann will help to ensure this desirable programme.</P>
      <P>Later on he said:</P>
      <P>We will support in any way we can the efforts of all members of the European Parliament from this island to win the support of their colleagues in the European Parliament for the implementation of the report.  That is our commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand, having listened to the Minister's speech, why the Government have an amendment down to our motion because our motion calls on the Government to take all the necessary steps to ensure the early and successful <Col N="534" /> implementation of the report.  This is what the Minister has just supported.  The Government's amendment, which is a very diluted concept, just urges the Government to have the recommendations of the report fully considered. There is a very important distinction there.  I was very glad to hear the Minister speak because I believe he has got the commitment to see this report is implemented and that he will use his good offices in Europe to ensure that this will take place.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to what Deputy G. Collins said last night.  While I was not in the House last night I understand that Deputy Collins quoted from an article in <i>The Irish Press</i> of Thursday, 16 February entitled &ldquo;British Army may block more roads near the Border&rdquo;.  It referred to a statement from the Northern Ireland Office.  Deputy Collins is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>The statement added that there has been discussions &ldquo;in the normal way with Irish authorities at police and political levels&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Obviously Deputy Collins was referring to a report in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 16 February which he had read and from which he had quoted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The report deals with the expenditure of £125 million and the people who come over here from the Economic and Social Committee of the EEC recognise that the Border region is depressed economically.  It is a peripheral region with no hinterland to the towns because of the Border.  One looks at the example of the town of Clones of which three-quarters is surrounded by Fermanagh <Col N="535" /> which is in the Six Counties.  Practically the whole hinterland of Clones is cut off and so Clones is one of the most economically depressed towns in Europe.  The blocking of the roads there last week simply added further to the problems of that region.  Enough has been said about the blocking of the roads, but it could do absolutely nothing to prevent violence of any sort in County Fermanagh. All it did was to inconvenience the farmers who live in that area.  Some of them would have to travel 14 miles as a result of these roads being blocked.  It increased political tension on both sides of the Border, perhaps leading to trouble.  It was a stupid decision on the part of the British Government and one hopes that we will not see any more of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EEC have shown a great interest in border regions and a particular interest in the Border region in Ireland.  We are the only country where the Border receives money from the non-quota section of the Regional Development Fund.  In their report they list certain priorities.  They list communications, for example, roads.  It is unfortunate that on the national primary road from Dublin to Enniskillen the bridge which was blown up was not replaced as a result of the refusal of the Northern Ireland Office and the British Government to replace it, again causing economic depression in the town of Belturbet and great inconvenience to the people who use that road. There is no reason, other than intransigence, why that bridge should not have been replaced.  The bridge on the national primary road No. 2 from Dublin to Derry, while functioning satisfactorily, is a temporary bridge, and we might look to having a permanent bridge erected there between Aughnacloy and Emyvale. We have heard a long saga about the Dundalk-Newry road.  Apparently the local authorities on this and the other side of the Border each decided to go their own way and each decided that they would get the quickest route to the Border for themselves.  The Dundalk road to the Border was planned to go along the east coast and the Newry road to the Border was going inland and the points <Col N="536" /> at which they should meet were half a mile apart.  Any report or any influence from anywhere that would ensure that such planning does not go on would be very welcome.  I hope to see rapid development now on having that road, which is part of the Dublin-Belfast road, constructed at an early date.</P>
    <P>One problem here is that all the national primary roads go into and out of Dublin.  The only major primary road going east-west is the Dublin-Galway road.  There is need for a major national primary road from Sligo to Dundalk and perhaps to Greenore to the port there which has 30 ft. of water at low tide and would be ideal for development for cross-Channel shipping services.  This should be considered in the context of EEC support.</P>
    <P>The report refers to the crippling taxation policy, and while it does not condemn any Government we would condemn the present Government.  The report mentions the tax on fuel, and the 35p a gallon imposed in the first month the Government were in office was responsible for a tremendous amount of cross-Border trade with people leaving this State and crossing the Border, which is estimated to have cost the Exchequer here £150 million.  The EEC have also shown their commitment to this country in the £100 million given for work in Belfast.</P>
    <P>On telecommunications, the telephone service is improving.  Direct dialling to the Six Counties is not up to the standard one would expect and it is necessary on practically all occasions to go through the exchange.  The question of a joint telephone directory for the people living in this Border region which would embrace the telephone numbers on both sides of the Border would be worth considering. Such a directory would be very useful.</P>
    <P>A great deal of good work on tourism has been done jointly by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte and it is encouraging to see in the report much support for the development of co-operation between the two tourist boards and the development of tourism. In my county EEC funds were responsible <Col N="537" /> for the purchase of Lake Muckno with 900 acres of water and 100 acres of land to be developed as a major amenity area.  It is encouraging to see that the report recommended that a further £1 million be spent on developing that amenity for water sports and other tourist-orientated facilities.  The Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte have produced a very attractive brochure selling tourism jointly on both sides of the Border.  The Minister here referred tonight to a report, which was aided by the EEC, on tourism in what is known as the east Border region which comprises County Monaghan and County Louth on this side of the Border and Newry and Mourne District Council and County Down on the northern side of the Border.  They make a very compact unit and a cross-Border development committee made up of the members of the four local authorities and their executives has been set up.  An EEC-aided tourist study was carried out and an excellent report was produced.  I proposed at a meeting of that committee and to the Minister, and to the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. Adam Butler, at a meeting in Downpatrick that the next step as a follow-on to that report is to set up an administrative structure to administer these Border regions.  Irrespective of what way one looks at this it would be of great advantage to all local authorities, to North-South co-operation and to those who would use it as a tourist area.  All facilities needed by those going on holiday will be available &mdash; the sea coast of Counties Down and Louth, the mountains in Armagh and in the Newry and Mourne areas and the lakelands of Monaghan.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment in the report to drainage works on various rivers. There is an anxiety about certain rivers on which it was proposed to carry out drainage works, but because of lack of finance it has not been possible to proceed with them.  I am referring to the Finn-Lackey and the Blackwater.  The amount of money allocated to the latter originally would be insufficient to carry out that work.  Work is due to commence on the portion of that river in the Six <Col N="538" /> Counties and, hopefully, all the money will not be spent on the Six County side with the result that there will not be any money left to continue the work on our side.</P>
    <P>Industry is very important in that area. If one looks at the statistics one will see that on the northern side Newry has an unemployment rate of 26 per cent; Strabane, 28 per cent; and Derry, 24 per cent; while on this side of the Border our national average is 8.9 per cent, but the figure in the Border region is 12.7 per cent.  We would welcome the support recommended for industry such as joint promotions between the IDA and the IDB, the development of the pig and poultry industry on this side of the Border and the development of the craft industries. It is necessary that there should be more co-operation between local authorities, VECs, the IDA and county development teams to ensure we get the maximum benefit from any work to be carried out to promote employment in the area.</P>
    <P>The report calls for development work to improve the appearance of rural towns.  The report should have included the development of recreation facilities in Border towns.  There is no reason why recreation facilities should not be provided out of the moneys to be made available for tourist orientated facilities.  At a time of high unemployment it is important that people should use their leisure time correctly.  That is important also in the promotion of good health and prevention of illness.  In terms of tourism it is also important that such amenities are made available.</P>
    <P>The Government should adopt the report and, for their part, implement its terms.  If they are getting finance from the EEC and are obliged only to put up a half or one-third of the cost it is bad economics not to avail of it.  Cross-Border development committees do very useful work.  However, they do not have any teeth and the Minister should seek to give them a more positive role to play because there is a danger that they will become defunct.  The Minister should arrange that copies of the report are sent to those committees for distribution among members <Col N="539" /> so that its proposals can be discussed at meetings.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the only way the terms of the report can be implemented is through the co-operation of the UK and the Republic of Ireland Governments.  I have no doubt that our Government will play their part but I doubt if the UK Government will be prepared to play their role.  There are 300 miles of Border and the region is peripheral in both parts of the country.  As long as it exists there will always be problems.  The ideal must be a united Ireland and then the area we are dealing with will have the same opportunity as other parts of the country for proper social and economic development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members from Border counties, particularly those who reside in the region, must welcome the report which was compiled by the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities.  According to the report we are one of the least economically and socially developed areas in Europe with the added disadvantage of being cut in half by a frontier or border that curtails normal economic development. That frontier or border is there and while it is the earnest hope and aspiration of most people that the country should be one united Ireland I see the implementation of the report as being a positive step towards unification.  To implement these proposals there has to be close co-operation with the authorities North and South and that, in turn, must lead to a greater understanding and a lessening of the distrust and fear we seem to have of each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any move of this nature must be beneficial to both communities.  To comment on all aspects of the report would take a considerable amount of time and in the time allocated for the debate that would be impossible.  Therefore, it is my intention to comment only on a few aspects of it.  The first matter I wish to raise is a rather contentious one, the issue of Border roads and the closure and otherwise of them.  We are all aware that many Border roads have been closed in recent <Col N="540" /> years for specific reasons.  The only aspect I am interested in is that in closing those roads many people in adjoining areas have had their way of life disrupted.  They have found it extremely difficult to carry on their normal everyday activities.  I should like to cite one case to illustrate my point.  A road leading into the town of Pettigo, a Border town, was cratered some years ago by the British Army for reasons best known to the authorities but there was not any consideration for a business person living in that area who had for many years run a reasonably good business with the communities north and south of the Border.  Due to the cratering of the road that business terminated and the unfortunate person had to close down.  He is a social welfare recipient now.</P>
    <P>There are many other instances that could be cited to illustrate the problems these closures have caused.  I should like to ask the Government to give a guarantee to reinvestigate the closure of these roads and to press to have as many of them as possible reopened.  The Government should also press to have requests for compensation since the closure of the roads dealt with.  If we are to have co-operation and a better relationship with Northern Ireland we will have to take some positive steps.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to mention is the question of roads and infrastructure in Donegal.  We are all aware that a good road system is vital to industry, trade and tourism.  While there are proposals in the report under discussion to improve many roads in Donegal, there are some glaring omissions.  Many other roads warrant consideration.  Last night the Minister for Finance mentioned that the Ballyshannon-Donegal road has been completed and will be officially opened in March.  This has meant a very pleasant and easy journey for motorists travelling to Donegal from Sligo and other western counties but many people who travel to Donegal from Dublin, the Midlands and Northern Ireland travel through Ennis-killen to Pettigo.  That road must be one of the worst in Ireland and needs urgent attention.  However, it is not mentioned <Col N="541" /> in this report.  It must be obvious that the group who carried out this survey missed this much used road.</P>
    <P>I want to mention other roads, especially that leading to Gweedore, one of the few Gaeltacht areas in the country. There are many valid reasons why this road should be considered.  We have an industrial estate on that road.  We have an automatic telephone system but the road system does not match it and this should be given consideration.  Burtonport is a fishing area and if you are unfortunate enough to get behind one of the big Hinos leaving Burtonport you are behind it until you almost reach Donegal town.  The roads to those areas leave a lot to be desired.  Driving heavy vehicles on these roads is nothing short of nightmarish. Work on the road to Killybegs has started but the local authorities are financially constrained and progress on the completion of this road is very slow.  In the interests of the fishing industry it is desirable that this project be completed as soon as possible.  I know from surveys carried out that this is reputed to be one of the busiest roads in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows tourism in Donegal has suffered over the past few years, and there are many reasons for that.  One of them could be the difference in prices between those charged in Donegal and those charged in the neighbouring Northern Ireland counties.  There are other contributing factors but I do not intend to go into them.  Despite efforts by Bord Fáilte and others interested to promote tourism in the Border areas, there is much to be done, as this report shows.</P>
    <P>On page 30, the report suggests schemes, but many of them must be carried out in conjunction with the Department of the Environment because a number of the larger towns in Donegal &mdash; Donegal town, Bundoran, Ballyshannon, Killybegs and Ardagh &mdash; need massive injections of capital to provide adequate water supplies and proper sewerage systems.  We cannot promote tourism on the one hand and have inadequate facilities on the other.  Development in Killybegs is being hindered because of an inadequate water supply. If these facilities are not provided, a town <Col N="542" /> cannot expand.  There is little point promoting the tourist industry if the Department of the Environment do not give a commitment that the necessary services will be provided as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Many projects listed in the report, if implemented, will generate employment and hopefully entice more tourists into the area.  However, I was disappointed that Letterkenny Airport was not approved and that no money was available for this project.  This should be given due consideration.</P>
    <P>The drainage of the Rivers Finn, Foyle and Mourne would be welcomed by the farming community in County Donegal, especially the Finn Valley, which has been a bone of contention for a number of years.  There has been a loss of crops in this area due to flooding but nothing has been done about it.  I welcome this project and hope it will be carried out in the near future.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border co-operation in relation to processing and marketing of timber is also welcomed.  We have enough timber to warrant an in-depth study of small industries, especially those related to timber. There should be a greater awareness of the importance of afforestation.  There are grants available for private planting and if people were aware of this more might be done.  Mention was made of access road to forests.  Now that we have timber for sale it appears that it was impossible to get the timber out in some areas.  This is a terrible situation and something should be done about it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I earnestly request the Government to implement as many of the proposals in the report as possible and show the people in the Border regions that this Government have the interests of this region at heart.  We need implementation of this report, not consideration.</P>

      <P>This is a very short time to deal with what I regard as a very important subject.  I was in Strasbourg when somebody from home rang me and asked how this money had been agreed for <Col N="543" /> spending in the Border regions.  Many people were taken by surprise by this announcement and thought the decision had already been made.  I looked at the situation and decided that this was a suggestion from the periphery of the decision-making establishment for the Social and Economic Committee of the European Community.  Nevertheless, we welcome their attention.  But there is a long way through the complicated decision-making process from where we are now to get final agreement with the Council of Ministers for a directive to spend this money.</P>
      <P>We should not see this as a comprehensive proposal for the development of the Border regions.  Rather this is a proposal for the development of a number of projects which could not be said to form any sort of an economic plan.  I have put down a resolution in the European Parliament, that the Parliament now proceed to adopt this report and prepare a report of their own suggesting that the Commission prepare a directive for the Council of Ministers.  Therefore we have already taken it another step.</P>
      <P>Already we spend quite an amount of money in the Border regions.  I might remind the House that we had a report on the development of the Erne catchment area.  Yet, when funds were provided from the non-quota section of the Regional Fund for cross-Border areas we proceeded to find new ways of spending those funds without any reference to the Erne catchment area.  We decided to disperse the moneys from that cross-Border development fund on a large number of projects including some Deputy O'Hanlon mentioned.  I do not think that was sensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here there are proposals for a number of projects in an area which is obviously extremely depressed, depressed by the existence of the Border and for geographical reasons ever before that Border was created.  Therefore this is an area warranting attention.  The Border has aggravated the economic problems that would have existed anyway in that region.  The spending of this money on different types of schemes on either side of the Border <Col N="544" /> will improve the economic situation but will not tackle its root causes.  If we are to tackle the root causes we must prepare a fully integrated plan which will be administered or at least supervised by a single organisation with some competence to overlook the spending of money in both areas.  If one looks at the spending on farm structures through the common agricultural policy, if one looks at the way the money is spent on either side of the Border, one would not realise one was talking about the same European directive.</P>
    <P>Similarly our taxation policies have created trade difficulties across the Border, have turned the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners into a policing organisation who must watch vigilantly day and night along that whole Border region, making it more difficult for people to travel up and down, when we should be seeking to open up the channels.  We must endeavour to harmonise economic conditions on both sides of the Border, and legislation, so that we will not have two taxation regimes so widely differing that they require the building of a Border which at times gives one the impression of a Berlin Wall.  I am most concerned about the breaking of these communications routes, the Border roads in certain areas. In County Leitrim we had two important contact routes only, one at Kiltyclogher and one at Rossinver, which have been closed for years.  I do not believe there were sufficient security grounds for doing so.  Rather I believe it to be political victimisation of an area.  I know the Minister took up this matter some years ago. I would request him to take note that nothing has happened in this area, that the Counties of Leitrim and Fermanagh are permanently divided, that parishes, villages and communities are divided. Protestant people are prevented from going to the church in the Republic they always attended and Catholics from going to their place of worship in Northern Ireland they traditionally attended.  No amount of spending of moneys or recommendations from the Community will resolve that problem <Col N="545" /> until there is the application of uniform economic policies on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>I shall seek to raise some of these points at European level as we proceed to make a report on this, which I hope we will, and we shall maintain contact with our Minister requesting his assistance from time to time.</P>

      <P>We contend that, had <Col N="546" /> the Government been taking the issue really seriously, we would not have had to use our time, as an Opposition, to initiate the debate.</P>
      <P>Along with the other Deputies representing Border constituencies who are directly involved I welcome this report although I have certain reservations in relation to it.  It is an informative report, a document compiled from the other reports and studies that have been undertaken in Border regions over the past ten years.  I would be concerned not so much with what is contained in the report but what has been omitted from it.  In that respect I might make some observations.</P>
      <P>On every aspect of the committee's investigation the most crucial problem they encountered was unemployment in that region.  This is the key issue in relation to the whole of the Border region and one to which we, as politicians, and the Government must face up.  In relation to the Border region I contend &mdash; and I put it on record here along with other Deputies representing Border constituencies &mdash; that there should be undertaken an in-depth economic study of the entire Border region.  Were such a study undertaken inevitably its outcome would indicate that we have economic difficulties in that area not related to any other part of the country, particularly in the county and constituency I represent, Donegal, which is entirely cut away from the rest of the Republic by an unnatural border.  Unfortunately it is because of that border we have these chronic difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have consistently contended, in relation to the Derry/Donegal/Strabane region &mdash; that triangle has been mentioned here, encompassing an area, as it does, stretching right to Malin Head and the Inishowen Penisula &mdash; that an industrial estate should be sited in that region to correct the chronic unemployment situation prevailing there.  We know to our cost the economic difficulties the Northern Ireland problems have created for our economy, troubles brought about by the lack of employment, particularly in areas west of the Bann because the Nationalist population had been abandoned by a Stormont administration <Col N="547" /> which did not care whether or not they existed or how they developed; they had no real interest.  We in the Donegal region suffered from the same type of problem through lack of special consideration for our region cut away from the rest of the Republic by that unnatural border.</P>
    <P>If one examines the unemployment situation in the Strabane/Derry and Donegal regions one finds it has been the highest in the country, not for the past five years but for the past 25.  While there is today an outcry from all parts of the country in regard to unemployment we have had to struggle with that difficulty over the past 25 years.  The Government must give encouragement and the agencies responsible for the development of industry must take a special interest in the area.  Employment can be generated from the natural resources of the region and I refer specifically to farming and the fishing industry which are underdeveloped. These valuable resources are exported in a raw state with no further manufacturing processes which would create employment.  The IDA and agencies responsible for industrial development should undertake some programme to deal with the problem.  The fishing industry has not been mentioned in the report.  I refer specifically to the Greencastle harbour where development work has been planned for the past five or six years but to date work has not been carried out on the harbour.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the Government provide the necessary finances to develop that fishing port.  If it were developed it would be the second largest fishing port in the country and it would provide onshore jobs for the community on the Inishowen Peninsula which has the highest rate of unemployment in the country.</P>
    <P>Agriculture needs special attention.  In 1982 there were 4,564 applicants under the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  This represented 1.7 per cent of commercial farmers and 8.8 per cent of development farmers.  The other category who were farmers under 55 years of age represented 71 per cent.  The Department of <Col N="548" /> Agriculture have issued a document to the ACOT offices which contains the following:</P>
    <P>With reference to your application for grant aid, the position is that aid is no longer available to farmers in your category under the Farm Modernisation Scheme, Your application is, accordingly, returned herewith.  You may wish to contact ACOT to discuss your position.</P>
    <P>For my region this means that 71.1 per cent of the applications will not qualify for any aid under the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  This is the implementation of the Mansholt Plan which was designed to eliminate small farmers.  Due to the land structure in Donegal the farming community consists basically of small land-holders.  If we are going to abandon them we must provide employment for them elsewhere, but I do not see much hope of this.  In their policies with regard to assessment of small land-holders the Government are practically annihilating them.</P>
    <P>We know that at the moment there is a scheme in Brussels regarding private afforestation.  In 1980 a plan was introduced, allowing £18 million to be provided to this country over ten years.  In effect, there should have been expenditure of £1.8 million per year for forestry development for the private sector.  However, the Government took up only £90,000 over three years when they should have taken up £5.32 million.  In 1958 the Department set a target of 10,000 acres per year for forestry development but that has been reduced to 6,000 acres for the the entire country.  We are anxious to make a submission to Brussels for aid for the Border region, but the aid available through the various agencies is not being taken up by the Government.  This will weaken our case with regard to financing this report.</P>
    <P>Many questions must be asked with regard to the report, because there does not seem to be any plan about how it will be financed.  I agree with what the Minister for Finance said last night, that the target is £125 million but the overall cost could be nearer £200 million.</P>

      <P>With regard to the infrastructure we require in the Donegal region and which has been referred to by my colleagues tonight, I make a special appeal to the Minister to ensure that the development of the Letterkenny airport goes ahead.  It appears from this report that it is to be downgraded in favour of Eglington.  If we are to develop the Donegal region we must have the necessary communications particularly in relation to the airport.  The railway was taken from us, we have a poor road structure and we have no transport system between Donegal and Dublin.  Because of our remoteness these factors are disadvantages and they add to the economic problems of the business community.</P>
      <P>In relation to the industrial zone there must be some commitment by the Government.  In this connection I wish to quote from a report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> dated 15 May 1983.  It states:</P>
      <P>A unique experiment in job creation has been given the go-ahead by the Coalition Government.  But final approval for the trans-Border scheme has yet to be given by the British Government.  Unique in world industrial terms, the scheme straddles the Border between Donegal and Derry with a free port at its core.  If it is approved by the British &mdash; and indications are they will sanction it &mdash; it will mean that the IDA and its equivalent in the North, the IDB, will be jointly promoting the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial zone plan is based on the Shannon Airport Industrial Free Zone complex .....  The plan was originally prepared three years ago by officials of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, under the <Col N="550" /> direction fo the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Des O'Malley.</P>
    <P>The plans are with the Department in relation to that development and I ask the Government to ensure that they will be processed.  Our immediate objective must be to improve communications and the infrastructure in the region so that it will be put on an equal footing with other areas and so that it will have a chance of competing and surviving.  We must devote our will to narrowing significantly the disparity between these Border regions and the rest of the community. There must be firm commitment from the Government to follow this report through.  They must provide the money to ensure the full economic development of the region.</P>
    <P>Finally, I suggest that the Government must approach local authorities in Border areas and ask them to provide lists of high priority projects so that there can be some movement to get finances into areas that heretofore have been neglected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I should like to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue, even though the time is very short.  Unfortunately, my three colleagues from South Tipperary will not have time to contribute, but Deputy Griffin will probably be able to contribute.  I shall be as brief as possible.</P>
      <P>All the Deputies from south Tipperary had a meeting in connection with the recent tragedy in the Galtee Mountains when over 1,000 sheep were lost.  Most of the farmers in this area have sheep raising as their main source of income, but the ewes and the lambs which were on the way were lost.  The headage payments and premium payments have been lost as well and also the sale of wool.  Their total livelihood is at stake.  I appeal to the Minister to arrange for these people to be compensated, as were the farmers two years ago when a similar tragedy of sheep losses occurred around the country.  A special rescue package was set up at that time.  We do not mind if the money comes from the Minister's fund or from Brussels as long as help is provided for those people who work so hard.  They live in a very rough part of this mountain area and their losses are very hard on them.  They have to walk up to three and four miles in this mountain area when they are looking after their sheep.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the engineering and outdoor staff of South Tipperary County Council for the help they gave to those sheep farmers while they were trying to rescue their sheep. They also helped the veterinary profession in South Tipperary to count the sheep lost.  The situation was so grave that those sheep farmers do not yet know what their losses are as snow is still on the hills.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to bring a rescue package into operation and, if possible, to meet a deputation from the sheep farmers concerned. They led a very miserable life up to a few years ago when the price of sheep increased.  Now, when they were trying to eke out a living this calamity occurred. I know the Minister was made aware of this during the past week and that he will be as helpful as he can.  As time is short I will allow my colleague, Deputy Brendan Griffin, to speak.  Deputy Seán Treacy and Deputy McCarthy were anxious to speak on this matter but the time is not available.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and I appeal to the Minister to do what he can for these people.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputy S. Byrne for giving me a few minutes of the very short time allocated to him.  I would like to substantiate the very fine case he has made for the sheep <Col N="555" /> farmers of the Galtee Mountains who suffered great losses in the recent snowstorm. We know from the figures available that about 901 sheep were suffocated on the mountainside and approximately 22 farmers have suffered varying losses. One man lost 150 sheep, another 85, and another 50.  The exact details have not been verified.  They have a genuine case, and I sincerely appeal to the Minister to reintroduce the hardship fund, which we had two years ago, to compensate the farmers who are solely dependent on sheep for their livelihood.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that this particular area applied to be admitted into the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme because of the poverty of the area and the low income of the farmers. It is estimated that losses in the region of £50,000 have been incurred.  When one considers the loss of 900 sheep, most of whom were in lamb and the consequent loss of their wool the value of each sheep would be £60 when all the losses are added up.</P>
      <P>I would like to reassure the people of South Tipperary that the water supply is not contaminated.  It is purified, and the county medical officer has indicated that there is no threat to the water supply.  I ask the Minister to sympathetically consider the case of those sheep farmers. The figures of losses can be verified.  We have the headage payment scheme and we have the number in the sheep dipping scheme.  The Minister's officers in South Tipperary can verify each loss to individual farmers.  I also ask the Minister to introduce an emergency scheme so that if there is a repetition of this disaster a rescue action plan could be put into operation immediately involving the Army helicopters, which could drop food to the sheep, and taking in all the other agencies.</P>

I urge the Minister to come to the aid of these small sheep farmers in their hour of need and grant them the maximum State assistance.  I also urge him to avail of the disaster fund from the European Parliament, which is available for such purposes, and he will have my support and that of my European colleagues to that end.</P>

Some of these measures have already been taken, such as the engineering changes, governing the discharges of liquid to the sea, to prevent a reoccurance of this accident. Other measures are in hand.

      <P>He was notified of the decision in his case at the local office at which he signs as unemployed and he was informed of his right to appeal if he was dissatisfied with the decision in his case.  He recently appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and arrangements are being made to refer his case to an appeals officer for determination.  The rate of unemployment assistance payable to him will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>It was decided by the local pension committee on 4 November 1982 that the person concerned is entitled to an old age pension at the weekly rate of £32.45 from 10 October 1982.  This rate increased to £36.60 from 1 July 1983.  This is the rate of pension to which he is entitled having regard to the assessment of his means, consisting of the weekly value of capital.</P>
      <P>If his capital has reduced in the meantime it is open to him to apply to have his pension increased.  On receipt of such an application his title will be reinvestigated and he will be notified of the outcome.</P>

    <P>Statistics in relation to the number of maintenance orders made in the year ended 31 July 1983 are being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.  Statistics in respect of maintenance orders made during the year ended 31 July 1979 are not available.</P>
    <P>The figures exclude maintenance summonses issued at the request of solicitors in the Metropolitan District Court for the years ended 31 July 1979 and 31 July 1980 &mdash; such statistics were not kept for those years.  It is estimated that they would amount to no more than 16 in the two year period.</P>
    <P>As regards custody, the District Court did not have jurisdiction under the <Col N="474" /> Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, until the commencement of the Courts Act, 1981, on 12 May 1982.  No summonses were issued or orders made under the Act for the hearing of disputes as to custody in the legal year ended 31 July 1982 and the numbers for the year ended 31 July 1983 were 100 and 77 respectively.</P>

      <P>I deeply regret that the Ceann Comhairle has seen fit to adjourn the House on two occasions today.  I think that this is unprecedented, certainly in recent times.  It involves the loss of 50 minutes' time.  In justification of ourselves on this side of the House, I should like to place on record that our Members were not unruly.  The three different matters which we sought to raise were, firstly, the seeking of a debate on a matter of urgent national importance; secondly, the visit of the French President which took place yesterday and which had important implications for our agricultural interests; thirdly, a matter of some significance involving the Minister for Justice.  I feel that we were entitled to raise these matters and have some discussion on them.  On both occasions, in my view, the Members on this side of the House, while persisting in raising the matters, exploring them and seeking the assistance of the Chair in regard to them, were not unruly.  It is regrettable that the Chair saw fit on these two occasions to adjourn the House.  I say this in all sincerity and with due deference.  Lest it reflect on the behaviour of this Party and its Members, I feel that I should say this much about the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Haughey.  I have taken the unusual course of allowing a statement on my ruling because that statement came on a day when the House was adjourned on two occasions.  Deputy Haughey was here this morning when the House was first adjourned and I leave that to himself and I leave it to the report which will appear in the record of the House.  I should like to put on record, however, that it was only after several of what I considered to be disorderly interruptions and an assurance from Deputies that I would not get order in the House, as long as disorderly remarks were reported some place, that I felt obliged to adjourn the House.</P>
      <P>On the second occasion, Deputy Haughey was not present and again I shall rely on the records when they come out.  One Deputy got up and raised a matter which I feel he must have known was not in order at that time, and I so ruled.  It took several efforts and a threat of action to get that Deputy to sit down. Another Deputy stood up and raised another matter and, while it was a separate matter, the principle which applied to the first ruling clearly applied to the second.  One Deputy who frequently gets up, shall I say, on the Order of Business arose on a number of occasions about other matters.  Then when the matters appeared to be cleared up another Deputy, who rarely gives any trouble in the House or is rarely disorderly, got up on one of the matters on which I had already ruled, and insisted on raising it once again, and insisted on speaking while the Chair was speaking.</P>
      <P>This went on, Deputy Haughey, argument and wrangle for ten or 15 minutes. I do not want to appear to be frivolous and I do not want to appear to be provocative but you yourself, Deputy Haughey, are on record on the day on which I first took this Chair of an acceptance of the Chair and an end to argument with the Chair.  Now if I am to preserve the dignity of the House as a national assembly I must get co-operation.  If it is thought I am acting outside my jurisdiction or in an unreasonable manner the machinery is there to call me to task in a formal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> I want now to put this on record: I have the best of relationships with the Members of this House and we have, I think, held more meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges since this Dáil was elected than occurred in the same time span in previously elected Dáils and in all those meetings I have never been called to task and I have never even been questioned.  I appeal now to the Members of the House.  If Standing Orders are defective, or do not give them the latitude to which they feel they are entitled, there is a way of remedying that and, as long as I am in this House, I will to the best of my ability, as I said on the day I was elected, operate the Standing Orders of the House.  I am calling the next item now.  I do not want any more discussion on this.  Item No. 11, Deputy Denis Foley is in possession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, a Cheann Comhairle, going to enter into the matters you have mentioned.  I have made my protest and made the position clear and I accept it is no part of our business to be at odds with the Chair and to waste the time of the House on procedural wrangles, and I hope we will succeed in avoiding that to the best of our ability in future.  All I ask is that you perceive to the greatest extent you can our point of view and the desire of my colleagues to raise matters which appear to them to be very important, perhaps important in the opinion of a particular Member or particular Members, and perhaps you could see their point of view in very urgent matters.  Deputies on this side feel frustrated from time to time, but that is not the point I rose to make.  I want to point out to you that the Government are, I am afraid, treating the House with great disrespect. They refused to have a Minister here practically all day today.  I just want to draw your attention to that.</P>

      <P>There is a standing practice here, and Deputy Tunney knows this, that a margin is allowed for supplementary questions.  The Chair tries to be reasonable and the Leader of your party suggests that he should be a bit flexible.  There is a standing practice to allow a supplementary question or two if Question Time finishes dead on 3.30 p.m. as it did today and Deputy Tunney should check because it did not go until twenty to four.  It went to marginally less than twenty five to four.</P>
