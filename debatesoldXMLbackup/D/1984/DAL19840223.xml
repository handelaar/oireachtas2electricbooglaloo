      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I have indicated to you my intention to raise under Standing Order 30 the general question of the placing of listening devices in a private house in Del Val Avenue, Kilbarrack, and the failure of the Government and the Minister for Justice to provide a satisfactory debate in Dáil Éireann in regard to the circumstances in which the placing of these devices took place and the identity of the person or persons responsible.  I want to have the House adjourned under Standing Order 30 to discuss this matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey last evening conveyed to me his intention to seek permission to move the Adjournment of the House under Standing Order 30 to raise a matter in connection with the alleged bugging at Kilbarrack. He conveyed to me this morning more detail of the matter which he seeks to raise as he has read out.  I have considered the matter carefully, I have considered the Standing Order carefully, I have considered the matter which Deputy Haughey proposed to raise in conjunction with the history of it since last Tuesday, and I have been forced to the conclusion <Col N="560" /> that the Adjournment which Deputy Haughey proposes to raise is not one contemplated by Standing Order 30. Accordingly I refuse permission to move the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that ruling extraordinary, and I must say it is unacceptable. I am sorry to have to challenge your ruling, but I do so with a full sense of responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally satisfied that my proposal is exactly within the confines of Standing Order 30.  I have gone through all the necessary procedures and I would be grateful if you would give some explanation for this inexplicable decision on your part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am equally satisfied that my interpretation of the Standing Order in reference to this case is the proper, correct interpretation.  I concede that somebody else is entitled to have a different interpretation and only one of us can be right.  I was given this same motion on the same basis on Tuesday last and that motion was withdrawn on Tuesday last.  I allowed a Private Notice Question on the very same topic on Tuesday last and this Private Notice Question was pursued by Deputy Haughey, as he is perfectly entitled to do.  I am not making any virtue of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked for an explanation and I will not be allowed to give it.  Here yesterday or the day before a motion on this topic was tabled by the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party and Deputy Haughey, if he wishes to take it up, will have three hours beginning next Tuesday, and his party have control at present of Private Members' Time.  I have considered the matter carefully and conscientiously.  I have given my decision and that is that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making a submission and at least I am allowed to do that. We are denied Government time for a very important motion, and now you are purporting to rule under Standing Order 30 that this matter is out of order.  I think your decision is unjustifiable and unprecedented. Since I put down my question here on Tuesday &mdash; and I accept it was <Col N="562" /> answered at some length &mdash; there have been developments.  The equipment concerned was put on display yesterday.  A number of questions arise out of that. Furthermore, it has now emerged that a statement made by the Taoiseach to this House in the course of his answer to my question was incorrect on an important matter, and that he telephoned the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Haughey wants to make a charge against the Taoiseach, against any member of the Government or against any individual he should do it by way of substantive motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting to you that since I put down my question several important matters have emerged which justify my raising this matter now totally and completely in accordance with Standing Order 30.  This equipment was put on display yesterday and there has been a development in regard to the answer given by the Taoiseach in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Order 30 requires more than ordinary urgency and I do not see more than ordinary urgency here because the motion was tabled on Tuesday, was withdrawn later, was pursued for 35 minutes by way of Private Notice Question and there is a motion on the Order Paper which will be debated on Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has said that Standing Order 30 requires more than ordinary urgency.  There is nothing in Standing Order 30 which speaks of more than ordinary urgency.  Standing Order 30 is specific.  It talks about the purpose of discussing a specific and important <Col N="563" /> matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration.  There is not anything there that says anything about more than ordinary urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are dealing with here is a procedure clearly contemplated under Standing Orders for dealing with exactly this sort of situation, and I cannot in any way see how the Chair's ruling could be justified.  I am forced to the conclusion that the Chair is giving this ruling for some reason unconnected with the merits of the issue.</P>

      <P>The Chair has in my view very unfairly prevented the Opposition from discharging their duty on this important matter in a way fully and completely contemplated by Standing Orders and I ask the Chair how can this very important matter be brought on the floor of the House and some explanation received from the Minister for Justice, who has been remarkably quiet on this whole matter up to now?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is unspecific about the Bills, but I think I can recall generally what they are.  They are Bills of considerable complexity and work is proceeding with them.  I have urged that work proceed as rapidly as possible as in both cases I am anxious that they should be brought before the House and enacted as soon as possible; but, as the Deputy will know, they both involve matters of considerable complexity.</P>

      <P>I am not going to allow imputations against me remain unanswered. On this programme Mr. Seamus Mallon, referring to the text of the remarks I made in the House, read from them and the word &ldquo;afterwards&rdquo; was in the written text.  That was a clerical error, and in speaking in the House I said &ldquo;beforehand&rdquo;.  I simply wished, if possible, that the fact that the word &ldquo;afterwards&rdquo; was not the one I had used in the House should be clarified.  That is why I sought to have it clarified on the programme on the air because an incorrect impression was given of what I had said in the House for understandable reasons because there was a textual error in the text that was prepared at the same time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the First Report of the Committee on Public Expenditure; Recruitment by the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
      <P>As Chairman of the Committee on Public Expenditure I am pleased to have the opportunity to lay before the House the committee's first report and to have some brief time allocated to a subject where the debate may be useful to the House and may be considered timely.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the discussion is to consider recommendations in a series of deliberations which the committee held in relation to the possibility of improving selection procedures in the public service generally and specifically in relation to the Civil Service Commission.  The report is an interim one but nevertheless it makes solid recommendations on specific changes we would like to see introduced at an early stage.  It deals with the committee's examination of recruitment procedures by the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission. The final report will be more comprehensive and will deal, among other things, with the possibility of instituting a centralised agency not merely for public sector recruitment but with much wider and more important areas relating to employment and training and the potential for the working population.</P>
      <P>At the moment the committee is meeting with the agencies and the interests involved in the area of selection and recruitment of personnel.  There is evidence to indicate there are significant areas of overlap and duplication which lead the committee to the inescapable conclusion that there are opportunities where we can increase efficiency and save public money while at the same time do a service to the quality of recruitment.</P>
      <P>The committee, which was appointed in June 1983, had its first meeting last September and has met regularly since then.  We decided in December we would meet on a weekly basis and I am pleased to say this has been welcomed by the committee and it has guaranteed continuity and progress in our work schedule. As Deputies will know, the Committee on Public Expenditure was established:</P>
      <P>to review the justification for and effectiveness of ongoing expenditure of Government Departments and offices and of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies in such areas as it may select and to report thereon to the House recommending cost effective alternatives and/or the elimination of obsolete programmes where desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference of the committee <Col N="579" /> are wide-ranging and include the power to send for such persons, papers and records as will enable the committee to complete their inquiries.</P>
    <P>Our sittings to date, and I am appreciative of this, have revealed genuine co-operation on the part of the officials with whom we have been in contact.  I am very heartened at the willingness to facilitate the committee and the fulsomeness of the response of all those agencies and individuals with whom we have been in contact.  This is very encouraging.  We have received many unsolicited practical ideas which have been of great assistance to us in this Oireachtas review of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The committee work in an atmosphere which is unusual and which has been underscored as late as this morning in terms of its uniqueness.  We have met very regularly &mdash; weekly during the last number of months &mdash; and I cannot remember one partisan party political remark during those deliberations.  The environment created in the committee by the members, by their very active attendances and contributions, is of great encouragement to me as Chairman.  It should not go unappreciated by the House.  It is the ideal environment in which constructive solid work on behalf of the House and the people of Ireland can be done.  I have no doubt that the mood thus generated will result in genuine substantial progress in due course. The vice-chairman, Deputy O'Kennedy, and the other members have attended meetings regularly and I am happy that collectively we are beginning to prove the value of the committee in the areas of public expenditure which we have looked at to date.</P>
    <P>One regret I have about the committee, and it is shared by my colleagues, is the loss to the committee of the late Deputy Colley who unfortunately died before our work really got off the ground. I have no doubt that he would have made a positive contribution to our work because of his wide experience as a former Minister for Finance and in other important Departments.</P>
    <P>The main developments to date in our <Col N="580" /> work have been to seek to review in a systematic manner the expenditure programmes of all Departments, offices and other organisations which come within our general terms of reference.  The committee can, will, and have done so in some cases, examined urgently individual areas of expenditure; but our principal objective will be an in depth review of the programmes and the budgetary approach of each Department.  With that in mind we drew up a comprehensive series of questions which have been sent to the Secretaries or CEOs of the relevant Departments and organisations, including non-commercial semi-State bodies. The details sought in the questionnaire are such that the committee will have the kind of responses which we have been getting to date in the form of a detailed document which should outline the functions and the financial and administrative procedures operated by each body.  This information will enable us to put the various bodies into some order of priority for further examination by the committee. Replies to the questionnaire are anticipated about now.  I expect that by the beginning of next month we will be in a position to have a solid body of work which will occupy us usefully and fruitfully for the foreseeable future.  We should then be able to press ahead with the systematic review to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Those questions are being asked to see whether we can get an insight as public representatives into the factual situation. There is no desire on the part of the committee to embarrass anybody or to cause difficulties for anybody; it is simply an honest inquiry which in some cases may elict responses along the lines of the controls referred to &mdash; for example, in specific questions where they do not operate at present or at all.  This will allow us to indicate areas where they might be operated or where some new procedures might be warranted.  The point is that our object is to seek factual information and in a co-operative spirit to work on that and make recommendations to the House in due course.  These reviews will consist of a preliminary briefing for the committee on each organisation, <Col N="581" /> which will be followed in the normal way by a series of meetings with the relevant administrators and professional staffs involved.  At the beginning these meetings would consist of positive question and answer sessions which would help the committee to understand existing practices, restrictions and so on.</P>
    <P>As a result of these interviews we will be able to deliberate and to submit reports to the Dáil with the recommendations we will think appropriate, if such recommendations are warranted.  The Dáil and the Minister will then be in possession of the committee's considered views on steps which they feel should be taken to obtain better value for the public money being expended on particular services.  When considered necessary the committee will seek outside expert advice.  I should like to put on record our appreciation of the financial resources which are available to provide that service.  It is important that that service be utilised.  Perhaps it would be asking too much from individuals, including ourselves or Government Departments, to be absolutely factually objective all of the time when it comes to self-scrutiny or self-evaluation.  That potential to engage outside expertise is essential in my view. It will also ensure that in regard to efficiency and cost effectiveness the recommendations made by the committee will be based on the best advice available.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are circumstances when we will be very happy if advice is proferred and we do not have to pay for it.  The task of getting better value for public money is not merely for a Government, a Minister or the House but for all of the people of Ireland, including particularly those with professional expertise and qualifications who may have insights and valuable contributions to make of one kind or another and whose advice would be welcomed.  We must therefore underline our desire to have a response from professional organisations, whether they be economic or cost-effective.  We will be very happy to receive their contributions.</P>
    <P>We hope the recommendations the committee will make in their reports will be acted on.  Because of the way in which <Col N="582" /> the committee were set up by the House, we have reason to be hopeful about that. It would be extremely inhibiting and depressing if a series of recommendations were simply to be noted by the House without action being taken on them.  I do not expect that will occur.  We are all aware of the disquiet that has been expressed by the public from time to time about reports which had been allowed to be just noted and which then disappeared into some kind of limbo.  I do not expect that will happen in this case.  We will do our best to ensure that concise and constructive reports will be produced and debated as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Recently we sought public opinion in regard to areas which the public consider should be a priority for us in our work. The response to date has been encouraging. It is important to reiterate that we are open to hearing from individuals and organisations their views on how public expenditure can be evaluated so that we will get better value for it.</P>
    <P>The specific report before the House deals with recruitment procedures to the public service by the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission, and we make a number of comments and recommendations.  I have been perturbed in recent years about the increasing difficulty of trying to get better value for public money and this may result in a perception by people in the public service that they are to be scapegoats. I do not take that view.  I believe that if there are problems and deficiencies in the public service and if there is room for improvement &mdash; and I believe there is &mdash; in relation to value for money and public expenditure generally, this House has to accept responsibility.  Politicians of different generations have been the creators of the shape and the nature of our present public service.</P>
    <P>I should like to underscore that it is in no way intended, nor would we wish, that any public servant would feel somehow that he or she was being pointed at, but rather that we were trying simply to improve the environment in which they work.  If there is a fundamental problem in relation to the manner in which the public service does its work, I venture to <Col N="583" /> suggest that it appears to be that they operate in an environment which has for them no clear targets or goals, either globally or individually, and nobody can work to maximum efficiency without having some idea, preferably very clear, of precisely what they are working towards.</P>
    <P>The report before us is one based on an initial request from our committee to consider what appeared, at least on the surface, to be an extraordinary circumstance &mdash; a circumstance which seemed to seek to have examined in an expensive manner over 14,000 applicants, which ultimately distilled in the order of a few dozen people actually appointed.  The course of the examination itself involved very major expense and it was reasonable to ask whether or not the public were getting value for money in terms of the actual selection techniques, how effective these were and whether they were, <i>per capita</i>, more expensive than was desirable or essential.  Our conclusion is that they were and that we should introduce systems which would ensure much more rapid, less expensive, cost effective and improved selection of people for public sector work.</P>
    <P>Last November, the committee invited the secretary of the Civil Service Commission and some of his colleagues to appear before the committee to discuss recruitment procedures in the case of the 1982 post office clerk competition, the one to which I refer, the general question of recruitment procedures and the costs and implications involved.  In the case of the former, the committee were concerned to note that 12,088 candidates were admitted to a costly written examination, but only six candidates had actually been considered for employment by the end of 1982.  It is fair to say that such a situation would never arise in the private sector &mdash; which does not, of course, necessarily make it absolutely right. However, it is an indication that something may have been out of scale.</P>
    <P>After a very full and frank discussion with the secretary of the Civil Service Commission, Mr. Seán de Búitléir, and his colleagues to whom I extend my gratitude for their co-operation the committee <Col N="584" /> deliberated on the evidence heard and the result is contained in the views and recommendations set out in the report which had already been tabled before the Dáil.  I should say that the secretary and his staff&mdash; and incidentally, Mr. de Búitléir and his staff are also the secretariat to the Local Appointments Commission &mdash; were very helpful to us, both at the actual series of discussions and subsequently when we wanted further information.</P>
    <P>While the 1982 post office clerk examination may have been somewhat an exception because of the volume of candidates involved, nevertheless the committee felt &mdash; and those interviewed accepted &mdash; that the cumbersome procedures adopted were symptomatic of practices which could be improved.  It is our view that such practices are out of touch with the value for money approach which is imperative in the private sector and should be imperative also in the public sector.  The committee felt that there was an urgent need for new measures to improve cost effectiveness and efficiency of the public sector recruitment processes generally.</P>
    <P>Some means must be found to short-list the candidates so that, having full regard to fair and equal treatment for all, an unnecessarily large number are not processed at great expense to the taxpayer, not merely from the point of view of the huge cost involved but also of the totally unrealistic expectations that such procedures build up amongst thousands of applicants, many of whom have not the slightest possibility of getting a job but all of whom may have achieved the minimum qualifications.  Accordingly, some method of short-listing which will take account of development factors and which will allow for evaluation by a group of responsible and intelligent people is essential.  We are recommending, therefore, that improved procedures be introduced as quickly as possible to bring existing practices at least into line with those operated in the commercial sector in Ireland and, perhaps, the public sector in other countries.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Civil Service Commission, the National Manpower Service <Col N="585" /> and other agencies should get together to see what can be done to strengthen and improve existing procedures.  This aspect suggested itself to the committee.  It is so obvious that it is somewhat surprising that this type of close co-ordination and liaison has not taken place before this, although I do know that there is some co-ordination and consultation.  That has emerged in our discussions since our report, but it is informal and relatively casual and in no way structured or organised.</P>
    <P>I hope, now that public attention has been focussed on the important area of public service recruitment, that immediate steps will be taken to eliminate out of date practices and procedures so that the taxpayers will get maximum value for money and the individual candidates to the public service appointments will be screened and processed more quickly and efficiently than has evidently occurred in the past, in the case of at least certain examinations and specifically in the case of the one which we examined.  Since the review of Public Service Commision and Local Appointments Commision procedures took place, we have continued that line of work and initiated an investigation into the possibility of introducing a co-ordinated or centralised agency which would provide a service for persons registered for, or offering, employment or training facilities.  These inquiries are still under way on this possibility, and we hope to be able to conclude our deliberations and interviews with various Government Departments quite shortly.</P>
    <P>It appears, even at this tentative stage &mdash; and this is admitted by every one of those agencies with whom we have had discussions &mdash; that there is duplication and overlapping and, therefore, unnecessary waste of money.  We believe that there are strong grounds for, at least, having one umbrella organisation, or grouping, or arrangement of organisations with which school leavers and other prospective employees could register.  It appears nonsensical, to some of us at least &mdash; and I offer this comment somewhat tentatively as we have not concluded our deliberations &mdash; that there are at least three separate registers of the <Col N="586" /> same people &mdash; one at the Department of Social Welfare, one at the National Manpower Service and another possibly at AnCO, all of them reflecting different aspects of the labour market, but clearly all based on the same essential data.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge that the maximum computerisation be introduced at the earliest possible date, so that we could get efficiency of response and a saving of public money, where possible.  Apart from that, it would mean that the labour market would be more responsive to inquiries from employers, and a peripheral but not insignificant advantage would be that it would help to reduce significantly abuse of the social welfare system.  The significance, therefore, of such a single point of contact, however structured or organised, cannot be over-estimated, given the importance of improving any and all procedures to assist those seeking employment or training, especially the young people.  I hope to have this report before the House within the next month or two.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome this opportunity to present this first report.  It is fair to say that we understand it is the first report from any of the new Dáil committees and we are pleased to be in early, as it were. I trust that it will provide food for thought and provoke comment by the public on other areas of public expenditure which appeared to warrant the attention of the committee.  The House should note that the committee's work programme and the pattern of our meetings are now well established and that there is a very high attendance, indeed.  Inevitably, therefore, positive results will follow quickly from recommendations and evolve from these deliberations.  I stress, however, that we are at the early days of our work and, therefore, we may make mistakes and chase the wrong question on occasion. We are fallible, we are simply public representatives seeking to do a job of work.  I want to say a sincere thank you to my colleagues on the committee.  On a personal level, I find it extremely satisfying, indeed, to work in an environment which manages so easily and readily to lay aside some of the Pavlovian responses which I always associate with the political party structure.  We find this <Col N="587" /> a very good environment in which to work and think it will yield results.</P>
    <P>Lastly, in these inquiries, and particularly in relation to the responses to the questionnaires which we have sent to Government Departments, I would appeal for maximum co-operation from those Departments and would underline the committee's determination to ensure that nothing will stand in the way of their doing solid work on behalf of this House. Accordingly, I would ask the Departments to respond as soon as possible, even if those responses be inadequate or incomplete or if, for some reason or other, there is not a possibility of such a response, we would like to know as soon as possible so that we can help the Departments to organise that response. That honest search for information will be the foundation stone on which the work of our committee over the next year or two will be based.  I hope the report before the House today will result in a change in the procedures along the lines I have recommended and therefore a more efficient system of selecting and recruiting staff and also less waste of public money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the opportunity, as Deputy Keating, chairman of this committee has welcomed it, to lay this report before the House and to make some comment both as to the work of the committee generally and the issues which arise from this report.  The terms of reference given to the committee established on 21 June 1983 are very wide, unprecedented and challenging in respect of the committee's role but also in respect of the role of the House.  The committee are merely a subcommittee of the House and cannot have any powers except what the House delegates to them. That is the reason why the first report of the committee is coming before the House this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee, basically, were asked to review the justification for and the effectiveness of ongoing expenditure for Government Departments &mdash; that is a very wide-ranging term of reference &mdash; and of non-commercial State sponsored <Col N="588" /> bodies in such areas as it may select and then to report to the House recommending cost effective alternatives and, or, the elimination of wasteful or obsolete programmes where desirable.  This, therefore, entitles us to look at what is seen to be wasteful expenditure and to make recommendations in relation to this.  It is significant to note that there has been the kind of atmosphere which the chairman, Deputy Keating, has mentioned, in the committee.  Every one of us want to approach this in terms of our responsibility whether we represent a party in Government or out of Government.</P>
    <P>I may be forgiven for saying that it is particularly unique for an Opposition party to be prepared to agree to serve on this kind of committee.  Normally we leave it to the Government to make the proposals to curtail public expenditure, and for those who have been in Opposition for some time there is a certain luxury attached to the Opposition position that you complain about a Government not spending more in relation to individual Ministers.  I want to indicate at this point that the main Opposition party are ready and happy to discharge their role, and this departure is evidence of our readiness as an Opposition to co-operate effectively in areas like this.  I would not like it to be seen that we only co-operate when it suits.  There are matters which are very different.  So far as one can make comments in relation to our experience in the House during the last few days and this morning as well these are entirely different matters where an Opposition have an obligation.  I do not want to go beyond that at this point, but one should not contrast what one might say is the reasonable approach which we are all adopting on this committee to what might sometimes be suggested as being a different kind of approach on other issues.</P>
    <P>When we approached our terms of reference we had, first of all, to decide a preliminary theological point for ourselves, whether we would take a broad ranging analysis of public expenditure generally or, alternatively, whether we would concentrate on specific areas, tease out particular problems and try to <Col N="589" /> act the role of the Socratic wasps, to sting here and there and to create an awareness in the public service of our role in questioning. In the early stages it seemed to some of us that these two were mutually exclusive but as things are working out they are not at all mutually exclusive. The two complement each other.  There is a broad range of approach which enables us to look at broad ranging areas of Government expenditure growth.</P>
    <P>The growth of the current budget in any year is a matter of great concern and has been so expressed in the committee. It is fairly clear why we are focussing on certain Departments &mdash; I am not saying that the idea is that they would come and have an opportunity of justifying the growth &mdash; where there has been particularly significant growth either within the Department or indeed within agencies under the aegis of that particular Department. All of us want to see the most productive return, particularly at a time when resources are limited, for whatever funds are available to us.  We want to ensure that every penny spent in the administration is justified, because a lot of people in the private sector, with some degree of justification, are noting with some degree of concern the growth of the public sector and the fact that so much of the funds available in the economy are being sucked into the public sector while the level of money available for investment in the economy generally has never been as low.  It is something of the order of 22 per cent of GNP this year.  This is a matter of very considerable concern. The one focus all of us have, which is the end product of this committee's work, is to ensure that the role and function of Government, the agencies and the Department who represent Government in the broader sense, not just partisan Government, are clearly defined to ensure that this creates a proper climate within the public service and allows the private sector to generate the activity we require, to create opportunities for sustained continuing and secure employment.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason, because of the imbalance within the growth of the public service by contrast with the constraints <Col N="590" /> within the private sector, whether it is agriculture or business, and the taxation required to fund the growing public service out of the private sector, that the role of this committee becomes very important.  It cannot be isolated.  We are not there to live in isolation from the reality outside of the committee or the reality outside of this Dáil.  The reason why we are there is to create that climate and to look, so far as we can, at the manner in which the public service generally discharges its responsibilities, how public expenditure generally is justified and where it is not justified.  There have been some examples even from our early considerations where <i>prima facie</i> it would not appear to be administered in the most efficient way.  As a result of the spirit of co-operation and approach of the committee, which I would like to reciprocate from this side to the chairman and the members from the Government side of the House, it has been possible, and will continue in that way, to take an entirely objective approach in relation to the issues before us.  It is interesting that a degree of consensus emerges.  Hopefully, this will be reflected here not just on the issues we debate but in a broader sense on the responsibilities of Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Everyone welcomed the establishment of the committees.  Speaking as a member of a committee, it adds to the workload of Deputies.  The effective discharge of our role requires support and back-up facilities.  There was public reaction in the past to the fact that each Deputy had the facility of a typist.  As Opposition spokesman on finance that is the only facility I enjoy.  A typist is not a researcher.  A typist will only type what is dictated.  I am not making a special case for an Oppostion spokesman but there is no comparison with the level of research and personal or other assistance available to a Government Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not regard it as a down.  To be in Government is not the be-all and end-all.  I am asking that no <Col N="591" /> matter where one sits in the House a reasonable service should be provided to enable one to discharge one's role.</P>
      <P>I hope this point will not be taken as being too political, but when one looks at the consultancy and public relations support available for the Government this year, there is a cogent case to be made for providing a reasonable proportion of the same kind of service for the Opposition.  There is no such thing as permanent Government or Opposition. It is important that the public relations facilities and consultancy services available to the Government should, in some measure, reflect on what is available for the Opposition.  Otherwise the great new world we wish to give effect to on these committees will remain in the dim and distant future.  In the course of a day an Opposition spokesman has a whole range of matters demanding his time.  There are front bench meetings, committees both party and internal and so on.  We would be deluding ourselves if we said we would do the job effectively without the necessary back-up facilities.  If we are not given the facilities it will be difficult to maintain the level of commitment we want to give to these committees and maintain their effectiveness.</P>
      <P>In relation to the committees, the chairman and members would like me to indicate that we appreciate the work which our own very limited secretariat &mdash; limited in numbers but not in quality &mdash; have done for us.  The secretariat seem to welcome the challenge as much as the members when something new is being developed.  I have found this on a number of committees on which I have served. They give the type of commitment we would like to promote throughout the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made a number of comments on the public service and public expenditure but I want to make it clear that I am not in any way criticising the personnel in the public service.  Far be it from me, having worked with them and having had the benefit of their support both in Government and on these committees, to make that kind of comment.  What we must do is create an environment in which the <Col N="592" /> people in the public service will most effectively be able to discharge their role. They are servants of the public.  The structures, gradings, habits and traditions are not such as enable individual public servants to discharge their role effectively. The relevance of the public service is often questioned.  Down the years those who applied and were appointed to the public service were the élite in their schools.  They were the ones who got the top grade.  More than ever now we want to generate something new, exciting and positive but we have not succeeded in promoting new ideas, a new climate for investment and activity.  There seems to be a wall between the private and public sector.  Attempts have been made to break down this barrier and it is vital that it is done.</P>
    <P>I invite anyone to look at the year book with the gradings of the public service and inquire if it is necessary to have such a wide range of grades from clerical assistant to clerk typist, junior executive officer, higher executive officer, staff officer, assistant principal, principal, assistant secretary and so on.  There are Departments and sections of Departments where there are up to 40 grades. There must be a justification not just in terms of status but of workload or responsibility for the difference between grades A and B, C and D and so on.  The Minister must look at this and we will co-operate with him on the committee to ensure that these grades, which may be reflected in salary linkages and so on, are relevant to the development of the public service.</P>
    <P>As regards some of the limitations we have come across since we started, are we entitled to look into matters concerning local authorities?  It is important to recall that most of the money spent by local authorities is channelled through central government which means, basically, the taxpayer.  For that reason &mdash; and this has emerged from the committee's considerations &mdash; we are entitled to look into wastage where it occurs.  I do not want to refer to specific areas although some have been referred to already in the newspapers but local <Col N="593" /> authorities must be relevant in this new era of development priority.  They must not be allowed to act as administrative agencies, they must be developmental entities, justifying every penny they spend, creating new ideas and generally supporting the people who are creating the climate and activity for creating and maintaining jobs for our young people. I am not criticising individual members of local authorities &mdash; quite the opposite &mdash; but I want to see all their energies released into something positive.  The administrative preoccupation which has been a characteristic of the public service generally perhaps could be cast aside if we realised that the main responsibility is developmental and that there is no satisfaction in passing responsibility from one administration to the other.  The real responsibility is creative and that is what we must try to promote in this committee.</P>
    <P>Of course we are only at the early stages of our work and I hope we will reach a consensus on the need to promote the developmental concept of the public service in all its forms.  It is sometimes forgotten that the Civil Service represents only something in the order of 27 per cent or 28 per cent of the total public service.  If you include local authorities, health boards, teachers, gardaí&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Since An Post and Bord Telecom came into being it is now 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had forgotten about that.  I do not think any member of the committee would be satisfied if we were confined to looking at 10 per cent of the public service.  For that reason our remit in looking at personnel, expenditure and programmes must be interpreted as extending over the whole range of the public service.  Before the delegation of responsibility to An Post and Bord Telecom, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were subject to the scrutiny of the Ombudsman and I believe that a very considerable number of the complaints referred to him pertained to that Department. Much of the Ombudsman's time in the early months will be taken up by examining complaints in respect of <Col N="594" /> Departments that are not now his responsibility. I make that point to stress the need to ensure that the simple fact of becoming a semi-State body does not and must not mean that the semi-autonomy that semi-State bodies have means they are protected from any kind of scrutiny. If that were the case then our capacity to inquire into public expenditure with regard to semi-State bodies would be limited.</P>
      <P>We must always be answerable to the people and if they do not like how we operate they have an answer.  The fact that people are working in a State or semi-State structure should not mean they have total protection against any degree of inquiry, much less attack, from public representatives.  Public representatives can be difficult if the occasion demands but they have an immediate and direct responsibility to the people.  I hope there will be no presumption on the part of new boards that they are cast-iron proof from any degree of inquiry.  Perhaps Deputies may make inquiries to which there are no easy answers but we are the protection for the individual person who, for one reason or another, cannot cope with the establishment.  We must ensure that we will not be issued with standard replies implying that it is none of our business.  If that is the case the protective shell becomes almost a coat of mail which no one can pierce and everyone inside that coat is immune to any degree of response to relevant concern and comments from public representatives.</P>
      <P>The particular issue with which we are concerned in this report is the recruitment pattern operated by the Civil Service Commission.  One would be tempted to adopt all the committee's recommendations as one's own but they are the conclusions which we all reached and, therefore, there is no need to repeat them.  The report has been available for some time now and the press have given fair and objective coverage of our proceedings and to this report.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 5 (1) in relation to public service recruitment it states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee was advised by the <Col N="595" /> Secretary of the Commission, namely, the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission, that the Department of the Public Service decides the recruitment policy for the civil service and monitors the recruitment process generally while the Civil Service Commission implements policy.</P>
    <P>That being so <i>prima facie</i> at least there is a case to answer on the part of the Department of the Public Service in monitoring competitions.  How did this happen? The Department of the Public Service is there to monitor and I am sure it has a pretty large budget.  The Minister will probably be able to tell me the order of the budget.  I think it is in the region of £10 million.  Now there is a diminution in the numbers recruited to the public service.  I shall not go into that now, but it seems to me that the Department most involved should itself be looking at the justification for these procedures &mdash; examinations, accommodation, interviews and so on in relation to every single Department of State.</P>
    <P>There are very few growth industries at the moment, but one of the few is that of interviews, training, travelling to interviews, travelling back from interviews.  It has become quite an industry and it is a very considerable part indeed of the whole process.  At the end of 1983 out of a total of 14,122 applicants the total number appointed was 88.  Up to the end of 1982 it was only six.  That was the breakdown. Look at that breakdown in the context of the cost involved: direct staff costs £20,000; cost, excluding staff costs, £80,000.  Take the breakdown of that £80,000: fees to examiners £18,000; cost of hiring halls £13,000; superintending examinations £15,000.</P>
    <P>Where is the employment?  It is in examining, superintending, travelling to examinations.  Then there is the provision of furniture at £14,000. There is travelling and subsistence at £7,000.  Is there not something radically wrong in this?  Did we really have to wait for this committee to discover this extraordinary position?</P>
    <P>Now there was and is a Department <Col N="596" /> which has a direct responsibility, the Department of the Public Service, the alleged co-ordinating Department. Where is the co-ordination?  How come? This pattern is proliferating.  You have examinations, interviews, the cost of interviewers, the cost of examiners, the travelling expenses, the subsistence and so on in many other Departments of State.  Here this morning the Tánaiste talked about setting up yet another State agency.  We are engaged in discussing public expenditure and we want to ensure that the Government of the day &mdash; I want to be objective about this &mdash; will not envisage new agencies which will only result in increased expenditure unless those agencies and that expenditure can be justified totally and specifically by the Government of the day, and when it comes to our turn again, I shall be quite prepared to subject myself to the same kind of examination as I am conducting now.</P>
    <P>The degree of co-ordination in the activities of the Department of the Public Service is important.  Our chairman, Deputy Keating, referred recently to co-ordination of manpower policy generally. I must say initially that the word &ldquo;liaison&rdquo; covers a great deal.  There is liaison between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour and various agencies.  But it is not enough to have just liaison.  There must be a central direction.  There must be a total obligation to ensure that all the relevant information the Manpower Service has will be available to the employment exchange.  Note the title &mdash; Employment Exchange.  It is possible that over the years the employment exchange has come to be seen as a place where you just sign on and take your money.  People have commented on the indignity of having to go to the employment exchange and, with growing unemployment, we must ensure that the dignity of the citizen is protected and maintained.  The citizen is not just going to the employment exchange to get a handout.  It is an employment exchange, and if it is merely regarded as something that pays out then there is something radically wrong.</P>
    <P>We have two agencies now, the Manpower <Col N="597" /> Service and the &ldquo;Labour&rdquo; Exchange, both doing the same job.  My view, and the view of most members of the comittee, is that we should be working towards one central agency and the real purpose of that agency should be placement in employment and preparation for employment.  These should be fundamental, so that applicants will not be going in there merely to queue up with the growing number of unemployed to draw whatever benefit they are entitled to.  That is just one further indignity.  Too often we talk too generally and too critically of people in that situation.  Those who do not get the habit of work early on often find it very hard to adapt later. Those crucial early years are of vital importance.  We all know people who found themselves at working age with no work available for them who subsequently found they were almost incapable of working.  These co-ordinating agencies will have to be used effectively to train, advise, direct and help in every way possible.  We must do everything in our power to ensure that the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour will be more effective in co-ordination. Actually there are three different Departments involved if one takes into account the Department of the Public Service.  Where are they going?  Is there need for an overview and a central direction?</P>
    <P>That is all I will say on behalf of this side of the House this morning.  I welcome the opportunity of making these general comments on the basis of our first report.  I join with our chairman, Deputy Keating, in expressing the satisfaction of the Members of this side of the House for the environment that pertains in that committee.  I assure the House that to the extent that is both reasonable and necessary that environment will continue to be supported by us on this side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman of the Committee on Public Expenditure, Deputy Keating, has already outlined to the House the background of the report on recruitment by the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission.  It is clear from an examination <Col N="598" /> made by the committee that recruitment procedures operated by the Civil Service Commission in at least one area of their operations, namely the post office clerks' examination, was too cumbersome and costly from any point of view.  Firstly, there can be no justification for calling 12,000 candidates to an examination.  The cost of that to the Exchequer is £100,000.  This figure is broken down under a number of headings on page 6 of the report and it has been dealt with at length by Deputy O'Kennedy. Secondly, there can be no justification for the calling of over 12,000 candidates to an examination, in effect giving a large proportion of that number of young people the expectation of jobs in the civil service that do not exist, and then taking on fewer than 90 people per year.  If nothing else is to be achieved in this area, the Committee on Public Expenditure have done a good day's work in highlighting practices which are difficult to justify when Exchequer resources are so constrained.</P>
      <P>While I have no reservations about the professionalism and expertise of the staff of the Civil Service Commission, it must be said that they and indeed the staff of the Department of the Public Service must be extremely vigilant at all times to ensure that the public get good value for money.  The committee will return to this concept again and again.  Taxpayers deserve to be reassured that their hardearned money is being used to the greatest possible effect.  The terms of reference of the Committee on Public Expenditure will ensure that those interests will be protected through the systematic reviews of public expenditure being undertaken by the committee.  We have been told that about 50,000 school leavers enter the labour market each year.  Approximately 75 per cent of these find jobs in the first year and about 25 per cent, unfortunately, are unemployed for a longer time. I will return to this aspect later.  The latest public statistics reveal that in 1982 about, 3,000 people entered the public Civil Service and about 500 senior staff were recruited to the local authorities by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of ensuring that the <Col N="599" /> best people are taken on by the Civil Service Commision and Local Appointments Commission cannot be over-emphasised. At present it could be said that those who succeed in getting jobs in the public service are in a truly enviable position.  They have secure jobs, good salaries and guaranteed pensions.  Every young person who has talent and ambition has the potential to rise to the top of the Department or office to which he is appointed.  It is a great credit to our civil service that many people have entered at the very lowest level of a Department and have ended their careers in the public service as heads of Departments.  Given the current level of unemployment the competition for jobs in the Civil Service will be much more intense than in previous years.  The outcome of this development is that overall the Civil Service will tend to get a more highly educated person than in the past, and conversely those who would have obtained jobs in the Civil Service in previous years are now virtually debarred by virtue of their lower grades in the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.  This was one reason for the huge number of applications in 1982 for the post office clerks' examination for which no qualifications are laid down but the age limits of 15½ to 17½ years.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission must find some mechanism for ensuring the balance between getting the best people into the public service and at the same time ensuring that a fair proportion of young people who may not be brilliant academically will have an opportunity of taking up careers in the service.  We know of people who have been successful in all walks of life without benefit of a formal education.  I am convinced that it is not outside the capabilities of the Civil Service Commission in consultation with the Department of the Public Service to devise some form of approved selection process using the most modern psychological tests, and to distribute the available jobs in the Civil Service more evenly than in the past.  On-the-job training provided by the Civil Service training centre should overcome any unevenness that <Col N="600" /> might exist among those appointed under such revised arrangements.  I would be glad if the Minister for the Public Service would comment on my suggestion, and perhaps he will have its merits examined in his Department.  I am sure that the Committee on Public Expenditure would be interested to hear the outcome on any examination of methods of improving existing procedures.</P>
    <P>As the chairman said earlier, the committee are at present considering whether grounds exist for the establishment of some form of centralised agency for job seekers and employers.  Without wishing to pre-empt the final report or recommendations of the committee on this, it is fair to say that there is evidence of duplication of some functions of a number of existing agencies.  For example, AnCO and the Department of Education are both involved in the provision of pre-employment courses.  Another instance that I am aware of is that AnCO and the National Manpower Service are involved in recruiting people for employment and training.  To a lay person it is difficult to justify any kind of duplication in the important areas of the provision of work or training.  A second but equally important angle on this is that duplication must cause great confusion to job seekers and to employers also.  These are the people the service is designed to help, and is seems that it is found wanting in some respects.  I will be recommending to the committee that our report should contain proposals for the urgent elimination of duplication of function or services if it is found to exist.  Our aim will be to reform the present agencies so that the user, the man, woman, boy or girl who pays for these agencies, will benefit from a smoothly run system best designed to meet his or her needs.</P>
    <P>The chairman referred to submissions to the committee from the public.  The public should avail more intensively of the opportunity to make such submissions. The committee welcome any suggestions or proposals that will reduce public expenditure or improve existing programmes.  All submissions will be taken seriously.  Already we have received practical proposals which will be <Col N="601" /> before the committee in their deliberations on individual Departments, offices and the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  The State bodies sector has not received the attention it deserves.  Additional submissions which touch on the non-State bodies will be welcome.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of organisations in the private sector who help to cut down on public expenditure.  Last summer I had the privilege to be present at the launching of the Young Ireland Movement whose aim is to motivate young people to buy good quality Irish goods and, as a result, improve employment opportunities for young people at no expense to the State.  When one compares this with previous Buy Irish Campaigns which were funded by the taxpayer and often without the desired effect one can see the value of a movement such as it.  I trust that the first report of the committee, and the debate on it, will impress upon the House and the public that reviews of public expenditure are well under way and that the committee are determined to make a significant impact in obtaining value for each pound spent by the Exchequer on behalf of our taxpayers.  As a member of that committee I am happy that we achieved this and that I played a part in it.</P>
    <P>At times in this House, particularly in recent days, I became frustrated because many of the antics that take place here are irrelevant to the problems of the people we represent, high unemployment and the fact that those who have a job pay high taxes.  However, when I attend meetings of the committee under discussion in some way my political batteries are recharged because that committee, which represents all sides, reaches consensus in a spirit of goodwill. I join with Deputy O'Kennedy in expressing the hope that that consensus and spirit of goodwill will eventually find its way into the Chamber.  I should like to pay tribute to the Secretary of the committee for his dedicated service.  The committee's first report is the first small step in what I have no doubt will be a major influence on the better use of public expenditure in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good that an all-party committee of the House can look at an area of the public service where there is room for improvement and produce an agreed report.  I do not agree with all the comments of the last speaker, because it is important that there should be an Opposition in the House to watch the day-to-day activities of any Government. Democracy being what it is, the Opposition of the day are probably more important for that reason than the Government.  It is encouraging that an all-party committee can produce recommendations for an area where practices are outmoded.  I should like to refer to my experience as Minister for the Public Service, and in doing so I am anxious to make it clear that the present Secretary of the Commission was not in charge then.  The person responsible has long since retired.</P>
      <P>While I was in that office political capital was made in the House by Members who now hold high office &mdash; not the Minister present &mdash; when I in good faith felt there was a need for some modernsation in the Civil Service Commission.  Bureaucratic institutions resisted by various efforts.  There were leaks to the Press by sources I failed to establish and they slanted in the direction that my involvement was a political one.  I should like to assure the House that my involvement was in the interests of the ordinary people of Ireland, the people who matter most, those who elect us.  Those who were to the forefront then are not there now.  I do not have any idea who leaked the stories or how details of certain meetings were given to the Press, but I am satisfied that they were distributed and were not intended to help improve procedures or prevent alleged political interference.  It is my view that they were leaked to create a device by which the Commission could defend itself against all politicians by saying that the interference by the Minister of the day was for political purposes.  That was not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the recommendations of the committee.  We are living in changing times when recruitment to all posts spells out great problems for all interview boards.  Whatever post is advertised the <Col N="603" /> number of applicants is enormous.  That is one of the reasons why there is a need for a more modern approach by the Civil Service Commission, or the Local Appointments Commission, to the needs of the day.  I can recall a question and answer session here between the Minister for the Public Service and Deputy David Andrews in regard to the provision of typewriters for civil service examinations. I understood the difficulty the Minister was in as to how the tests could be set up.</P>
    <P>The question of interview boards has concerned me for many years, because I am convinced that any person who sits on such a board must have a commitment to come up with what they believe to be the right answer.  Of course, there was always a difficulty in trying to get consistency. Human nature being what it is we all differ in what we regard as the most suitable criteria for any appointment.  That will continue to be a difficulty.  The independence of such boards is sacred.  There should not be any interference from politicians, and I know all worthwhile politicians share that view.  However, there should not be any favouritism by the bureaucratic institutions.  There is a danger that interference in that direction can be greater than interference from politicians. It may be taken that I am speaking with a little chip on my shoulder from my past experience, but I am interested in the public good.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that an all-party committee can agree on a report of this nature removes the danger of a political charge such as I experienced.  The independence of the institution we are referring to must be safeguarded and protected and I <Col N="604" /> believe the vast majority of politicians share that view.  These institutions have served us well but we must not be afraid to modernise them and approach the business they do in a better way to meet new demands.  That is a matter of extreme urgency.  The committee of the House is ideally suited to a situation like this.  I welcome the report and add my voice in support of it.  I apologise to my colleague from Cork for having delayed him a few minutes by making this contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Oireachtas Committee was set up last year at a time when Dáil procedures and the performance of Oireachtas Members were coming under severe criticism.  Today the first report of that committee is coming before the House at a time when the performance of the House is again being examined closely.  As a relative newcomer to this House I would like to say that the antics we have seen here over the last few days do not inspire the people with confidence in politicians.  They say we should face up to the real problems of this country &mdash; unemployment, breaking down of vested interests which control certain sections of the community and so on.  While not ignoring some of the issues that were raised in the last few days, they feel we are spending too much time on minor issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever we attempt to look at protected areas of interest or at some of the major vested interests, closed shops, monopolies and so on, attempts are made immediately to undermine our credibility, either as a group or individually.  That is happening all the time.  I know what Deputy Fitzgerald was talking about.  I expressed my interest in becoming a member of the Committee on Public Expenditure because I had formed the opinion down the years that the standards adopted in the expenditure of public money were somewhat different from the practices adopted in the private sector. My experiences to date, unfortunately, confirm this and we only have to look at this report and the massive amount of public money spent on the filling of a relatively small number of positions to <Col N="605" /> see that this report confirms my opinion.</P>
    <P>The committee also dealt with the Office of Public Works.  We looked at the vast amounts being spent on the rental of office blocks and we had a meeting with the Comptroller and Auditor General. All these activities justify the belief that vast amounts of public money are being wasted and squandered.  Unfortunately, accountability by State Departments seems to be less than I had ever anticipated. The committee system, if it has achieved nothing else to date, has established the fact that public servants must now account in a very detailed way for the money at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy has suffered in recent years because of the different standards adopted in the public sector from those adopted in the private sector. The public sector must become hungry for success and that is not happening at present.  Our semi-State bodies which did not come within our terms of reference, are becoming more uncompetitive and the time has come to call a halt to this process.  From now on the attitude of directors' management and workers in the public sector must be that there will be a fire in our stomachs, coupled with a determination to succeed and an attitude to go forward with a balanced approach that will stand up to close scrutiny.  While the attitude in the private sector at present is to get out, win business and take risks, the practice in the public sector is to make sure we do not make mistakes. Everybody sets out not to make mistakes but being too cautious and adopting the attitude &ldquo;I am not saddled with responsibility but somebody else is&rdquo;, is seriously undermining the success of the public sector.</P>
    <P>This report shows clearly that public moneys have been wasted in the very simple exercises of filling posts in the public sector.  While this report identifies the problems, unfortunately it does not provide conclusive answers because as the chairman said at the outset, this is an interim report which we hope will be followed by a more comprehensive one in due course.  The report reflects our inexperience of grappling with these problems.  We are a young committee, <Col N="606" /> young in experience, and we took a while to find our feet and to know where we were going but for the last month or so the committee have been working very efficiently.</P>
    <P>Our committee face a major challenge in coming to grips with the gross abuse of public moneys that takes place in certain sectors.  We approached our task conscious of the fact that extra scrutiny must take place on all public projects because of the shortage of public funds, over-taxing and the need to cut back on public expenditure.  Our approach has at all times been constructive and the most positive thing is that our approach has ignored political divisions and has been a united one.</P>
    <P>This is a short debate and therefore I will not go into too many details except to say that the three or four months I have spent on this committee were the most fulfilling since my arrival here in 1981.  I look forward to the weekly meetings because we have set ourselves an attainable task and we go into these meetings ignoring completely political divisions which normally exist in this House.</P>
    <P>Members have been criticised a great deal in the media, and at times rightly so, but we have demonstrated through this committee system that we are determined to take on the problems that face the people we represent.  We must be determined to take on and challenge the vested interests, be they in the private or public sector.  In taking on these tasks and facing these challenges we must be aware that we will be criticised and our attempts undermined at times.  However, these attempts to undermine our credibility must make us more determined in our efforts in the knowledge that many of our people are living at or below poverty level and either we provide leadership for them or we succumb to other organisations and institutions.</P>
    <P>The whole question of public spending must be looked at in depth.  Value for money in the public expenditure programmes must be a priority, as the overall spending in the public sector is now an awesome burden on the economy.  The activities of the committee have aroused considerable interest amongst the business <Col N="607" /> community and the general public, reflected in the amount of correspondence to the secretary of the committee in recent weeks.  The matter is of particular concern to the business community because of the high proportion of national resources now devoted to the public expenditure programme.</P>
    <P>Our objectives are to identify public expenditure of major significance, to ensure that the money is spent positively and economically and that organisation and financial management is efficient within the public sector.  I must express my sincere thanks to the secretariat of our committee whose efficiency, I shall not say has surprised but has amazed me. There has been a huge volume of documentation but we have done our best to tease out and identify the problems.  In this task we have had 100 per cent co-operation from the secretariat.  However, I detect that our efforts in other areas have been resented by a number of public bodies which has been reflected in the questioning of our terms of reference by a number of them.  It must be realised that our job is to ensure that the overburdened taxpayer gets value for money. As a member of the committee I feel strongly that all public bodies must account fully for the way they spend money.  I shall not go into details now because of time constraints.  It may not be relevant to today's discussion and it can be done at a later date.  But it must be said that massive amounts of money have been wasted in the past that could have been expended on projects of much greater benefit to our people.  The critical situation confronting the country at present must force all public bodies to ensure they work in an efficient way and obliges us to ensure that any projects commenced or implemented henceforth are cost-effective and, more importantly, have a high labour content because of our unemployment problems.</P>
    <P>I should like to extend my thanks to all my co-members of the committee who have worked so well.  There has been no political division within the committee, which has been a refreshing experience, <Col N="608" /> bringing a breath of fresh air into the whole operations of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>As a member of the committee I welcome its first report.  As a relatively new Member of this House I am delighted to be a member of that committee.  There is a tremendous sense of unity of purpose within the committee crossing all political divides.  We have a common approach to our work as distinct from the Committee on Public Accounts whose job is to justify the expenditure of public moneys, our job is to appraise ourselves and analyse the spending of public moneys.  The report clearly indicates that there is much necessity for a clear policy on efficiency and cost-effectiveness within the area of the public service.  I should like to pay tribute to the secretary of the committee, Mr. Judge, and his staff.  Were it not for their backup it would not have been possible for the committee to have done the amount of work we have.  We meet on a regular basis.  I find the work very rewarding.  I also find it easy to identify the problems. Indeed the committee system is a suitable forum for teasing out the problems prevailing in the expenditure of public moneys.</P>
      <P>I should also like to pay tribute to the various representatives of the many Government Departments and agencies who have attended committee meetings, who have given of their expert knowledge, advice and assistance.  All the information possible has been given freely and positively by them.  Over the years the public service has taken a lot of bashing from almost everybody.  As a new Member of this House I should like to place on record that I am more than happy to state that the people leading the various Government agencies and public bodies are of the highest competence and capability.  They have and will make a major contribution in the years ahead.  I hope that this committee &mdash; through political advice, experience and in co-operation with the leaders of the various Departments and agencies &mdash; can come up with a better system in the future, ensuring more efficient investment of public moneys in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that on page 7 of the report there <Col N="609" /> is mention of 14,422 people having applied for jobs within the post office &mdash; now An Post &mdash; of whom 88 only were appointed at a total cost of £100,000 to run the examinations, at a cost of over £1,000 in respect of each of those 88 jobs.  This clearly illustrates that the recruitment system within the public service is in need of major overhaul.  This is not the fault of the people within these Government bodies, it is a system that has obtained for a long time.  I suppose to some extent legislation has created this type of system.  In modern times, with such demands being made on public moneys, it is now up to us to devise a more efficient system.  In this task I am confident we shall have the full co-operation of all the people within the public service. I foresee the future of recruitment in the public service in the categorising of similar jobs within the public service.  For example, if a particular category or grade of job suitable to all Departments was advertised the one examination would cover all those Departments and whatever number of applicants sat those examinations and passed them would be available for selection and appointment to any Government Department for which the grade or job was suitable.  If we did that only, then the work of the committee would have been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>We are still in our infancy.  There are excellent members serving on the committee and we have a lot to contribute.  I might pay tribute to the Minister for the Public Service himself.  I know the constraints on him.  Yet he, along with the leader of the House, was very co-operative in ensuring that we had sufficient staff so that the workings of the committee were not rendered prohibitive.  It may not be the policy of our committee to have more recruitment within the public service but, because of the type of work in which we engage, I suspect we will need extra staff for research and such things in the years ahead.  I am sure the necessary co-operation from the Minister for the Public Service and other Ministers will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I feel honoured to be a member of the committee.  We have a worthwhile job to do.  I believe that the future investment <Col N="610" /> of taxpayers' money in the State service is dependent on an efficient, cost-effective system.  I believe our committee will make a major contribution in ensuring value for money to our taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join other members of the committee who have commended the secretariat and the spirit with which the people have approached the work of this committee. There is no doubt but that it can become a very useful forum for teasing out problems in the public sector.  We have received nothing but the fullest co-operation from the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission who were the first people who, as it were, came under the scrutiny of the committee.  The Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission have been operating somewhat at a disadvantage because of the lack of clear policy statements from the Department of the Public Service.  Obviously the Local Appointments Commission have laudable aims. They recognise there is a statutory obligation on them to hold competitions. They believe also that the opportunity should be given every year to young people, that we should not have the situation where a competition is held only once in every five years because that would exclude many school leavers.  They believe it should be opened to universal application, that everyone should get a chance to be examined and that the person chosen should be selected on objective grounds.  Those principles are laudable, but we identified some problems and these are spelled out in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first relates to cost.  The system as operated by the Commission has failed to respond to declining vacancies in the public service.  In the report we cite figures by the commission where they state that the cost per appointment has increased from £325 in 1980 to £700 in 1982 at constant prices, but those figures are only a partial account of the situation because there are other expenditures not included in their estimate which are included elsewhere in the Estimates. These cover buildings, rates and so on, <Col N="611" /> and they come to an extra £500,000 which must be added to the cost.</P>
    <P>A feature that amazed us when we spoke to the commission was that what are described in their booklets as the persons selected for appointment do not add up to the number of jobs filled.  In the case of the Post Office exam where figures were cited, we discovered that the number of jobs filled was about one-quarter. In other words, the figures I quoted a moment ago are not accurate: the real figures are four times that amount.  This is a worrying matter.  If one adjusts for those two features, the cost of filling a job by the Local Appointments Commission increased from £1,400 in 1980 to £3,700 in 1982.  The expenditure of almost £4,000 on the placement of a person by the commission into the Civil Service seems an enormously high cost. While the objectives of the commission in the way they conduct exams are laudable, I do not think we can continue to do this at such a high cost.</P>
    <P>It was surprising to discover that only one in four people offered jobs in the Civil Service actually take up those jobs. This is clear evidence that people are using the Civil Service and the Local Appointments Commission competitions as exam practice but, on the other hand, the people appointed have been through other employment networks and have got placed by the time they get an offer of a job in the Civil Service.  There is a real concern that we are carrying out an unwieldy and expensive competition and that at the end of the day the people who are successful are not, in many cases, interested in taking up the positions. There is need for a change in this area.</P>
    <P>As other speakers have said, we did not reach a complete consensus on all aspects but we agreed on two points which were important.  The first is that whenever a competition is advertised there should be a statement setting out the likely number of vacancies to be filled.  Many young people are entering these competitions with high hopes which will not be fulfilled, and obviously this increases the numbers who will enter.  For example, if it had been stated in the case of the Post Office exam that the vacancies <Col N="612" /> numbered only 88 it would have had a different effect on applicants.</P>
    <P>We would like to see an annual publication in the form of the comprehensive programme published earlier this year, setting out the policies pursued in Civil Service recruitment, the methods used and the cost per job filled.  If that were done on an annual basis it would supplement the existing annual report and it would provide information to enable people to monitor the efficiency of the system.</P>
    <P>The central issue at question in our report is how one screens the applicants when many people apply for a limited number of places.  We have identified that the present system is not ideal.  It involves very heavy costs on the items we cited, including the hiring of desks and halls and the supervision of examinations. There are alternatives, but the committee did not reach a consensus on them.  However, we set out some clear guidelines. We did not want detailed examination of more people than would be required to fill the jobs with the necessary qualified personnel.  Secondly, we did not want short-listing on the basis of academic standards that would push the qualifications for the job far above what was needed.  We identified the danger that very highly qualified applicants would take positions where others had trained themselves solely for such positions. Obviously the people who had devoted their energies to obtaining such posts would be bypassed by people who had perhaps the advantage of a third level education.  We did not see that as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>However, we did not agree on how proper screening should be done and we would like the commission and the Minister to come back to us later in the year with their suggestions as to how this could be done satisfactorily.  One possibility discussed by the committee was that of a straight lottery system, that where many people applied one would simply take names out of a hat who would enter the final stages of competition, interview and screening.  That did not find universal support in the committee, and it was just left as a possibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> Another possibility which got greater support was the idea of cheaply administered multiple choice questions on subjects relevant to the vacancy in question and we would like to see that kind of option considered by the Minister and the commission.  It would do two things: first, it would cut costs and, secondly, it would cut down the number of applicants. If there were a clear multiple choice of test or exam for, say, clerical officers in the Post Office, people who are not interested in that kind of vacancy would not apply.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to ask the Minister to examine, one the committee make, is that there seems to be a certain duplication because the National Manpower Service and the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissions operate entirely independently from one another.  The committee feel that the recruitment activities of the Commissions and the placement work of the NMS in some way should be integrated.  Assessments are made by officers of the NMS on the career prospects of certain individuals and the same sort of assessments are going on in the two commissions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would seem sensible to have a single system of assessment, at least in the early stages of a competition for employment.  Perhaps closer liaison between the commissions and the NMS would be possible.  I should like the Minister to look at the NMS system of short listing candidates for selection by employers.  That could be applicable to the civil service.  After all, in the civil service we have very large personnel sections scattered throughout the Departments. At the moment, the civil service of about 60,000 people has personnel sections of more than 1,000.  Those personnel sections do not deal with selection or interviewing and they do not deal with pay negotiations.  Is there, therefore, not a possibility that those 1,000 people could take on board the final stages of choosing for employment in their respective Departments, which they do not now do? I commend to the Minister that he would consider policy in the area of recruitment to the public service.  In the personnel <Col N="614" /> sections in the public service we seem to have quite a lot of confusion.  There are 400 people in the Department of the Public Service and a further 200 in the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissions, as well as the 1,000 scattered throughout the service.  We should examine this closely to see if we are getting proper returns for public money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I am grateful to have this opportunity to speak on this matter.  I should like to express approval of the Civil Service Commission for the valuable service they have given to the State since they were founded.  They have appointed many people to many posts in the Government service and I am sure they have now reached the stage when they would accept the proposition that change is necessary and that if we do not change we will not get people of education and ability coming into our system of administration.</P>
      <P>Our main aim should be to get the proper people for the proper jobs at the right time.  Other Deputies have referred to the system of selection, but the hands of the Civil Service Commission are tied by the competitive examination system. I consider this to be holding up new initiatives, and I hope the Minister will take a serious look at this matter.</P>
      <P>There are many other methods of deciding the capability of applicants. There is a system of examination for third-level students who do examinations which can be similar to those carried out by the Civil Service Commission.  Candidates for these school examinations already have a status of education and suitability, and I suggest that the Department should look at this seriously because these different systems of examination lend themselves to duplication, at great cost to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that we must get the most suitable people possible into the public service.  We all agree there is a waste of money in all Departments in different ways.  We have people in the system who are not suitable, who are in the job just for the sake of having a job, and one could say that that could be part of the reason why we are not getting the best <Col N="615" /> value for money.  It could be said that because the country has a lot of unemployment, the pressure is on people to seek jobs no matter where they find them.</P>
    <P>There is a grave danger that people who are not suitable are rushing to do examinations run by the Civil Service Commission.  There is concern and pressure among parents to ensure that their sons and daughters try for this, that or the other job.  Therefore, at great cost sometimes to parents their children have to travel up to 100 miles to sit for examinations.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.2 of the report before the House states that 75 per cent of those sitting for examinations and who are successful do not take up the offer of employment, or they sit for examinations for practice or for other reasons.  Therefore, this recommendation must be examined closely in order to find out whether the Estimate for the Civil Service Commission is being used properly or whether that money could be used for some other purpose.  Perhaps we would be better off with half the amount in that Estimate.  The committee are deeply concerned about better use of public money and therefore the examination system becomes relevant as a high cost factor.</P>
    <P>I have stated at our meetings that we should look at Government Estimates for the public service.  A sum of £5,581 million is divided out to the different Departments to be spent in 1984.  A huge proportion of that money is for wages, salaries and so on.  If we had the proper people in the proper jobs we would be able to save money.  We must put the best and most suitable people in suitable jobs so that they can give a good, efficient service.  If we do not examine this aspect a waste of money will result.</P>
    <P>I have a query regarding the annual Public Services Estimates.  Some of those who work on the preparation of these Estimates may have gone into employment through the Civil Service Commission and have developed experience through the different Departments.  For example, the Estimate for the Revenue <Col N="616" /> Commissioners/Post Office Services, at the beginning of 1983 was £11 million but the outturn at the end of 1983 was £16 million &mdash; £5 million extra.  There must be some good reason for that Estimate being almost 50 per cent greater than the actual expenditure during the course of the 12 months.  The Estimate for 1984 under the same heading is only £9,750,000, which is less than the Estimate for the beginning of 1983.  I do not know on what basis these Estimates are made out and I do not want to cast a reflection on those concerned with this work, but if it is through inexperience or lack of information it is their responsibility to ensure that we get the use of all public money, and the Estimate to which I have referred has resulted in the taking away of £5 million.</P>
    <P>Under Social Welfare &mdash; Post Office Savings &mdash; at the beginning of 1983 the estimate was £14 million, yet the outurn at the end of 1983 was £24 million &mdash; £10 million greater than estimated.  There must be some reason for this.  This money is allocated at the beginning of the year for use during that year and if we do not plan properly the use of the available public money 100 per cent, other areas in need of finance will have to do without it.</P>
    <P>The question of having one national employment agency has already been mentioned, with which all are registered, their standard of education and suitabilty for work, the unemployed, their education and their suitability for work.  If we have that type of register we will be moving into modern times with computerisation as the answer.  The more rapidly we move in that direction, the better the value obtained for public money.  This modernisation should not be difficult to achieve.  We would have a register of the various skills of people, the opportunities arising and the people could be quickly placed in suitable positions, within the public service area.</P>
    <P>In the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General it is stated that the Comptroller and his staff will not be in a position to keep the accounts of the various semi-State bodies up-to-date unless extra staff is supplied.  Some of the <Col N="617" /> accounts for 1982 are not yet up-to-date and the position will worsen.  I put down a question to the Minister for the Public Service on 22 November 1983, asking if he intended to sanction the recruitment of more staff to assist the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am sad to say that the reply was not favourable because of Government cutbacks, or lack of finance.  If we expect our books to be kept up to date and to get full use of public money it is essential that extra staff be recruited in this area immediately.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Oireachtas Committee on Public Expenditure, of which I am pleased to be a member, will continue the good work which they are doing and will hold the respect of the people communicating with them.  The committee are not trying to knock anybody out of his or her present position.  We respect their opinions and hope that they respect ours.  Basically, we are trying to work in the interests of all the people towards a better standard of living, better use of taxpayers money and having the maximum number of jobs available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say initially that I very much welcome the content of the report from the Committee on Public Expenditure.  As mentioned by the Chairman when moving the motion, this is the committee's first report and it is also the first occasion on which the Dáil has had an opportunity to discuss a report from one of the new Dáil committees.  I believe that the new system of committees will give an opportunity to Deputies to investigate and clarify for themselves areas of administration which they might not otherwise be able to examine to their satisfaction except, perhaps, to a certain extent through the medium of a Dáil question.  In fact, in that regard I could not help reflecting on the remarks and attitudes adopted today by speakers from all sides of the House on the matter of the operation of the Civil Service Commission and the tone of the debate in March and April of last year when virtually contradictory remarks and viewpoints were expressed as to how the commission should operate and the extent to <Col N="618" /> which it should provide examination opportunities to the general public.</P>
      <P>As regards the report of the committee, I should like to mention to the House that I have written to the Chairman of the committee seeking a meeting with them to discuss the contents of the report and possible action arising out of the recommendations contained within it. Since the report was published some ten days or a fortnight ago the contents of the report have been brought to the notice of the Government and I have received their agreement to the idea that I should ask the committee for a meeting so that we could discuss the report's recommendations and see what further views the committee might have in regard to the more efficient operation of the Civil Service Commission.  I hope that that is a fair indication of the attitude which the Government are trying to adopt towards the operation of committees generally.  The fact that the members of the Government are prepared to indicate their anxiety to discuss with all-party committees the general attitude adopted by the committees in their reports is one which ought to be welcomed by the members of the committees and will indicate to them the attitude of support which the Government wish to adopt towards the activities of committees generally.</P>
      <P>Before I respond to the individual recommendations I think it would be as well to point to a number of matters relating to the Civil Service Commission, not least of which is the fact that the cost of running competitions for recruitment to the Civil Service is directly proportionate to the number of applications received. Each competition involves costs incurred on (a) Examiners' fees; (b) the hire of halls at suitable venues for examinations; (c) superintending examinations; (d) printing of examination papers; (e) advertising and postage; (f) computer processing; (g) provision of desks and suitable furniture and (h) miscellaneous travel expenses.  During the last month in the House I was pressed to provide additional facilities at a cost to the Civil Service Commission and the taxpayer for the benefit of people attending for examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> All of these expenses vary with the number of candidates applying for a particular post.  In 1982, for example, over 24,000 entered for the clerical assistant competitions, over 9,000 for the clerical officers post and over 11,000 for the executive officer competitions.  Deputies will appreciate that these substantial numbers of candidates must be carefully processed by the Commission, admittedly at substantial cost, irrespective of the number of appointments that eventually result from the actual competition.</P>
    <P>In 1976 the total number of applications received for various competitions held by the Civil Service Commission was 72,648.  By 1978 the total number had risen to 88,758.  In 1981 the figure was 99,925.  By 1982 we had managed to break the 100,000 barrier and 106,861 people applied for the posts advertised. The number of candidates selected for appointment, as a result of either examination or interview, in each of those years was 3,596, 7,967, 6,004 and 3,119 respectively.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves if the number appointed, in comparison to the total number applying, is justifiable in the context of the expense of operating the Commission. In the debate on a Private Members' Motion on 19 April 1983, when objections were raised to the application of a limited examination fee in certain cases I said at column 1306 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>It might have been more honest and fair if the applicants were given some indication of just how few opportunities there really were of obtaining gainful employment.</P>
    <P>I went on to say at column 1308:</P>
    <P>I believe we must find ways to make the numbers who are actually examined more relevant to the numbers of jobs available while at the same time allowing all people who are eligible in some way to make initial applications and have those applications screened, I believe, on balance, that would be a fairer way to all applicants.  It would certainly be fairer to those who eventually <Col N="620" /> would come to be examined and who would realise they had some chance of getting those jobs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that so many Deputies have, in the course of the intervening ten months, through the activities of the Public Expenditure Committee, come to share those views expressed at that time and which I venture to suggest did not receive anything like universal or all party approval at the time.</P>
    <P>The particular examination, which drew the attention of the Public Expenditure Committee to examine the operations of the Commision generally, was that of post office clerk competition held in 1982.  Notice of the intention to hold that competition was given prior to the embargo introduced by this Government when last we were in power.  The brochure announcing the competition was published in September 1981 and made clear that the competition would be held in April 1982.  While some of the figures that have been used are quite startling they are a little misleading in relation to the particular competition.  That is still not to say that the costs have not been enormous.  Because the panel appointed has continued in existence since the original competition was held the figure of six people being appointed is erroneous.  So far, there have been 140 people appointed, and to do that the Commission has gone down as far as approximately the 500th place on the panel.  Even on the basis of those numbers and the cost of £100,000, which was given in paragraph 6.2 of the committee's report, the cost per appointee to date has been about £700.  If additional appointments are made the cost will be reduced to a lower figure depending on the further numbers appointed.  At present, it is expected that about 25 more will be needed, which will reduce the cost to about £600 per appointee.  That cost is still very considerable. The question has to be asked at what stage one balances the requirement to allow all of those who are deemed to be eligible to apply for public competitions for appointment while, on the other hand, balancing against that the requirements <Col N="621" /> of the taxpayer that public money should be expended in the most cost effective way.</P>
    <P>These figures give one some idea of the overall situation in relation to recruitment through the Civil Service Commision. Experience has shown, however, that the vast majority of school-leavers often apply for a range of competitions solely for the purpose of examination practice.  In fact Commission statistics indicate that no more than a third of those offered positions, as a result of the various competitions, actually accept. There is therefore considerable substance to the charge that many of the applications received by the Commission are not genuine in the first instance.  However, as the House well knows, the Commision is statutorily obliged to consider all valid applications as if they were genuine.</P>
    <P>Of course the Government are concerned to ensure the greatest efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the operation of the Civil Service Commission.  Those objectives must, however, be consistent with the maintenance of public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of the Commission's recruitment procedures.</P>
    <P>Needless to say the claims of individual candidates, in these competitions, must, particularly in times of economic and financial difficulties, be balanced against the cost to the already overburdened taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say this in any contentious way, but Deputies will remember that the Government, in an attempt to reduce the cost of competitions, introduced in 1983 &mdash; it is relevant also to point out that the report under examination was basically the report of the 1982 activities of the Civil Service Comission &mdash; application fees which, if my memory serves me right, produced a diversity of reaction from across the political divide and perhaps even from people who are now members of the new Public Expenditure Committee.</P>
    <P>The actual result of the charging of application fees was interesting.  There was a sizable reduction of at least a third in the number of applicants and there was a considerable improvement in the <Col N="622" /> cost-effectiveness of the Commission evident in the receipt of £208,000 in fees quite apart from the savings on examiners and the other areas I mentioned earlier. Those fees, however, are no longer applicable because of the opposition of the public generally and because of the opposition of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The example of the application fees, and the attendant controversy, illustrates vividly the difficulties which the Government face, and indeed the difficulties which the Committee on Public Expenditure now faces, in attempting to reduce costs in a highly sensitive area.  The committee make a number of recommendations some of which are in the area of statistical information which the Commission will supply.  Others, however, are somewhat more complex.</P>
    <P>The recommendations at paragraphs 8.2, 8.7, 8.8 and 8.9 fall into the former category and can be implemented, in the main, without difficulty.  They refer, briefly, to notification of vacancies available, number of vacancies actually filled, costings relating to the Commission and computerisation.</P>
    <P>As regards the recommendations at paragraphs 8.3 and 8.6 the suggested involvement of the National Manpower Service will, of course, be examined, but I must point out that there are major difficulties attached to this recommendation.</P>
    <P>The functions of the National Manpower Service and of the Civil Service Commission are as they stand at present fundamentally different.  The former is a referral agency which leaves the choice of the employee to the employer, whereas the latter selects the employee on behalf of the employer.  The Commissioners are bound by law to make their selection on the basis of merit as determined by competition, while employers availing themselves of the National Manpower Service are not so restricted as to how they select.</P>
    <P>The integrity of the Commissioners in applying the merit principle has never been impugned and has been the major factor in maintaining the public confidence in the selection process for civil service employment that I referred to a <Col N="623" /> moment ago.  The Commissioners must in law be satisfied as to the suitability of candidates and their order of merit, and they cannot therefore delegate selection to the National Manpower Service or any other agency.</P>
    <P>As a general rule the National Manpower Service does not deal with applicants on a national basis.  If a private employer in Dublin was looking to fill some non-specialist vacancies for which many people might be suitable, the National Manpower Service would be unlikely to refer him/her to job seekers registered in their Cork, Galway or Sligo offices, for example.  The Commissioners on the other hand must, when asked to fill vacancies, advertise for them on a national basis and consider all applicants irrespective of where they live.</P>
    <P>Likewise to confine a competition to persons in the National Manpower Service register would be totally contrary to the principle of open competition and would necessitate a change in legislation. In any case, once the new procedure became established, the persons who would normally apply for Civil Service posts &mdash; most of them still at school &mdash; would register with the National Manpower Service, thereby greatly artificially swelling the numbers registered and causing duplication and an increase in costs for the NMS generally.  In essence the reality would then be that two agencies would be involved in recruitment instead of one.  Such a situation could hardly be regarded as conducive to either improving efficiency or reducing cost-effectiveness.</P>
    <P>I was a little taken aback when I heard of a development on the committee's recommendation in relation to this matter as expressed by two members of the committee, Deputy Bruton who had a particular interest in the suggestion and Deputy Hilliard.  Deputy Bruton's idea was developed to some extent by Deputy Hilliard.  It was that we would have one single placement agency in respect of both the public and private sector based on people's academic attainments and computerised records of those achievements. If those views were advanced at <Col N="624" /> the committee I am not surprised by Deputy Bruton's remark that the committee were unable to reach a consensus on some of the suggestions.  Such a system whereby one could only get a job if one had sufficiently high academic qualifications registered in one national placement agency in respect of any job in the public or private sector is a concept which is peculiar only to some East European regimes.  It would be totally rejected and would be anathema to the general public.</P>
    <P>It is worth examining the case that there ought to be one recruitment agency for the entire public sector.  At present, the Civil Service commission deal with the civil service and the Local Appointments Commission, which utilise the same staff, recruit for the more senior echelons of the local authority and health services.  The State bodies carry out their own recruitment procedures in the main. There may be a case for moving towards that concept so as to promote greater mobility within the public sector.  We could examine the notion of having a public sector commission for the purpose of recruitment within the public sector. The concept of a single appointment agency for any job which exists and falls vacant in the country is unrealistic and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.4 of the report deals with shortlisting.  While the committee does not specify the basis on which shortlisting should be carried out they do say that it should not be done by setting academic standards above those necessary for the particular position.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter, however, is that applicants are short-listed where large numbers present themselves for an interview type competition.  This is done objectively by reference to matters such as educational qualifications, length or type of experience, etc.  For school-goers or school-leavers, the only objective way to short-list them would normally be by reference to their educational qualifications, and it is difficult to see what other objective criteria can be applied in their case.</P>
    <P>Having said this, however, I would welcome recommendations from the committee as to how they would short-list <Col N="625" /> applicants in a fair and equitable manner without setting excessive academic standards.</P>
    <P>This is one of the things I had in mind when I decided to write to the chairman of the committee asking him to meet me to discuss various aspects of the report. Deputy Bruton dwelt at some length on the question of screening or short-listing and said the committee were unable to come to a consensus viewpoint as to how this might be conducted efficiently and impartially.  The committee encountered some of the difficulties which have been encountered by the commission and by my Department in trying to balance a fair opportunity for people to compete with the need for the most cost effective service.  The Deputy said that the suggestion of a lottery for the purpose of short-listing people had been put forward but had not received universal support.</P>
    <P>I was being somewhat facetious ten months ago when speaking in the Dáil.  I pointed out to the House that in the case of a local authority, as a comparison with the activities of the commission, Dublin County Council called and examined 3,033 applicants for the position of clerical officer in 1982.  From that number they appointed three people.  At column 1307 of the Official Report I asked if that was not really a charade.  No matter how excellently conducted the examination was, and I have no reason but to believe it was conducted fairly, even God would be put to the pin of his collar to decide which three out of 3,033 people were best.  There is a case to be made &mdash; this is the basic concept of a lottery &mdash; that if one got the 3,033 application forms and threw them up in the air and caught three on the way down, one would probably get as good three people as if one went through the lengthy examination procedure that the council engaged in.  On the other hand, there would be many outraged applicants and parents who, if they thought people were being selected on the basis of catching pieces of paper out of the air, would say public moneys were not being devoted properly to allowing applicants to be given the best possible opportunity to prove they were the best people for the job.  That is the basic difficulty <Col N="626" /> the commission and Government have to face.  It is one which the committee faced up to and identified, but I was a little disappointed that they were unable to specifically say what they believed was the solution.  I hope that in our discussions next week we will be able to go a little further along that road.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 8.9 the committee say that they would welcome an extension of the use of computerisation in the area of recruitment with a view to effecting greater cost savings.  In this regard, I have been pressing for an extension of computerisation in the Civil Service with a fair and increasing degree of success.  In relation to the Civil Service Commission, this is one of the divisions of the Civil Service which is most ready to adapt to computerisation and has itself endeavoured to apply computerisation as extensively as possible.  The use of computers in the Commission is constantly being reviewed.  Some examples of computer techniques introduced since January 1982, with annual cost savings, are: (1) the installation of computer terminal and data processing equipment in 1983 resulting in the elimination of payments to outside computer bureaux, giving a net saving of £10,000; (2) the introduction of electronic scanning equipment with consequent savings in fees for examiners, giving a net saving of £30,000; (3) the use of word processing and optical mark reading equipment at the holding of recent competition for Garda recruitment, giving a net saving of £40,000.</P>
    <P>There has also been reference in the House to a staff of over 200 in the Civil Service Commission.  In fairness, I must point out that since 1 January 1982 the number of staff has been reduced from 219 to 164, a reduction of 55 people or 25 per cent.  That is probably the highest amount of staff shedding and staff deployed to other areas which has taken place in any Government Department during that period, due in the case of the commission partly to the operation of the embargo but more so because of the introduction of computerisation and electronic scanning equipment and their readiness to see staff deployed to other <Col N="627" /> areas in the Civil Service where they can be used more effectively.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 8.5 the committee refer to the need to avoid unnecessary examinations. In fact the recommendation is that the commission should consider that the statutory obligation on them to hold competitions does not preclude a flexible interpretation on how such competitions should be defined, and that, in this context, new or improved measures could be introduced to avoid unnecessary formal examination.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, requires a &ldquo;competition&rdquo; to be held and it also provides that every competition shall consist of at least one test.  I should like to assure the House that savings are in fact being achieved in this area by compressing and simplifying the nature of the tests.  I should point out that if the commissioners were seen not to be adhering strictly to the law, there would always be the possibility of an unsuccessful candidate challenging the result of the competition.</P>
    <P>While the comissioners are, of course, constantly seeking for means to avoid unnecessary formal examinations I will be reviewing the Act in the context of the proposed White Paper on a better public service.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made by various speakers, and I will endeavour to refer to them all briefly.  The Chairman of the committee referred to the co-operation which he had received from civil servants and people generally whom the committee had contacted, and I appreciate his remarks in that regard.  I was anxious that the staff in the various areas in the group of Votes for which I am responsible would go out of their way to be co-operative, and the staff and I were most anxious that the committee would be aware of the difficulties and the conflicting demands upon the commission and the Government.  I think the committee recognised those conflicting demands and dealt with them as fairly as one could possibly have hoped for them to do in the course of their report.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy spoke about matters <Col N="628" /> perhaps somewhat outside the context of the report of the committee on the operations of the Civil Service Commission. However, in the course of some interesting comments he said it was important that there should be an effective discharge of public service duties and that we should examine the structures, gradings, habits and positions within the Civil Service and the capacity to release immense resources.  I agree with the Deputy in that regard, and I should like to think that some of the changes which we have already introduced will be conducive to releasing the capacity to deploy those immense resources in the best possible way with the greatest degree of mobility.  Obviously the questions of structures and gradings will have to be examined also in the context of the proposed White Paper.</P>
    <P>I agree that there are what appears to be an excessive and enormous range of different gradings, many of which do not appear to be relevant or necessary at present.  People have different ideas concerning that matter, and usually those in a grade feel it should be continued.  However, there is need for a dispassionate examination as to the numbers and range of grades.  I do not know the exact number of grades in existence but they certainly run into many hundreds, perhaps a thousand.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy made a very interesting point when he drew the attention of the House to the fact that, since the departure of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which represented half of the total 60,000 approximately in the Civil Service, the Civil Service now contains about 30,000 people or 10 per cent of the entire public sector.  He said he did not believe that the committee would be content to see the area of their remit confined to the activities of the Civil Service and that public expenditure in relation to the public sector generally should allow the committee to examine areas outside the Civil Service proper and, in particular, local authorities.  That is a valid point, but it is no harm for the House to reflect on the fact that my Department's remit is confined to the Civil Service and only in a very limited <Col N="629" /> way to the wider public service.  I can, consequently, appreciate the frustrations of the Deputy and those which may be facing the committee.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also spoke about the need to ensure that the remit of the Ombudsman was as wide as possible and to his not now having responsibility to examine areas of telecommunications and postal services.  I referred to this matter in the House last week and said that once the Office of the Ombudsman had been in operation for some months it was my intention to examine, in conjunction with the Ombudsman, the extent of his remit and to honour a previous undertaking I had given to the House to come back in here if necessary to widen the Ombudsman's remit.  There is already power available to the Minister for the Public Service to bring various State bodies within the remit of the Ombudsman through ministerial order.  When the office has been in operation for some months and has successfully surmounted the natural teething problems I intend to discuss this with the Ombudsman and to ensure that his remit is as wide as he and I believe it ought to be.  The House need have no worry in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald referred to some problem he had had while Minister for the Public Service in relation to which I have no personal knowledge and am unable to comment.  However, as the Deputy has spoken about it in the House I am sure he feels he has dealt with it adequately.  His remarks did ring a particular bell for me in that &mdash; and this is an aspect of the operation of the Civil Service Commission which perhaps the committee did not advert to in their report to the extent that they might have &mdash; the Civil Service Commission have had a very high reputation over the years with regard to the impartiality of their operations and persons appointed on foot of commission recommendations have never, in my recollection, had the accusation levelled at them that they were appointed from a party political viewpoint. It is very important that the high standard and reputation of the commission is maintained and continued.</P>
    <P>There has been a practice over the <Col N="630" /> years whereby constituents approach individual Members of the House asking for their help in relation to their application for a position in the Civil Service. Up to a year ago the tradition was that the Deputy wrote to the Minister for the Public Service, who wrote to the Civil Service Commission, who in turn wrote back saying they would be making the appointment in the normal way.  That letter was returned through the conduit and, if the applicant was successful, he or she might have thought it was due to help; if unsuccessful the public representative involved might or might not have said that he or she did the best for them.</P>
    <P>I was unhappy with that situation and I was not prepared to pass on dubious queries to the Civil Service Commission.  I have instead been writing to Deputies pointing out that canvassing ought to have the effect of disqualification and that were I to make even a formal inquiry from the commission it might be interpreted in that way and my intervention might be harmful both to the Deputy and his constituent.  I felt that there was a need for the system to be strengthened.</P>
    <P>For some months past I have been in correspondence with the commission asking them to make new regulations in relation to the disqualification rule.  I am happy to say that they have recently sent to me new draft regulations, the effect of which will be to tighten this procedure. It is my intention when those regulations come into force to inform Members of the House and other public representatives that any representations sent to me will be forwarded to the commission and will result in the automatic disqualification of the person in respect of whom the representation is made.  That is fundamental not only to the operation of a fair and impartial service but also to the realisation of that impartiality on the part of the general public.  I put the House on clear notice that in the very near future any representation to me, oral or written, will have the effect of automatically disqualifying the candidate involved.</P>
    <P>This should help to improve the reputation and standing of Members who can <Col N="631" /> say clearly and honestly to their constituents that if they were to intervene in any way the candidate would be disqualified. This should serve to show up the rather deceitful attitude that has sometimes been adopted by certain people in suggesting that they were instrumental in obtaining jobs through the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald also spoke about the difficulty, when the commission operate a myriad of interview boards, of obtaining consistency and the fact that people may not always perform to the best of their ability while appearing before interview boards.  I appreciate that point of view.  In connection with the changes in relation to the appointment of senior civil servants, through the introduction of the top appointments committee and, more especially, through the introduction of an assessment procedure based on a person's day-to-day performance, I have helped to bring about a situation where people will be promoted on their performance on a daily basis rather than their performance at a 45-minute interview. That new system of appraisal and assessment is being extended to various other management grades in the Civil Service and it is my earnest hope and expectation that it will be possible for me to say by the middle of the summer that a system of appraisal and assessment obtains in relation to all management grades in the Civil Service from the position of secretary to that of executive officer. I hope to come back to the House with further details within the next few months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton seemed to be labouring under a misapprehension when he suggested that the figures published in the annual report of the commission did not accurately represent the numbers who took up employment.  A certain small number may leave employment within a couple of days of being appointed.  The figures contained in the report, while admittedly very high and showing an average of £700 per job filled in 1982, are correct, and the suggestion of the Deputy that they ought to be multiplied by four would bring about a situation where an <Col N="632" /> extremely costly and, perhaps, over-expensive operation might be regarded as being four times more costly than is the case.</P>
    <P>The committee's report contains a suggestion regarding the publication of the likely number of jobs to be filled.  That number cannot always be gauged with accuracy.  I suggest that in future the commission ought to publish the number of posts filled in that grade in the preceding year.  This ought to give applicants some idea of the numbers of jobs which might fall vacant.</P>
    <P>The Government are faced with the fundamental problem of balancing the availability of positions and the making available of opportunities to all applicants who have the necessary qualifications to throw their hat in the ring and get a fair crack of the whip.  That must be balanced against the number of jobs likely to be filled and the cost to the taxpayer.  The difficulties are obvious and complex, but one must accept them and come to whatever conclusions are necessary. It may well be that an amendment of the 1966 Civil Service Commissioners Act will be required, but I do not think it can mean an amendment of the basic concept that an independent body, independent of control or interference by any Minister, shall conduct some form of procedure in which the public have confidence and resulting from which posts can be filled on an impartial basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Bruton's suggestion, I do not think it would be appropriate or acceptable for personnel units with Departments to take on the job of making appointments.  These units have quite a task of education, training and retraining to carry out in relation to existing staff.</P>
    <P>The concept of the commission was introduced by the first Government in the early twenties.  It has stood the test of time very well.  The commission have been examining cost-effectiveness.  I welcome the report of the committee and the fact that so many of their recommendations endorse the remarks I made in the Dáil on 19 April last.  To give the House some idea of the differences that can <Col N="633" /> occur in less than a year, I would refer to column 1525 of the Official Report for 20 April which states:</P>
    <P>The Deputy quoted a figure of 17,000 applications for one grade in the Civil Service and said only 12,500 turned up for the examination.  So what?  Are not the young people of Ireland entitled to apply for jobs?  The jobs are scarce enough.  Very often job applications dates clash and they are unable to turn up for both examinations. You cannot say you have equality of opportunity unless you have access to that opportunity.  Access means that you can apply for and sit for the written examination.  Being sanctimonious and asking why they did not all turn up for the examination is just being mealy-mouthed.</P>
    <P>As the members of the Public Expenditure Committee are discovering, there is a distinction between mealy-mouthed and having concern for the cost falling on the taxpayer.  I hope that the report of the committee will be read by, amongst others, Deputy Mary O'Rourke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the interest taken by all those who have contributed and I pay tribute to the frankness and the forthright nature of the Minister's significant contribution.  This is an interim report, and I gather there is no fundamental objection to any of the recommendations.</P>
      <P>A number of extraneous matters arose in the course of discussion which are not included in the recommendations and which are, therefore, peripheral to this debate.  Such a matter is the question of a lottery system.  It did not emerge as a recommendation because it did not get adequate support, as the Minister hinted. Accordingly it is not formally on the table and will not be formally on the table as a recommendation from this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note that, at an early opportunity, the Minister intends to communicate with me to discuss the contents of the report.  I look forward to responding rapidly and co-operatively to that request.  The Minister said the commission is statutorily obliged to consider all <Col N="634" /> valid applications as if they were genuine. In terms of cost-effectiveness the question is not the number of applications, or the number of jobs which might emerge at the end of that consideration, but the process of consideration.</P>
    <P>We are submitting that what has happened up to now is that a fairly formal arrangement of very comprehensive, extensive and expensive examinations has operated by and large.  In that environment, we contend that a selective, modern, efficient short listing technique and approach which operates in other countries from which we are making inquiries will basically mean that an evaluation of an application would be made by sensible people and could result in a much smaller number being called for a formal examination.  That is the kind of suggestion we are making.  I agree it must be approached with great caution and taken very carefully.</P>
    <P>Such an approach would not leave anybody open to the allegation that an application was not being considered. There is a simplistic approach prevailing at present in relation to the creaming off people at the top of an examination system which could very well result in the wrong candidate getting the position in some cases, or people who were good at doing examinations but were not necessarily qualified getting the post.</P>
    <P>With regard to the academic question the Minister dwelt for a moment or two on the suggestion this morning that the academic criterion might be dwelt on by the committee.  I can assure the Minister that is not the case.  In our recommendation we say that such a short listing mechanism should not be used by setting academic standards above those necessary for the position.  In other words the academic qualification should not be the criterion.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Recommendation 8.4 of the Report deals with shortlisting.  While the committee do not specify the basis on which shortlisting should be carried out they do say that it should not be done by setting academic standards above those necessary for the particular position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> If during the morning somebody insinuated an over-emphasis in that respect, it should not be misinterpreted.</P>
    <P>If I may take the liberty of speaking on behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister's initiative on the question of canvassing for posts in the Civil Service. I hope he will consider extending it beyond that.  I would look forward to the day when seeking procurement or advancement by anybody for any post in the public sector would be seen as unethical and something which this House individually and collectively would repudiate. I would be happy to consider to what extent our committee could facilitate the Minister if he requires any support in that respect.  That would be in the best interests of everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>It places an onus on agencies affected by such a proposal to be responsive and outward-looking and to give a public service.  People would be able to get information.  This obnoxious practice of sending letters which are open to the interpretation that we can influence the fall of the dice is one which all decent people and right-minded people would wish to have exorcised from our system as soon as possible, if it is not already too late.  I welcome the Minister's initiative.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in our report appear to find general favour.  The Minister indicated support for quite a number of them.  He took the committee to task, rightly I think, for not being as specific as we might have been, and I hope will be in due course on the question of the short list.  One problem we had in that respect was that our job was not the job of Government, but to make recommendations on our perceptions of inadequacies. The details of such recommendations may very well have to be worked out by the Departments, or by the Government or by the Minister involved in any case. We are not equipped or geared, nor should we be expected, to write chapter and verse on the precise formulation for the improvements.</P>
    <P>That said, there is an onus on us to go as far as we can to try to lay as specific a set of recommendations as possible before the Minister.  We will take up his <Col N="636" /> gracious invitation.  He said he would welcome recommendations from the committee as to how they would short list applicants.  There are techniques which are used by people in the private sector who are skilled in dealing with personnel, and which do not involve processing thousands of applications for a relatively small number of jobs.  They manage to sift and evaluate a fair amount of information.</P>
    <P>I accept that they are not necessarily bound to consider every application equally, but there may be a via media between the two extremes.  If that is the case, we should be able to make progress and first, reduce the cost to the taxpayer of elaborate and unnecessary competitions; secondly ensure that we get the best talent and not use simplistic criteria to pinpoint this talent; and thirdly, and not unimportantly, not build up nonsensical expectations among thousands of young people that they will procure a job when the employment potential is extremely limited.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to move the motion this morning.  I thank my colleagues for their co-operation, and I want to put on record my appreciation of Mr. Judge and his staff who, since they came to work for us, have been extremely helpful.  I look forward to coming back to the House with other reports, and I hope they will result in due course in an improvement in our approach to public expenditure.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress I was taking an overview of what might be expected to happen in the youth service in the course of the next 12 months, and comparing it with the targets we set ourselves on taking office.  I dealt with the progress towards developing a national youth policy. I want to remind the House that the committee are already showing their commitment to the task in hand.  They presented an interim report within three months of being established, as they were requested to do.  Members on all sides of the House will look forward to the final report due in September of this year. That report when presented undoubtedly will present challenges which we must face and, in so far as we can with the very difficult financial situation in which we find ourselves, we must respond to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme of grants to assist youth organisations and provide services for young people was first introduced in 1969 when a total of £42,000 was made available from Exchequer funds.  That level of support has increased progressively as successive Governments recognised the role of youth organisations in the social education of young people.  In 1980 substantial progress was made when it was <Col N="638" /> agreed to guarantee to support courses staff and programmes of organisations then in receipt of grants.  Last year saw further progress in the development of the youth service.  As I mentioned yesterday, an increase of 36 per cent on the 1982 provision was secured and this allowed for the entry of new organisations to the youth service grant scheme. They were Macra na Feirme, An Óige, the Order of Malta and the Junior Chamber of Ireland.  The provision of funds to assist the promotion and development of services for those most in need was the other development of which I spoke yesterday. The extension of the scheme to include Macra na Feirme was of particular importance to Members of this House as indicated in representations I have had from almost every Member in the House representing a rural constituency who has paid tribute to the work of this organisation and the valuable contribution they make to the social scene in rural Ireland in particular, so I was very happy to be able to respond.</P>
    <P>The year 1983 saw progress on another front.  An agreed set of grant-aid criteria was produced in consultation with the National Youth Council of Ireland and youth organisations in general.  At one time it was complained that equity varied with the length of the Lord Chancellor's foot.  I do not think that anyone has suggested that the allocation of the youth service grant scheme depended upon the size shoes worn by various Ministers of State.  There would be some remarkable divergencies between the very elegant foot of my predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and some of our more plodding offerings, but it is fair to say that the scheme depended unduly perhaps on the whim of the office holder of the day, or at least it was open to that fear on the part of organisations.  The new scheme provides for the assessment of the effectiveness of the youth organisations in the areas of administration, full-time and part-time staff, programmes and development for the purpose of allocating new grants.</P>
    <P>This year for the first time the grants will be decided in the context of that scheme.  An important feature of the <Col N="639" /> scheme is a commitment to consult with the standing committee on youth work of the National Youth Council of Ireland in relation to any further developments and extensions of the scheme.  As I indicated, the 1984 provision in the Estimates allows for an increase in the 1983 outturn of £1.371 million and that increase will be well in excess of the cost of living increase that might be expected.</P>
    <P>The area of in-service training for full-time youth workers has given rise to concern for some time.  Organisations require to provide ongoing in-service training for their full-time staff, which is understandable, and this is becoming a central feature of the youth service.  In order to equip workers with appropriate skills it is necessary to meet the changing needs of young people and the changing needs and aspirations of the volunteer leaders.  My Department provide direct assistance to organisations for in-service training.  This whole question must be examined by the national youth policy committee in the context of the overall provision of training for youth workers. Last year £20,000 was made available to organisations for this purpose and once again provision will be made in this coming year.</P>
    <P>My Department and I recognise that youth work has an international dimension which plays a part in determining the general development and quality of youth service.  Consequently, in co-operation with the National Youth Council of Ireland and other appropriate organisations, funds are made available to assist youth groups, young people and youth leaders to avail of learning and training opportunities abroad.  An area of significance is that of cross-Border youth exchanges.  For some years a scheme of grant assistance has been in existence which was made available to promote and encourage greater contact, co-operation and participation in events by young people from both parts of Ireland. Under it grants are payable to youth groups affiliated to recognised national youth organisations to assist them to travel to and stay in Northern Ireland, or to host a group from there.  As I have <Col N="640" /> indicated, I attach a high priority to the development of this exchange programme. Members will be interested to know that last year some 52 exchanges took place under this programme involving some 1,770 young people.  This year will see extended supportive aid.  Parallel to that is the area of British-Irish youth exchange which this Government see as an important priority in generating goodwill and mutual co-operation among all young people from these islands.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be aware that 1985 will be International Youth Year.  Ireland has sought and, having sought, secured membership of the United Nations Advisory Committee for International Youth Year.  It did so because it seemed to us that the themes of that year &mdash; participation, development and peace &mdash; were of special relevance in an Irish context.  A national coordinating committee for International Youth Year has been established and that committee is representative of youth organisations, young people, Government Departments and other interests. The task of the committee is to plan, co-ordinate, stimulate and assist activities by appropriate governmental and non-governmental agencies for IYY.  The Government have agreed to provide £140,000 Exchequer assistance to the committee in support of their plans for the year.  I would welcome the views of other Members on this, but it seems that the celebration of International Youth Year and the themes central to it offer many opportunities for co-operation in joint North-South programmes for young people.</P>
    <P>I have already taken the opportunity of having a meeting with my opposite number in Northern Ireland, Mr. Nicholas Scott, MP, to consider with him what opportunities he and we would see arising. It is a fair summary to say that on all sides is a desire to avail of the opportunity presented by IYY to extend contact and co-operation.  One area has already been decided.  Members of the House are aware that within this island about three scout organisations are in existence.  Next year will see those organisations coming together for a joint camp on a scale that <Col N="641" /> has scarcely ever been seen before in this country.  Full details of this will be announced shortly.  I hope in the near future to indicate how we can give further practical support.  It may be of interest to my colleague sitting beside me to know that the intended venue is in the west.</P>

      <P>I cannot guarantee that.  One matter that has been of concern to previous office holders in the Department of Education or, on the other hand, in the Department of Labour with responsibility for youth affairs, has been the lack of State recognition of the achievements of young people.  Across the House there is a consensus on the need to rectify what seems to be an omission. Accordingly, the Government are committed to the establishment of a national award scheme for young people. It is intended that the scheme will be the nation's highest recognition of the achievement, initiative and community service of young people.  In expectation that the award will provide important additional programme outlets for voluntary youth organisations and thus will contribute to the development of youth services generally, it is intended that Exchequer support for this initiative will be limited in time and duration.  We hope that the total Exchequer support will not exceed £100,000 and that other costs will be met from the private sector.</P>

      <P>Discrimination in the social welfare code affects mainly the entitlements of married <Col N="642" /> women.  In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance stated that legislation to deal with the matter will be introduced later this year.

Will the Minister confirm that those matters will be dealt with by the end of this year and that we will be able to face 1985 in a position that under the social welfare code there will not be any discrimination remaining?</P>

On the optical benefit side, on the same basis of 300,000 wives, it is estimated that it would cost in the region of £1 million for the first year of operation, adding .025 per cent to the current PRSI rate.

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to an article in a publication (details supplied) to the effect that Members of the Oireachtas are abusing the system of parliamentary questions by virtue of the number of those being asked on social welfare problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the article referred to which undoubtedly raises some disturbing issues in relation to the large volume of questions asked on social welfare matters in particular those relating to the entitlements of individual claimants.</P>
      <P>Deputies are, of course, entitled to raise such matters if they so wish but the question also arises as to whether this House is the most appropriate forum for many of them.  In many cases the questions are in effect first-time representations in respect of individuals who have not used the remedies available to them to pursue their claims through the normal channels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Delays in the processing of claims are currently being experienced in certain areas of the Department due to the <Col N="651" /> increasing claim-load and to certain staff shortages.  At the same time there has been a considerable increase in the level of representations and in the number of parliamentary questions.  The 4,109 questions asked in 1983 exceeded by almost a thousand the total for 1981 and 1982 put together.  Unfortunately the servicing of this large body of representations and questions is having an adverse effect on the Department's ability to process claims for payment and is contributing to the delays.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to bear these considerations in mind when putting down questions relating to the entitlements of individual claimants and to consider in each case whether all the normal channels for pursuing the matters at issue have been used to the full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that there were over 1,000 more questions put on the Order Paper for 1983 than in the previous year.  This is an indication of the fact that his Department are not in a position to administer the schemes, particularly the unemployment assistance scheme, because of the embargo placed on the public service by his Government, and that is the reason the questions are down.  Does the Minister not consider it totally misleading of the National Social Services Board to write such an article &mdash; which is read by people involved in trying to help those most in need in our community &mdash; and would he suggest to them that these questions should not be put down?  Would the Minister accept that the vast majority of questions on the Order Paper are necessary to elicit a response on behalf of the under-privileged in our society?  Is the Minister aware that I had a question down the other day when I was told that somebody who had applied for unemployment assistance in September 1983 was still having his case processed because of extensive investigations and that this is the type of case in respect of which Deputies put down questions? Would the Minister accept that it was totally wrong of this magazine, published <Col N="652" /> by the National Social Services Board, now a statutory agency, to mislead the public in this way?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me to make a statement on the matter and I have made that statement which contained my views on the matter.  On the one hand the article should not be dismissed out of hand in the manner in which the Deputy suggested.  Undoubtedly there are some cases, not all &mdash; and I fully agree with the Deputy in his defence of the parliamentary question particularly in relation to social welfare matters because they relate to the most vulnerable sections of our community &mdash; when Members, if needs be, should use the ultimate weapon, if you like, which is the parliamentary question.  At the same time the analysis of the situation contained in the report is worth while studying and examining.  There are certain cases in respect of which Deputies put down questions they must know in their own minds are unnecessary.  There is one example quoted there where an applicant for a free telephone obviously did not comply with the requirements, yet a parliamentary question was put down.  It does an injustice to the vast majority of social welfare questions when there are the few questions Deputies put down simply in order to be able to tell their constituents they took every possible step to get them their entitlement even though the Deputy should have known in the first instance that the person would not comply with the regulations to qualify for that benefit.  There was a time in this House when questions to the Minister for Social Welfare were very rare. They are becoming so plentiful now that they are contributing in a major way to the difficulty of dealing with cases.  I <Col N="653" /> might suggest that all Deputies take all other steps first &mdash; most Deputies do &mdash; before putting down a question.</P>

      <P>While accepting almost in full what the Minister says &mdash; and I agree with his remarks about a lot of parliamentary questions put down; indeed I have raised this matter several times &mdash; would he not agree that this article and the way it was presented seemed to imply that TDs had no right to take part in a democracy by way of putting down questions which it was contended, regardless of whether they are researched or not, is a waste of time? Indeed the whole foundation of the report was based not on when questions are put down but on when they are answered.  When questions are put down what happens in the Department is that they are then corrected, answers sent out and there is local contact within the various sections of the Department whereas, if the question was answered immediately, the success rate for TDs would be much higher.  The report gives a very slanted version to discredit TDs.  Like a number of my colleagues I rarely put down a parliamentary question but this article attacks the fundamental right of a TD to put down a question to help somebody in need.  Certainly I read an article which was most unfair.  I was elected here to speak but certainly the people who wrote that article did not do much about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.  Instructions have not been issued to discontinue payments of unemployment assistance in any area.  All applicants for unemployment assistance who fulfil the statutory conditions for receipt of assistance are paid and payment is not discontinued unless the statutory conditions cease to be fulfulled.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of unemployment assistance is that the applicant be available for and genuinely seeking work and applicants are interviewed periodically for the purpose of ascertaining whether this condition continues to be fulfilled.  I understand that a small number of applicants in the area referred to in the questions have had their claims disallowed on the grounds that they do not fulfil this condition.  Many cases of this kind arise from time to time and the experience in this particular area is not significantly different from the experience in other areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any applicant whose claim has been <Col N="656" /> disallowed has the right of appeal against the decision of the deciding officer in his case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that were it not for the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme many families in the area mentioned, and particularly in Dundalk, would be destitute and would not be able to provide for themselves and their families?  In his reply the Minister stated that people could appeal against their disqualification. Will the Minister say what are people to do in the interim while they are awaiting a decision on an appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>These two questions are very important.  They give us an opportunity to nail the lie that all a person has to do is go to a labour exchange, sign on and just draw what some people describe as so called &ldquo;easy money&rdquo;.  That is not so, it never was and never will be.  Social welfare officers continue to ensure that all the statutory conditions are complied with fully.  In doing that it is natural that people who have been out of work for a considerable time will feel aggrieved and sore and I can understand their feelings. However, let us at least keep the social welfare code above the kind of criticism which is all too widespread at the moment; I am sure Deputies have heard this criticism as I have heard it.  It proves the point that people do not get unemployment benefit simply at the drop of a hat.  Everyone claiming unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance has to comply with the statutory conditions, and inquiries are made from time to time from the people concerned in all areas. Some people do not have the answers. During January a total of 86 recipients of unemployment assistance were interviewed at Dundalk Employment Exchange regarding the efforts they had made to obtain employment.  Those interviewed were generally aged under 45 years and they had been on unemployment assistance for a number of years.  As a result of the interviews 17 of the people interviewed were disallowed for six weeks on the grounds that they were not genuinely seeking work.  The <Col N="657" /> circumstances of the cases varied but in all cases there was no evidence that the persons involved who had been receiving assistance for a number of years were making efforts to obtain employment or were interested in doing so.  Fourteen of the cases have been appealed.  I know it can be argued in these times that they cannot get work but it should be pointed out there were only 17 cases involved out of a total of 86 who were interviewed at Dundalk.  To keep the problem in proportion, at the Dundalk exchange the number receiving unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance was 3,035 on 3 February 1984.  Eighty-six people were interviewed and Deputies can work out the percentage here.  Those who have appealed have recourse to the supplementary welfare allowance and if they win their appeal they will get arrears of assistance.  I am merely putting the matter in perspective and stating the position.</P>

According to the information I have, no evidence was produced to show they were making efforts to obtain employment or were interested in doing so.  In my opinion it should be very easy in Dundalk and anywhere else for recipients to produce the necessary evidence.  There is far too much criticism, generally from better off people, that others have the option to work.  Questions come in to the Department asking what is being done about it. These questions highlight the fact that claims for benefit and assistance are 99 per cent genuine.  Fourteen of the 17 referred to here have appealed and they will get full oral hearings.

      <P>Under the social welfare code, the statutory conditions lay down that an obligation is on the claimant. These claimants should have been registered with the NMS.  The persons interviewed in Dundalk did not refuse to register with the NMS but they were not able to give satisfactory evidence of any sustained effort to find employment. Answers were given, such as that they had called at a building site last week or to a factory last year.  In some cases, letters of efforts to find work were dated on the day of the interview.  The deciding officer was satisfied that no efforts to get employment had been made in these cases.  They have submitted appeals and I hope they will be able to produce evidence. I am not trying to minimise the effects of such decisions on individual families but this involves 17 cases out of 3,000.  As I have said, the onus is on the claimant to fulfil the statutory condition that he or she made every effort to find work.</P>

      <P>There are no immediate plans to transfer administration of the disability benefit scheme from headquarters to local offices.  Such a move would require considerable extra resources by way of staff, accommodation and equipment and the local offices are already under severe pressure because of the increasing number of claimants for unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that a disability benefit system which could relate more closely to local circumstances would lead to greater efficiencies in administration and provide a better service to the public.  To this end, visual display terminals linked to the Department's computers have been installed in 19 of the Department's offices to provide a rapid inquiry service in relation to disability benefit claims.  It is intended to equip all the Department's information offices with these inquiry terminals in due course.</P>
      <P>Further development of these inquiry facilities to provide a claims processing function for disability benefits at local offices will have to await a more comprehensive computerisation of all the services provided in the local offices.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The family income supplement scheme is designed to increase the incentive to work for persons with families who are only marginally better off working than if they were claiming social welfare benefits.  This involves topping up the take-home pay of low-paid workers.  The effect of this on the labour market and the various methods of control which would have to be employed to <Col N="661" /> prevent abuse of the scheme were among the factors which had to be taken into account in fixing the income levels to which the supplement would be provided for different family sizes and the amounts to be provided for each family.  In addition, the task of estimating the number of families who would benefit from the scheme proved to be difficult because of the absence of up-to-date income distribution data for the families concerned.</P>
      <P>It was therefore decided to postpone the introduction of the scheme and the money thus saved was largely used to provide a special increase of 5 per cent for the long-term unemployed with effect from October 1983.  It was announced in the Budget Statement of 25 January 1984 that the scheme will come into operation in November next.  It is my intention that provision for the scheme will be incorporated in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>

We were told at that stage that the Government had decided to implement the scheme by legislation in the near future. Six months later we were told the scheme would be introduced on 1 December 1983.  Now the Minister of State says that they did not know the number of people who would benefit, that that had to be estimated and that other difficulties arose.  If such difficulties were there last year they will be there this year, and does the Minister expect the House to accept that that is the reason why the scheme was not introduced in 1983?  Was it a money saving device?</P>

      <P>As I have stated, the money saved was used to provide a 5 per cent increase for long-term unemployed, with effect from October 1983.  It is the intention that the scheme will be incorporated in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.  In regard to a scheme like this, the Government should not be criticised for being ambitious or, perhaps, overambitious. It was announced in the <Col N="662" /> Budget Statement of 9 February 1983.  It is a completely new form of scheme and unforeseen difficulties arose in connection with getting all the required information.  The Deputy may rest assured that provision for the scheme is being made.</P>

I am asking the Minister where the figure of 20,000, quoted to this House by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, came from.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will include night heating in the free electricity allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The free electricity allowance scheme administered by the Department is based on the ESB's two-part domestic tariff.  It provides relief from the normal standing charge and from the cost of up to 200 and 300 units of electricity each two months in the summer and winter periods respectively.  The scheme was not designed to cover electricity supplied at special reduced rates as in the case of night rate space heating and there are no plans to extend the scheme in the manner suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that elderly people living in flats and apartments very much need heat at night?  In view of the cold winters that we are now experiencing, would he reconsider his attitude and allow night heating to be included?  That is not going to break the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be too sure about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly agree with the Deputy that every effort should be made to ensure that elderly people have proper heating.  The present free electricity allowance comprises relief from the normal standing charge in respect of the ESB two-part domestic tariff together with the cost of up to 200 or 300 units of electricity which is currently 7.35 pence per unit per two monthly billing in the summer and winter periods respectively.  Since the introduction of the scheme in 1967 it has been confined to electricity supplies on the two-part domestic tariff which covers most electricity supplies for domestic purposes.  It has not included electricity supply at the special reduced rates, such as for storage heating which is covered by a separate tariff at approximately half the <Col N="664" /> domestic rate.  I gather that the Deputy wants this provision extended to storage heating, but there are many difficulties in that area.  The ESB estimate that approximately 4,000 to 5,000 of the 164,000 pensioners entitled to free electricity have storage heating, which is a very small number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated that there are not many involved and that it would not cost the Department that much, would he agree to include these people living in flats and apartments, where there are no fireplaces and no heating systems?  Furthermore, they can only use a certain number of units.  It would be no extra burden on the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of granting a special allowance of, say, 1,000 units &mdash; which would cover the use of one storage heater &mdash; to 5,000 pensioners with storage heating over the free winter billing period would be approximately £544,000 per annum.  The potential cost of all free electricity recipients seeking a special allowance for night heating would be £17,860,000 for the six winter months. The estimate for the free electricity allowance scheme for 1984 is £20,665,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12 and 13 together.  At present two separate fuel schemes are in operation.  There is an urban scheme for residents of 17 cities and towns, including Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, and there is a national scheme which operates throughout the State.  Under the urban scheme, recipients of unemployment assistance who have dependants automatically qualify.  The national scheme is intended primarily to cater for the heating needs of persons receiving social welfare pensions and similar long-term payments and does not include unemployment assistance recipients.</P>
      <P>The position whereby there are two separate fuel schemes with different conditions for entitlement is undoubtedly confusing and unsatisfactory.  Proposals are, therefore, being prepared for submission to the Government with a view to replacing the two existing schemes with a single uniform scheme from the beginning of October 1984.</P>

      <P>Why, in the year of the national fuel scheme 1983-84, was there a special exclusion by this Government of those on unemployment assistance, who are the poorest in our community? This was an exclusion which did not apply in previous years.  Previously it was stated that the health boards had discretion, outside the categories named, to give those such as unemployed free fuel.  Why has a specific paragraph been inserted this year into the national fuel scheme to exclude those on unemployment assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The national fuel scheme was introduced in 1980 to expand and rationalise the various schemes for provision of winter heating which had been in existence under the old home assistance scheme which was abolished in 1977.  The conditions were devised to include the best features of the existing schemes, in particular that of the southern area, which was the most expensive, but the categories were extended to include recipients of all long-term pensions and allowances and the liberal definition of &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; was borrowed from the free electricity scheme.  While unemployment assistance recipients were included in the urban scheme, these schemes had been brought in specifically for non-turf areas during the war and the criteria of need would not justify extending the entitlement to unemployment assistance recipients throughout the country, where the majority would have access to turf.  There are indications that unemployment assistance recipients have been granted allowances in cases of special hardship, but these are isolated cases and the scheme is generally being administered in accordance with the approved criteria.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Embassy in Paris has made special arrangements to facilitate the advance of funds to stranded Irish truck drivers in France.  To date the Embassy has dealt with requests from four hauliers and funds have been advanced to assist in two cases.  The Embassies in Bonn, Vienna, Rome and Berne have also been contacted with a view to providing assistance.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with the Ambassador in Paris this morning it has been decided to send a representative to the French-Italian border where most of the serious difficulties are being experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials from my Department and the Department of Communications will be meeting representatives from the Road Hauliers Association this afternoon to <Col N="668" /> consider what further appropriate action the Government can take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in an interview after the 1.30 news today an angry haulier suggested that there was not any action by our Embassy or our representative staff in France to help out in the difficulties?  How can the Minister say, then, that the Embassy in Paris have been so active?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Because that is true.  I have already said that we have advanced funds to hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the British authorities are going further than that and they are talking to the hauliers out on the ground and giving assistance of a practical nature?  Will he tell the House when the Embassy staff will do something to relieve the hard-pressed Irish hauliers in France?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pointless sometimes to talk in this House when people do not listen to the answers you are giving.  I have already said that the Embassy in Paris have contacted hauliers and have advanced funds.  That is practical assistance. I do not know what the Deputy is suggesting when he said that more could be done.  We could go to the French-Italian border, where, as far as we know, about 20 of the hauliers are stranded. That is something practical.  The most practical thing we can do is to give funds. The reason somebody is going from the Embassy to that area is because the hauliers may find difficulty in dealing with local officials and banks in the area.  The other main pocket where lorries are stranded is in Le Havre and the Irish Continental Line are acting there.  They are advancing funds and giving every assistance they can.  There are other cases where there are individual lorries stopped in places throughout France and we do not know precisely where they are. The reason for the meeting this evening is to find out from the Road Hauliers Association if they know where their individual members are stranded and, if so, if they have means of contacting <Col N="669" /> them, to ask them to contact the Embassy in Paris where any practical assistance that is necessary will be given.</P>

The Minister suggested in his initial response he had already taken the action.  I would like to know when the Department issued the instruction to the Embassy to get involved?  If the Minister is so familiar with the details of this, would he indicate to the House how many Irish hauliers are stranded, how many have sought assistance to date and when we can expect to relieve the situation for the hard-pressed drivers?</P>

Those in Le Havre are being assisted and looked after by the Irish Continental Line.  Those on the French-Italian border are another pocket and money has been advanced to them.  There are individual lorries stranded in other parts of France and we do not know where they are. Maybe their parent companies know and, if so, if their drivers contact them or if they give us some way to contact them, the Embassy in Paris could contact them to see if they want assistance.</P>

      <P>Before Question Time, I was commenting on the Government's intention to move towards the establishment of a national awards scheme for young people.  The award can be seen as forging a unique partnership between Government and public and private institutions with the aim of promoting the better development of young people.  It is my hope that the scheme will be established shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area which is my specific responsibility is the grant scheme for youth employment and I wish to inform the House of some changes which have taken place in relation to that.  Deputies will be aware that in the past there was a heavy concentration on construction <Col N="693" /> related activity.  We hope that emphasis will now shift with AnCO developing greater responsibility in the area of construction and the weight of the scheme being moved into other areas.</P>
    <P>I mention some areas where there seems to be a potential to create employment for young people albeit of a temporary nature.  I invite Deputies to consider whether there would be openings for these in their own constituencies. They include drama, arts and culture, social services, caring areas, meals on wheels, home help, running centres and so on.  I mention these as examples which offer opportunities for employment for young people with the assistance of local and community groups.  I invite Deputies to give serious thought as to whether there would be openings in these areas in their own constituencies.  If they identify some they should contact my office where they will receive every possible assistance.</P>
    <P>Another area which was the subject of comment is the co-ordination of manpower training and education services. This question received considerable attention during the last few months as evidenced by the interest expressed in the area in the earlier debate today.  It has been argued by some that due to the rapid expansion of youth programmes and other job creation measures the area of responsibility within the educational world and the world of training has become somewhat blurred.  There has been a degree of uncertainty about the roles of the Departments of Education and Labour and the manpower authorities <i>vis-à-vis</i> the overall concept of youth training.  Following the Government's concern over the perceived duplication and overlap in these areas, it was decided in December to appoint me Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Labour with additional responsibilities for the co-ordination of education and training.  Since then the matter has been further considered and it was decided that I should, in conjunction with the Ministers for Education and Labour, prepare a number of agreed recommendations as soon as possible.  The areas to <Col N="694" /> be covered will include the various manpower authorities &mdash; for example, AnCO, Youth Employment Agency, CERT and a number of other sections of the Department of Education.  I have already contacted a large number of organisations which have something to say in this area and requested their views and comments.  I have now received responses from almost all of them and it is my intention over the next week or two to embark on a series of meetings with those bodies and tease out their views on what is obviously an area of some sensitivity. My final examination will take into account the NESC consultancy report on manpower policy which is currently under way.  I have no doubt that will provide me with additional insights.  At the end of this comprehensive exercise, and having had the goodwill of all the bodies and agencies concerned, it will be possible to provide the State with a more efficient and cost effective delivery of service in the areas of education, training and manpower.</P>
    <P>It was with some satisfaction that I contributed to this debate.  The last year was one of solid achievement in the areas coming within my responsibility.  The additional resources made available in the Estimates and the budget means that we can expect further development in the years ahead and I look forward to coming back in 12 months' time to inform the House of the progress which has been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the area of the budget which had a very positive effect on the area for which I have responsibility.  I refer to the very enlightened decision to reduce VAT liability for the theatre and live performances. The reduction was from 23 per cent to 5 per cent.  The instrument by which this was done was section 4 of Budget Resolution No. 8, 1984.  As will be accepted, that would not be a good title for a show, play or review; but the decision had rave reviews by everyone concerned with it.  I had the rather exceptional experience of being in a theatre some two or three nights later and was <Col N="695" /> invited to go on the stage and take a bow for what the Government did for the theatre.  Naturally, I modestly turned down this offer but that did not stop the audience or the entire cast from giving me a standing ovation.  It must be unique for a Minister or Minister of State to be given what amounts to a curtain call &mdash; and an enthusiastic one at that &mdash; for his endeavours on behalf of a particular profession.</P>
      <P>The benefits of the decision have been acclaimed by all, the promoters, players, ancillary employees, trade unions and the members of the public who constitute audiences for the theatre and performing arts.  The arts critics and people in the media have been unstinting in their praise.  I am acutely aware of the prevailing financial difficulties which have constrained the legitimate and real ambitions of many of the most creative people engaged here in theatre and musical productions. These financial difficulties stem from a wide variety of causes such as inexperience; relocation of urban population centres away from city areas, making it more difficult to get to the theatre; parking problems and competition from imported TV and cinema.  There is also the general decline in disposable income as a consequence of the worldwide economic recession.  These are factors over which the Government can exercise limited influence.  However, we took action in an area where we could bring major relief and that was by reducing the burden of VAT on theatre and performing arts by lowering it from 23 per cent to 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated cost of this concession, which, I am glad to say, comes into effect on 1 March, will be about £1 million in a full year.  The benefit designated to the performing arts will bring about £½ million to the live theatre and other forms of entertainment will benefit by a similar amount.  That covers a wide range of musical shows, circuses, puppet shows and a whole variety of other things.  I have been assured that the measure will ensure that a number of venues which would otherwise have become uneconomic or &ldquo;gone dark&rdquo; the phrase within <Col N="696" /> the profession itself, will effectively remain viable and I am sure that is something which all Deputies will acclaim.</P>
    <P>I am also told that a further consequence is that a number of proposed increases in admission charges will now be deferred.  In fact the Abbey Theatre have already responded by cutting their admission charges for Monday evening productions by as much as almost 60 per cent.  All this is conducive to attracting audiences to come in greater numbers to enjoy the performing arts.  One of my greatest ambitions in this area is to see a greater flow of people to the theatre.  This is one practical way of doing it and helps to remove the notion that enjoyment and appreciation of the theatre and live arts are in some way the preserve of an affluent élite and not to be experienced by all our citizens.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from its contribution towards the maintenance of commercial viability of a number of public venues, this reduction will also help to secure the jobs of some very talented people.  We all know that many gifted performers who choose to remain in Ireland do so at a very considerable financial sacrifice.  It is not enough to give these people public acclaim, although, like politicians, they like it; they deserve and need a more prosaic and tangible expression of our goodwill, which is the reasonable prospect of regular and remunerative employment in their own profession here at home.  I am sure that our decision to reduce VAT will go a very long way towards underwriting the success of many creative productions in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Finance and I have been invited by theatre managements and trade unions to accept a bound volume of Christopher Fitzsimon's <i>Irish Theatre</i> in recognition of what has happened regarding VAT and what it has done for the profession generally.  I hope that this decision will ensure that there are many other glorious chapters in the sequel to <i>Irish Theatre</i>.  I have no doubt that it will have a major impact.</P>
    <P>I believe that the budget presented to the House on 25 January was the absolutely correct approach in the present <Col N="697" /> circumstances.  It was designed primarily to consolidate the substantial progress we have already made in correcting the many defects in the economy which we inherited from the previous administration. This budget will strengthen the economy and will instil a greater degree of confidence in the Government's approach to our economic problems than we have had for many years.  There is a great settling in taking place and an acceptance of the fact, albeit a grudging acceptance from the Opposition, that the Government are doing precisely the right thing and that it is now bearing fruit.  There is also an acceptance that the Government are set fair for lasting their full term and that their gradual approach of putting things right according to their well-designed plan will take effect.</P>
    <P>There are many positive features in the budget which I could speak on but I will pick out just a few to illustrate the sensible and determined approach which was adopted and which has been accepted in a very big way by the people at large. This was clearly demonstrated in the poll taken by <i>The Irish Times</i> immediately after the budget.  Many people perhaps violently disagree with some of the provisions but, overall, it has been exceedingly well received.  In recent years, one of the primary causes of our economic ills has been the lack of control over public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The question may be asked as to why it was so important to keep public spending under control and why there is so much concentration on our public finances.  The glib phrase being used about the Government is &ldquo;excessive concentration on bookkeeping&rdquo;.  There are, of course, many reasons but the obvious one is that of simple housekeeping.  If spending increases then there is an absolute necessity for taxation or borrowing or both to increase in line with higher spending commitments.  Interest charges on borrowing add to taxation so, in the final analysis, it is the taxpayer who must bear the burden.  There is no escape from that.  Higher taxes mean higher costs which, in time, reduce our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>As a trading nation we must export but we also import and competitiveness is an <Col N="698" /> essential aspect of our whole strategy.  As a result of lack of competitiveness, industries are priced out of the market, unemployment increases and more Government spending on unemployment benefit and assistance and so on becomes necessary and the vicious circle starts all over again.  It is clear, therefore, that one of the root causes of our problems is one over which we have full control.  We must, therefore, make every effort to curtail the increase in public spending to a level which can be financed without any further increases in taxation or borrowing. I do not think that theory can be seriously challenged in view of our recent history.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of evidence in the budget that this problem has been tackled.  For example, the provision for non-capital supply services in 1984, taking into account the extra expenditure announced in the budget, shows only a 10 per cent increase on 1983.  This increase compares with increases of 13 per cent, 19 per cent and 29 per cent in the previous three years and indicates that the real cost of Government services has been brought under control.  Expenditure as a percentage of GNP has been stabilised at approximately 48½ per cent of GNP.  We contrast that with the sharp increase from 36 per cent to 50 per cent of GNP between 1977 and 1982.  The stabilisation of current Government expenditure this year is a remarkable achievement considering the continuing upward pressure on services from a growing population and the extra provision necessary for unemployment, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>Taxation has also been stabilised.  Net new taxes this year amount to about one-quarter of the net extra taxation we had to impose in 1983 and the burden of taxation expressed as a percentage of GNP has been increased by less than one percentage point.  That is an example of considerable progress along the very definite course which the Government have chosen and are determined to stick to in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Again, by way of contrast, in the five years from 1977 to 1982, the burden of taxation increased by an average of <Col N="699" /> nearly one-and-a-half percentage points each year.  It went up from just over 27 per cent of GNP in 1977 to nearly 34½ per cent of GNP in 1982.  In addition, in those years there was also very heavy recourse to borrowing in order to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditure.  Borrowing for current expenditure expressed as a percentage of GNP more than doubled between 1977 and 1982.</P>
    <P>Control over public expenditure is therefore of vital importance and is a major aspect of this year's budget.  Public expenditure control does not mean that those dependent on social welfare should suffer and the Government have ensured that.</P>
    <P>A close analysis of the budget arithmetic will show that in controlling expenditure the Government concentrated on keeping down the cost of administration. Expenditure which is classified as Government consumption, that is, resources consumed by the administration in providing goods and services to the public, has been reduced in real terms, while resources transferred from one section of the population to the other have not suffered this reduction.</P>
    <P>In the budget this year an extra £70 million has been provided to improve social welfare benefits and allowances. That £70 million is equivalent to the yield from the increased excise duty on alcoholic drink, tobacco, hydrocarbons and road tax as well as the yield expected from the imposition of 8 per cent VAT on clothing from 1 May 1984.</P>
    <P>We would like to have given more to social welfare recipients but that would have involved even higher tax increases which would have made the tax burden even more intolerable.  The range and level of tax increases necessary to finance even a modest increase in social welfare payments is an indication of the limited room for manoeuvre available to the Government as a result of the extravagant spending and concessions made by previous administrations since 1977.</P>
    <P>A second area where the budget gave relief relates to the hard pressed taxpayer. The concession on the income tax <Col N="700" /> rates, bands, allowances and exemption limits will cost £40 million this year &mdash; again a substantial sum for a relatively modest change.  We would like to have been more generous but the constraints imposed by the extravagant policies I have mentioned dictated otherwise.</P>
    <P>I mention these social welfare and income tax concessions in particular because I want to point out that, although they are modest, their cost to the Exchequer this year will amount to little over half the increase in the cost of servicing the national debt this year.  The millstone of national debt accumulated in recent years is already well documented and I do not propose to dwell on it here, except to revert to my earlier point that the key to reduced debt and reduced taxation lies in greater control over expenditure.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this budget does nothing for employment.  I would like to refute that view.  The Taoiseach, in his speech on the budget, pointed out a number of specific measures designed primarily to improve employment opportunities. I would like to list these measures here again.  Additional resources are being made available for an employment support scheme to be provided by Córas Tráchtála.  There is to be tax relief for long-term venture capital in new enterprises. The potential impact of the latter measure has not yet been fully realised. It will have a dramatic effect on the willingness of people to put sums, perhaps modest sums, into industry and this will greatly help in the industrialisation drive by giving people a personal interest in bringing industry to their own area.</P>
    <P>There is also renewal of the corporation tax deduction in respect of additional employees as well as an extension of the initial allowance for plant and machinery and initial and annual allowances for industrial buildings.  These allowances were due to expire.  There is an extension of the industrial buildings provisions to laboratories used for analysis work in connection with mining and oil exploration.  There is an extension for a further three years of the allowances to encourage people to invest in the private sector in the construction of toll roads, bridges and multi-storey car parks. <Col N="701" /> These allowances had been due to expire on 31 March next.  There is the abolition of the clawback of stock relief once granted and a new system of stock relief on the basis of the opening stock shown on the accounts.  VAT on concrete is to be reduced on 1 March next from 23 per cent to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural sector for which my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, has primary responsibility in the western area, the AI and ground limestone reliefs which were due to terminate have been extended and a special provision has been made to help with the domestic co-operative marketing of potatoes. The extension of the AI and ground limestone reliefs will be of major benefit, particularly in the west, and it is a matter on which Deputies from the west were being strongly pressed.  I am delighted that it has been retained.</P>
    <P>In addition, the stamp duty provision designed to encourage the transfer of farms to young farmers has been extended for a further year, taking account of the fact of the difficulties which some young farmers have experienced in acquiring the necessary number of hours training to qualify for this relief.  This scheme has had a dramatic effect on the transfer of land during the two years in which it has been in operation.  A number of people are now waiting to avail of this who could not do so earlier because of difficulties over the training period.  Consciousness of the scheme had not spread sufficiently.  The scheme will have a very beneficial effect in getting farms into the hands of younger people who will be more enterprising and who will also have benefited from the educational aspect.  This might not have been the case but for the scheme.  Overall it is an excellent idea.  I would advocate that as many people as possible should avail of the scheme.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, an additional £8 million has been provided for road improvements.  The amount available for housing through SDA loans and the Housing Finance Agency has been increased substantially.  The Housing Finance Agency is proving to be a great <Col N="702" /> success.  I was glad to be able to announce this week in my local paper that a total of £1,690,000 has been provided for housing loans to Sligo County Council.  This will enable them to continue their scheme for housing private individuals at a level at least equal to that of last year, and perhaps in excess of it, despite the increase in prices.</P>
    <P>An additional £2 million has been provided for the repair of primary schools and this is badly needed.  My colleague, Deputy Brennan, will be aware of the damage caused by recent severe storms and the effect on prefabricated schools. Perhaps we should look again at the policy of erecting prefabricated school buildings since a question mark has been put over their viability.  Perhaps some more long-term possibilities should be explored.</P>
    <P>Funds have been provided for two projects of significant importance to major provincial centres, the Ringaskiddy deep-water berth and Galway airport. Regarding the latter project, the people of Galway must be congratulated on the magnificent contribution of £250,000 towards this project from their own resources.  I understand it may actually be increased.  This will provide what I regard as the missing link in the chain of airports around the country, and provide a facility for a viable airport in Galway city.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to see the provision for the deep water berth at Ringaskiddy, especially as harbours will shortly come under my jurisdiction in the Department of Communications.  I was delighted to see this injection.  It has been welcomed by all the Cork Deputies and the people in southern Ireland.  Its potential for increased activities in related industries is very significant in an area which has been badly hit by unemployment, as was my own area of Sligo.</P>
    <P>We had the closing of our flagship industry of Snia with the loss originally of 400 jobs, and perhaps at the time of closing about 320 jobs.  We are now actively pursuing a replacement industry.  We are beginning to dredge our own harbour with a grant of £625,000 provided in the Estimates.  I am very hopeful that we will <Col N="703" /> soon be able to get a replacement for the Snia industry.  We are trying very vigorously. I am not claiming any particular stake in this myself.  Deputy Brennan and his colleagues, and Deputy McCartin in conjunction with myself are working very strongly on this aided by the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  It is a very formidable team looking for a replacement industry.  We hope we will be successful.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position to announce a rather smaller industry in about three weeks' time to give employment to about 45 people.  This is not great in comparison with the loss of Snia but it will be some contribution towards the overall employment in the area.  I had great satisfaction in chasing it from the original idea through to getting foreign industrialists involved.  I hope to be able to announce it in a few weeks' time, although I never believe in any announcements about industries until the wheels are actually turning.</P>
    <P>Recently in Sligo we had the very sad experience of a fine American company who were about to set up an industry with employment for 190 people.  They closed before they opened, if that is not abusing the language.  I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle had a harrowing experience in Nenagh, but that was our experience on top of the closure of Snia, and it had a traumatic effect on the morale of the area.</P>
    <P>Tourism will benefit from the reduction in VAT on cars, caravans and boat hire and the special scheme to refund VAT on retail purchases by tourists exported in their personal luggage.  All of these measures together with careful and prudent planning of the public finances for 1984 will improve the employment prospects as the economy recovers from the recession.</P>
    <P>There is a great settling in of public opinion.  There is an acceptance that the Government are doing the right thing, not necessarily the popular thing.  It has never been our tradition to do the popular thing for the sake of transient popularity, or to hold on to power for power's sake.  Our tradition has been to do what was necessary in the national interest. <Col N="704" /> We have done that in the budget.  Over the coming years it will be proved to have been correct.  Although many of the measures we have had to introduce since taking office have been unpopular, our overall long-term policy will prove to be popular.  I forecast that when the next election is held on the first Wednesday in July 1987 this Government will be returned to office again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage of the budget debate I do not intend to go through all the features of the budget.  I should like to concentrate on two issues, one in the area of taxation, and the other in the area of manpower policy and employment policy in particular.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Finance has requested the planning board, when they report in the middle of this year, to include detailed recommendations on tax reform.  Over the past number of years our tax system has become more and more unworkable.  We have run into problems in the area of collection and enforcement.  We have run into high marginal tax rates.  I am not alone in saying that, nor are politicians.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote what the Comptroller and Auditor General said when he reported in 1981 on the issue of enforcement. Regarding the effectiveness of the sheriff and county registrar collection system, he noted that they did not represent the full contribution which such enforcement procedures should make towards safeguarding the collection of the far greater amounts under each tax head due on a current basis.  He went on to say that, without the threat of enforcement, receipts from current collections would drop.  That is a clear statement from a man with authority on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the enforcement side, our tax system is grinding to a halt.  When he reported in 1982 he entered into another sphere of the tax code, namely, the appeals system.  Having first drawn attention to the very considerable delays which can occur in the appeals system, he said it appeared that the appeals system was also resorted to in cases where the primary objective of the taxpayer was to delay or try to avoid paying tax.  He said <Col N="705" /> in such cases because of lack of co-operation on the part of the taxpayer, and because of the backlog of appeals on hand, a number of estimated assessments covering successive years could remain undetermined, leaving virtually no tax collectable during that period.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out the details of the defects in our tax code on the administration side.  Added to that are his reports year on year on the volume of outstanding tax. If you compare the two reports you can see how much tax was outstanding after 12 months had elapsed from the end of the tax year.  In May 1981 the outstanding taxes from the previous tax year and all years previously came to £967 million from the two key taxes, income tax from the self-employed and corporation tax. In 1982 that had gone up by 22 per cent to £1,178 million.  That is a clear indication to me that, although we are making some headway in tightening up on our collection procedures, we still have not solved the problem.  A growth of 22 per cent in the outstanding tax level is of concern to anyone dealing with the tax code.</P>
    <P>As we all know, all the balance outstanding is not likely to be collected.  This year for the first time the Comptroller and Auditor General made figures available on what he expected would be collectable. He suggested that a figure of £456 million of the £1,200 million odd outstanding and not in dispute.  This came under categories such as not disputed, under demand, awaiting enforcement, under enforcement, or in the arrears branch.  When he went on to say how much would actually be realised, the figure dropped from £456 million not in dispute to £150 million.</P>
    <P>We must question a collection system which allows such mythical figures to be generated in our system.  We do not know what the situation is.  Initially we have a figure of £1,200 million outstanding. Nearly £500 million of that is not disputed but, at the end of the day, we expect to recover only £150 million.  This is because we have evolved a system of tax collection that is completely inappropriate.  It is the system whereby the Revenue <Col N="706" /> Commissioners make assessments and send them out to the taxpayer and then enter into lengthy appeals procedures and enforcements and so on, being all the time out of pocket.</P>
    <P>I make a strong appeal to the Minister in the context of this review of taxation to look seriously at the system of self-assessment as an alternative.  The virtues of self-assessment are self-evident. Firstly, they free the tax administration from persuing every tax return that comes to them.  At present every tax return must be examined by an inspector. Under the self-assessment system very many of them would not be examined.  In the US this system has been in operation for many years and I understand that they examine in detail only 1 per cent of tax returns, yet they have a very effective collection system because the penalties for failure to co-operate are very high.</P>
    <P>Another obvious advantage that I perceive is that the self-assessment system lowers compliance costs not only for the Revenue Commissioners thus freeing their administration, but equally for the honest-to-God self-employed person who is trying to do things properly.  If he is allowed to carry out a single assessment of his tax liability, provide the information and the cheque and not get into these lengthy wrangles with the Revenue Commissioners about matters that to him often are very obscure and delaying tactics, that would be better for business as well as for efficient tax collection.  The final advantage of the self-assessment system that I will mention is that it gets in the tax revenue on the day appointed. The day is named, the Government declare tax returns, payment must be in on 5 April and the money will be in the Exchequer on the day appointed.  Under the present system, although returns are supposed to be in on 5 April, it is obvious from figures I have quoted that huge sums of tax do not come in even 20 months after the day appointed.  The Government are out of pocket all of that time and the Revenue Commissioners do not pursue interest on tax outstanding.</P>
    <P>No small part of our tax code problem is the enormous complexity that has grown in it.  I will run briefly through <Col N="707" /> some elements of our tax code which will illustrate the senselessness of it.  If the present code had been put to the Department of Finance ten years ago and they were told that we proposed introducing that code I am convinced that the Department would have said that it was totally unworkable and unrealistic.  I doubt some of the rejections of schemes being put forward in the tax reform area on either collection or tax reform on the grounds that they are unworkable considering the unworkable system we have already. Most members know the details of the tax code but I will run through a few of them briefly.  We have five systems of income tax; the PRSI system, the health levy, PAYE, the special income levy and the youth levy, all based on different thresholds, different ceilings and different rates.  In the case of the special income levy there is now a new cut-off point different from any other codes, that is people earning less than £5,000 pay no special income levy.  That code is enormously complex for anyone trying to administer it particularly since the PAYE system is administered by employers and much of its complexity falls directly on them and therefore, it is a disincentive to employment.  The PRSI area has 12 classes of contribution and within each of those 12 classes are three categories, making a total of about 35 different categories which must be administered. That is extremely complex for employers to administer.  The indirect tax area embraces six rates of VAT and numerous specific excise duties on top of all that.  A few years ago the objection to introducing low rates of VAT on certain goods was the unworkability of bringing in new tax rates.  In the last few years we have succeeded in creating quite a number of new rates and that argument has not been presented against them.  Therefore in indirect tax we have evolved a hopelessly complex tax system.</P>
    <P>In the income tax code we have a whole web of different tax allowances and small income exemptions.  If a man from Mars or a Department of Finance official who had been out of circulation for the last 20 years were to look into our tax code he <Col N="708" /> would say that it is hopelessly unworkable and that any Government suggesting such a code would be laughed out of court.  Through piecemeal reform and amendments over the years we have developed such an unworkable system. One of its worst features is the very irrational structure of marginal tax rates that have grown up in our code.  For example, under the small income exemption limit people on very small incomes can face marginal tax rates of 60 per cent.  That represents a huge disincentive to people in that part of the code to increase effort or take on work.  As stated by Donal de Buitléir, Secretary of the Taxation Commission, we have seen in the last few years quite a dramatic growth in the marginal tax rates.  He pointed out that, although the percentage of income retained by workers in Ireland was the average of that of all European countries at 70 per cent, we are unique in having 40 per cent of our taxpayers paying above the standard rate of tax and in having almost 10 per cent of them paying 60 per cent or over tax rates.  In short, by having a tax system with a number of allowances we have forced up the marginal tax rates so that people at the most moderate income levels are brought into the marginal high tax rates.  In a paper which he gave recently Donal de Buitléir showed the change in the last six years from 1968-79 to 1984-85.  The top of the basic 35 per cent band in 1978-79 was reached if your taxable income was £10,200 in present money terms.  The top of that band has come down by a full £6,000 to only £4,000.  The same applies to higher rates in the structure of the tax code. People on very moderate incomes are pushed up into facing tax rates of 45 per cent, 55 per cent and 60 per cent basic, not to talk of PRSI contributions and other levies on top of that.</P>
    <P>A start must be made now at the task of reducing firstly the complexity of the system, and, secondly, reducing the mechanisms that have diluted our tax base and created such high marginal rates with all that goes with them.</P>
    <P>I turn now to what I perceive as very significant inequities in the tax system that are of concern to me.  Those inequities <Col N="709" /> affect the position of married people with large families.  Secondly, I should like to deal with the discrimination which applies to people with different types of housing costs.  To illustrate the point about large families it is worth considering what has happened to the child tax allowance over the past ten years.  In current money terms the tax allowance in 1970 was £800 and in 1984, in current money terms, it has gone down £100. What that means in practical terms, if one takes the money in the pocket of the person on the standard tax rate, is that in 1970 the State gave to that taxpayer with a child £5.40 into his pocket but 14 years later, in 1984, the State gives 70p.  That is a dramatic erosion in the position of large families and it is an indictment of us all that it has happened in the last 14 years.  I grant that there have been increases in the universal childrens allowances over the period but those allowances have been far short of what is required to compensate taxpayers for the deterioration in the child tax allowance. If one adds the child tax allowance to the universal childrens allowance paid through the post office one will see that the situation has deteriorated since 1970 from a current value of £6.10 into one's pocket to less than £3.50 now.</P>
    <P>That is a serious inequity in our system. I do not believe it is fair that the family man at work should be given only £3.50, or thereabouts, from the State to support his child while, for example, a man who is sick or unemployed will be given £11.60 by the State.  I cannot see that the cost of supporting a child changes when one leaves work or that people on a low income who are at work should be treated in that way by the tax code.  The other insidious side effect is that in some cases persons who are out of work can gain no benefit from taking up employment if they have large families.  I should like to quote some examples I calculated.  A married man with four children taking up work because of the low benefit given to him under the tax code and the childrens benefit system for having children faces an effective tax rate of 85 per cent if he takes up a job at the average industrial wage, an effective tax rate of 101 per cent <Col N="710" /> if he takes up a job at three-quarters the average industrial wage and a massive effective tax rate of 134 per cent if he takes up the job at half the average industrial wage.  In practical terms that means if a man is considering a job at anything significantly under the average industrial wage and he has a family of four he would be better off staying unemployed.  That is an invidious situation to have in our tax code.</P>
    <P>The housing cost issue is one I am concerned about.  It is the old catch 22, people who are in private tenancies cannot get any allowance against their tax liability for the rents they pay.  That is in stark contrast to people who are either buying out their homes or have the benefit of a local authority tenancy and can get on the differential rents systems. Under this system people are left in an effective poverty trap.  As the tax code does to a person with a large family this treatment of housing costs does to people who are unfortunate enough not to be in a position to buy a house for themselves or to get on to the council or corporation tenancy lists.</P>
    <P>Those observations about the inequity in our tax code must add extra impetus to the Government's scheme for family income support for those at work and of the gradual extension of the tax relief for rents, which I am glad to say has been brought down where it is now available to those over 60.  Last year it was only available to those over 65.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of tax reform and the proposals of the Commission on Taxation.  One of the things about tax reform that is too easy to forget is that there will always be gainers and losers.  With the present massive tax burden the gainers will look at any concession as only getting their due while those who lose on their tax reform will feel deeply aggrieved.  That is a problem that causes tax reform to be difficult to embark upon, that the political perception of tax reform in any sort of radical way is not favourable, that unfortunately the gainers will not congratulate one for tax reform while the losers will be loud in their complaints.  However, I do not think that should deter us from tax <Col N="711" /> reform.  What it means is that we have to do our tax reform on a phased basis.  We should set clear objectives to be achieved over a number of years and pursue them systematically annually trying to minimise sudden changes that would affect some people adversely and, at the same time, be gradually dismantling an unduly complex and unworkable tax code.</P>
    <P>The commission have highlighted the major problems we must confront. Among those I mentioned they referred to the high marginal tax rates, the need to bring in tax credits, the need to reduce what they call tax expenditures that have leaked away our tax base, reform of the PRSI system and the whole question of indexation.  In other words, the regrettable way inflation has allowed the tax burden to surreptitiously creep up and that has been availed of by Governments in the last ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which we must consider in tax reform, reform in the context of the employment scenario that will face us for the next ten or 15 years. The lesson I draw from that is that we must question the whole basis of the PRSI system which faces the employer with a tax bill of more than 12 per cent directly paid and the employee with a tax bill of 5½ per cent plus the 3 per cent levy. In all it amounts to more than 20 per cent tax.  That is a straight payroll tax &mdash; in effect, a tax on employment.  When one couples that with the fact that they have leaned over backwards to subsidise capital through various tax concessions and subsidies one will see that we have built into our system a perverse incentive structure.  We are encouraging employers to employ capital and discouraging them from employing labour.  Looking at our tax codes one would swear that we were a capital abundant economy with scarce manpower.  The reality is that we have ample manpower and a lot of it not fully occupied.</P>
    <P>We must examine the whole basis of the PRSI system not only from the fact that it is a straight tax on employment but also on the equity side.  It has always been said that the PRSI system is a funding system, that people are funding benefits <Col N="712" /> from which they gain.  However, we have now introduced means-tested basic rates of social payments on the premium of the benefit rates and the rates which are paid out of the PRSI code are only tiny.  They are marginally over the basic rates available to anyone.  Equally, the pay-related benefit is only a marginal sum.  If one looks at those two together one can reckon that about one-third of all contributions to the fund are paid out as payments over and above basic rates of social welfare payments.  I question on that basis whether the Social Insurance Fund is in any sense an insurance fund at all.  Equally, there is no allowance for what one might call in the car insurance area no claims.  There is no such thing in the Social Insurance Fund.  Your entitlements are always the same no matter how good your employment record.  We must question the PRSI system on these two bases and also on the basis that there is no distinction in the PRSI code for family commitments.  We have reached the stage where this code is a significant burden on families.  There is no allowance for the number of children, mortgages or any of the other charges the income tax code generally allows in order to achieve equity.  For all those reasons we must question the PRSI system but particularly on the grounds that it is a straight tax on employment.</P>
    <P>The second issue we must look at is the proposal made a number of years ago in an NESC report, that was a proposal of a negative income tax, a system that would consolidate social welfare and the tax code into one system.  When that report issued calculations were made as to what it would cost.  Quite detailed calculations showed it was a workable proposal. It is high time to have another look at this.  Unfortunately, the taxation commission did not address themselves to that issue; they dismissed it in a few lines. It is important that the planning board and the Minister address that question once again.</P>
    <P>By consolidating the social welfare code and the tax code into a simple tax and payments system, we can achieve not only administrative economies in the social welfare area but, at one stroke, we <Col N="713" /> can achieve what is being attempted piecemeal by many other schemes, that is to try to allow people who are unemployed to avail of whatever opportunities present themselves.  The kind of schemes I have in mind which were trying to do that are the enterprise allowance scheme, a very sensible scheme; the family supplement scheme, which will allow people to take up work opportunities and not be disadvantaged; training allowances and the new proposals mentioned by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to allow the unemployed to engage in work and the many schemes envisaged by the Youth Employment Agency to allow young people to engage in community work.</P>
    <P>Many of these schemes are expensively administered and have created administrative nightmares, particularly the danger of displacement effects, unfair competition and so on, and the many other problems which have grown up around these schemes.  The simple measure of a negative income tax would be an advantage because if people did only a few hours work each week they would still get their social welfare payments and get some advantage from the hours worked. That type of tax code <i>cum</i> social welfare system would allow us to avoid a lot of the administrative expense in devising schemes to do just that and we have been doing our best to find such schemes.  In my view it is time to have another look at this proposal which was made in 1977. This could become the vehicle for simplifying the tax code and making it fairer in many areas, including those I mentioned earlier&mdash;the disadvantaged, large families and people with housing commitments. It can have another advantage because it could stop the drift into the black economy.  That has occurred because of the high tax rates and the fact that people cannot get welfare payments if they take up even the smallest part-time job as they would be regarded as unavailable for work.  As I said, it is time we took a serious look at this proposal. The attractiveness I see in that proposal is that it would mean equality in the treatment of men and women by the tax and payments systems.  This is something <Col N="714" /> which we are committed to achieving by the end of this year under EEC rules.</P>
    <P>I hope the publication of the planning board's report will be the start of a very realistic attempt to change our tax code and to remove the hopeless complexities which have grown into the code over the years.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal now with the strategy pursued in this year's budget.  Fianna Fáil have been at sixes and sevens in their response to this budget.  At one stage they advocated the classic pump prime. Earlier in the year when we had an economic debate the Leader of the Opposition spoke of the need to sink more money into public spending and the need to reduce tax rates selectively in areas that would generate more tax revenue. Unfortunately, that is in conflict with his criticism of the Government for failing to make greater inroads into the Exchequer borrowing requirements.  You cannot advocate more borrowing, more spending and lower taxation at the same time and that basic confusion appears to be in the Opposition's approach to this budget.</P>
    <P>They forget we are a small open economy with 55 per cent of all domestic demand going on imports.  We are an economy with a massive Government sector.  As a share of GNP Government spending is up to 75 per cent, if we include social welfare contributions.  That is a huge burden.  The analysis behind what Deputy Haughey said, where a bucket of Government spending would prime the pump and the well would gush forth, does not hold in this economy, as we learned to our cost in 1977.</P>
    <P>We have to examine Government which is the dominant absorber of resources in the economy, the cause of high tax rates and many of the problems which have grown up in our economy. The need is not for a little more public spending but for an overwhelming review of the programmes we are taking on.  Last year's publication of the comprehensive review of public spending is a very welcome change.</P>
    <P>Despite the commitment by many Ministers for Finance that we are on the road to fundamental review of various programmes and that from now on we will <Col N="715" /> examine programmes root and branch, successive Ministers believed that this was what they were trying to achieve, and that this was the way forward.  Yet, every year we are back to the same situation in which when Estimates are published they do not seem to fulfil the hopes that Ministers expressed a year earlier; that next year would be significantly different in the way we approach spending.  I am afraid that 1984 has been of the same ilk. The Estimates did not fulfil the promise in the review published in that little blue book during the course of last year &mdash; Comprehensive Public Expenditure Programmes. I do not believe the Estimates fulfil the hopes that raised.  In many areas that book &mdash; in particular I can recall the fisheries area and the manpower training area &mdash; raised fundamental questions about the way in which public spending was being conducted.  Without making recommendations it clearly pointed the way in which economies could be effected.  Yet when the Estimates are published we tend to be back in the same system of trying to contain the level of public spending on a global basis without examining the fundamentals of different types of expenditure.  I do not know where the fault lies.  I would hope that during 1984 we would be able to make greater strides in that area.  Perhaps the problem lies in our system of Cabinet responsibility in which there are Ministers trying to defend the interests of specific Government Departments, not acting, if you like, in unison, trying to ascertain where is money being used less fruitfully and where is it being used more fruitfully.</P>
    <P>Another common cry from the Opposition in criticising this budget was the claim that not enough was being done for employment.  The last speaker, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, pointed to the very considerable number of things being done for employment.  I believe the criticism that not enough is being done for employment is far too simplistic.  Just to cite some of the schemes at present available, there is the employment incentive scheme to encourage manufacturers to take on <Col N="716" /> extra employees.  There are 50 per cent grants for feasibility studies of people who are considering taking on new employment schemes.  There are capital grants and the most favourable tax regime in Europe for manufacturing industry.  We have 100 per cent training grants for people considering taking on new employment.  We have a national placement service and a national training board.  Between those two agencies about £200 million of State money is being expended.  We have a new enterprise allowances scheme, the new community youth programme administered by the Youth Employment Agency and the new scheme for capitalising pay-related benefits. We have Córas Tráchtála, the IDA and all the other bevy of State agencies. It is far too simplistic to say that the Government are not trying to do enough for employment.  The response should not be that we should pile up more and more schemes but rather that we ask ourselves what is going wrong: why are we not getting the sort of response from the huge number of schemes we are now administering?</P>
    <P>I believe the greatest single weakness in this country is our failure to evaluate and formulate policy in Government Departments.  Indeed, I sometimes wonder do Government Departments have the capacity to think in policy terms at all.  I should like to deal with a specific one that is under the aegis of the Department of Labour.  In the manpower policy area &mdash; and that would include employment schemes, training schemes, the National Manpower Service and so on &mdash; we do not have any coherent set of policies at all.  It has grown very rapidly over the years and has now reached the stage at which our manpower policy is a massive State industry expending approximately £200 million of taxpayer's money.  It has grown particularly rapidly in the last five years or so.  Yet we do not have any clear policy statement.  As far as I know the last White Paper on manpower policy dates back to the sixties. Just to cite one example in the United Kingdom &mdash; and I do not claim that the United Kingdom is a shining light in this <Col N="717" /> respect &mdash; they have had two White Papers in the last five years on the issue of manpower policy.</P>
    <P>There is enormous need to think through what we are trying to achieve in this manpower area.  Over the last five years there have been piecemeal additions on an enormous scale &mdash; for example the work experience programme, the enterprise allowance scheme, the Youth Employment Agency, all desirable in their own right and all having a place in a proper manpower policy.  But what has happened, as we all know, is that various schemes and agencies have got into a hopeless mess with an overlap in the area of training and courses.  Equally there is duplication in assessing young people leaving school.  The National Manpower Service do it, there are the Civil Service Commission and Local Appointments Commission doing it, as are AnCO.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that there are young people hopping from one scheme to another, they engage in a work experience programme, they engage in a training course, perhaps they then get back onto another training course.  The reason for that is that we have not set out a clear direction from the Department of Labour as to where the different agencies should be going to prevent people availing of the services of a whole lot of different ones while others may go unhelped altogether.</P>
    <P>The independent agencies, particularly AnCO, have become autonomous from the Department of Labour.  I do not believe that the Department have the capacity to direct policy in the case of AnCO.  Perhaps part of the reason is that the Act setting up AnCO was too generally framed.  It appeared to give AnCO a very general remit in the training area, stretching right back into the educational area, which has caused a lot of the problems in the sort of operation in which they have become involved.  Another agency set up recently is the Youth Employment Agency.  I question whether they are in a position to co-ordinate a series of other independent State agencies. After all, ultimately it is the Minister who must declare policy for those State agencies.  We are bound to have problems <Col N="718" /> if the Youth Employment Agency is trying to co-ordinate agencies answerable to the Minister.  We have seen that sort of problem emerge in the course of the year, that the Youth Employment Agency is frustrated to some degree.</P>
    <P>The time is clearly opportune for the Minister for Labour to declare that he is the person who dictates policy, and to do so through the publication of a White Paper in order to try to clear up the whole of this manpower area.  There are fundamental questions that must be faced urgently in that area.  The first is to draw a clear distinction between two types of training.  One is what people have described as the demand-type versus the supply-type.  In simple terms what it means is that the demand-type trains people for specific vacancies, equips people to take up a specific employment opportunity.  That is a very different type of training from one aimed primarily at young people who have been disadvantaged by the educational system, who are in need of special help and remedial training. We do not have that sort of distinction in our policy at present.  Even within the Department of Labour there is some confusion.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I had a question down to the Minister for Labour when those two courses were lumped together as if there were no distinction to be drawn between them.  There must be a distinction drawn between the way one chooses people for those two different courses and between the tests of success for them. For example, one could not expect a remedial course to have the same success rate as, say, a hard technological course. There must be a clear distinction drawn between the content of those courses. Therefore, there is need for a White Paper to distinguish clearly between those two training areas, to ascertain who we want to go into the different areas and what priorities we want to achieve in those areas.</P>

      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

He appealed against the disallowance of unemployment assistance but an appeals officer also decided that his means exceeded the statutory limit.  He applied to have his means reviewed and his case was referred to a social welfare officer for further investigation. Inquiries have now been completed and the case is in transit to a deciding <Col N="683" /> officer in headquarters for a reassessment of his means on the basis of the report of the social welfare officer. His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined in the light of the outcome.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat-rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the weekly sum of pay-related benefit, flat-rate unemployment benefit and income tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of the net average weekly earnings of a claimant.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of the maximum rate of unemployment benefit payable to him £65.60 weekly.  However, the 85 per cent limit applicable to him is £52.46 and as the weekly flat-rate unemployment benefit payable to him exceeds this amount pay-related benefit is not payable to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on disability benefit the person concerned was entitled to flat-rate benefit at a rate of £65.60 a week and pay-related benefit of £23.30 a week.  Unlike the 85 per cent wage-stop in the case of persons claiming unemployment benefit where it is related to earnings in the current tax year, in the case of the 80 per cent limit that applies to persons on disability benefit, earnings in a previous income tax year are used.  The claimant's level of <Col N="684" /> earnings in the relevant tax year were such that the 80 per cent limit did not affect his rate of benefit.</P>

      <P>The person concerned exhausted her maximum entitlement of 312 days unemployment benefit on 2 October 1983.  To requalify for unemployment benefit she would require to have a minimum of a further 13 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate rate of contribution has been paid.  Her entitlement to further benefit from 3 October 1983 could not be determined until inquiries to establish the insurability of her part-time employment had been completed.  These inquiries have recently been completed and a deciding officer has decided that her part-time employment is insurable for occupational injuries benefit only and does not provide cover for unemployment benefit.  It is open to her to appeal against this decision and she may obtain a form for this purpose from her local employment office.</P>

      <P>The unemployment benefit scheme is a statutory scheme to provide income for insured persons during periods of unemployment.  It is part of the social insurance system which is financed mainly by employers and <Col N="690" /> employees with a residual contribution by the Exchequer.  The Social Insurance Fund has specific functions and the income of the fund cannot be used for purposes other than those contained in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The funds to be provided to local authorities and the Office of the Public Works are determined in a different context and subject to available resources. Deficiencies in the funds available to these organisations are matters for consideration by the agencies directly concerned.  The use of the social insurance funds in the manner proposed would involve a major change in the role of the fund and there are no plans at present for the fund to take over functions which are the responsibility of other agencies.</P>
