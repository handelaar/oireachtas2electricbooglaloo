      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 19 were taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am opposed to these amendments because they will not do anything to improve the section.  &ldquo;Within one hour of detention&rdquo; allows an undue flexibility as a replacement for &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Without delay&rdquo; is unworkable if it means absolutely without delay.  Some Deputies interpreted it as without reasonable delay but that does not advance the situation or make any improvement in it.  As soon as practicable means immediately unless there is a practical difficulty.</P>
      <P>As regards persons under 17 years of age, the Garda regulations and the present law make it necessary for the parent or guardian to be present.  There is no incentive for the Garda to delay informing them because questioning cannot take place until they turn up.  That is governed by existing law.  I do not see any difficulty there.  In the case of people over 17 years of age &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; is a phrase with which the courts are familiar.  They have interpreted it previously and that interpretation is immediately unless there is a practical difficulty. Of course there will be practical difficulties on certain occasions and questioning will have to commence as soon as a person is arrested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments have been adequately debated.  Before coming to the House I read the record and every possible angle of this section as regards these amendments has been discussed.  I promised the House that I would look at the question of how an arresting garda decides whether someone is under or over 17 years of age.  I have said that I will have to look at that, and there is an added urgency to it now since I have given a commitment that section 3 will not apply to children below a certain age, be it 12 or 13 years.  The same difficulty will arise on the margin of how the absolute age can be established and of what will be the consequences of a garda treating somebody under 17 as if they were over 17, even if he made a bona fide <Col N="196" /> mistake about it.  I have promised the House I will look at these points and come back on Report Stage on them. Otherwise everything worth saying about this section has been said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We regard &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; as reasonable to cover the situation and consequently we are not supporting these amendments.  We explained this in greater detail on the last occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not withdrawn.  The main point I want to make in support of these amendments is that the main body of the Ó Briain Report, signed by all three members, argued that a person should not be interrogated until a solicitor had been contacted and given time to reach the Garda station.  It was suggested that at least one hour should be allowed to give the solicitor time to reach the station.  We felt, in view of the fact that there was no such provision in this Bill, that once a person is detained he is liable to be questioned from the beginning without the presence of a solicitor, that it was only reasonable to try to ensure that a solicitor would be contacted at the earliest possible moment and that one hour would be a reasonable time to allow.</P>
      <P>Question: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
      <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where the member in charge of the Garda Síochána station has been given the name of a solicitor pursuant to subsection (1), or subsection (2), fails, after reasonable efforts to do so, to contact the named solicitor, he shall give the person <Col N="197" /> detained the opportunity of naming another solicitor, and he shall cause any solicitor so named to be notified accordingly as soon as practicable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are trying to cover the situation where a named solicitor is not available or cannot be contacted when sought and the detained person should be given an opportunity to get a second solicitor &mdash; and perhaps even to indicate that the intention of the House is that if a second solicitor is not available, an effort should be made to provide another solicitor.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 62, page 19, of the Ó Briain Report reads:</P>
    <P>The Law Society delegation which appeared before us regarded as feasible a scheme whereby a panel of &ldquo;duty solicitors&rdquo; could be maintained.  Solicitors on the panel for any given day would be available to attend at a local Garda Station when a prisoner requests the advice of a solicitor but is unable to name a solicitor of his own. A feasibility study of the subject should be undertaken forthwith.  We so recommend.</P>
    <P>If a duty roster of solicitors was available this would overcome the problem where an individual was unable to name a solicitor, or to name one who was available. The intention of this amendment is to say there should be a second option and the spirit is that reasonable steps should be taken to ensure a solicitor is made available and that a reasonable opportunity should be given in a practical sense to provide a solicitor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This amendment is aimed at providing for the case where the solicitor named by the detained person cannot be contacted.  In that event it could be said that the right of reasonable access to a solicitor, which every detained person has, was not being given to him unless the detained person were given the opportunity of naming another solicitor and of having him notified as soon as practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be some sympathy with the principle of the amendment.  There is a somewhat analogous provision in the <Col N="198" /> proviso to subsection (2) of this section, which deals with detained persons under 17 years of age.  The proviso deals with the eventuality that the member in charge is unable to communicate with a parent, guardian or spouse of the person detained and provides in that case that the person under 17 years of age should be treated as if he was an adult.  There will be a responsibility on the Garda to inform a solicitor.  This alternative provision, in instances where the designated people are not available in the first instance, is in the section for persons under 17 years of age.</P>
    <P>I have a certain amount of misgivings as to how far we should try to cover all possibilities like this in terms of statute. For example, if the Garda cannot contact the named person or the first solicitor, should the obligation extend until they eventually get a solicitor who can come? Should it be a second chance or should it continue?  There are difficulties in this, but I agree with the spirit of the amendment. I will examine it to see if I can make provision for it either by way of an amendment on Report Stage or under the regulations which may be more appropriate.  This could be provided for in the proposed regulations where there would be a <i>modus operandi</i> that the right of access to a solicitor would not be nullified by the fact that the first solicitor contacted was not available.  I will come back to this on Report Stage, although I agree with the spirit of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this amendment the question arises that a person detained may not be aware of the name of any solicitor.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us how such a situation would be dealt with by the Garda.  Under the section the person detained is informed of his right to consult a solicitor but a number of people detained, perhaps for the first time, in a Garda station would not have the name and address of a particular solicitor. The Ó Briain Report suggests a duty panel of solicitors.  Could the Minister indicate if he has any intentions in that direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I see the <Col N="199" /> difficulty there.  On the question of the panel of duty solicitors, which I understand has been suggested by the Incorporated Law Society, I should like that society to develop that proposal further. Are they willing to put forward a duty panel of solicitors as a public service in the interests of justice, a list of names being made available in Garda stations? Detainees could then choose someone from the list who would be available on a voluntary basis.  I am not sure of the nature of the proposal and should like the Incorporated Law Society to develop it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The original point which I raised with the Minister concerns a person detained not being aware of a solicitor and not having a name or address of one.  In what way can the rights of that person be protected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I think that it would be very unusual for a person not to know the name of a solicitor.  For someone under 17 years of age there would be a difficulty but there is also the obligation in that case to inform the parent or guardian of the right of access to a solicitor.  It would thus be in the hands of the guardian or parent.  The vast majority of adults, while not perhaps being on terms of friendship with their solicitors and not knowing them very well, would certainly be able to name a solicitor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather late in the evening, around 10 p.m. two weeks ago when we were debating Second Stage, I made a number of references to solicitors and the position of people detained which are relevant to this amendment.  I do not think that the points which I raised have yet been clarified.  I should like some <Col N="200" /> clarification, first in relation to Deputy Woods' amendment with which I have a great deal of sympathy.  If the spirit of this legislation is to be upheld, if someone seeks the assistance of a solicitor who is uncontactable, the Garda should have a duty to seek to make contact with an alternative solicitor named by the detainee. However, much of this will be theoretical, particularly with regard to young people.  Under the present criminal legal aid system, one is entitled to apply for criminal legal aid if one cannot afford to pay for legal advice.  That would include virtually the generality of persons under 17 years who may be detained. One is not, however, entitled to apply for free criminal legal aid until a charge with an offence is brought in the courts.  If I am detained in a Garda station pursuant to the provisions of this Bill, I can seek assistance from a solicitor, be it the original solicitor named by me, or some alternative solicitor under Deputy Wood's amendment.  If I do not have the financial wherewithal to pay for the solicitor's services, I shall not receive assistance from him or be entitled to independent legal advice, the reality being that the criminal legal aid system does not come into operation at that stage.</P>
      <P>We are now providing for a somewhat different situation.  I am concerned &mdash; and the Minister has not yet responded in this connection &mdash; that we examine whether the system can be extended to deal with this difficulty.  The idea of duty solicitors to which the Minister referred&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If we do not keep to the amendments before the House, Deputy Shatter, we shall never make any progress.  I suggest that the Deputy confine himself to the amendment. Perhaps what he is now saying would be more relevant on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that I am making is in the context of this amendment. Whilst it is well intended and comes within the spirit of what is intended, the reality is that it is irrelevant if one does not have the financial means to pay for the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="201" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is on the section generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We can go into this in detail when it comes to debating the section in full.  However, I should be anxious to hear the Minister's observations at this stage on this aspect, in particular in the context of the decision delivered in what was known as the Healy-Foran case in the Supreme Court back in 1976, when it was effectively decided that young people who are charged with criminal offences are entitled to free legal aid if they do not have the financial means to pay for it.  It would seem that that case and the judicial pronouncements in it could be extended to this area.  While I accept Deputy Woods's amendment, being certainly in favour of the spirit of it, I am not yet satisfied that we are dealing adequately with the problem of providing legal assistance.</P>
      <P>Secondly &mdash; and the Chair will obviously stop me if he considers this more appropriate to the generality of the section &mdash; in the context of a solicitor attending, be he the originally requested or another solicitor, there is no clarity in this Bill as to what happens when the solicitor attends at the Garda station. This will give rise to cases within cases and ongoing litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with a certain point.  It suggests that if solicitor A, whom the detained person has sought, is not available or cannot be contacted, an opportunity should be given to that person to name another solicitor.  That is all that is involved here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be of some help to clarify what happens after a solicitor has been contacted and when he or she arrives in the Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The only other point which I would make has been accepted by the Minister in the context of the Garda code of conduct.  When a request is made to have access to a solicitor and <Col N="202" /> an attempt is made to get the original solicitor, if the Minister adopts on Report Stage Deputy Woods's amendment it should be important that the time scale of these matters be properly logged in the station, so that there is no dispute as to the time of the request and the speed with which the Garda acted upon it. Possibly some other of my comments would be more appropriate when we are debating the section in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Deputies have also remarked, this could be an academic exercise.  There is much evidence to show that most people detained would not know the name of one solicitor, much less a second.  Am I to take it that unless the persons detained can afford to pay for the solicitor's services, until they are charged they do not get free legal aid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made reference to the Incorporated Law Society perhaps drawing up a rota.  Are we to take it that the only provision of solicitors for those who do not know of a solicitor or cannot afford one would be through the philanthropic offer of the Incorporated Law Society by way of such a rota?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with a detained person who does know the name of a solicitor and who requests that solicitor, but that solicitor cannot be contacted.  It suggests that he be given the opportunity of naming another solicitor.  If some provision is to be made for someone who does not know the name of a solicitor, this is not the occasion on which to deal with that.  That would be when we are discussing the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I purposely refrained from getting into a discussion on the duty solicitors and their roster.  I raised the point the last day that the cost of a solicitor for many of the people who would be involved here would be a major factor.  I agree this is a matter for the section as a whole.  I welcome the Minister's approach to this and his assurance that he will have a look at this and consider it for Report Stage.  He mentioned putting forward a list from which such a person could be drawn in the first instance.  The question of the naming of a person is relevant because, in order to name a first or a second person, you have to know where they come from.</P>
      <P>The Ó Briain Report said that a feasibility study on this should be undertaken. It is regrettable that that has not been done.  I accept the Minister's suggestion that it is something the Law Society should consider and put proposals to the Minister.  This is a very important feasibility study because I have to agree in selecting a name and looking for a second name there is a great danger that the knowing of a name becomes a very important aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>As I understand the Deputy's amendment, it is put down to safeguard a person who might give the name of a solicitor whom he wanted to consult and where a lot of time was taken up in trying to locate this solicitor and no further steps were taken to get a solicitor.</P>

      <P>That is quite true.  When a person is detained knowing where to look or even to suggest a second solicitor arises even in relation to the amendment. I would like to clear up that point now because we will have to come back on it otherwise when discussing the section. The naming of a solicitor is an important matter and the Minister might consider this when he is considering the amendment on Report Stage.  In certain areas it is very difficult for an individual to name a solicitor.  The Minister said most people will know a solicitor and will be able to name one.  I assure him that in my experience in certain areas there is no question of people knowing a solicitor unless they have been in contact with the law previously.  There is a problem in that area.</P>
      <P>Certain solicitors gain notoriety and become extremely well known as people to contact as solicitors.  Most of the contacts seem to go to one or two solicitors. This seems to indicate that in looking for the first one or the second one, as proposed in the amendment, it is important to have a list which people can have put to them from which they can have a reasonable selection.</P>

There is a danger that some of these points will be lost as we go on to discuss the broader issues of the section.

      <P>The person may name a solicitor.  It would be out of order for the Chair to get into an argument about the merits of the amendment.  I want to assure the Deputy I am not doing that.  The amendment visualises the detained person naming a solicitor.  If that person cannot be contacted within a reasonable time the amendment invites the person to name another solicitor.</P>

I do not want to get into an argument with the Chair on that but I do not want to be put into a position where I am being unduly restricted.  It does not matter in this instance but it might matter in another one.  We can take that up in a more general way on the section.  The Minister has been quite open in his approach to this amendment.  He recognises some of the problems and we can talk about some of the other problems which may be associated with the intention of this amendment when we are discussing the section.  I accept the Minister's approach to it and I am prepared to withdraw the amendment on the assurances which the Minister has given to us in relation to Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In both amendments, especially those put down in the names of Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa, we have ranged fairly widely over the section.  Deputy Shatter has raised a number of points which I dealt with previously.  We have now spoken about the nomination of an alternative solicitor.  I do not have any proposal to extend the criminal legal aid system to persons in detention before they are charged.  It is a very costly system.  I have serious doubts about the efficiency of the system at the moment and one could be critical about the operation of it.  We should not proceed with the section on <Col N="206" /> the basis that everybody will want a solicitor. People have the entitlement to contact a named person.  I believe quite frequently the named person will be the option which people will opt for.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that the section is in ease of the detainee.  There is no right of access to a solicitor being given in this section because that right exists already.  The section is giving the person the right to be informed of the right of access.  The same applies to parents or guardians.  It is not a question of a new right being given under the section to a detainee where the parents or guardian have to be informed.  That right exists already.  The section states that a person is to be informed of that right.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand why Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa are opposing the section as a whole because, regardless of what one may feel about the details of the section, it is in ease of the detainee and of the person in custody rather than in ease of the Garda Síochána.  I do not understand why the whole section is being opposed.</P>
      <P>With regard to what happens when a solicitor attends, the existing case law covers that and it is a point which Deputy Shatter has made.  As I pointed out previously, an arrested person has a right of reasonable access to a solicitor.  The section is not conferring a new right but is recognising an existing right.  It is ensuring that the person is notified of it. Although it has not been definitively settled by the courts the probability is that the right is a constitutional one.  Accordingly, refusal on request to allow reasonable access would probably make the person's detention unlawful.  The courts have held that what is &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in this context must be construed having regard to all the circumstances of each individual case particularly as to the time at which access is requested and the availability of the legal adviser sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relevant cases where the right of access to a legal adviser was considered were the <i>People (DPP)</i> v. <i>Madden and others</i> (1977 Irish Reports, page 336) and <i>The State (Harrington)</i> v. <i>The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and others</i> (The High Court, 14 December 1976, <Col N="207" /> unreported).  In the latter case it was also decided that access to a legal adviser must be allowed in privacy and out of hearing of any member of the Garda Síochána. There is a right of access under existing case law.  We should not proceed as if the courts did not exist.  If the courts in their wisdom decide subsequently that a person's rights were breached under this section, that difficulties were placed in their way and their right of access to a solicitor was not provided for, the redress is in the court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes raised the question of the criminal legal aid system.  Legal aid is very expensive and there are competing demands on the Exchequer &mdash; some of them in the legal area, many in the social area in general.  The amount of money which could be spent here might be difficult enough to justify.  I have asked solicitors what their advice would be and invariably the advice which a solicitor gives to a detained person it &ldquo;say nothing&rdquo;. It is not as if the solicitor gives a long lecture to the detained person.  The regular formula is &ldquo;Do not answer any questions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The statistics quoted by Deputy Woods of the experience in Great Britain would suggest that persons detained under section 3 of this Bill could be detained for very short periods indeed and that it would be the exception that people would be detained for the full stretch.  One or two hours would be quite reasonable.  I would expect that persons under the age of 17 detained would contact their parents or guardians or, if married, their husbands or wives.  I am sure it will be mostly wives who will be called upon.  If they are over 17 years of age they can contact a named person or a solicitor.  I appreciate the difficulties of somebody who does not know a solicitor and Deputy Skelly made a suggestion as to how we could overcome it.  Many of the details which would improve the situation could be dealt with by way of statutory regulation rather than amendment of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Minister in relation to the section as a <Col N="208" /> whole but I would emphasise that the minimum is to ensure that the judges' rules are upheld since they give protection to those under 17 years of age.  We are faced with the difficulty that there is a basic inequality in this section.  There is a major flaw which it is difficult to put right due to the problem of providing legal aid for people who are poor and do not have the money to pay for it.  They say about going to court that the doors are as open as the doors of the Ritz Hotel. The legal aid system covers a person once he or she is charged, but now people will be detained without being charged.  If they have a reasonable income they can handle it and pay for someone to advise them.  I have made the point earlier that the need will arise only in a relatively small proportion of cases because most cases will be dealt with fairly quickly.  We are talking about the 5 or 10 per cent of cases where people would need to be advised of their constitutional rights.  If they are not so advised there could be further difficulties, even for the Garda. There is a gap because of the extension of powers of detention for a period when a person is not charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister can deal with this.  I will be looking at the possibility of an amendment on Report Stage to ensure that adequate provision would be made for legal aid to poor or disadvantaged persons so that they could have equal access to the services of a solicitor, as envisaged in the Bill.  If we accept this section as it stands people will not have equal access to a solicitor, during detention.  Those who have the money and the knowledge can contact a solicitor who may just telephone the station and make inquiries.  That can be very valuable.  Things can flow fairly straightforwardly after that.  We are dealing with a potential detention for 20 hours, although we accept that most detentions will be for a short duration.  The section is designed to provide equal access to a solicitor but in practice it would be unequal.  I accept the Minister's difficulty in that the enlargement of the legal aid scheme could mean that solicitors would be called up for no reason and money would be wasted.  One has to set that <Col N="209" /> against the basic inequality for the person who has less money.  Such a person comes off second best and that must worry us, even though it would apply in only a small percentage of cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister provided us recently with reference material in regard to a case which is relevant to this section, the case of Detective Garda Travers and a minor. This was a judgment delivered on 24 February 1984 by Mr. Justice Finlay and it is worth elaborating on it.  In that case the defendant at the time of the alleged offence was 14 years.  Apparently he was arrested in the presence of his father and was brought to the Garda station and cautioned.  However, he was not informed of his right to have either of his parents present at any interview between him and gardaí.  The prosecuting garda who had effected the arrest and who had taken the statement stated in evidence that he did not wish to have the father present during the questioning or during the taking of the statement for fear that the father might attempt to obstruct justice.</P>
    <P>One of the questions that arose was whether a garda is obliged before questioning a young person of 14, in addition to the usual caution given to all accused persons, to further caution or inform that young person that he or she is entitled to have a parent or a guardian present during the questioning or the taking of any statements.  In the decision afterwards the statement made was as follows:</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that in relation to a person of 14, unless there are practical impossibilities arising, that if a person of about that age is suspected of a commission of a crime he should not be questioned or interrogated except in the presence of a parent or parents of some person of an adult kind who is looking after him as a guardian.</P>
    <P>Further on it was stated:</P>
    <P>It is not intended to be an inflexible rule nor under any circumstances could proof of non-compliance with it be said automatically to exclude as admissible evidence the making of a statement by a suspected young person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> The statement contained the following comment:</P>
    <P>It would also seem to me that a prudent course on the part of an investigating garda in such circumstances would be to secure the attendance of a parent.</P>
    <P>This is very revealing in relation to current practice and the law as applied by the courts and the strictures on the Garda in those circumstances.  We welcome the Minister putting the High Court view before the House so that we can understand more clearly what can and is likely to happen.  The general conclusions contained the following statement:</P>
    <P>If for good reason a garda feared that one parent of a young person might obstruct the course of justice there would, in accordance with the principles I have set out, be still an obligation on such garda to seek the attendance of the other parent at the questioning or taking of a statement.</P>
    <P>It also stated:</P>
    <P>The fact that a parent or a guardian might advise a young person being questioned by the gardaí to say nothing does not constitute an obstruction of justice.</P>
    <P>If parents knew their rights in this matter there would probably be less difficulty. Many problems arise because people do not know their rights.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to go along with the Minister on this section on the assurances he has given us in relation to Report Stage.  He has given us a commitment to look again at the section.  I will consider tabling an amendment to the effect that adequate provision be made for free legal aid.  The Minister said the Law Society might come forward with a list and that may be necessary.  For instance, perhaps arrangements could be made with regard to having a reasonable fee granted for the making of a phone call &mdash; I know that ultimately all these things come back to fees.  In many instances it may simply be a question of a solicitor making a telephone call.  If people are properly advised of their rights and if they are not <Col N="211" /> going to be held for a lengthy period there may be no need for anything further. However, we will have to look at this matter on Report Stage.  Otherwise it builds into the Bill an inequality of access to the services of a solicitor and I shall consider putting down an amendment concerning this aspect on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, the right of access to a solicitor already exists and this section improves the situation in that a detainee must be informed of this right which he has already.  However, I am slightly concerned, as are many others, because most people have little to do with solicitors and many of them could not even name a solicitor. Even in a simple matter of purchasing a house people frequently ask one to recommend a solicitor.  When a person is detained for questioning and when he is filled with fear and worry it may affect his thinking powers.  Surveys are conducted frequently with regard to political matters: it would be interesting to carry out a survey and find out the number of people who could name a solicitor.  That is only the beginning of it; it is another matter to be able to contact him, especially after hours.</P>
      <P>The Minister should develop the suggestion or offer in the Ó Briain Report in relation to a duty panel of solicitors.  I do not know what is the problem here but it may be with regard to money.  The medical profession provide a valuable and worthwhile service at a very modest cost. Frequently they come to Garda stations at night-time to take blood or urine samples in drunken driving charges but they do not get much more than the day-time standard fee.  I know this because my brother has for many years acted as a doctor on call and he has frequently gone to Garda stations.  The day-time fee might be £6 and he would get £10 for a call at night.  Admittedly the medical profession take the Hippocratic oath and they would not let a patient down.  In the same way the legal profession could be called upon to provide a worthwhile service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> When you are talking about legal fees, when someone in detention calls in a solicitor, you might be talking about a very large sum, maybe hundreds of pounds or at least the start of a process whereby a fee of hundreds of pounds would be earned.  I agree with the Minister when he said that the advice a detainee is most likely to get would be not to say anything until he can have consultation with a solicitor and a case can be prepared.  If that is so, one does not need a great deal of expertise to advise a client and the onus should be on the profession &mdash; at least he should be asked &mdash; if that kind of service could be provided so that people at all times could have easy access to solicitors.</P>
    <P>I should like that matter to be examined because I know that many people in my constituency would have no dealings with a solicitor as they are not permitted to advertise.  Frequently solicitors names are upstairs over some shop or in a side street and they would not be meeting ordinary people socially.  They are not a very large percentage of the population and unless one had a need to contact a solicitor or had dealings with solicitors in business there is a likelihood that people would not know them.</P>
    <P>In any event, knowing a solicitor is not the answer to the problem.  A person might want to have a particular solicitor representing him.  In this respect the Incorporated Law Society could be of great assistance to the Minister to see if some kind of service, which would not be very costly, could be provided in the initial stages to safeguard and help a detained person.  If that cannot be done, we should look at the legal education system and see how it can be changed because, if the medical profession can provide a service for everyone, I do not see why the legal profession cannot do the same.  A directory of practising solicitors should be shown to the detainee so that he can at least choose a name and make a telephone call.  In that regard, I do not see why the call is restricted to one solicitor or a friend.  I do not see the reasoning behind that.</P>
    <P>We had other amendments which spoke about &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; and <Col N="213" />&ldquo;without delay&rdquo; and I mentioned my reservations in connection with them.  I understand the Minister's worry regarding the criminal legal aid system.  Nevertheless, I still think it is a service which we should provide and, perhaps in the manner which I have suggested, the cost could be greatly reduced and humanitarian concern shown by looking at it in that way.</P>
    <P>When a person is being informed of his right of access to a solicitor, there should be a notice to that effect visible and a copy should be given to the detainee because, very often, people are in a state of shock and cannot take in what is being said to them.  The weaknesses in this section are in the right to inform the detainee and how that is done, access to a solicitor, the problem of having to locate a solicitor and, finally, from the detainees point of view, the circumstances under which he is detained.  Very often, with people who do not know their rights, the tendency is to do nothing, to hang on and inadvertently to suffer as a result and possibly become embittered. That is unfair to the Garda because a person who would otherwise have spent a half an hour, an hour or an hour and a half, as the Minister has suggested, in a police station could end up spending a great deal longer which would not have been necessary.  In fact the Garda may not even have wanted them to be there that long &mdash; all for the want of being able to speak up or for making things absolutely clear to him and giving him access to a solicitor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments which were put down by Deputy Mac Giolla and myself were intended to tighten up the section and ensure that there would be no undue delay in contacting solicitors and relatives of the detained person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that persons under 17 years of age now have the right &mdash; presumably they always had this right but it has only been defined recently &mdash; to have a parent present before they can be questioned.  However, the most important point in relation to this section is that while attempting to improve the rights of detained persons it does not go <Col N="214" /> far enough.  There are serious gaps in the section, most of which have already been referred to by a number of speakers contributing to this debate.  The Minister, in response to some of these points, said he does not believe that there are very many people who do not know a solicitor.  I have no way of knowing on what he bases that belief but, in my experience, a very large number of people do not know a solicitor.  Many of them, while they may know the name of a solicitor, do not know his business or home address.  It is quite likely that a significant number of detentions will occur after 5 o'clock in the evening and if the detained person knows the name of a solicitor but does not know his address how are the Garda supposed to contact him?  If he is unable to contact a solicitor in what way are the rights of the detained person protected? He also indicated that some persons detained may not want a solicitor.  In those cases it is my belief that that would be because the detainee would be afraid of the cost of employing a solicitor.  This takes us back to the point raised by Deputy Woods that, as in many other areas of the law, a person who can afford to pay for the best legal representation has an advantage over a person who cannot afford to engage a solicitor of any kind.</P>
    <P>Because we are in this Bill introducing a new concept into the normal criminal law, that of detention for the purpose of questioning, in view of the fact that the present legal aid scheme does not cover persons until they appear in court I would argue that the Minister should seriously consider taking up the proposal of having a panel of duty solicitors.  The Minister argues that this may be very costly but we cannot reasonably argue that, because of cost, a person's rights should not be protected. Perhaps the Minister would comment on the recommendation in the Ó Briain Report, at paragraph 62, that a feasibility study be carried out on the possibility of establishing a panel of duty solicitors.  Responding to that report in 1978 the then Government accepted that a feasibility study ought to be undertaken. Perhaps the Minister would also indicate whether this or any previous <Col N="215" /> Government have undertaken such a feasibility study.  It is reasonable to assume that such a feasibility study has been undertaken and, if so, perhaps the Minister would let us know its results.</P>
    <P>Another important point to be raised on this section is in relation to a detainee knowing or not knowing a solicitor.  It may well be that a detainee could know a solicitor by, for instance, having had dealings with him in buying a house, or his parents may have engaged a solicitor in the purchase of a house.  We are all aware that many solicitors engaged in conveyancing are not interested and do not want to be involved either in going to court for criminal proceedings or in visiting Garda stations.  Of course there are other areas of specialisation, there are solicitors who specialise in company law and so on.  While a person may be vaguely aware of the name of a solicitor there is no guarantee whatsoever that that solicitor will be interested in attending a Garda station or indeed will be competent to do so, or of advising persons of their rights, because he may have spent most of his time in legal practice on conveyancing, company law or on any of the many other areas of law in which they can specialise.</P>
    <P>There is a serious gap in the section as drafted.  The Minister asked why Deputy Mac Giolla and I opposed the section in view of the fact that it is intended to improve the position of a detained person. Our basic reason for so doing is that we consider the section inadequate.  If the Minister had accepted our amendments, similar ones, or had endeavoured to improve the section in some way, even if he offered at this point to improve the section &mdash; ensuring that detainees have reasonable access to a solicitor &mdash; then we would reconsider our opposition to the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Our concern with this section &mdash; like some of the others with which we shall be dealing today &mdash; is an endeavour to provide a system of checks and balances ensuring that there will be procedures to provide protection for people against possible abuse and protect <Col N="216" /> basic civil liberties in the context of the exercise of the powers of detention by the Garda.  However, this section has a fundamental flaw.  I am sorry the Minister has expressed the view he has today, that he is unwilling to look again at the criminal legal aid system and the way it operates. I accept some of the Minister's reservations about the criminal legal aid system having proved expensive &mdash; there is no doubt about that.  On the other hand, nobody has yet devised an alternative system affording people adequate legal protection when charged with criminal offences and which would be less expensive.  The only mirror image of the criminal legal aid scheme that we have in this State at present is the civil legal aid scheme operating through law centres which are incapable of coping with the demands placed on them and which are entirely inadequate to meet the needs. Until such time as there is an adequate and appropriate suggestion for an alternative scheme of criminal legal aid the system brought into being by the 1962 Act is with us.</P>
      <P>The problem with this section &mdash; and here I share the view expressed by Deputies Woods, De Rossa, Skelly and Barnes &mdash; is that the protections it affords are selective.  In fact the provisions of this section will provide real protection for the hardened criminal, the person who has been before the courts, who is familiar with the criminal justice system, who has had regular contact with expert criminal lawyers &mdash; because of the fact of having been charged with criminal offences &mdash; who will receive protection under this section, in the sense that that person will have access to a solicitor because he or she will have established contacts with a solicitor and know how the system operates.  I am not saying that such a person should not have contact with a solicitor; anybody who is held in detention is presumed to be innocent until charged with an offence and found guilty by our courts, so they are entitled to such access.  The point is that this section will provide selective protection in that those who can afford to pay for lawyers will have access to them and receive advice when they are detained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> Those whom we would regard in this House as coming within the bracket of the hardened criminal, the person who has been before the courts on a number of occasions, convicted of offences, possibly having been sentenced to terms of imprisonment and who finds himself detained again, will have a relationship with a solicitor who will have some expertise in the area of criminal law and probably will have the wherewithal to pay for that solicitor.  Possibly that solicitor &mdash; in the context of past fees earned, be it through independent payment by the persons themselves or through the criminal legal aid scheme &mdash; will be quite willing to go along to a Garda station. The problem arises with youngsters who are detained in a Garda station, who will have no independent income, who possibly have never previously been in contact with the police in a Garda station, who have never previously been suspected of committing a criminal offence, who have never been before our courts, such persons will be vulnerable.  They will be unlikely to know of a lawyer and, if they do know of a lawyer, probably will not have the financial means to pay for his engagement.</P>
    <P>Therefore it seems to me that what we are providing here is a selective system of justice where the protection provided will be determined by the amount of cash in the pocket of the person detained.  I do not think that is satisfactory.  We cannot simply dismiss it by saying that the criminal legal aid scheme as it operates at present is too expensive, therefore we will not extend it in any way to deal with this situation.  We need to examine it.  We had a long debate in this House two weeks ago about whether the Garda, when they are requested to make contact with a lawyer, should do so without delay or as soon as practicable.  We had a great semantic argument about the respective merits of phrases like &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; and &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  It was all very interesting but was irrelevant to persons who are told either &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; or &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; they can make contact with a lawyer and who do not have the wherewithal to pay a lawyer.</P>
    <P>I am not a fan of the scheme of having <Col N="218" /> a duty solicitor attached to a police station, which operates in some countries. I am not sure it operates all that well.  It provides someone with legal training who can advise someone who is detained but, whether that is the best way of dealing with it, and whether it always provides independent legal advice, is open to question. A question has been raised about a duty roster system in police stations in other jurisdictions.  They sound all right in theory but often they do not work all that well in practice.  Often you do not get the most expert lawyers waiting in police stations on a duty roster system.</P>
    <P>A type of system which could operate as an extension of the legal aid scheme would be to use the names of those solicitors who are on a legal aid roster and who are on the list retained by the courts as being solicitors who are willing to undertake criminal legal aid work.  A list of solicitors' names and telephone numbers should be in each of the Garda stations in individual areas or districts in which they operate.  The Garda should be able to supply those names to persons who are detained and who do not know a solicitor.  The Garda cannot be expected to recommend a solicitor.  That might result in the solicitor never getting employment in the context of representing clients in criminal law work.  It might result in persons not being represented by the most desirable solicitor, a person they would feel confident would give them independent advice.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the Garda stations should not maintain lists of solicitors who operate on the criminal legal aid panel.  To some extent somebody who was not familiar with any solicitor would be taking pot luck in choosing a name, but at least they would have the facility to do that.  A question then arises about payment.  How do you provide for that in the context of a legal aid system where there is no independent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Chair feels we are now indulging in a Second Stage debate.  The Deputy is now dealing with the whole system of free legal aid which is another step in the criminal code of the administration of justice and that is outside <Col N="219" /> this Bill.  It would take a separate and distinct Bill to deal with it.  A reference to it would be all right, but to go into it in-dept would not be in order.</P>

      <P>This section is concerned with the provision of legal assistance to people who are detained.  I am trying to assist the Minister in seeing whether a scheme can be devised which would ensure that legal protection would be available to people who are detained and available equally to all people who are detained regardless of their financial position.  I do not think that in making a reference to that in this context I am going too wide of the Bill.  The Minister referred to the duty roster.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to look again at this, in a sense, blanket refusal to provide legal aid in these circumstances. It occurs to me that in the light of the Healy-Foran judgment to which I referred two weeks ago &mdash; and the wrong names appear in the Official Report &mdash; and in the context of the recent decision by the President of the High Court which sets out the law relating to the right of access of parents to young persons who are detained, it appears to me that when this legislation becomes operable, there must be some possibility that the courts might decide that there is some right to have access to a solicitor on the part of people who cannot afford to pay for a solicitor.  This section is properly designed by the Minister to provide a protection.  I believe it provides a selective protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> I want to deal with another aspect of this section in the context of requiring the Garda to notify the fact that someone has been detained.  I raised this point previously and I do not think the Minister replied to it.  I apologise to him if he did. I may have missed his reply.  I have been in the House for most of the debate and I have not missed too much of it.  I made the point that where young people are detained the juvenile liaison officer scheme should have some involvement in addition to a solicitor or a parent.  Garda stations are supposed to have a juvenile liaison officer attached to them.  This scheme has never been properly and fully developed.  It has a great deal of good in it and it should be allowed to grow in such a way as would allow it to make a very real contribution to the criminal justice system and in dealing with young people.</P>
    <P>It seems to me uniquely appropriate that where a person under 17 years of age is detained the local juvenile liaison officer should be notified.  He should have some involvement if that young person is to be questioned.  He may be someone with whom the young person has had previous contact.  I am critical of the fact that there is no statutory provision recognising the existence of the juvenile liaison officer scheme.  In the context of detaining a young person, surely it would be appropriate that members of the Garda who have some expertise or training in this area &mdash; although they would acknowledge that they have not got enough expertise or sufficient training; but at least they have a specialist interest in young people &mdash; should be notified if a young person is being detained.</P>
    <P>That would ensure that a degree of sensitivity would be exercised by the Garda in the manner in which they deal with these powers, particularly in the context of young people.  It is a concern of many people that, when a young person is detained, while the Garda may notify a solicitor or try to make contact with the parents, the experience of being detained &mdash; and people will be detained who are innocent of any offence and who will never be charged with an offence &mdash; may greatly alienate young people and <Col N="221" /> exacerbate feelings of alienation which already exist.  The hope would be that in exercising these powers the Garda would deal with them in a considerate and considered way.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider amending section 4 on Report Stage.  Subsection (2) deals with persons under the age of 17 years who are detained.  We should provide that, as soon as practicable, the juvenile liaison officer attached to the Garda station would be notified of the detention and consider in the context of rules of conduct or the code of practice of the Garda making some specific provision relating to the involvement of the juvenile liaison officer in the detention of young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a passing reference to the fact that he believes periods of detention for many people will be short, that the experience is that they will be detained for an hour and a half and will not need legal advice.  They may be detained briefly in a Garda station and be out again before it is possible to get a solicitor to come to the station.  That may happen on some occasions, but it will not always happen.  A great deal of public concern exists that people may be detained for unduly lengthy periods even after the Garda become assured that they have not been involved in any major criminal activity which would bring them within the ambit of this section.  That point should be made when debating the Bill.  The recent event when 33 young people were detained for 30 hours under the Phoenix Park Act, 1925, seems inexplicable in the context of assurances that people would be detained for only one hour or 90 minutes under this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that no comment may be made on what offences these people may or may not be charged with.  As a general point I believe it is valid to express concern at a period of detention taking place.  That was a lengthy period of time in the context of <Col N="222" /> events.  I do not know what offiences those people will be charged with but in the context of this section where assurances are given that people would not be detained for unduly lengthy periods of time the only point I am making is that that period of detention indicates the need to ensure that under the provisions of the Bill, in particular section 4, people detained will have full and proper access to legal assistance.  That should apply not merely to young people &mdash; defined in the Bill as those under the age of 17 years &mdash; but to those over 17 years also.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister's concern which he has expressed fairly throughout the debate is to achieve a proper balance, to ensure that the Garda have the powers made available to them that they deem appropriate and that people have available to them proper protection of civil liberties.  It is necessary to ensure that those powers are not misused.  In the context of the Minister's genuine concern I should like to ask him to consider some of the points I made in this area and add some more flesh to the skeleton type provisions that exist in section 4 to ensure that the legal protection he envisages being provided by it are genuine, will apply equally to everybody and are not dependent on financial ability to pay for a solicitor's advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of balance which Deputy Shatter and others said the Minister was attempting to achieve in this section we cannot consider there is balance of equality in it unless it is linked to legal aid and solicitors being available to everybody.  We have already referred to the fact that many people do not know a solicitor, may not be able to afford one and would have problems coping with solicitors and the law.  I accept, if expanded in this case, it could be expensive and might be difficult to justify.  There is no point in putting legislation through to give powers of detention without giving that matter consideration.  We must all strive for balance and equality before the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Shatter and Skelly referred to ways of overcoming some of the expense incurred in the legal aid system <Col N="223" /> such as rota system.  I will not deal with that matter in detail but it is essential that action be taken on it before Report Stage so that the Minister can introduce a structure for legal aid for everybody who needs a solicitor.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to inform the House on Report Stage that that is in operation.  If that does not happen the House will be concerned and reluctant to pass this provision without such an assurance.</P>
    <P>With regard to information and access to it I do not think we can stress often enough during the debate the state of mind people are in when detained in a station and subject to the whole ritual of the law.  I am referring in particular to those who are young, feel isolated or under threat.  It is essential from the Garda point of view that this type of information is given so that we do not end up alienating the force from the community. It is essential that our people do not see the force as a hostile group that is out to get them.  If that is to be avoided we must ensure that people detained are informed of their rights.  Having done that the only practical thing we can do is to ensure that they get their entitlements. It is important to stress that.</P>
    <P>The events last weekend indicate that there can be inexplicable detention.  That can raise fears amoung members.  Without focusing on the detention referred to by Deputy Shatter I believe I am expressing the view of many people when I say that in a security exercise such as occurred last weekend &mdash; I accept it was an unusual occasion &mdash; if extra powers of detention were given we might end up with the public believing that the forces of law and order were not working on their behalf but against them.  We should never allow that to happen.  Unless we deal with the issues raised in section 4 that will happen and to our cost.  I hope the Minister will consider the recommendations made by Deputy Shatter in regard to those under 17 years of age.  He may consider introducing the juvenile liaison officer.  We are all attempting to ensure that law and order are carried out here in a humane and just way.  I include the Garda in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the views of the previous speakers and I urge the Minister to retain the section without any adjustments.  I do not hold the view, expressed by several Members, that people do not know solicitors.  I accept that a few may not know of a solicitor but some people do not know where dentists are located.  However, when they need a dentist they do not have much difficulty in finding one.  Most rational and reasonable people will agree with the section. Any extension of the criminal legal aid scheme should be curtailed.  That scheme has a question mark hanging over it.  It has been a gravy train for a section of the legal profession.  In particular a leading member of The Workers' Party has been the chief beneficiary.  Recent figures indicate a drop in criminal activity &mdash; I have no doubt that will be shown to have been a temporary phenomenon &mdash; but I have no doubt that our fight must be to reduce the incredibly high rate of criminal activity here.  Our concern must be for victims of that criminal activity.</P>
      <P>The belief of Deputy Shatter that a juvenile liaison officer should be present is wrong.  A solicitor should be present but a juvenile liaison officer should not be present.  He has no function in that matter.  I believe the conduct of the Garda Síochana in most cases is exemplary, particularly in dealing with young people under 17 years of age.  Therefore, I support the retention of that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I found it profoundly depressing to hear the remarks of Deputy McGahon regarding the legal aid scheme.  In effect he is saying that a distinction should be drawn between those people who can afford legal representation and those who cannot afford it. That is putting the clock back a hundred years.  If a person has not the means to be legally represented then quite clearly the State must have an obligation to ensure that that person is not deprived of legal representation and assistance for that reason and that reason alone.  The wealthy section of the community have no problem.  They can retain solicitors and junior and senior counsel at will and call up all the aids they require.  It is <Col N="225" /> entirely unacceptable that we should divide our community into two sections, the haves and have nots, and so provide and maintain as a State that people with money are put in an advantaged position in a matter of this nature.  The old saying of one hundred years ago that justice was open to all just as the Ritz was open to all who could afford the prices to go in there could not be tolerated in a caring society.  I know that our country is to some extent at any rate, a caring society but considerably more remains to be done.  I deprecate the remarks of the previous speaker in this House and I advocate strongly the extension of the legal aid scheme to ensure that people who cannot afford legal aid will have it provided for them by the State.</P>
      <P>The question of access to a solicitor is the subject matter of this section.  As the Minister pointed out quite correctly, the section recognises a right that is already there, namely the right of access to a solicitor.  The existing law provides for that, that is true.  The section, as the Minister indicates, purports to extend that somewhat by providing that not alone has the person the right of access to a solicitor but that he must be informed of that right.  Certainly that is an appreciable improvement as far as it goes, but is it really doing anything of substance? What purpose or intent could there be in having the person informed that he has a right of access to a solicitor, but that is all you do?  There is no great merit in that <i>per se.</i>  I am a solicitor myself and I may be informed that a client of mine is in custody.  There is no great advantage either to him or to me.  Surely if the right to be informed of that is to have any meaning, the intent and purpose of it can only be that the solicitor should be present when the questioning takes place. What benefit is it to a person in custody that the person is informed that he has the right of access to a solicitor if before the solicitor arrives the questioning procedure swings into intensive action?  It is of no benefit whatsoever to the person. The information, while interesting no doubt, is useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, from the solicitor's point of view it is quite useless that he should be <Col N="226" /> informed that his client is in custody and he tells the Garda that he is on his way and will be there in an hour, if when he arrives in an hour's time or whatever he finds that it is all over.  Therefore, there is no great merit in giving the information. The purpose is that the solicitor would be present before the questioning commences.  That is the only logical reason for having a section providing that he is to be informed of his right of access to a solicitor.  The section ought to be amended to provide that when the directive of the section is carried out and the person in custody is informed that he has the right of access to a solicitor, the next stage would be that the Garda would contact that solicitor and if that solicitor indicates that he is in a position and is prepared to be present within a reasonable time &mdash; the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is used in another context in the section &mdash; then questioning would be suspended for the reasonable period indicated by the solicitor.</P>
    <P>It could be argued, and the Minister will no doubt make the point, that if a solicitor is not available, cannot come, says that he will not be there for days and so on, perhaps in such an extended case then the questioning might go ahead.  If a solicitor indicates that he is prepared to be there within a resonable time, then the purpose of having him informed is to enable him to be there.  In such a case would it be asking too much to suggest that an amendment be incorporated to provide that questioning be suspended for that reasonable period nominated and indicated by the solicitor when consulted? Making that as a sort of compromise point would in no way detract from my position that in any case, as I advocated on the last occasion, a scheme should be set up, with the co-operation of the law society and legal aid services, of duty solicitors who would be on call in emergency situations at any time of the day or night to assist people who find themselves in need of assistance and advice and who are unable to provide it from their own resources.  At the very minimum if a solicitor when contacted pursuant to the section indicates that he is prepared to be present in a reasonable <Col N="227" /> period, then surely the section should provide that questioning be suspended until he arrives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A number of points have been made and most of them have been made before now.  The detained person has rights at the moment and what I am providing for under section 4 is that that perosn would be informed of his right of access to a solicitor and that in the case of a young person the parent or guardian would be informed.</P>
      <P>Deputies made a point about young persons being detained who would not know the names of solicitors.  That is not true.  Under the section, if a person is under 17 years of age the obligation is to inform the parent of guardian as well, and it may be the parent guardian who will contact a solicitor.  If a parent or guardian is not available, the obligation areise to notify, on request, named person. There is a point about whether people would know solicitors.  There may be people who would not know solicitors personally, but they would know the names of solicitors.  I accept young people would not, but most ordinary people would have reson to consult solicitors at some time in their lives, to make their wills or to buy property or because of some involvement with the law.  I accept the point made strongly by Deputy Shatter, and I will examine the possibility to have some kind of list in Garda stations giving of solicitors who would be available for consultation in Garda stations. I will examine if that is practicable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter made a number of points oon access to solivitors and spoke particularly about the Criminal Legal Aid Act, 1962.  The courts have decided that if it is essential in the interests of justice, criminal legal aid should be provided. There is also a means test to decide whether the perosn would be elligible for leagl aid, but the pharase &ldquo;essential in the interests of justice&rdquo; is the overriding factor. it is arguable whether it is in the interests of justice for a solicitor to attend questioning detention and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same Deputy spoke about this <Col N="228" /> section and sectioon 3 being examined subsequently in the courts and he said the courts may decied that people have the right to have their solicitors present right through periods of detention.  He said it is a totally new concept.  Of course, we have detention at the  moment and people can be detained for up to 48 hours under the offences Against the State Act, and the right of access to a solicitor is there. The courts have not development case law to make it essential to have a solicitor present right through the questioning period, but the right of access to a solicitor is there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor asked what use is that. The use is that during the questioning period a person has access to a solicitor in private, out of the hearing of the Garda Síochána, and he can be advised by that solicitor.  That is as far as the courts have developed their interpretation on the rights of detainees.  In the section I am taking the case law as stated by the courts and I am providing that detainees must be informed of the right of access to a solicitor and to a parent or guardian.</P>
    <P>I can understand the concern of Deputies that there could be practical problems in the actual exercise of the right &mdash; that solicitors may not be available, or where the first solicitor was not available whether it would be necessary to contact a second one.  I undertsnd those points and I will see if something can be done so that at least people who would not know the names of solicitors would be informed of them.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention of the section to go beyound that.  I am not in favour of Deputy Taylor's point that a solicitor should be there right through the questioning period.  I do not think it is necessary and it would be enormously expensive. Obviously, if it was conceded in one instance it would be conceded in the others.  I do not know how much solicitors charge per hour but I would regard £20 per hour as being a reasonably modest fee, and if somebody is detained under the Offences Against the State Act for 48 hours we could get a bill of £960 or £1,000 from a solicitor.  We must think of the taxpayer.  There is no such thing as free legal aid, whether it be criminal or civil <Col N="229" /> free legal aid.  The aid is free to the individual but the taxpayer is taking up the bill and I am not too happy about the operation of the criminal legal aid system.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that certain solicitors and firms of solicitors are making enormous amounts of money out of the scheme and I am not too sure about the level of the service provided.  That is not to say that I have immediate plans to change the system.  i will not put the clock back 100 years and I agree that if people have not the means with which to be represented in court the State should provide it.  That is not to say that we have a perfect scheme at the moment.</P>
    <P>On the juvenile liaison officer scheme, the liaison officers' role is concerned with counselling youngsters who have committed offences.  To bring them in when somebody has been detained would cause two things to arise.  Firts of all, it would change the role of the juvenile liaison officer dramtically, but in the opinion of the public it would give the impression that the young person was guilty of an offence and was being counselled by the juvenile liaison officer when in many case the young perosn will be btought in in connection with the investigation of an offence and subsequently will not be charges.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is a particularly good idea, even though I agree with what has been said about the juvenile liaison scheme and how effective it can be and how is should be developed.  However, the scheme is to help people who have been found guilty of offences and have been referred to the care of juvenile liaison officers.  There is another problem. The juvenile liAison officer is called and if the youngster confesses and makes a statement it might be said that the confession is inadmissible because it could be argued that ti was made as a result of an inducement by a person in authority, the point being that the juvenile liaison officer knew the young offender, had his confidence and used it to get an admission.</P>
    <P>I a juvenile liaison officer is to act as the friend of the young person and if he is to be the advise of a person who has <Col N="230" /> been convicted and if that youngster is brought in a second time the position would arise that some body who has the confidence of that young perosn would be brought in in an advisory capacity. This would create very serious problems in such a situation.  That is not to take away from the complimentary remarks made about the scheme.</P>
    <P>Similar remarks were made about the probationary services, about involving probation officers.  In this scheme there have been relationshipd of friendship and confidence between probation officers and young offenders and anything said between them could be inadmissible because of this relationship of confidence being interpreted as an inducement by perosns in authority who had developed this rapport with young persons.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I have said at various times, that section 4 is in ease of the detainee.  It is not giving new rights of access to parents, guardians or solicitors, but it is putting a statutory obligation on the Garda Síochána to inform the person of his or her existing rigts.  I agree that informaing perosns of their existing rights may not be enough to enable them to exercise those rights and I will see whether something can be done by regulation or practice in Garda stations to ensure that at least people who are unable to nominated solicitors will be made aware of the names nd locations of various solicitors who in general would be willing to act in this capacity.</P>
    <P>A point which has not been adverted to is that because we have the criminal aid scheme many solicitors may be willing to attened at Garda stations because subsequently they will become the solicitors nominated if somebody is charged.  It is not as black  and white as Deputies have argued.  I can see a situation developing if a perosn nominated a solicitor at that stage.  If the person is not charged he will not have a major problem and if he is charged the solicitor who is nominated will benefit restrospectively when he will be paid for the court case.  In practice solicitors, especially young solicitors, on the list may be willing to attend in station on that basis.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the availability <Col N="231" /> of a duty roster of solicitors.  The Incorporated Law Societry are an independent body.  They cantorl an independent profession.  Perhaps the community would appreciate a gesture on the part of the society whereby they would provide a service for people who are detained. This is not a question I wish to dwell on but I am not too sure about the situation of the legal profession advocating schemes that would be very costly to administer.  The suggestion of solicitors being available on a roster system to detained perosns is good and I should like to see the Incorporated Law Society develop the idea and put forward a scheme on those lines.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says in relation to the section in that it is in ease of the detainee and is providing for the right to be informed.  We must take this in the context of the Bill in so far it is providing for a period of detention without charge and that is totally new.  It is in that light that the Minister is provideing for access to a solicitor and for notification of detenmtion.  We must bear in mind that the provision is not merely something gratutous in the interest of modernising the law.  It looks as if only the innocent poor will be the ones in danger criminals who may be in the poorer groups will know their way around fairle well.  Some may even be spondored or supported by other people but it is for the fairly large number of innicent poor people that we wish to peovide measure of protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said he would be prepared to go along with a ropster system of solicitors who would be available to detained perosns.  We take the point he makes about retrospective benefit.  Such a situation operates in some instances but in the case we are talking of where under the Offences Against the State Act, for instatnce, 90 per cent of those detained are not charged, we do not know what the precentage would be but perhaps <Col N="232" /> about 70 per cent would not be charged Consequently, the retrospective benefit idea may not commend itself to solicitors. However, the problem might be overcome by way providing fot the payment of a small fee in respent of a solicitor's availability to a detained person and then for the retrospective benefit in the event of a subsequent court case.</P>
    <P>My hackles were raised by some of Deputy McGahon's comments.  I was very much concerned about the line he was taking.  Listening to him I was glad of our having a Constitution and also an independent Judiciary and independent courts.</P>
    <P>I deal frequently with people in the sort of situation we are talking of.  They do not know solicitors and ususlly do not wish to have any delaings with them.  We are talking about innocent people who may not be too well off.  Very often people are reluctant even to contact a solicitor for the purpose of making wills and failure to make a will leads to much difficulty in regard to probate and so on.</P>
    <P>I agree that there are problems in regard to the free legal aid scheme but we must consider it with a view to ascertaining how it can be improved and modified. I have indicated that there are certain individuals and companies who seem to be very mush involved in that scheme but in practice I have had difficluty at times  in finding them when they were needed in court.  However, the need for the scheme is obvisous especially when we are considering the extension of powers. The Minister has acknowledged the point that while theoretically we may make a solicitor available, in pratice that may not be so because in the first instance detained perosns may not have the where withal to engage solicitors.  But the availability to a solicitor in a case of detention is crucial.  We lack a breakdown of case law and of how people are affected in thse matters of detention.  I would refer to a case which occurred in September 1983.  This involved the arrest of a man under the Offences Against the State Act but allegedlky for malicious damage to the  extent of £15.  He was taken to a Garda station at 10 p.m. and after 15 minutes requested immediately <Col N="233" /> that a doctor and a solicitor be brought to him.  He was attended by a doctor at 11 p.m. following which he was questioned for some time &mdash; from about 11.30 to midnight.  He claimed that during that period there was limited physical abuse to his person.  His solicitor visited him at 1.30 a.m. and he brought the man's wife to see him at 3.30 a.m.  So far as that man was concerned the repeated visits of his solicitor were crucial to his state of mind because he was detained for almost 24 hours.  He is convinced that if his solicitor had not been present he would have been detained for a second period of 24 hours. The solicitor was treated properly and was able to make a case for the client and to argue about the ill-treatment that the detained man complained of.  The question of that alleged ill-treatment has been under investigation since October 1983. However, the question I am concerned with here is the importance of the availability of a solicitor in such instances.  I agree with what a number of people have said.  Deputy McGahon referred to the gardaí mostly being exemplary.  I accept that.  However, when we mention cases where gardaí did not act in an exemplary fashion we are told we do not support them in every situation.  That is wrong.  I will not accept a situation where we cannot question the actions of a member of the Garda or a system and so on.  I could cite a case in Donegal which resulted in the conviction of two members of the Garda.  In that case, the individual concerned insisted on a doctor being there both before and after.  We want to try to cater for cases where there may be an abuse of power by a limited number of people.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the poor and those who cannot afford to pay a solicitor would have somebody available to them who could take some kind of action on their behalf.  I accept the Minister's difficulty in practical terms but I appeal to him to look carefully at this.  Those who will be adversely affected by this are the innocent poor.  Those who have an income will be able to get a solicitor and usually those who are not innocent are well used to dealing with the situation and will be well advised.  Under these <Col N="234" /> new powers people who will be innocent but may have information to convey must be protected.  This section must be improved on Report Stage.  I hope the Minister will not close his mind to the question of some form of legal aid however limited it may be because of the cost which would be involved.  It is a challenge to the administration to bring forward systems to meet these requirements.  That is the whole basis of management by exception.  The management system is there to provide for the exception without spending too much money on it.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with this on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he would look at the question of having a list of the names of solicitors available.  That would be very welcome. There are solicitors who are subscribers to the legal aid panel and, as an interim measure, perhaps their names could be put on the list to be made available in Garda stations.</P>
      <P>Some criticism was made by the Minister and others about the cost of the criminal legal aid scheme and the fact that some firms of solicitors are drawing substantial sums of money from the scheme each year.  That is undoubtedly so.  It does not apply only to solicitors but to counsel.  One can see from the press the amounts made yearly by solicitors and counsel.  Some of them show indecently large annual earnings from the criminal legal aid scheme.  Deputy McGahon pointed out that some of the major beneficiaries may or may not be associated with The Workers' Party but whether they are or not has nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way to deal with that position is to restructure the criminal aid scheme.  If the Minister proposes to implement that it will have our full support.  It should be restructured in a similar manner to that which applies to the civil legal aid centres. Instead of calling in private firms of solicitors resulting in indecently large earnings for a small number, the State should set up criminal law centres to deal with criminal work as they have already done for civil work.  The State would employ <Col N="235" /> solicitors and counsel on a full-time basis and pay them an appropriate salary.  They could be called on and be responsible to meet the criminal aid needs of those who are arrested and charged.  In other words, there would be full-time solicitors and barristers employed by the State.  There would be no difficulty in staffing such centres.  It would cost the State considerably less to operate a service on those lines than the present system costs.  It would provide a considerably better service from the point of view of those who would have to use it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the presence of juvenile liaison officers at investigations. I was not entirely happy with the Minister's reply.  The Minister pointed out that, as a result of the relationship between the juvenile liaison officer and the young person, there could be a danger that an admission made might be challenged on the grounds that an inducement had been offered.  That is not a point that would arise very often if at all. At present juvenile liaison officers have an association with young people.  I am not aware of any case where an admission made by a young person was challenged on the grounds of inducement.  Inducement is part of procedure and it is by no means unusual for gardaí to hold out inducements.  How often has the phrase &ldquo;I will go easy on you when the matter comes up before the justice&rdquo; been heard? One hears that all too often in practice. I would not rule out the association of juvenile liaison officers on that account. They do magnificent work.  The officers are held in the highest possible regard, and rightly so, by district justices.  It is important that juveniles should have the benefit of their guidance at all stages.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind the kind of people we are talking about.  They fall into different categories.  There will be people who are well educated and know the score.  There are others who will have a low level of intellect.  I remember being involved in a case many years ago and I sent in a juvenile liaison officer to talk to the young person in custody and discuss the matter with him.  I have remembered the remark he made all these years.  I <Col N="236" /> asked how he got on and what was his assessment of the situation.  His reply spoke worlds of the kind of problem we are dealing with.  He said: &ldquo;Not much grey matter there&rdquo;.  The young person concerned had no grasp of the situation he was involved in, what he had done or what was at risk.  Juvenile liaison officers dealing with people who do not have much grey matter have an essential role to play which is recognised by district justices.</P>
    <P>I doubt that there is any district justice in this country who would strike down an admission or rule it out if it followed on discussions which had taken place, simply because a discussion had taken place between the accused person and the juvenile liaison officer concerned.  Those Deputies who advocated that that is the situation have a valid point to make and in my view it should be looked at again.</P>

      <P>Section 5 (4) reads:</P>
      <P>Any person who obstructs or attempts to obstruct any member of the Garda Síochána or any other person acting under the powers conferred by subsection (1) or who fails or refuses to give his name and address when demanded, or gives a name or address which is false or misleading, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £800 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes to substitute <Col N="238" /> £1,000 for £800.  This amendment is introducing a new offence for which a person can be fined for refusing to give his name and address when requested.  Subsection (1) says:</P>
    <P>Where a person is detained pursuant to section 3, a member of the Garda Síochána may &mdash; (a) demand of him his name and address;</P>
    <P>We are saying that someone who refuses to give his name and address when demanded will commit a new offience for which a fine will be imposed.  In the Bill it is £800 and the term of imprisonment is 12 months, and the Minister proposes to increase that figure to £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear what is happening.  The Minister has introduced a new offence where a person refuses to give his name or address, and he is increasing the fine from £800 to £1,000.  In my view a warning should be issued.  I do not know if the current regulations or current practices would insist on a warning in this case but people should be warned that if they refuse to give their name or address or give a false or misleading name or address, that would be an offence for which they would be liable to a term of imprisonment of 12 months.  It seems only right that the people should be given a warning especially if a person is under 17 years of age.  That is the main point I wanted to make on this amendment.  This is a new offence.  It is not simply a matter of changing £800 to £1,000 as the amendment would suggest.  The difference between a maximum fine of £800 and £1,000 is not very great and the court would take into consideration the circumstances of the individual concerned before imposing this fine.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about inserting a warning into this section because people should be forewarned.  For instance, if a person has been advised by his solicitor to say nothing, and he follows that advice and refuses to give even his name and address, he will be committing an offence. It is not a simple matter of increasing a fine from £800 to £1,000.  We have <Col N="239" /> to examine these amendments in that context.  I am sure that the media will issue the warning generally because it will be news to people that, in effect, the section will introduce an offence for not giving one's name and address when asked by a member of the Garda Síochána.  The Minister would say that a fine of up to £1,000 for not giving this information is at present required to bring about law and order and help the Garda in doing their work, which is probably true.  However, people would want to be quite clear on the law as it will stand once this Bill is enacted and comes into practice.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 is in relation to section 5 (5) which states:</P>
    <P>Section 7 (2) of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, is hereby amended by the substitution in paragraph (a), for &ldquo;£500&rdquo;, of &ldquo;£800&rdquo; and by the deletion of paragraph (b).</P>
    <P>The £500 in the Bill was there being increased to £800 and the Minister's present amendment No. 22 is increasing it to £1,000.  I do not see any other implications in that amendment at this stage.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 deals with section 11 which states:</P>
    <P>If a person who has been released on bail in criminal proceedings fails to appear before a court in accordance with his recognisance, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £800 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.</P>
    <P>This is fairly straightforward, not surrendering to bail being made an offence.  We are glad to see this in the Bill.  The amendment merely raises the fine of £800 to £1,000.  I do not see any difficulty with that amendment also.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 33 deals with section 14 (2) regarding the withholding of information with relation to firearms or ammunition, which states as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> If that person fails or refuses, without reasonable excuse, to give the information or gives information that he knows to be false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £800 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both.</P>
    <P>Here the Minister is introducing an offence, the nature of which can be discussed, presumably, when we are dealing with the section in general.  The Minister merely suggests that his earlier proposed fine of £800 be now £1,000.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 34 deals with section 15 which relates to the withholding of information with regard to stolen property:</P>
    <P>If that person fails or refuses, without reasonable excuse, to give such account or gives information that he knows to be false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £800 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or to both....</P>
    <P>The Minister is now proposing to raise that maximum fine of £800 to £1,000.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 44 deals with section 20 (10), line 36, regarding proofs by written statement:</P>
    <P>Where (a) a statement is tendered in evidence by virtue of this section, (b) and the person by whom the statement was made has stated in it anything which he knew to be false or did not believe to be true, he shall be guilty of an offence....</P>
    <P>This is a section in the Bill which will help in the conduct of the business of the courts and will be welcomed generally also.  It creates an offence where a person gives false information.  Obviously, this is a very necessary safeguard.  The Bill stipulates a fine not exceeding £800 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding <Col N="241" /> twelve months or both and the Minister is raising the fine to £1,000, which is reasonable enough.</P>
    <P>The final amendment is No. 52 which deals with section 27 (3):</P>
    <P>Any person who refuses to allow his fingerprints to be taken pursuant to this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £800 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or to both.</P>
    <P>This refers to the taking of fingerprints of persons dealt with under the Probation of Offenders Act of 1907, or convicted. We shall have to discuss that subsequently under the section as a whole.  The Minister is proposing a new offence and that the amount of the fine be raised from £800 to £1,000, which is reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In general, the amendments to which Deputy Woods has referred replace an £800 maximum fine by a £1,000 maximum fine because since the Bill was published the £800 maximum fine has gone out of date. It is a question of lining it up with what has happened under the Road Traffic Bill and the Copyright Bill.  In amendment No. 21, no offence new to our law is being created.  Section 7 (4) of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, has a similar provision:</P>
      <P>Any person who obstructs or attempts to obstruct any member of the Garda Síochána or any person acting under the power conferred by subsection (1) of this section, or who fails or refuses to give his name and address when demanded or gives a name and address which is false or misleading shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable</P>
      <P>(a) on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or to both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £500 was updated to £800 and now, because of what has happened in other legislation, it is being updated to £1,000. The same type of concept is in the Road <Col N="242" /> Traffic Act, 1961, section 107 (3), which reads:</P>
    <P>Where a person, when his name and address is demanded of him under this section, refuses or fails to give his name and address or gives a name and address which is false or misleading, such person shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>The penalties for the offences are graded as to first, second and third offence with the maximum fine increasing in each case.  Under the Litter Act a person is obliged to give his name and address. It is not a new concept introduced into the law or anything like that.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether we should have a separate provision so that the person should be informed of having committed an offence if he did not give his name and address I do not consider that that is necessary and it is not provided for in the Litter Act, the Road Traffic Act or the Criminal Law Act, 1976.  In practice a garda would tell a person that he or she was committing an offence if the name and address was not given.  The merits of the individual sections can be debated when we come to them.  The only thing that is involved in these amendments is increasing the fine from £800 to £1,000. Many of our fines in various pieces of legislation are out of line with present money values.  I have a particular interest in it not because of a desire to increase State revenue or punish people more adequately by imposing greater monetary penalties on them.  My main concern is that I believe that if the courts had realistic alternative sanctions some people who are committed to terms of imprisonment might not necessarily be committed to prison.  One of the main sanctions in everyday life in court is fines. If the maximum fine is too low and is totally out of line with present-day monetary values there could be a tendency in the difficult case to use the alternative of imprisonment rather than a fine.  I ask the House to accept this amendment and to accept the maximum fine of £1,000.  The District Court in its discretion can impose any kind of fine up to £1,000.  It might not be a rule of thumb but it is certainly a <Col N="243" /> very strong argument that the higher the maximum fine available to a district justice the less likely it will be that he will impose a term of imprisonment.</P>

It goes on to say that any person who obstructs the Garda is liable to penalties.  The idea of the penalties was introduced in 1976.  It is the same section being applied to this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing law people have to be arrested for the purpose of charging them.  We are now talking about people being detained for a period of up to 20 hours for questioning.  I am not against it.  In terms of general law and order it is right that people should be prepared to give their names and addresses in the first instance but they should know when they have not committed any offence &mdash; in this case many of these people will not have committed any offence &mdash; they should be very clearly aware of the fact that under this section they will commit an offence if they do not give their names and addresses.  If a boy or girl under 15 is detained under this Bill and is totally innocent and righteously feels that he or she should not even be detained because he or she is innocent that person would want to be quite clear that even in those circumstances that person would be committing an offence by not giving his or her name and address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> People should be made aware of this so that they are not letting themselves into a situation where they are totally innocent at the outset and they end up giving a wrong address for some reasons.  In the past if one had a brother going for the priesthood one did not give one's name or address. That is not so unusual because it would be held against one's brother. Now you will pay a price for that.  They are finding it hard enough to get people at present.</P>

People should be made aware of the fact that under this Bill they must give their proper names and addresses because if they do not they will be committing an offence straightaway. I agree with the Minister's intent that people who are innocent about their business should not have fears about such an offence being introduced so the difference between the £800 and the £1,000 is largely irrelevant because the courts can look after this.  We are not objecting to the Minister's amendment but it is very important that what is taking place here is broadcast quite clearly and people are made aware of it particularly young people who might feel for mistaken reasons that their mother or father should not know about what is happening.  It is probably a good thing they face up to their responsibilities at an early stage.</P>

      <P>As a strong advocate of the necessity for this Bill I have to confess that I have reservations about the extent of the penalties being made available for what in many cases could turn out to be a harmless crime.  While everybody would feel it is a reasonable request that a garda should be given a name and address there are many occasions, particularly late at night, where very decent people who have taken a few drinks would be alienated by such a request.  To impose a fine of £1,000 or send somebody to jail for 12 months for an offence of that nature is laughable while habitual criminals can commit crimes of violence <Col N="245" /> on old ladies, assault them and get free under the Probation Act or get farcical jail sentences of three, six or nine months and be let go free after having done a few months in jail.  This is going from one extreme to the other.  I would like the Minister to look at that situation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It does not apply to a person cycling or driving along a road at night.  It is under section 5 of the Bill which talks about the powers which the Garda Síochána would have if a person is detained under section 3 so, in the first instance, it can only apply to somebody who is detained pursuant to the powers given to the Garda under section 3.  I take the point Deputy Woods is making but the public at large are aware that one is obliged to give one's name and address to the Garda Síochána under certain circumsances.  For example, under the Road Traffic Act the motorist is obliged to give his name and address.  There is a great awareness of that.  People may not be sure what other information one is obliged to give or even whether one is obliged to give other information.  If a youngster is found cycling home at night without a light on his bicycle he is obliged to give his name and address to the Garda Síochána.  A person who commits an offence under the Litter Act is obliged to give his name and address.  I do not think it necessary to include in the Bill that there should be an explicit warning to a person that he has broken the law.  I can see the point which is being made and I will consider whether it was necessary to make provision in regulations.  The fact that a person was brought into a Garda station on reasonable suspicion and detained would impress on him the seriousness of the matter and it would be difficult to conceive of a situation where people would not realise they were in breach of some kind of law or regulation if they did not give their name and address to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>(f) seize and retain for testing anything that he has in his possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in fines also applies to other offences such as refusing to give information about goods in one's possession, refusing to make a statement which affects the right to remain silent and so forth.  These sanctions are in effect the big stick which the Garda may use to persuade somebody that if he does not allow himself to be photographed, fingerprinted, <Col N="247" /> swabbed and refuses to make a statement about goods in his possession he faces a term of imprisonment or a fine of up to £1,000.  There is a grave obligation on the Minister to ensure that the Garda are obliged to make this clear to a detained person.</P>
    <P>In the generality of cases the difference between finding the money to pay a fine of £800 or £1,000 is not real because people are not in a position to pay either amount.  Unemployed young people may well be brought into stations and charged under this section.  They may be receiving as little as £1 or £2 a week in social assistance.  In most cases people would be unable to pay a fine of even £100, let alone £1,000.  This brings us back to the point of the inequality of sanctions against persons found guilty of an offence. Generally the person who has access to money can pay the fine and avoid imprisonment, while those who cannot pay will presumably face imprisonment as a result.  Apart from the right or wrong of the sections under which these fines and terms of imprisonment will apply, we are back to a debate which took place last year in relation to whether it is fair and just that the poorest section automatically face imprisonment through their inability to pay fines whereas those who have the capacity to pay the fines have no problem.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would let us know if a person can be detained if he is known to be in breach of the gaming laws and is failing to pay tax on bets.  If a person was detained in such a way, asked for information and refused to give it, would he be subject to a fine of up to £1,000 or imprisonment for 12 months?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy De Rossa's contribution because we always talk about the maximum fine, not the minimum.  When debating the Road Traffic Bill I expressed the view that a minimum fine should be imposed for various offences but it was made clear that it is enacted in our laws and held by the courts that people can only be fined in accordance with their means.  District justices have always held to the principle <Col N="248" /> that they cannot be fined outside their means.  That is why we have maximum fines, never minimum fines.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in response to a number of questions yesterday from Deputy O'Kennedy both the Industrial Development Authority and Shannon Development are vigorously promoting north Tipperary for suitable industrial development.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are at an advanced stage with an overseas company for the establishment of a new industrial project in the IDA's 24,000 sq. ft. unit at Nenagh.  I am informed that there are now four projects employing seven people located at Shannon Development's workspace development in Connolly Street.</P>
      <P>Two of the IDA's factories at Thurles have recently been occupied by Appledore Ltd., and Eirauf Ltd., both of which will make a major contribution to employment in the area.  In addition, Shannon Development are currently converting two industrial units into a workspace complex, which will result in 11 units of varying sizes being available for letting and are also constructing two units of 2,500 sq. ft. each at the New Road, Thurles.</P>
      <P>The IDA's 24,000 sq. ft. advance factory at Roscrea will shortly be occupied by Roscrea Bacon Factory Ltd., as part of a recently announced major expansion which will create 37 additional jobs over the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>In addition to these developments, the IDA are promoting the following facilities: Nenagh, one 16,800 sq. ft. factory; Thurles, one 18,750 sq. ft. factory; and industrial land in the following locations: Nenagh, 54 acres; Thurles, 75 acres and Roscrea 40 acres.</P>

    <P>To date the NEA have made a small number of investments in addition to commissioning some consultancy work.

      <P>I do not accept at all that the National Enterprise Agency has been unsuccessful.  It has suffered from political uncertainty over the last three years in that a number of Governments succeeded one another and they had different views about the role of the National Enterprise Agency.  In July last I decided that pending the introduction of the legislation setting up the National Development Corporation the National Enterprise Agency should be reactivated &mdash; it was already in existence &mdash; and should continue with its work.  I have in my possession a review of the projects they have invested in, are on the point of investing in or considering for investment. Given the relatively small staff resources available to them they have identified some very interesting and useful projects.  Naturally, I cannot go into this in detail with the Deputy because some of these projects are not at the stage where they are in a position to announce the investment although I expect to be making some announcements of investments by the NEA later this month.  I would be happy to arrange a discussion for the Deputy with the National Enterprise Agency if he wishes to have a more informal briefing on the position.

Quite a substantial number of valuable projects have <Col N="256" /> been brought to a mature stage by the National Enterprise Agency.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the reasons industrial premises, which were previously occupied by Government and IDA-sponsored companies which have since gone into liquidation and whose premises are now being sold at low prices to private individuals and companies, are not being purchased by IDA and the Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing stock of factories in the Industrial Development Authority's ownership comprises factories directly built by the authority and factories acquired following liquidations or restructuring.  In the past, the IDA have purchased 60 factories from companies which ceased to operate or as part of restructuring packages to assist companies in their efforts to become viable. In view, however, of the existing stock of available factory space the industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department have no plans to acquire any further industrial properties.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will outline in detail the number of empty advance factories in each city and town in the country; the date on which the building of each factory was completed; the internal area of each factory; the number of these factories for which there are active negotiations with industrialists; the number that have been rented to existing adjacent industries; and the number of advance factories in the country that have been rented or leased to companies as at 31 December 1983 and to date.</P>

      <P>The tabular statement which follows gives details of vacant factory space throughout the country exclusive of small industry units, details of which have been provided in response to a separate parliamentary question by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's reference to &ldquo;existing adjacent industries&rdquo; is to factories which have been let on a temporary basis to existing industries adjacent to such factories.  The total number of such factories is 22.</P>
      <P>A total of 391 IDA advance factories were leased to manufacturing companies at 31 December 1983.  The total number of factories leased at present, including SFADCo advance factories, is 740.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told the House that 740 factories are vacant around the country and I should like to know if he considers it time for a redirection of policy and a new look to be taken at them so as to make some use of vacant factory space particularly in view of the high level of unemployment?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the number of vacant small industrial units which are available in each town or city throughout the country; <Col N="264" /> the number of small industrial units in any town or city throughout the country which are occupied at present; the number of these vacant units on which there are active negotiations with industrialists for them; and the total area and value of all IDA property in the country at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of the number, location and status of vacant small industry units, up to and including 10,000 sq. ft. are set out in a tabular statement which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the total area of factories in IDA ownership is 10.25 million sq. ft. which includes factories leased to promoters and being sold to promoters approved by the IDA for grant assistance. These factories have a present day replacement value of approximately £250 million.  The compilation of the detailed information requested by the Deputy in regard to occupied advance factories would be time consuming, wasteful of resources and would not justify the effort involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put a question to the Minister similar to the one I asked him earlier but which he sidestepped and did not bother to answer.  Is it not time, with the amount of vacant factory space throughout the country, and the amount of investment that is used, for a new direction of policy by the Minister and the IDA in regard to putting those vacant factories to use?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a case to be made for examining the use of these factories in the most flexible manner possible for industry.  One of the ideas that has been developed by SFADCo is to provide within a large factory a number of work space units.  That is one way that existing plants can be used more intensively where large industries do not exist.  However, there are limits to what one can do in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House if the committee set up to look into import substitution were able to utilise any factory space for industries engaged in producing materials that are being imported?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy no doubt will be aware that I have given a great deal of time in recent months to promoting the import substitution drive particularly in the food area.  I am aware also that the IDA have done extensive studies on this area which have been published and as a result of this published information a number of projects have come forward.  I am also engaged in consultation with supermarkets and other retailers with a view to getting them to assist in import substitution projects and I hope that some at least of these will be located in some of the advance factories I have mentioned.</P>

      <Col N="269" /> In 1983, 11,450 first-time jobs were created by the IDA in grant-aided industry. Total capital and training grants made by IDA in 1983 amounted to £121.5 million.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that a number of the first-time jobs created in 1983 arise from grant payments made in previous years.  Similarly a number of jobs will be created this year arising from grant payments made in 1983.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will provide details of the amount of unutilised factory space throughout the country which could be adapted for the establishment of small units and which could be used as &ldquo;start-up&rdquo; workshops or offices for the creation of new employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the Industrial Development Authority have 212 small factory units totalling 771,000 sq. ft. ranging in size from 200 sq. ft. to 9,000 sq. ft. available for small industry at 71 locations throughout the country. Of these, 84 units totalling 302,000 sq. ft. are at present reserved for industrial projects. In addition, Shannon Development have 111 small industry units totalling 257,000 sq. ft. available at 36 locations in the mid-west region and west and southwest Offaly.  Forty-six of these units totalling 133,500 sq. ft. are reserved for industrial projects.  The remaining units are being actively promoted for suitable projects.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will already be aware that Shannon Development have pioneered the provision of low cost space to small industry based on the sharing of facilities and overheads in a single building.  This is known as the workspace concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1983 the IDA also commenced construction of 46,750 sq. ft. of small industry &ldquo;incubator units&rdquo; ranging in size from 500 to 1,000 sq. ft. at 14 locations throughout the country.  These units are particularly suitable for the start-up phase of the typical small industry project. There is also a significant volume of <Col N="270" /> privately owned factory space available principally in the larger centres of population which is suitable for small industry development.</P>
    <P>The demand for small industry units is being constantly monitored by the industrial development agencies.  As there is an adequate volume of small industry factory space available at present these agencies have no plans to adapt bigger factory units which are required for medium to large-sized industrial projects.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the information we have got here today would indicate that we are proceeding to erect factories and failing to purchase at a very low price factories at other locations?  Would the Minister not agree that it is time for a complete re-examination of industrial development generally following the reply to those questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first two questions posed by the Deputy I would not agree.  The advance factory building programme has been suspended for the time being until we can fill the many advance factories that are already available and are not filled.  As to the question of buying additional factories at what the Deputy claims is a low price &mdash; and I do not necessarily disagree with him &mdash; this would make sense if we were running short of advanced factory space, and it might be worth considering at some stage in the future.  Before we recommence an advance factory building programme we should look at the possibility of buying existing space.  However, some of this existing space is not particularly suitable for modern industry and this will have to be assessed on a case by case basis.  However, I agree with the last part of the Deputy's question which suggests that there should be a radical review of industrial policy, and this is in train.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can repeat what I have said already, which was that advance factories are not being built.  The IDA building programme continues under two major headings: (1) small incubator units for small industries which are of a type not sufficiently served at the moment; (2) what are known as special buildings where, rather than build advance factories on spec, they are building factories as part of a grant package for a particular project.  That part of the programme, of course, continues but those factories never remain empty because they are being built for a particular industry.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will consider, in consultation with the IDA expanding the enterprise centre concept to all counties in Ireland and thereby utilise some of the large number of vacant IDA advance factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the Industrial Development Authority have provided an enterprise centre in Pearse Street, Dublin, and also plan to construct a centre in Cork.  10,000 sq. ft. of small industry incubator units are being provided within the IDA's East Wall development which will embody some of the features of the Pearse Street centre. Enterprise centres of this nature are sustainable only in large centres of population. However, the IDA will monitor the progress of these centres and will review the question of establishing other centres as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development have provided two workspace centres at Limerick City and centres at Abbeyfeale and Kilfinane, County Limerick and Nenagh, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>In addition, the industrial development agencies have a range of small industry units available throughout the country suitable for the needs of the typical small industry and crafts project.</P>
      <P>As there is an adequate volume of small industry factory space available at present, the industrial development agencies have no plans to adapt bigger factory units which are required for medium to large industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I heard the Minister correctly to say that it is the belief that enterprise centres are not suitable except in large areas of population. Would he not agree with me that those enterprise centres can be made applicable in areas of much less population than the ones he spoke about?  Craft industry surely can be developed in the <Col N="273" /> more remote parts of Ireland and, rather than leaving factory space as it has been, vacant for quite some time and probably will be vacant for a long time in the future in the absence of any policy here to do anything about it, the Minister should consider the adaptation of them as enterprise centres on a temporary basis and see how they go.  We would be better off making some use of them than leaving them idle.  There is a great deal of talent in the craft and small industrial areas. Surely if you make the effort and give the opportunity to young people instead of having them roving the streets and getting into all sorts of vandalism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially a centralised share support service is provided by the IDA including common secretarial services, common accounting services, shared conference facilities and a common canteen.  Clearly, to make sense of these economics one requires that a number of projects would be located in relatively large centres in order to make them economical.  In that context one would tend to locate such centres in larger areas of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree there are plenty of opportunities around the country for young people to put their talents together?  Would he not provide the use of estates lying vacant around the country for such projects <Col N="274" /> rather than indulging in this bureaucratic nonsense?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully, and that is what we are doing in regard to smaller projects in areas where additional space is required.  The IDA are still continuing to build incubator factories suitable for such small projects.  SFADCo and the IDA will give plenty of opportunities for such projects and any lack of space will be responded to immediately by the building of new units.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it is my intention to restructure the entire policy, and that will be done.  I encourage the industrial development agencies to make arrangements in the regions, when that is suitable.  I believe there will be a significant number of larger projects coming in which will use the large units available. I intend to make sure that we will have <Col N="275" /> such factories available for large as well as small projects.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Minister has said, would he encourage the IDA to establish an enterprise system throughout the country in the many thousands of square feet of factory space unoccupied?  Surely the unemployed throughout the country are entitled to get the same opportunities as those in Dublin and Cork.  The Minister has been selective in regard to the enterprise idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony, Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Coogan</b> asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the cost of the IDA's planned new headquarters at the location of the former Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club; and if he is satisfied that such expenditure is justified or that the Industrial Development Authority need a headquarters in such a prestigious area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have allocated £2.4 million to the Industrial Development Authority in 1984 to cover the costs associated with the fitting out of, and removal to, the proposed new headquarters at Wilton Place.  Further expenditure of £2.1 million will be necessary in 1985.  The new building is being rented from the New Ireland Assurance Company Ltd., at rates equivalent to the current costs of new lettings of similar size in that location.  These arrangements are in pursuance of an irrevocable legal commitment entered into by IDA in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the IDA operate from six separate offices in Dublin.  This is unsatisfactory. In order to improve their services and to maximise their resources, <Col N="276" /> the Government decided it was necessary to provide the IDA with a central headquarters. The proposed location is in the same general area as their existing six offices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate what has happened to the six properties which will be vacated by the IDA when they move into their new headquarters? Is there truth in the rumour circulating that it is planned to spend £1 million on furniture for the new office block?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to the six offices varies.  In respect of a small proportion of them, the leases will be running out soon.  In regard to the others, arrangements are being made to dispose of the IDA's interest in those leases on the best possible terms.  As far as the cost is concerned, it is for the overall furnishing of the offices in question. I have made arrangements that before any of this money is spent a schedule of particular expenditures envisaged by the IDA must be submitted to me and approved by me and the Minister for Finance.  I cannot give the Deputy a breakdown of expenditure as between furniture and other fittings and services until I have that detailed information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate whether, before the move was planned by the IDA in 1980, there was approval from the Department for the move?  Is the Minister confident that the IDA will be able to dispose of their interest in the leasehold premises they have without suffering a loss in revenue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Departments of Finance and Industry approved the IDA proceeding with the Wilton Place lease in August 1980 and an agreement was signed by the IDA with the owners on 26 November 1980.  It is fair to say that the terms on which some of the existing space will be disposed of will not be as good in terms of income as the equivalent expenditure that will have to be made in respect of the new space.  However, the arguments in regard to centralising the <Col N="277" /> IDA services in one office relate to a number of matters to which I could refer if asked to do so, but I do not wish to.</P>

It certainly would be my wish that it should be Irish made and from what I have heard about one purchase they have in mind, in that case, at least, Irish made material is being bought.

      <P>I would not wish that they would buy anything but Irish products.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that there are requirements imposed by our membership of the EEC in regard to public purchases which must be complied with.  There is the question of ensuring that one will have what is suitable for the purpose for which it is intended.  Perhaps there are some items of equipment or furnishings which are not made in Ireland.  Clearly, those would have to be imported.  I would prefer not to get into a detailed breakdown but if the Deputy wants to put a specific question on the subject of the country of origin of the relevant purchases I will, of course, endeavour to supply the information.</P>

      <P>The review to which the Deputy refers is an internal review that was undertaken by SFADCo on their initiative.  It is a matter for them as to when the review is completed.  It was commenced in May 1983 and I understand it has been carried out mainly by their own staff, a fact on which I compliment them.  They rely to only a very modest extent on outside consultants and that is a very welcome trend in agencies of this kind.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The projection the Deputy is referring to was not the one as put in his question but rather a projection for net job creation, taking the number of new jobs created and subtracting from that the number of job losses.  The figure of 1,000 may have appeared in that context but, as I have indicated, the expected figure for new manufacturing jobs is between 11,000 and 12,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>These figures are net figures.  They refer to the number employed in manufacturing.  They take into account job losses and job gains.  The decline which commenced around 1979 has continued but recently there has been a marked deceleration in the rate of decline in manufacturing jobs.  I am on record as indicating I am hopeful that towards the end of the year we will begin to see, if the present favourable trends continue, job numbers in manufacturing begin to rise again.  Although we have <Col N="283" /> had a decline in manufacturing employment of 4 per cent since 1973 the decline in other countries has been much greater. It was 23 per cent in Denmark; 14.5 per cent in France; 22 per cent in the Netherlands; 26 per cent in the UK and 13.6 per cent in Germany.</P>

      <P>That plan relates to overall targets.  We are discussing a regional plan.  The IDA's plans in this area are being integrated into the Government's White Paper on Industrial Policy in accordance with the views expressed by a number of observers that it was important that policy and planning in this area should be made by the Government and that the IDA should execute Government policy rather than make policy for the Government, as was the case in the past.</P>

      <P>I am aware that unemployment in the north-east region has increased in recent years.</P>
      <P>However, within the past three months a number of new industrial projects have been announced for the region.  These include a new meat processing plant to be established by Ox-Fleisch Gmbh of West Germany in Carrickmacross, the successful take-over of Westinghouse in Dunleer by Glen Dimplex Group, the major expansion programme by castlebar Bacon Company Limited in Monaghan town and Co-operative Poultry Products in Cootehill and the new manufacturing venture by Town of Monaghan Co-op into yogurt and related dairy products.  Irish Meat Exports Limited are continuing to expand in Coolshannagh, County Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority are promoting a total of 335,000 sq. ft. of factory space at nine locations in the region together with 231 acres at 17 <Col N="289" /> locations for development of suitable small, medium and large industries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the main points which I want to make, I wish to refer to one matter mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition in his address &mdash; if &ldquo;address&rdquo; is the correct word &mdash; in opening this debate.  He said that I proposed to appoint &ldquo;a politically appointed board or council &mdash; call it what you will &mdash; to supervise the Central Statistics Office.  We reject that.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on the record of the House that on Monday, 28 May, I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition a letter <Col N="381" /> in the following terms, explaining first that the Government had decided &mdash; and I quote &ldquo;to establish this council for which provision is made in the Statistics Act, 1926&rdquo;.  I said that I believed the appointment of such a body, comprised of people of eminence in their field and with a suitable range of expertise, could be of considerable assistance in the development of that statistical service.  I named the people whom I proposed to appoint: the Deputy Director of the Economic and Social Research Institute; the Director of the Social Policy Centre, NIHE, Limerick; the Professor of Economics from the University of Ulster; Professor Sexton of the Economic and Social Research Institute, formerly on the staff of the CSO; Professor Robert Kelleher, a partner in DKM Economic Consultants employed by the all-party Forum to undertake the economic study for them; Professor Brendan Whelan, head of the survey unit in the Economic and Social Research Institute; and Professor Brendan Walsh, who is an acknowledged expert on demographic and manpower statistics and, indeed, on the question of economics generally.</P>
    <P>I went on to say:</P>
    <P>As you will see, I have endeavoured to select for the council a group of people with as wide as possible a range of relevant expertise.  In view of the crucial importance of the independence of the Central Statistics Office, I thought it right to inform you of my intentions in the matter.  Should there be any aspect on which you would wish for further clarification, I would, of course, be very happy to discuss this with you.</P>
    <P>I think it is perfectly clear that I intended to ensure, first of all, that the body concerned would consist of people of the highest repute with a relevant range of competence in the different areas that are appropriate for this purpose and that I was more than willing to discuss the matter with the Leader of the Opposition should he have any matters to raise with me.</P>
    <P>I told him that I intended to announce the appointment of the council at a statistical <Col N="382" /> seminar on Tuesday last; but, of course, when the debate on this statistical matter came to take place in the House, I had no alternative but to bring forward the announcement, because otherwise I could reasonably have been accused of concealing from the Dáil my intention to take action which might be regarded by some as having some relevance to the matter in hand.  The Leader of the Opposition did not, in fact, reply to my letter, but chose instead to stigmatise the proposed council as political.  I want to deny that imputation and to regret that he did not have any qualms in the matter and did not communicate with me before the debate in which he must have known that I would have to refer to the council, in view of the fact that I could otherwise be accused of withholding information from the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Taoiseach's guidance, I shall be calling the next speaker at 7.15 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I understand that. Having said that &mdash; and it is important to have that on the record, very important because it is vital that the independence of the Central Statistics Office be maintained &mdash; I want now to turn to more political matters and to say that the two outstanding characteristics of the present Opposition are the almost totally negative character of their criticisms and their failure to produce any coherent alternative to the policies which we are pursuing, and shall continue to pursue, with the courage which alone can being us through the multiple crises that we now face.  On the rare occasions when a constructive voice is heard from the other side of the House &mdash; as for example, in the latter part of the speech that Deputy Reynolds made here on the Adjournment debate last December &mdash; it has been dismissed with contumely by the Leader of the Opposition in a manner that must cast doubt upon his understanding of the role of an Opposition, or his comprehension of the process by which Oppositions get themselves returned to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure of the Opposition, and in particular their Leader, to evolve any <Col N="383" /> consistent or thought out economic policy has been quite remarkable.  Even by the standards of opportunism and party-politics, which perhaps have never been totally absent from political life in this or any other democracy, it has been, I think, almost unique.  We have all lost count at this stage of the number of U-turns that the Leader of the Opposition has performed on this subject.  If anybody, even on my side of the House, can count them accurately, I shall be interested to have the tally.  In so far as one can detect any particular policy stance at the end of this tortuous process, it appears to be one of facing in both directions at once.  In one of his more recent utterances on this subject, in an interview with <i>Business and Finance</i> magazine, he outlined a variety of ways in which more money should be spent and more tax reliefs given in order, he suggested, to generate additional growth in the economy.  Many of the suggestions were good enough in themselves and, were the money available, the Government might indeed have taken some, at any rate, of the actions which he recommended.  Where he completely failed, as on so many occasions in the past, was in facing up to the question of where this money was to come from.</P>
    <P>True, on this occasion he stopped short of his familiar proposal of earlier occasions that the money should be borrowed, on top of the debt already being accumulated because of the quite extraordinary and, indeed, disastrous expansion of spending during the period when he was in Government, first as a Minister and then as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>He confined himself in his argument to a simple suggestion that expenditure should be reduced by the amount required to release the sums of money needed for his various projects.  As to where these cuts might fall, he was notably silent, anxiously avoiding any of the unpopularity that might fall on his shoulders as a result of making any concrete suggestion even of the most limited kind as to the further cuts in expenditure that he would have recommended over and above those already undertaken by the <Col N="384" /> Government in the pruning operation involved in the recent budget.</P>
    <P>It is precisely this unwillingness to face any real issue, and the single-minded determination to avoid reality, that has condemned the Leader of the Opposition to two such electoral defeats and will condemn himself and his party to remain in Opposition until they are prepared to face up to the responsibilities inherent in the political process.  The realisation of that, I believe, exists in the Opposition party.  There are people who understand or recognise that, but they are inhibited by the particular structures and tensions of that party from doing anything to enable that party to play an effective role in opposition.</P>
    <P>As I was dictating these words in my own living room my eye lit upon a green covered Government publication of which for some reason I had two copies, entitled &mdash; the irony of it &mdash;<i>Development for Full Employment</i> and stamped &ldquo;Not for publication before 6 p.m., 16th June, 1978&rdquo;.  I went across to my bookshelf, and took down this document and found that in the fifth paragraph of its introduction it says &ldquo;This Green Paper proposes an ambitious programme for ending unemployment within five years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Three years later almost to the day, when they left office in June 1981, so far were Fianna Fáil from having achieved the full employment set out in this document as the target or main objective, something which they meant to do, that although the recession had but begun unemployment, far from having been eliminated as to three-fifths as it should have been if progress had been made towards the programme of full employment, was one-quarter higher than when that Green Paper was published &mdash; this despite the fact that during those three years they had doubled the national debt and trebled our borrowing abroad.</P>
    <P>That is the inheritance we received from Fianna Fáil.  We are having to clear away this rotten foundation in order to rebuild our shattered economy &mdash; a painful task, the immediate responsibility for which is being carried by the Minister for Finance with outstanding dedication and skill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the matter before the House, I would commend to any Government the manner in which it was handled by the Minister.  He ensured that when the first indications emerged of an identification in the balance of payments of some capital items as being current in character, he drew attention to this in the publication with the budget.  When information came to hand as to the precise magnitude of the adjustments made between the capital and current side, which involved no change in the total flows but only an identification of their character, that information was immediately published by the Central Statistics Office and it was given in the fullest detail to the House. The only intervention which I made in the matter was to ask that the Central Statistics Office would carry the series back to 1970 so as to give us greater continuity in the statistics.  However, I felt it wrong that the publication of the figures for the last five years should be held up while awaiting this and, therefore, felt that the figures should be published when available.  The earlier revised data would become available in due course when that work had been completed.</P>
      <P>In undertaking our task of recovering the economy from the disastrous shape in which it was left by our predecessors in office we have refused to adopt the easy expedience so beloved of the Opposition party under their present leadership. What we have done instead is to lay the foundations for future progress by halving the current deficit as a proportion of GNP which threatened us when we took over office for the first time nearly three years ago and by reducing the level of borrowing in terms of GNP by two-fifths which would have had to be attempted in 1982 if we had not taken things in charge within three weeks of being elected to office in mid-1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To have achieved that much in a period of just three years with an interruption of almost a year of Fianna Fáil Government, to have halved the current deficit <Col N="386" /> and reduced borrowing by two-fifths in terms of GNP, while not drastically deflating the economy, is, by any standards, a remarkable achievement and will be seen as such by any objective observer.  At the same time, we have not attempted to move too far, too fast.  We have tried to judge the pace of progress towards our fiscal targets with a careful eye to the need to ensure during the current year favourable conditions for domestic growth, stimulated by external recovery.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that many difficult tasks do not lie ahead.  Nobody should be under any illusion that, because of the shape of the budget this year, the problems have been resolved.  No, the damage done over those four years of Fianna Fáil will take at least an equivalent number of years to set right and, possibly, longer to set completely right but we have completed a large part of that work already. This year, we have deliberately paced the economy to give it a chance to recover in response to the recovery in the USA.  In the years ahead, in accordance with the national plan to be published in the next couple of months, we will be taking further action to narrow the gap between expenditure and revenue, action which inevitably must be concentrated primarily in the expenditure area, given the excessive level of taxation by any objective standards for a country at our stage of development.</P>
    <P>Upon these foundations we shall build in the months immediately ahead by producing a plan for the economy based on the recommendations of the independent National Planning Board which we have published in accordance with the principles of open Government which we have sought to adopt.  I should like, incidentally, to express my gratitude to the board for their outstanding contribution to the planning process.</P>
    <P>Our plans for the future development of this economy will be based upon the solid work of this independent board, due account being taken of any relevant and constructive views upon their recommendations that may emerge either in debate in this House &mdash; I hope that during the course of the evening something constructive <Col N="387" /> may emerge &mdash; or from other quarters.  The plan that emerges from this process will bear little resemblance to such documents as those produced by the Opposition party in 1978, the one of which I have two copies on my bookshelves or, again in 1982, <i>The Way Forward.</i> There will be no easy conjuring of 7 per cent growth rates out of the year, no facile assuming away of problems, no easy options designed to secure popularity rather than results, no use of the words &ldquo;we envisage&rdquo; five times on a page as a substitute for decisions and action.  By contrast, compared to what the Opposition produced in their recent periods in Government, our plan will be a sober document facing real issues and making hard choices.  We shall be content to be judged by its realism and by the results of the policies that will be built upon the foundations that it will lay, which will be solid, not tottering as were the foundations left to us by our predecessors in office.</P>
    <P>May I once again recall the words of Mr. Jack Lynch, then Taoiseach, in December 1977, when he told this House on the Adjournment debate of the solidity of the foundations that we left upon which his Government had to build.  That was one of the most remarkable tributes ever paid by one Government to a predecessor in office.  That is what he thought of our Government from 1973 to 1977.  I have told the House what I think of the Government from 1977 to 1981 and the people will decide what they think of the Government of 1982 to 1987.  I believe their verdict will be in favour of those willing to take the necessary action to restore the economic health of our society and to bring back some kind of hope for the future, which has been effectively extinguished by the manner in which our affairs were mishandled by Fianna Fáil over those disastrous years.</P>

      <P>I never cease to be amazed by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance coming into the House or going out into the public arena talking about doing U-turns, talking in forked tongues and everything else.  The Taoiseach had to finish up talking about 1981. Does he realise we are now in 1984, heading for half way through the term of office of this Government without a policy and a single word about any of the problems which affect the country without a plan on industrial policy, which we were promised last July.  We were told then it was before the Cabinet.  We have had mark one, mark two and mark three withdrawn and out of the way because there is no agreement at Cabinet level.  The only reason the Coalition are holding together and are not falling out is that they have not taken a decent decision since they came into office.  They have the hard neck to come in here with that sort of nonsense to try to confuse the issue for the electorate.  Judgment will be passed within the next 14 days on whether the Government have made any progress. This is 1984 not 1977, not 1981.  It is no wonder the young people and everybody else are turned off with the way politics have developed over the last number of years.</P>

There is no agreement in the Government on any coherent employment or industrial policy.  That is why I cannot get any information.  I had four questions at Question Time today to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. He gave the most arrogant reply I have ever heard in this House, to the effect that the information I sought was contained in the Library in the IDA annual reports for the past three years.  I suggest that the Taoiseach talk to the Minister.  The information I sought is not available in the way I want it.  I asked him to be forthcoming with the information so that I could formulate some view on the policy being pursued in relation to industrial development.  He fobbed me off by telling me to use the services of the House.  The people who elected me would expect a Minister to be prepared to hand that information to an Opposition Deputy.

      <P>Everybody is getting hot under the collar tonight.  The truth always hurts and the Chair cannot keep the Government side quiet.  I sat here quietly and took it on the chin from those <Col N="392" /> guys and I expect them to take it in return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any point in trying to debate anything here tonight if I am not to be allowed to do so?  The role of a Taoiseach is to be sincere and sincerity needs to be proven.  As far as the people are concerned the sincerity of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance is not proven.  The credibility of the Government is sinking fast, as they will learn if they campaign in the election. The reason is that they are interested only in diversionary tactics, cosmetic politics and getting their handlers to disseminate new types of information which are of no interest because they have no bearing on the economy.  The more the Government keep those media management people around them the more credibility will be lost by this House and every Member.  People do not believe anything any more.</P>
      <P>It is the lowest form of political opportunism when a mistake has been made to try to blame civil servants and to suggest that civil servants in the Department of Finance withheld information or did not pass it on.  That is the kind of innuendo being put out by the Government handlers. It is disgraceful to try to denigrate the Civil Service who have served the country so well.  Clearly there is a problem in the CSO.  Why not reorganise it? There is enough modern technology to enable the production of monthly statements. It can be done in London in relation to a far more diverse economy than ours.  We cannot get the information 18 months later and we are operating on estimates, that is no way to manage the country or even a business.  Why not get things right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is political opportunism of the highest order to announce that a watchdog committee is to be appointed. We must get the management of the CSO right.  We cannot talk about planning the <Col N="393" /> economy unless the basic statistics are right.</P>
      <P>Only two weeks ago I asked a question in this House in relation to emigration figures which are highly relevant in the planning process, if that process ever takes place.  The figures are about 18 months out of date.  We all know that young people are flocking from this country. They cannot get work permits in America but they are taking their chances with holiday visas.  They are going to England where the economy seems to be on the upturn, certainly in some sectors. They are going to France and to Australia, anywhere they can go.  Those figures are highly relevant, yet we do not have them.  Instead of sorting out these problems we are appointing a watchdog. To try to pass the buck to higher civil servants or people in the CSO is reneging on ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>The Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924 clearly states that the Minister is responsible for all actions.  We should be looking forward, not going back to the past and I am not interested in discussing who did what and when. The Taoiseach talks about how much the national debt has been raised but we know from the Central Bank figures that Coalition Governments of whatever hue and whatever year are responsible for almost 60 per cent of the national debt.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach tried to lecture me on U-turns.  I will remind him of a few U-turns which are fundamental to what we are discussing.  During the very short period in 1982 when I was Minister for Industry and Energy a Private Members' motion was tabled by Fine Gael on the closure of the Fieldcrest factory. In 1982 they called on me, as Minister, and on the Government of the day to pour millions of pounds of taxpayers' money into an industry that they knew in their hearts and souls could not be sustained. Yet they were prepared for political opportunism and expediency to come in here, and the Taoiseach led them up those steps to vote putting taxpayers' money into an industry that was dead, for which the market had gone and which had no chance.  The Government were defeated on that motion.  For the first time we exposed the political opportunism. But we do not operate the media handlers or these professionals who go around perpetrating that sort of nonsense.</P>
      <P>
        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the record of this House will show.  If the party opposite want to revert to the period 1973 to 1977 there was then an incident in which £10 million of taxpayers' money was invested under the previous Coalition Government when not an ounce of ore was ever mined here as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later in 1982, when I took the politically courageous decision to close Ardmore Studios, there was another Private Members' motion in this House, supported by Fine Gael and Labour, the great people over there who talk honesty, integrity and credibility.  What did they do?  They paraded up those steps for the second time saying &ldquo;Put more taxpayers' money into Ardmore Studios&rdquo; when everbody knew it was dead and had no relevance to the development of our film <Col N="395" /> industry.  Indeed, what is wrong with our film industry here is what is wrong with most other industries in this country &mdash; and I hope I shall have time to come to them &mdash; that is, the intolerable burden of taxation that is crippling them.</P>
    <P>If the people opposite want another one, I might say that I closed Avoca Mines to save taxpayers' money.  Then we entered the General Election of 1982 when off went the Taoiseach, his Minister for Education &mdash;she is here &mdash; and the present Minister for the Environment &mdash; here also &mdash; down to Wicklow where there was a possibility of them losing their seats.  They gave a commitment to pay £1 million of taxpayer's money to the workers of Avoca Mines from whom I had withstood the pressure for three weeks during the election and for six weeks previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had enough of that; the people of the country are sick and tired of it.  If the Taoiseach wants to continue along that road I will take him on for an hour or two any day of the week.  What I and the people of this country are concerned about is why this money disappeared &mdash; everybody knows it has gone.  For anybody to suggest to the intelligent people of this country that it simply does not matter a damn is an insult.  It matters to a person receiving a bill for £100 or £1,000 income tax any day this week.  It is contended that the collection of tax is so important that there will be court cases; yet when £500 million disappear out of the country without anybody knowing, it does not matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can tell the people opposite that if the &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; exposed in this situation <Col N="396" />&mdash; and indeed the bog holes exposed last week and which will be exposed over the next week or so in Laois-Offaly &mdash; is not taken seriously by this Government and if they are not prepared to come out with a taxation policy that will restore people's confidence to invest in this country, then that sort of money will continue to flow out of the country.</P>
    <P>Legitimate business people here, who have set up firms, have been legislated out of existence because of the taxation policies pursued by the present Minister for Finance &mdash; and he does not appear to know what makes anything tick or what makes anything work.  Does he know that he is pushing them further into the black economy every day?  The white economy is there but is being squeezed out of existence. The black economy is being developed by legitimate business people here because, due to the intolerable levels of VAT, they cannot see a way of remaining in business unless through the black economy.  It is those levels of VAT which have driven so much business up to the North of Ireland.  For instance, take the town of Clones where 6 per cent of the television sets bought are bought locally, the rest coming from you know where. Take a similar town, Bandon in County Cork, about which some Deputies were shouting a minute ago, 76 per cent of the television sets there are bought locally. We know the loss of money to the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the outflow of money across the Border.  But the Government do not want to listen to reality, which is simply that if they want to continue legislating to push people to the pin of their collars, putting them out of business, the downward spiral of employment in industry will continue.  The Government are legislating and taxing them out of existence.</P>

This evening I ask the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance to ponder: are they sure there is light at the end of the tunnel, or is it a train coming the other way?  That is what I believe it is.

      <P>Listening to Deputy Reynolds I could not help but think that the weaker the argument the stronger the words.  There is nothing involved in this motion except that, once again, the Opposition have invited the House to contribute to the debasing of the political system and of politicians generally.  It is being done for two clear, current reasons, one, the fact that there is a European election campaign taking place, perhaps badly for some of the former Ministers for Finance who are candidates in that election.</P>

      <P>Have we not now reached the stage at which motions of no confidence have been debased?  The entire coinage of the concept of motions of no confidence has fallen into disrepute in view of the fact that consistently since 1980 motions of no confidence of one kind or another have been tabled regularly in the Leader of the Opposition, not by this party, not by the Labour Party, not by any other group in this House but consistently from within the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party at boringly regular intervals &mdash; motions of no confidence of <Col N="400" /> one form or another have been tabled and debated <i>ad nauseam</i> within and without the Fianna Fáil Party both at parliamentary and grassroots level.</P>

The motion of no confidence is, as the Taoiseach said earlier, coming from people who promised in 1978 to abolish the concept of unemployment within five years.  It is from the people who two years ago added a new word to the English language, gubu.  It is from the people whose record in Government was one of a continuous litany of sorrows, of errors, of staggering from one crisis to another, of cant, humbug and, above all else, of failing to face up to realities.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's budget was the one that suggested that the current budget deficit would be £353 million but it turned out to be £515 million. Deputy O'Kennedy's budget was the one that suggested the Exchequer borrowing requirement to be £896 million but it was over 33? per cent more than that, £1,217 million.  He read about that later.  He was the one who suggested that the Exchequer borrowing requirement, as a percentage of GNP, would be 10.4 per cent but it was 14.5 per cent.  It is a good job that the Deputy did not take up a career as an airline pilot because one would expect that if he had headed for Tipperary he would be lucky to end up in Sligo.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy was succeeded by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald who said in his budget statement that the balance of payments deficit could increase.  In fact, the figures published were £1,389 million and they were revised last week to £1,595 million.  He was followed by Deputy MacSharry, another candidate in the European elections. Deputy MacSharry suggested there would be no change in the balance of payments deficit.  In fact, the forecast came out as £1,041 million but the deficit turned out to be £1,316 million.  Are they the type of people who can quote figures to us now as being sacrosanct?  The leader of their party said last night that liaison between the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Central Statistics Office was shown to be lamentable but later he said that up to now the country had always totally objective impartial statistics produced by a completely independent office.  We have to decide whether or not the statistics are accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil produced a document, <i>The Way Forward,</i> and in the foreword to that document, produced in October <Col N="402" /> 1982, the Leader of Fianna Fáil who was then Taoiseach said that the plan had been prepared with great care and with the aid of the best advice available.  He said that all relevant facts and figures had been assembled and all the calculations carefully made.  They are the same calculations that were made on the information available from the Central Statistics Office, information which was, as we recognised some months ago, incomplete and has now been corrected.  However, the information was claimed at that time by that Taoiseach to be the best possible advice carefully compiled.  Yet in the House last night he put forward arguments in relation to the operation of the Central Statistics Office on the one hand and, on the other, objected to the appointment of a statistical council to improve the position.</P>
    <P>I had some difficulty in following Deputy Haughey's argument last night just as I had some difficulty in following the argument of Deputy Lenihan who arrived fresh from the debate to expel the prophet O'Malley from the promised land of Fianna Fáil and spoke about the difference in ideology between the parties in Government.  The ideological gulf within the Fianna Fáil Party is so immense that it is difficult to assess.  However, it was an improvement on the part of Deputy Lenihan in that it was the first time we had discovered that he realised there was such a thing as a political ideology in the operation of practical politics. Later in his contribution that Deputy told us that politics were about serious business.  It was nice for us to discover that after 25 years the light of the Holy Ghost had dawned upon him to give him that piece of information.</P>

      <P>Last night the Leader of the Opposition suggested that inflation had not come down significantly but had fallen somewhat. Let us again have a look at the record of Ministers for Finance since 1979.  The estimate in that year was that inflation would be 8.6 per cent but it was 13.2 per cent.  In 1980 Deputy O'Kennedy said prices would go up and, in his half year review, said the rate would fall but it went from 13.2 per cent to 18.2 per cent.  In 1981 Deputy Gene Fitzgerald said it would be slower and half-way through the year he said it would be moderated later on but inflation turned out to be 20.4 per cent, not exactly very successful statistics from previous holders of the office.  Yet, the forecast made by the present Minister in his budget last year has been realised.  The country is on target in the most difficult situation imaginable. I do not think we are in a situation where the publication of these revised figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to reject the serious allegation made last night that the Minister for Finance deliberately endeavoured to suppress figures which were available to him earlier this year.  The economic background to the budget, published in conjunction with the budget, clearly shows that that was not the situation as did the Minister's reply to Deputy O'Kennedy's parliamentary question on 7 February last.  Having worked with the Minister for Finance I do not think any Minister could have been expected to give greater application, attention or dedication to his task than the Minister has done.  His record, and his performance on a daily basis, contrasts extremely well with the record of the Deputy I suspect will speak next and of his colleagues who are at present <Col N="405" /> campaigning for election to another parliament. Having listened to the contributions from the Opposition benches I say that their grasp of public finances, no more than their grasp of the political realities, would make one think that in comparison to them headless chickens would qualify for the final of Mastermind.</P>

      <P>It is to be regretted that an occasion should arise or be allowed to arise where it was incumbent on the Opposition parties to place a motion of no confidence on a Minister in Government. I do not believe that my party had any choice other than to proceed with a motion of no confidence in view of the monumental blunder which has emerged in the balance of payments deficit and in the budget which the Minister for Finance brought before this House which was based on figures other than what are now known to be the correct figures.  It is possibly evidence of the concern felt by the Government that, to justify their defence of their Minister and their falsely based budgetary strategy, they have sought to descend to some personal attack on people in and outside this House.  It would have been more appropriate if they had confined their remarks to the matter under debate.  Last night the Minister said in his speech:</P>
      <P>We knew at that stage that a revision of the balance of payments figures would be required but we did not know what the size of the revisions would be. We knew at that stage that the revision would be on the current side.</P>
      <P>It is clear from what the Minister said then that the true situation was known for a considerable time and, as Deputy Haughey rightly alleged in his contribution, the Minister presented a budget based on information known to be false. Surely this is sufficient grounds for our demand that he resign.  Last night the Minister for Finance effectively admitted that there had been a cover-up.</P>

      <P>He said:</P>
      <P>I want to say categorically that I have not withheld information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and that he knew about the revision of the balance of payments and that it would be on the current side.  The residual outflows of the &ldquo;black hole&rdquo;, as it has properly been called, were identified in the Central Bank report for the fourth quarter of 1983, before the budget, as £837 million.  If the Minister knew the revision would be on the current side, that means that he knew that over 50 per cent of the £837 million identified by the Central Bank or at least £500 million extra would be on the current side, that is the balance of payments.  Despite this, he continued to make claims about the balance of payments deficit being only £350 million or 2.5 per cent of GNP when he knew that it would be at least £850 million.  It turned out to be £863 million. Therefore, he was making claims he knew to be fraudulent.</P>
      <P>Over the years the balance of payments deficit has always been a major factor in determining budgetary policy and it is incredible to hear the Minister for Finance telling us that it matters little whether the deficit was £350 million or £850 million.  It may be embarrassing for the Minister to admit to the real effects such a balance of payments deficit will have, but the Minister's embarrassment is of little concern when the credibility of our financial institutions is at stake.  What other country in the world would allow a Minister for Finance to pass up such a grave blunder as not being of any great consequence?</P>

      <P>Our parliamentary system is based on the principle that Ministers are accountable to Parliament for all their actions.  Parliamentary tradition would have it that Ministers who make serious blunders would themselves offer their <Col N="407" /> resignations.  I think that I am in a position to call on the Minister to do the honourable thing on this occasion.</P>
      <P>It has been a constant plea of this Government that severe taxation levels and restrictions on Government expenditure would have to be imposed until the national finances were brought back into line.  The implementation of this rigid policy has made bankrupt hundreds of firms, put tens of thousands out of work, made Ireland a very unattractive place to invest, removed the incentive to work and stifled initiative, brought poverty and idleness to thousands of homes where these were never experienced previously, wiped out half the building contractors in the country and put nearly one in every two building workers on the dole.  It has resulted in the Government abandoning their stated policy of providing 30,000 new homes and added to the misery of thousands of families who will now have to wait years before getting suitable accommodation.  The misery of hunger, idleness and homelessness has been the result of this Government's policy of so-called financial rectitude.  Yet this Minister, who lectures us on these matters, has got his sums wrong, not just to the extent of a few thousand pounds or even a few million pounds but to the extent of £500 million, a sum so large, so daunting that few people can comprehend its magnitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance time and time again has told us how much out of line our balance of payments was, that it represented too high a percentage of GNP and how necessary it would be to reduce the deficit.  We were led to believe that this Government planned their budgetary strategy on this basis.  Up to last week we were told that the evidence of success of Government policies was to be seen in the reduction in the balance of payments from 8.5 per cent of GNP to 2.5 per cent of GNP.  What then are we expected to believe of this Government's policies if the evidence is now, on the Minister's own admission, seen to be false and inaccurate to the extent of £500 million?  That is equivalent to 6.5 per cent of GNP and not the 2.5 per cent boasted up to last <Col N="408" /> week.  The blunder of the Minister for Finance is monumental and cannot now be dismissed by the Government's sudden conversion to the belief that the size of the balance of payments does not matter anyway and will not affect the overall financial strategy in their budget.  This Government's credibility is now at stake. To restore confidence they should remove the person who presided over this blunder and, through the appointment of a new Minister for Finance, seek to restore some credibility and confidence in their administration and their policies.</P>
    <P>The most disturbing aspect of the difficulties affecting the Irish economy at present is that neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Finance seems to know how to deal with the problems successfully. Economic commentators once favourable to the Government are now forecasting an economic crash in 1986. All the signs are that things will not improve without a major shift in Government policies and in the philosophies to which they have been adhering, but must we all sit and wait until all of this happens? Surely the Minister for Finance carries the greates responsibility to those who have already become unemployed or are employed and now facing redundancy, and also to businesses caught between the Government-imposed increased costs and falling consumer demand caused by excessive Government-imposed taxes.  The citizens of this country are at the mercy of a Government who are failing to fulfil their responsibilities but who, despite this, will continue in office.  Why?  Because of the support of a pathetic group of discredited Labour Party Deputies who are already scared stiff to go out and face the electorate, had to postpone local elections and are trembling at the outcome of the European elections which they could not avoid and which must take place next week.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance controls the financial allocations to each Government Department.  Investment strategy is determined by him, controlled by him and regularly monitored and revised by him.  Every penny spent from Exchequer <Col N="409" /> sources supplied through his Department has the explicit approval of the Minister for Finance.  He alone is in the ultimate responsible for advising his colleagues in Government on the extent of the funds available and the potential for further revenue raising, and he alone reports on income and expenditure trends evident in the economy.  If the Minister for Finance gives wrong, misleading or inadequate information to his colleagues in a Cabinet meeting to decide Government expenditure strategy, then surely he is guilty of gross incompetence and negligence and only one honourable course is open to him, which is to resign.  That is the time-honoured course for men of honour to take who blunder in the portfolio with which they have been entrusted.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of Ireland today is quantified by the numbers of people unemployed and the ever-increasing number of those people who, because of the length of time they are unemployed, are now suffering a major drop in their standard of living.  When there is a transfer from unemployment benefit to the smaller unemployment assistance payments, long-term unemployment has a demoralising effect on families.  It increases despair resulting in higher crime levels and, sadly in some cases, even suicide.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to deal with this problem and we are entitled to criticise the Government who so far do not seem to have grasped its extent and the need for immediate positive measures to deal with it.  Instead, we have had a series of Government decisions reflecting lack of faith in our people's ability to respond to the problem.</P>
    <P>In the environment area Government action has resulted in one negative decision after another, sledgehammer blows to morale and confidence.  The whole local government system is collapsing. Funds have been withdrawn, long-standing schemes for essential services have been cancelled or severely restricted, the main and county roads are breaking up and the tarring of country lanes in western counties has practically come to a <Col N="410" /> halt.  Major water and sewerage schemes are being curtailed and essential treatment works are being omitted, in some cases leading to pollution of our beautiful waterways.  Group water supply schemes are at a standstill throughout the country. The number of local authority houses being built is being reduced.  Road workers are being made permanently redundant in county councils and corporations. Water charges have been imposed by this Minister to compensate for the failure of his Government to fulfil obligations to provide adequate funds for local councils.  Local elections have been put off to avoid having to answer to the people for the destruction of local democracy.</P>
    <P>We have seen the influence of the Minister for Finance in the withdrawal of Gaeltacht road grants.  We have seen his refusal to give adequate funds to Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann.  We have seen the reduction and the withdrawal of farmers' dole in thousands of cases in the west, reducing the people's poor standard of living even further.  The lime subsidy has been withdrawn and the farm modernisation scheme made ineffective.</P>
    <P>The list is endless and it all rests at the door of the Minister for Finance because all of these decisions were influenced by the allocations made available by the Department of Finance with his approval, his personal decisions.</P>
    <P>Last week we heard of the Government's refusal to provide promised jobs at Ballyforan peat briquette factory in the west.  In reply to a parliamentary question today I was informed that the Minister for Finance has decided to let the ESB close down the turf burning electricity station at Screeb near Rossmuck in the Connemara Gaeltacht.  Week after week these decisions are emanating from the Government with the approval of the Minister for Finance, and indeed influenced by him.  Two hundred men in my constituency supplied turf to the Screeb station, managing to supplement their incomes.  That station is to be closed, to become another empty building, another monument to the failure of the Minister for Finance, who is a subject of this motion of no confidence.</P>

      <Col N="411" /> I am informed also that the Minister has decided to close down the Miltown Malbay generating station.  All I can say is shame on him, shame on his Government who let him do this.  The people of Connemara have received a vote of no confidence from the Minister for Finance and will fully support me tonight in my expression of no confidence in him.  He was a disaster at bookkeeping, a disaster for Ireland and a particular disaster for the people of the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The answers of Coalitions in the past was emigration.  Sadly, as we saw here earlier this week, the President of the great United States of America came as a descendant of one of those emigrants. Nowhere in Ireland has suffered as much from emigration as the western counties, particularly mine, because it was the policy of all Coalitions to encourage emigration. The failure of the Government in every area means that they are offering emigration once again to the youth of Ireland.  We in Fianna Fáil brought emigration to an end.  We stopped that haemorrhage of our youth, of our people, who had to leave home since the time of the Famine, that terrible drain on which people wrote books about the disappearing Irish.  Because of the policies adopted by this Government it seems that emigration will again be the only hope for our youth.</P>
    <P>I ask the House fully to support our motion which is justified on all the grounds I have given and because of the reasons given by other members of my party, and on many other scores.  I regret the occasion arose but it was necessary to put down this motion of no confidence.</P>

      <P>I want to take up a point made by Deputy Molloy about money being missing and sums wrong.  What is the point in coming in here and repeating something he knows to be incorrect?  This charge was made last week by the leader of his party.  It was explained clearly, in simple terms that even Deputy Molloy could understand &mdash; Deputy Haughey understood it &mdash; by the Minister for Finance last week, and all correspondents <Col N="412" /> since then got it right.  But Deputy Molloy comes in here and talks about sums wrong and money missing.  He should know that is not correct.  Deputy Reynolds waxed eloquent half an hour ago.  He said politics was being brought into disrepute.  Deputy Molloy has just added his shovelful of dirt to that disrepute. Shame on him.  Look who has contributed to this debate.  They are people who had the cheek to contribute to a debate on a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Finance &mdash; Deputies Haughey, Lenihan, Reynolds, Molloy and, I presume, Deputy O'Kennedy will conclude.</P>
      <P>Everyone of these was a member of Fianna Fáil Government between 1977 and 1981 when the damage done to this country and its economy and the future of our young men and women will not be removed for almost a generation.  Those people presided over that downward plunge of the economy, but have the cheek to come in here tonight to support a vote of no confidence in the Minister for Finance.  They should be ashamed to come into the House at all, even as backbenchers, not to mind contributing to a vote of no confidence in the Minister for Finance.  There have been two notable exceptions from the debate tonight and yesterday, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, who is present, and Deputy MacSharry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Why do they not tell us, or were they not nominated by their party to come in? Deputy O'Kennedy might give Deputy <Col N="413" /> Fitzgerald some of his time to tell us what he knows as a former Minister for Finance.  I am exonerating Deputy O'Kennedy because, as we heard earlier, he went to Europe early when he had a look at the books and saw the mess the economy was getting into.  He went to Europe and left Deputy Gene Fitzgerald to carry the can.  If there was something wrong about which Deputy Molloy has been blaming Deputy Dukes, Deputy Fitzgerald must know something about it and Deputy O'Kennedy should give him time to explain his role in this, and that of Deputy MacSharry.  Deputy Reynolds told us that industry here has been ruined.  This comes from a member of a Government that placed the greatest load ever imposed on industry here, the VAT at the point of entry.  Deputy Reynolds said business confidence has been lost. That, more than any other measure imposed by any other Government, damaged industry here, with the exception of one other thing, the famous Talbot deal. Think of the stroke that did for confidence in industry here.  Those gentlemen over there should be out apologising to the youth of the country for the damage they have done to their future.</P>

      <P>This motion of no confidence is tabled by us on the basis of assertions made by the Minister to the Dáil when he knew or ought to have known that those assertions were not true.  In his Budget Statement on 25 January he not only understated the balance of payments deficit for 1983 but used the grossly understated deficit to proclaim that confidence had been considerably boosted by the reduction achieved in the Exchequer borrowing requirement and by the improvement in the balance of payments in 1983.  He said that the balance of payments deficit was reduced from 8½ per cent of GNP in 1982 to about 2½ per cent in 1983.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheehan, now that I have his name, can make his speech some other time.  In the <i>Economic Background to the Budget</i> which was issued by the Department of Finance on the instructions of the Minister, which is the way it is always done, it was stated that there was a further improvement in the balance of payments for 1983 which reflected in part the reduction of three percentage points in the relative size of the Exchequer borrowing requirement. We are now seeing a linkage based on a mis-stated balance of payments deficit and an Exchequer borrowing requirement. Evidently, if one is wrong so is the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the budget the Minister increased the Exchequer borrowing requirement from £1,756 million in 1983 to £1,884 million in 1984.  He increased the current budget deficit to £1,089 million compared with the outturn for 1983 of £960 million which, as we all know, was already £63 million more than the 1983 budget estimate.  These figures alone make a nonsense of the Government's claim to reduce the current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement much less eliminate them as was promised in their election programme.</P>
      <P>Turning to the series of statements the Minister made in the House subsequently, I asked him specifically to comment on the unrecorded outflow of at least £800 million &mdash; it was in fact £863 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>......the revisions are unlikely to alter significantly the improvement in the trend to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thereby deliberately repeated the false statement that had been circulated by his Department in paragraph 15 of the <i>Economic Background to the Budget</i> which was issued two weeks previously.  When I challenged him again on that same date specifically on the components of that unrecorded outflow, mentioning especially the repatriation of profits by multinationals, unrecorded outflow to Northern Ireland and money being transferred illegally from the country, the Minister replied that he did not accept that the level of this residual indicated <Col N="416" /> uniquely or unambiguously any of the things to which I had referred.  In the meantime the Central Statistics Office report which has greatly embarrassed the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These are apart from the as yet unidentified residual of £293 million to which I shall return later.  They were deliberate misstatements of fact on the part of the Minister on two occasions. At that time even the most casual perusal of the Central Bank Bulletin issued two weeks earlier would have confirmed both the size and the components of the deficit. Subsequent newspaper comments to which I referred the Minister in the course of the questions of 7 February confirmed that also.  Months later the CSO merely confirmed something that was evident before the Budget Statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That report has confirmed that there was an unrecorded outflow of £863 million, £513 million of which was due to the repatriation of profits. The Minister and the Government owe an explanation not only to the Dáil for these misrepresentations but perhaps even more seriously to our creditors abroad from whom we borrowed £677 million in the early months of this year and with whom we renegotiated the terms of existing loans in those crucial months.</P>

      <P>The renegotiations were conducted on the basis of a stated <Col N="417" /> balance of payments deficit which even then was known to be £500 million less than the actual figure.  So much for the Minister's story of confidence and of creditworthiness. The Minister claimed in his Budget Statement, in referring to the reduction in current budget and balance of payments deficits, that this performance had restored credibility to the whole budget process.  Not only is this assertion manifestly untrue but it makes a mockery of the credibility which is vital to our national and international creditworthiness. The Minister was forced to acknowledge publicly for the first time yesterday and I quote:</P>
      <P>We knew at the time that the balance of payments revision would be on the current side... I said the figures would finally bear out the underlying trend and that proved to be so.</P>
      <P>That is an indefensible assertion.  Any Minister who was capable yesterday evening, even in the face of all these facts, of saying that those figures would bear out the underlying trend and it proved to be so, has already forfeited the confidence of this House.</P>

      <P>The Joint Committee on Public Expenditure was prevented from investigating this matter after it had been proposed by honourable members of the Minister's party who were concerned about it.  It is time to establish a Dáil committee to review the Government's foreign borrowing and foreign exchange policy.  In the first three months of this year the Government borrowed abroad £677 million or 85 per cent of last year's total foreign borrowing.  In view of the fact that the Government are using taxpayers' money, as every Government does, at a level of £1½ billion to remunerate foreign borrowing, it is time to establish control over their level of public expenditure.  Our total foreign indebtedness at the end of 1983 was £8,960 million, an increase of £2,000 million on the total at the end of 1982.  The Government's disastrous devaluation decision, which we clearly and resolutely opposed in March 1983, has added significantly to the level of inflation.</P>

Pending the return of a Government with policies for renewal and development and a <Col N="422" /> Government who know that their fundamental obligation is to create a climate in which the people can do for themselves, not a Government which has a Minister for Finance who says his priority is to &ldquo;regulate and control tax revenue&rdquo;, will the Government allow us in the various committees to agree on fact and work together to achieve what they obviously cannot?</P>
      <P>We have evidence of them trying to appeal to various influences.  We had the extraordinary statement by the Tánaiste when he tried to create a diversion by attacking the banks for abusing the people.  Who are abusing the people? Can the Government speak with one mouth?  Can they speak with a consistent mouth and give us the facts as they are and not as they distort them as they did on this issue?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27a:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 9, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.&mdash;Notwithstanding anything in section 1, sections 3 to 8 shall not come into operation on a day earlier than a day on which a Garda Síochána Complaints Commission is established.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment was put down to indicate the importance of a Garda Síochána Complaints Commission.  The Minister introduced two explanatory memoranda in relation to this Bill.  The supplementary memorandum stated:</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Bill is being issued with an explanatory memorandum which, as is normal, is confined to a factual explanation of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To supplement the factual material in the explanatory memorandum, the Minister for Justice wishes to state, for the information of Deputies and Senators, that the Government has decided, on his recommendation, that those provisions of the Bill giving increased powers to the Garda <Col N="429" /> Síochána and which will come into operation only when a Ministerial order to that effect is made, will not be brought into force until a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal has been established.</P>
    <P>At the very outset the Minister gave an undertaking on behalf of the Government that an independent Garda complaints procedure would be established. Our objection at that time was that we felt that such independent complaints procedure should have been included with the Bill in the first instance and that the provision of a supplementary explanatory memorandum indicated that it was a last minute addition to the Bill, that its details had not been worked out and, consequently, that the Minister had no option but to give an undertaking that a complaints procedure would be introduced in conjunction with the Bill and that certain sections would not come into operation until that procedure was implemented.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions since we have suggested that such a complaints procedure should be provided in the interim period so that it could be assessed in conjunction with the Bill.  What we originally circulated on the Order Paper of 10 April 1984 was the establishment of a Garda Síochána Complaints Commission. It is our view that a commission should be established, that it must be an independent, statutory commission.  It is our view also that such a commission should be appointed by the Government, that its chairman should be appointed directly by the Government, that its members should be appointed on the nomination of the Minister for Finance and appointed by the Government also. Its chairman should be a barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years standing, that its membership should include representatives of vocational and community interests and a representative of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>In contending that the detention powers we have discussed here should not come into operation until such a complaints procedure is established we are <Col N="430" /> echoing the views expressed originally by the O Briain Committee in their recommendation No. 59 which read:</P>
    <P>The investigation of complaints by members of the public against the Garda Síochána should be brought into line with more enlightened practice in Western Europe.  A Complaints Tribunal with a strong independent element should be set up.  We do not feel called upon to spell out how its membership should be composed, although the desirability of having an expert penologist and an experienced criminal lawyer suggests itself.  Whatever its composition, the membership should be clearly so impartial and above any suggestion of bias that it would earn the respect and co-operation of both Garda Síochána and public. We cannot emphasise too strongly our belief that any such Tribunal must have the wholehearted support of the Gardaí if it is to function effectively, and no effort should be spared to secure the goodwill of the several Representative Bodies.  Whatever procedure is adopted for dealing with complaints, no suggestion of double jeopardy should arise.  We so recommend.</P>
    <P>They recommended the establishment of a complaints tribunal and that the investigation of complaints by members of the public against the Garda Síochána should be brought into line with more enlightened practice in Western Europe.  There are some divided views about this.  There has been some concern expressed by the Garda as to whether this would be a good or bad thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment is to delay the coming into operation of certain sections until a complaints commission has been established. I suppose, while it might not be in order <Col N="431" /> to go into the complaints commission in great depth, the Chair thinks it is permissible to refer to it in making a case for delaying the coming into operation of the sections until its establishment.  I know the Deputy will not make a meal of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made a meal of anything yet and I have been here a long time.  In the first instance I had an amendment down suggesting the establishment of a complaints tribunal and I was told that that had been ruled out of order.  I then put down this amendment which related to the coming into operation of the sections in question.  I have no desire to go into any great detail but it is relevant to this part of the Bill.  While there may have been reservations earlier about the kind of complaints procedure which I foresee &mdash; and about which I am speaking here &mdash; I believe that amongst the Garda themselves at present there is an increasing interest being shown in having established an independent, statutory complaints body.  From the beginning the Garda themselves welcomed the establishment of an independent complaints procedure.  Indeed the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors recommended strongly that there be established an independent complaints procedure and they have set out their views on how such might operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Garda News</i> of April 1984 the Garda Representative Body gave their views on what should be an independent complaints procedure.  They concluded that there should be one established, that it should be fair and impartial, provide for thorough investigation, be designed to ensure that there is no undue delay in processing claims and allow for the separation of matters of a serious nature from those of a minor nature and various other things.  They spelled out clearly what they required and saw as being necessary. Certainly they agreed that the establishment of a complaints procedure was necessary.  I might quote from that <i>Garda Review</i>, volume 12, No. 4, at page 29 under the heading &ldquo;Extracts from the Address of Michael F. Murray,&rdquo;..... <Col N="432" /> the member of the National Executive on the Criminal Justice Bill when he said:</P>
    <P>.... it is clear that some independent element is going to be introduced into the Complaints Procedures .... The basic question we must ask ourselves here is do we agree with the introduction of an independent element?  There are strongly opposing views on this. Some feel that it might be unduly restrictive and singles out the police profession for special attention while others, such as lawyers, doctors and so on, can continue to conduct their own disciplinary business in private.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murray continued:</P>
    <P>If we honestly and sincerly want to have contact with, and support from the community, we must stop thinking of ourselves as a brotherly band beleagured by hostile forces and start thinking of ourselves more as public servants within a specialised law enforcement organisation.</P>
    <P>I put it to you therefore that it is in our best interests to be in favour of some form of independent element in our complaints procedures.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murray went on to outline broadly the kinds of principles they would favour, and that they should include an independent element in the complaints procedures. Therefore, as the Garda understand increasingly what is involved, there is more and more support for the establishment of such a complaints procedure. That procedure will be beneficial to the Garda Síochána because the allegations which are so often made will be dealt with in a clearly independent manner and, consequently, many which may be vexatious will be shown up for what they are.  Subsequently it would leave the Garda in a stronger position.</P>
    <P>The Minister in March last when introducing amendments to the Bill set a five-year time limit on sections 3 to 8 which deal with detention and related matters.  Indeed, in the House he said he would consider whether this should be a four or five-year period.  The Minister has said that his discussions about such a tribunal are at an advanced stage.  We are <Col N="433" /> at one in that respect.  I should like to refer to the fact that the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill, 1983 in England included a police complaints and discipline procedure.  It proposes to set up a police authority which will deal with their supervision of investigation of allegations against police officers and related disciplinary charges against such officers. There is a precedent and a very good reason for such a procedure.</P>
    <P>We have suggested the setting up of a Garda Síochána Complaints Commission, an independent body for supervising and investigating complaints against the Garda Síochána and related criminal or disciplinary charges.  We dealt with its membership, the establishment date, the appointment of the commission and the importance of involving the community and vocational groups in this area.  We also dealt with the importance of involving a representative of the medical profession.  We have also set out a reporting system, dealt with employees and the question of finance and, in particular, the processing of complaints, a matter of considerable interest in relation to the discussions that are taking place.  The system we have suggested for processing complaints is outlined in the amendments that were circulated on 10 April last.  We have included some of the provisions people are looking for, such as that there should be two levels of complaint, that some complaints should be dealt with on a more informal basis and those of a more serious nature be delat with on a formal basis.  The Garda have been looking for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us repeatedly in the House that these sections will not come into operation until he establishes an independent statutory complaints procedure. I hope it will not be very long before that procedure is introduced.  We are concerned that so much time has passed without the complaints procedure being set down.  As a consequence the implementation of the provisions of the Bill will be put back.  In this regard the Minister has told the House that the provisions will not be implemented until he has established a complaints procedure. Our amendment gives the Minister an <Col N="434" /> opportunity to deal with this matter.  The Minister mentioned a complaints procedure during the debate on the Bill but he has not tabled an amendment to include such a provision.  I hope he will look favourably on our amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When I took office as Minister for Justice work had been proceeding on the main provisions of a criminal justice Bill for quite a long time.  Many of the proposals we have been discussing are ones which at least two of my predecessors, and possibly three, had been considering.  I would like to have come into the House with a scheme for a complaints procedure, either an administrative or a legislative one, at the same time as I produced the Bill but the last Government, of which Deputy Woods was a member, had not given any indication that they were going to have a complaints procedure of any type.  They had not done any work on it. Obviously, there was a time lag between the production of the Bill on which some work was done and the complaints procedure on which no work had been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill outlined the main provisions of the legislation.  I was advised that it was not appropriate to talk about a complaints procedure in the Explanatory Memorandum because such a procedure was not contained in the Bill.  The idea or the concept, was not contained within the Long Title of the Bill.  I produced a small second memo which committed the Government to doing exactly what the Deputy desires in his amendment, that sections 3 to 8 will not come into operation until a complaints procedure is in operation.  I have repeated that commitment in the House on several occasions.  In his amendment Deputy Woods is seeking to make the commitment the Government and I have given legally binding by an amendment to the Bill.  That does not need to be made legally binding.  I have given my word to the House that this will happen.  It will be a legislative scheme.  It has gone through Government and is being drafted at present. I will bring it before the House as soon as it is ready.  I will not accept the <Col N="435" /> Deputy's amendment because I see it as the Deputy casting doubts on the commitment I have given to the House.  It is not necessary to tie me legally in the Bill to fulfil the commitment I have given to the House and which the Government gave when the Bill was circulated.</P>

      <P>The point raised by Deputy Woods, and dealt with by the Minister, is probably one of the most important aspects of the legislation.  I do not believe that the training of the Garda makes them aware of the damaging effect even one act of discourtesy can have on the public.  We need to ensure that there is a strong awareness within the force of the need to harness community goodwill and get people on the side of the Garda. To that extent where a garda does something which is not in keeping with the spirit and vocation of the Garda Síochána an independent complaints tribunal would be very desirable.  A garda may commit small offences, if they can be called offences, perhaps of the industrial employment type.  Every offence should not be a federal case; every offence should not be a matter for the independent complaints tribunal.  In introducing an independent complaints tribunal we should specify what and how, complaints can be referred to and dealt with by this tribunal.  We must get the balance right between the rights of the Garda and their responsibilities to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters as they stand are certainly not in the interests of the community.  If a person makes a complaint against a garda at the moment it is investigated, or supposed to be investigated, by an inspector from another division.  But sometimes in the early hours of the morning people will contact one with a complaint and when it is pursued by a garda in uniform calling on the person, even though that garda is from another division and may be very courteous and helpful, people can become frightened.  Whether we or the Garda themselves like it or not, people who do not normally come in contact with the Garda have a fear of the whole questioning procedure.  People signing a statement, which they are asked <Col N="436" /> to do, can find themselves turning up in the District Court for something which perhaps could have been dealt with quite easily without having to go to court. There fore, I want to see an independent complaints tribunal set up, but I want to see the terms of reference of that tribunal before the House preferably before this Bill passes into legislation.  The Minister tells us that this matter has been before the Cabinet and is being drafted at the moment.  Since we are on only section 9 of the Bill, I hope that it will be possible to get that legislation in here before we pass the Bill.</P>
    <P>One thing the Minister could consider which would help to allay the fears of many people would be examination of the training procedures to ensure that gardaí are community orientated in the first instance, that they are trained and psychologically facilitated to assist the community.  Many gardaí giving evidence before the various committees say that in many cases something happens when a person puts on a uniform.  In considering a complaints tribunal we must also consider the whole question of training and psychological testing for people entering the Garda Síochána.  I hope the Minister will bring forward his proposals for this complaints tribunal before the Bill passes and that at the same time he will take up the suggestion, which I made in the House and which the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors are making, about a commission of inquiry into the question of deployment, training and management of the Garda Síochána.  I hope to have an opportunity to say more about that later.  It is vital that this area be examined.  There is no point in looking at this proposal piecemeal.  The legislation is there.  We could do a very good day's work by going the whole hog with this and agreeing to the establishment of a commission of inquiry into the management and deployment of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand why Deputy Woods put down this amendment.  We have had exhaustive discussions in trying to have a complaints procedure made part of the body of the Bill and we did <Col N="437" /> not really succeed in convincing the Minister that he should change his original thinking in that regard and that the provision in the Bill giving increased powers to the Garda Síochána would come into operation only when a ministerial order to that effect was made.  However, he guaranteed that it would not be brought into force before a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal has been established. He went through the argument and explained the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill.  I do not think that we can persuade him at this stage but I think he has committed himself irrevocably to bringing in this procedure prior to the operation of these sections.  I do not believe that he will do an about face and I believe that this will be brought in in good time for us to discuss it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister understands our concern about the need for an independent complaints tribunal.  We must take into consideration that if the independent complaints tribunal is not introduced here for debate before the Criminal Justice Bill is passed and becomes law, then we could find ourselves as Members of the House under pressure because the Bill would have been passed before the complaints tribunal had been debated and agreed on and we might not have the same freedom and strength to uphold the kind of independent complaints tribunal that we envisage as necessary.  As Deputy Mitchell said, the length of time taken in debating this Bill should allow time within the Department for the drafting of the provisions for an independent complaints tribunal. It would be difficult for us to accept the Bill in isolation from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a novice in the House and lack knowledge of the procedure regarding Bills coming in here.  I would like to ask the Minister if after we vote each section of the Bill and on Report Stage, is it then completed and signed?  Is that the moment at which the Bill becomes law? If this Bill is voted on in this House will it then be <i>de facto</i> law?  If a garda or gardaí attempted to use some of the extra powers before the ministerial order was <Col N="438" /> granted, would they be in breach of the law?  I would like an answer to that.  I am anxious that the question of the complaints tribunal be in if possible before Report Stage and certainly before the Bill is signed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister brought in the Bill initially he argued very strongly the need for an independent commission or tribunal for complaints procedures independent of this Bill.  I agree with him that, even if this Bill had never seen the light of day in this House, there would still be a need for an independent complaints procedure for the Garda.  The Bill, having come in here and having been debated in the House, underlines the urgency of an independent complaints procedure.</P>
      <P>The Minister may feel we are casting doubts on his word.  That is not the intention, but I should like to see in the Bill a section providing that it will not become law until the complaints procedure has been passed by the House.  Fears have been expressed by nearly all Deputies that the powers in the Bill will be open to abuse, following experience of abuses of the 1976 emergency legislation which resulted in the Ó Briain committee and their recommendations.  There is genuine concern that an independent procedure should be established.  We have examples of abuses and not everybody is satisfied about present procedures, that they are entirely free of bias.  No matter how unbiased the procedures may be they are organised and carried out by the Garda and therefore there is always a nagging doubt that the procedures are open to abuse.  Therefore I urge the Minister to accept an amendment, or to insert one himself, which would make it necessary to have the complaints procedure established in law before the passage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point has been raised in regard to this amendment.  It refers to a Garda Síochána complaints commission but does not say that it should be an independent commission.  An earlier amendment of Deputy Woods, ruled out of order, gave some detail.  The Minister spoke about a complaints tribunal or <Col N="439" /> commission and said it would have a strong independent element.  That would seem to indicate that it will not be entirely independent and I should like the Minister to elaborate, to tell us to what degree the complaints procedure will not be independent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I am happy that Deputies have come round to my point of view that a complaints procedure with a strong independent element is necessary.  I spoke about this in my first months in Government and I have been speaking about it since.  I have got the Garda Commissioner to agree with me and the two Garda associations have indicated agreement in their publications.</P>
      <P>The complaints procedure will be a legislative measure, as extensive a piece of legislation, almost, as the Bill before us.  Already at the draft stage we have 30 sections.  That may have to be cut down, but it will be a major piece of legislation and will stand on its own rights.  I continue to advocate it and I am surprised at Deputies bringing in a case tonight on the basis that they were trying to convince a reluctant Minister.  I have tried to convince many members of the public about the need for such legislation, and I may say that the Opposition when in Government did not do any work on it whatsoever.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to discuss the merits of the complaints procedure legislation. Deputies will have plenty of time to discuss its merits when it comes before us. I have been giving nuggets of information on every occasion this has been mentioned on how far that legislation has advanced.  Deputies who have been contributing to the debate see themselves as honest and upright with strong social consciences.  I accept that and I ask them to accept that if the Minister and the Government give their word it means something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want an amendment legally to commit me to something which I have already promised to do.  The Bill providing for the complaints procedure will have to go through all its Stages here, <Col N="440" /> including Report and Fifth Stages, and through all Stages in the Seanad, and I am sure Senators will be anxious to match paces with the Dáil.  It will be a long hot summer for the Minister for Justice.  That Bill will go through, I hope, after a good discussion before going to the President to be signed.  Section 1 of this Bill provides:</P>
    <P>&mdash;(1)  This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed thereof by order or orders of the Minister for Justice either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>While in theory it will become law, part of the <i>corpus</i> of our criminal code, when passed by both Houses and signed by the President, it cannot until the Minister signs orders to bring it into operation.  He can sign one order or he can sign different orders to bring particular sections into operation.  In respect of sections 3 to 8, I will not sign the order until we have a satisfactory complaints procedure in operation.  I should like the House to accept my bona fides on this.</P>

      <P>The heads of the Bill were being considered at that time but one might ask what would have happened if at that stage certain circumstances had not arisen.  The Minister has been in office since December 1982.  In October last he circulated a document which indicated his plan for a complaints commission. It is because of what he said that I had to put the amendment in this way. When I tabled the draft procedure for the setting up of the complaints procedure it was ruled out of order because the Bill did not contain anything on those lines. Such a reference appeared only in the second supplementary memorandum.  At that stage in October the Minister said it had not been decided whether legislation would be necessary to establish such a procedure or whether it could be introduced at least in the first instance on an administrative basis but that in either event it was the intention of the Government that both Houses would be given the opportunity of discussing a complaints procedure before it would be brought into effect.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said we all came around to his point of view, that was, that there should be an independent statutory body or a body with a strong independent content.  We are talking about an independent body.  From a very early stage in the course of these discussions this whole point has been developed.  Therefore, having tabled a draft procedure containing 22 sections but which was ruled out of order, I had no alternative but to table this amendment.</P>
      <P>Regarding a question raised by Deputy Mitchell, there should be provision within the procedure for dealing with informal complaints on one basis and with more serious complaints on a different basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The purpose of the section is to introduce consecutive sentencing for offences committed by persons on bail.  In 1982, 7,880 indictable offences were committed by such persons.  There is evidence of this number.  It represents about 24 per cent of all detected indictable crimes.  The detection rate was about one-third so we are talking of about 24 per cent of one-third of the total crime figures.  For that reason it is probably an understatement and the Garda are satisfied that many more offences are committed without their being able to obtain evidence of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vexed question of offences being committed by persons on bail has been discussed.  The debate has ranged from depriving people of their right to bail to what I have come up with here.  My advice is that to deprive people of the right to bail would be unconstitutional.  I do not envisage a situation in which I would sponsor a referendum to change that provision of the Constitution which entitles people to bail.  We are providing here that if somebody is found guilty of an offence which was committed while he was on bail, the sentence for that offence shall be consecutive to the first sentence or to any other sentence that may be imposed.  This has brought about a situation in the District Court where it was necessary to increase total sentencing power to two years so as to allow for consecutive sentencing power of up to two years.  It does not change the power of the District Court in any other way.  I hope it will be effective.  The problem of offences committed while on bail is a serious one.  If someone charged with an offence is found guilty and sentenced and gets bail they have immunity from punishment while they are on bail.  They commit crime while on bail and sentences would run concurrently if the expectation <Col N="444" /> was they would receive sentences of an equal length.</P>

It is to provide the District Court with the ability to deal with it but if they are tried before any other court a five-year original sentence with an offence committed while on bail which attracted another five years would mean a sentence of ten years.  The extension only applies to the District Court because they are restricted to 12 months at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is very welcome. The Minister said 7,880 offences were committed while on bail.  It is one of the scandals of recent times.</P>
      <P>What we are concerned about is how the section will work in practice.  The memorandum states:</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) makes it clear that the requirement to impose consecutive sentences in &ldquo;bail&rdquo; cases takes precedence over the discretionary power to impose consecutive sentences conferred on the District Court by section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951.</P>
      <P>The courts in imposing sentences on people who have committed offences while on bail have recently taken that fact into account and usually impose a stiff penalty.  The sentence to be imposed rests with the court.  What we are doing is introducing an extra sentence for offences committed while on bail.  Apparently the courts have been taking that into consideration to some extent.  I hope that what we are doing will not take away some of the court's discretionary powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We support the section completely.  It is very necessary.  The number of offences committed while on bail is a scandal.  At the same time I agree with the Minister when he says we cannot interfere with a person's constitutional right.  The Association of Criminal Lawyers have said that this section provides for consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.  The principle of the section is not <Col N="445" /> approved by the association.  They express concern about the District Court having power to sentence up to an aggregate of two years in prison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which we all welcome.  On section after section of the Bill we have been questioning the Minister, giving him a grilling and generally putting him through a tough time primarily because we are concerned, as the Minister is, about the problem which the community are facing.  We are anxious to get it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that the reason the legislation is before the House is that Deputies have been put under severe pressure in their constituencies to do something about the almighty spate of crime which the old, infirm and those not able to defend themselves in the community have suffered from mostly at the hands of people who are on bail.  In the <Col N="446" /> Crumlin area if a person is detained for snatching a handbag he might just as well go out the following day, grab an old lady, beat her up to within an inch of her life or give her a bad bruising and scaring, steal her handbag and someone else's the day after.  He could go before the court and ask for all these to be taken into account.  The same thing happens regularly in Dublin areas.  CrimInals steal cars.  Not only do they drive them recklessly but they drive them up to the Garda seeking a chase and go speeding around housing estates sometimes killing and injuring people.  They do that recklessly knowing that they are on bail and that when they go before the court they can ask for these things to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>From speaking to people in the Garda Síochána, I suspect that the amount of crime committed while on bail is higher than the Minister suggests.  The Minister's figure is only a portion of the total. If a person is on bail and is found guilty of an offence, he has been given sufficient warning.  Persons who are caught and brought before the courts should have the attitude that they should try to mend their ways but the opposite is the case as things stand.  They go out and deliberately get caught because they know that these things will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The section is very necessary.  I support it entirely and think the Minister has got it right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware, there is very little hard evidence in terms of the number of convictions of persons for crimes committed while on bail. <Col N="447" /> There are virtually no statistics kept in relation to that.  For that reason, it is difficult to quantify what exactly we are dealing with.  There is a public perception that virtually everybody on bail is committing offences.  As far as I am aware, there are no statistics available to show to what extent that is true.  The <i>Garda Review</i> of 1981 published some figures which they said were from confidential Garda files.  These figures related to offences about which they believe they had information but they did not relate to the number of convictions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell spoke about a person on bail who is caught committing another crime and said one would expect him to mend his ways.  The fact is that a person on bail is a person who has been charged with an offence but has not yet been found guilty.  Our law presumes a person innocent until the court finds him guilty.</P>

We must accept that our law does not deal with morality in those terms; it deals with definitions of offences and legalistic ways of interpreting them, and whether the balance of evidence is in favour or against the accused.  There is no other way of dealing with offences and with people suspected of having committed offences in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see more specific information made available on precisely what we are dealing with when we are talking about crimes committed while a person is on bail.  What kind of crimes are committed?  Is murder being committed by these people while on bail?  Is rape being committed by people who are on bail?  Is burglary being committed by <Col N="448" /> these people?  I would like a breakdown of some kind so we will know what we are dealing with.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has not attempted to restrict the availability of bail to persons who are accused of crimes. Our Constitution and our courts have made it very clear that a person is entitled to his liberty with certain qualifications until such time as he is proven guilty by the courts.  Then the courts exact their sanctions for the offences concerned. Before I go into this further, perhaps the Minister could give more details about the offences concerned.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The figures I have given were provided by the Garda.  I am not sure if they were published in the 1982 crime report, and I have been attempting to get them checked.  The offences most commonly repeated are larceny, burglary and in recent times drug-related offences.  That is not meant to be a conclusive list, but that would cover many offences which are committed while people are out on bail.</P>
      <P>This section provides that two life sentences cannot be ordered to run consecutively or to indeterminate sentences under section 103 of the Children Act, 1908.  That refers to a situation where a juvenile convicted of murder must be detained at the pleasure of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods mentioned the discretion of the courts.  There are two elements involved here.  Subsection (3) says that &ldquo;subsection (1) shall apply notwithstanding anything contained in section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.&rdquo; That gives District Courts a discretionary power to impose consecutive sentences, but the limitation of 12 months applies.  What is happening now is that it will be made obligatory to impose consecutive sentences in the District Court, but not in the other courts.  The two-year limit will apply.  Discretion would need to be exercised in another sense as well.  If somebody was charged with an offence which subsequently carried a five-year sentence and while out on bail committed nine other offences, each of which carried a five year sentence, theoretically he could <Col N="449" /> be sentenced to 50 years, not in a District Court but in a higher court.  That is an extreme example, but there is nothing in the section to prevent a judge taking this into account and looking at the cumulative effect of the sentences he is imposing so that while there would be an added element for offences committed while on bail, there would be discretion in the hands of the judge to pitch the particular time module to be added to the first sentence so that the cumulative effect did not turn out to be a ridiculous sentence which would not be in keeping with the nature of the offences.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know from their various letters to the Minister for Justice petitioning him on various sentences, there are powers of mitigation in the hands of the Minister to adjust what could be perceived as a run of sentences which would not necessarily be appropriate to serve.</P>
    <P>On the actual statistics, I cannot give the Deputy harder information on the number of offences, apart from what I have given.  What I do not have is the source of the statistic I have given, but if I can establish it, I will communicate with the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very frustrating for law-abiding citizens to hear of people on bail committing more offences.  This is very difficult to explain.  As the Minister has said, the courts have discretion, but this discretion is seldom used.  As the law stood, it encouraged a person on bail to commit other offences, because if he was found guilty of the first offence he could have the later offences taken into account and still only get one sentence.  For that reason I welcome the change in the law which means that consecutive sentences can be imposed from now on.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I have tried to check the source of the information I gave the House and I am informed that the 1982 statistic of 7,880 arose from answers to parliamentary questions.

      <P>The House will be <Col N="450" /> aware of a number of cases where other offences are taken into account.  I have found this to be quite common, from discussions with gardaí and others.  Given that this section may well increase the population in our prisons, does this mean that extra places will be available for those who commit crimes while on bail? There is no point in passing legislation such as this if accommodation is not available.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second last point made by the Minister, are the courts compelled to give consecutive sentences, or may they give concurrent or part concurrent sentences?  Is that discretion with the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): With regard to prison space, I would hope that what we are doing here would have a deterrent effect and that people would not have to be locked up for a very long period.  The problem as I see it now is that there is this period of immunity from punishment while on bail.  One can have a free run, rob ten houses and it is all taken into account when the sentence is being imposed commensurate with the first charge on which one was out on bail. It may put some pressure on prison space &mdash; that is a problem which we have had for a number of years, have now and will have for a number of years to come.  I have succeeded in accommodating approximately 400 extra in prisons over the last 12 months.  Something between 70 and 100 places can be made available, I think, in the coming six to 12 months.</P>
      <P>I am hoping that the Community Service Order legislation, in regard to which we are recruiting probation and welfare officers at the moment, and a seminar which is being held for District Justices &mdash; which is something the Deputy has been advocating for a long time &mdash; will reduce the pressure on the prisons also.  People would then be doing community service order work rather than serving prison sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second point raised by the Deputy, for an offence committed while on bail it would be obligatory on the court to impose a consecutive sentence.  However, since most of our penalties in terms <Col N="451" /> of years have a maximum of five years, there would be a discretion with the judge on the amount of that five-year maximum to be imposed for the bail offence.  One can consider a person having been sentenced to five years' imprisonment who commits an offence while on bail.  The judge in his wisdom would decide that the total package of offences justified seven years' imprisonment and in that case he would have the discretion to impose five years plus two, rather than five years plus five.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

Of course, in the District Court it could not exceed two years' imprisonment and that two-year period could have to be used in the District Court for one offence.  The justice may go only as far as two years for the original offence plus the offence committed while on bail.</P>

      <P>This section has been given the broadest welcome.  It has been welcomed throughout the city and seen as very useful.  One of the criticisms raised against the legislation as a whole is that it will not affect the minor crimes which are causing so much hardship and may be at the front line of problems facing a considerable number of people in many parts of the city.  Much of such disturbance is caused by minor crimes. This section will help in changing that situation and, as the Minister has said, be a deterrent.  At present a person out on bail has an incentive, a licence to commit crime while awaiting trial.  It is commonly perceived that that time is used to commit further crimes and perhaps line the pockets for the time when the offenders emerge from jail.  Of all the sections, this <Col N="452" /> is the most welcome and is a useful and long overdue addition to our laws.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, the Minister has confirmed what I said earlier, that the discretion still lies with the justice to decide on the individual sentences but these would have to apply consecutively. In view of the fact that there has apparently been a recent practice, the extent of which I do not know, of giving more severe sentences, partly because of the public outcry against crime, there is no doubt that the Judiciary will regard the spirit of this section in the way intended and the Bill consequently will result in the accumulation of a more serious sentence or penalty.</P>
      <P>The question was raised of people who are out on bail being given bail when there are already a number of similar offences against them.  One instance was put to me by a man who had suffered the loss of his brother in a car accident.  One of the points which he put to me was that the conditions of bail should be changed to allow the prosecution to object to bail, should the persons have committed similar offences previously.  When such offences have already been committed, should more weight be given to that at the time when bail is being considered? Can that be done now?  Presumably it is purely a matter for the judge, in any event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The particular case of which the Deputy is thinking is the O'Callaghan case, page 501 of <i>Irish Reports, 1966.</i>  This judgment was to the effect that refusal of bail in order to prevent the commission of other offences by an accused while awaiting trial was a form of preventive detention and was consequently unconstitutional.  That is the very constitutional problem here.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies arguing in favour of this section of the Bill have said that it will act as a deterrent. The Minister has also made the point, and Deputy Flaherty, that these consecutive sentences will deter.  This is <Col N="453" /> similar in some ways to the debate on the section regarding detention.  Opinions are being expressed about the effects of these sections without any statistical evidence being offered or any studies being brought forward which indicate that the effect being claimed will occur.</P>
      <P>For the sake of argument, let us take the case of the young lads who are in the habit of robbing cars to go joy-riding around their home estate or some neighbouring one.  We know the disastrous effects which this has had in certain instances, having resulted in deaths not only of the young people involved but also of innocent bystanders.  On the face of it, the offence of robbing a car and driving it around is not so serious, but its after-effects from high speed in driving and so forth can be very serious, indeed. However, there is no reason to believe that a consecutive sentence in cases which occur while people are on bail will prevent them from acting similarly while again on bail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening.  I do this because of my very grave concern for the workforce in Kilrush who were asked over a year ago to take holidays while their factory was being refurbished.  The end result was that they lost their jobs and there is very little hope of them getting employment as things stand at the moment.  Those redundant workers are owed over £32,000 in lieu of notice.  That money has been raised to the status of preferential credit in the final divide up of whatever assets become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is pretty bleak because the factory in Kilrush is owned by SFADCo and was only leased to the company. The only other assets for auction are the machinery and the house in Kilkee. This house was sold for £50,000 but the entitlement to the proceeds from the <Col N="454" /> sale is the subject of litigation.  It is not clear yet if that money will become available because the house was in the joint names of the directors.  It is estimated that if the machinery is sold it may realise £40,000 or it may realise a lot less.  This leaves the workforce in Kilrush in a very bad position.  Nearly £250,000 is owed and less than £100,000 will become available. The workers are not likely to get the £32,000 owed to them but only the percentage in accordance with the company law which governs receivership.  It is most unsatisfactory that we still have a situation like this.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Labour to examine the situation very seriously, particularly to examine the Protection of Employees Bill which has been circulated. This Bill will govern insolvencies arising as and from 22 October 1983.  It is designed to protect employees' inter ests in regard to pay in the event of their employer becoming insolvent.  It will also implement the EEC Council Directive 80/987/EEC which came into effect on the same date and which confers certain rights on employees in insolvent situations. I ask the Government to be magnanimous enough to put that date back to 6 April 1983 rather than the suggested date of 22 October 1983.  It is unfortunate that we wait until it is imperative to implement EEC directives before we do so.  We should be a step ahead and have them implemented far in advance of the date on which we have to implement them.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta have a considerable amount of money involved in the company. This money was advanced to the Kilrush company in three separate rescue attempts, the last of which took place early in 1983.  This assistance was provided on the understanding that the UK directors would invest a further £50,000 equity in the business but this additional funding has not materialised.  The owners requested Fóir Teoranta to appoint a receiver in April 1983.  They went ahead and appointed a receiver.  They maintain they did more than justified in trying to help the company but that there was little option but to appoint a receiver in the end.  The unions recognised this. <Col N="455" /> The receiver has made great efforts to secure a takeover but that has been unsuccessful.  He was in contact with 27 companies and actively negotiated with 11 of them.  Very serious negotiations were conducted with three companies and at one stage people were very optimistic that there would be a successful takeover.  That did not materialise.  There is very little employment in the manufacturing industry in that area of County Clare.  This workforce see very little hope of securing the money they are legally entitled to.  Everybody feels that the receiver did a very good job in trying to sell the company as a viable trading entity, but in view of the apparent lack of interest in pottery at the moment it seems that an auction of the assets is the only option open to the receiver.  It is recognised that the workers have a legitimate right to the minimum notice payment. The receiver decided on the minimum notice money in accordance with current solvency law.  Fóir Teoranta stressed they would have no part to play in such a decision.  Minimum notice payments are traditionally ranked very poor in insolvency situations.  I am sure the Minister recognises this.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of the situation cannot be overstated.  Many of the workforce have worked for over 20 years in the pottery industry in Kilrush.  They have acquired very specialised and definite skills and they now see very little opportunity to redirect that skill into some new project in the pottery field in Kilrush.  It is unfortunate that they now find themselves in this situation and that they cannot secure the money they are justly entitled to and which they have worked extremely hard for over the past 20 years. The Government have a duty to thoroughly examine the situation in cases like this.  I ask them to be gracious enough to revert the date to 6 April 1983.  That would be a justifiable date because it is the beginning of the financial year, it would make matters quite easy administratively and there should not be any great difficulties.  I am primarily motivated because of the situation in which the Kilrush workforce find themselves in. <Col N="456" /> I am sure it is not just confined to the Kilrush workforce but that the same situation relates to many other unfortunate people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own over the past few years and who are in a similar situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Taylor-Quinn in her plea for equity for the employees of the former Kilrush pottery factory.  The main point she has made is that emphasis was laid on the necessity for goodwill by Fóir Teoranta when seeking the temporary closure of the company. While the Deputy has stressed the date of 6 April, it seems to me that there is a case to be met by the State in so far as a promise was made.  These employees were asked to go on holidays and were not told that the company was closing. The major share of the equity was held by the State and for that reason the Minister should re-examine the case.  If it is just a matter of the date, he should accommodate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputy Taylor-Quinn and Deputy Carey have dwelt in some detail on the background to this very unhappy situation.  As Deputy Taylor-Quinn commented, the circumstances are not unique.  There have been other closures leaving people unemployed and unable to obtain their statutory entitlements and, in some cases, arrears of wages due to them.</P>
      <P>That problem is now being tackled in the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Bill, 1984, which was circulated last week.  It is not a case of simply doing the bare minimum required under EEC directives.  The legislation, which will be debated shortly, goes substantially further than the requirements imposed on us by reason of our membership of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net point is that the Employment Appeals Tribunal sat in Ennis and heard a claim by some 87 former employees under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  The validity of that claim was not in dispute and the total entitlement of the workers was assessed at £25,941.  Under the law as it now stands <Col N="457" /> those sums rank as preferential claims but at this stage of the receivership it is not possible to speculate as to what amounts might be expected to come to the employees.</P>
    <P>The question then arises as to the extent to which the Employers' Insolvency Bill becomes relevant.  That Bill makes sure that no similar situation will arise in the future and represents the Government's response to a very serious social ill in ensuring that in future no Irish workers, in the event of their company becoming insolvent, will find themselves denied their statutory entitlements and the wages for which they have already worked.  I appreciate that this may be <Col N="458" /> cold comfort to the unfortunate former employees in Kilrush.</P>
    <P>I have listened very carefully to the arguments advanced by Deputy Taylor-Quinn and Deputy Carey in favour of making some changes in the legislation. In effect what they are asking for amounts to a Committee Stage amendment in advance of the Second Stage and it seems a little premature.  I assure both Deputies that the points they have made in the course of this debate will be carefully considered.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the Government, at the meeting on 30 May 1984 decided that the generation of electricity from peat-fired stations is to continue <Col N="294" /> with little change, in accordance with revised arrangements between the ESB and Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>The ESB in 1983 drew up a five year strategic plan, 1983-1988 having as its primary objective, regarded as very commendable by the Government, the achievement of substantial improvement in the economics of its operations.  This plan was drawn up by the board and management of the ESB on their own initiative and responsibility.  The plan set out the measures seen by the ESB as necessary to accelerate the transition of the board from a period of high growth development to a plane of slower expansion. These relate to every section of the organisation and aim to reduce costs.</P>
      <P>The original plan also included proposals to close 733 MW of generating capacity in 14 stations which the ESB maintains are high-cost and low merit. The station at Screebe was included in these proposed closures.  Because of the obvious implications for the continued operation of Bord na Móna, the Government insisted that the two boards should get together and jointly consider the ESB proposals.  Following protracted negotiations modified proposals emerged which ensure that the generation of electricity from peat-fired stations is to continue with little change.</P>
      <P>The ESB also put forward modified proposals relating to the four small 5 MW sod peat stations including that at Screebe, County Galway.  These proposals, which have been accepted by the Government, are that the stations at Gweedore and Cahirciveen would continue in operation and the stations at Miltown Malbay and Screebe would close, as proposed originally.  The ESB pointed out that the load factors at Miltown Malbay and Screebe have been low for many years due to the unsatisfactory level of sod peat deliveries.  The cost of a unit of electricity sent out from the stations is also very high.  The stations at Gweedore and Cahirciveen have a better unit cost.  The ESB also stated that the anticipated delivery levels of sod peat at these two stations have generally been maintained over the years and reasonable load factors were attainable.</P>

    <P>The capital allocation of the Housing Finance Agency in 1984 is £63 million which is £8 million more than the amount issued by the agency in 1983.  The sources of the moneys extended by the agency are funds raised from institutional sources through the issue of index-linked <Col N="297" /> stock and borrowings arranged through the banking system.</P>
    <P>In relation to the agency's recent invitation to tender for stock, I understand that the agency decided not to accept any of the tenders received.  Decisions in this matter are for the agency itself and I have no function in relation to them.  The amount that the agency will be able to spend on the making of loans in the current year will not be affected by this decision.

When notification was received at the end of April that her pension book had not been received the book was recalled from the Dublin post office and sent to the pensioner in County Kilkenny.  However, the pensioner had changed her address again and it was not until the end of May, when the new address was notified, that the matter was put right and she was able to cash orders from her new book.  The pension book is now with the pensioner and any inconvenience caused to the pensioner is regretted.</P>
      <P>Her claim for an increase in pension has been partially investigated.  When the inquiries have been completed the matter will be decided upon and she will be notified of the outcome in due course.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was assessed with means at £27.35 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging in his parent's home.  His rate of unemployment assistance is 65p weekly being the maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable to him £28 less £27.35.  He recently appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and arrangements are being made to have his case determined by an appeals officer.  The rate of unemployment assistance payable to him will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of unemployment assistance payable to an applicant is increased for a qualified child in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts. However, on attaining the age of 18 years the child is no longer regarded as a dependant for unemployment assistance purposes. Accordingly, where a child on attaining the age of 18 years claims unemployment <Col N="307" /> assistance in his own right the rate of unemployment assistance payable to him is determined by the amount of means assessed against him and the amount of an increase previously paid to his parent in respect of him as qualified child has no bearing on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another safeguard we are proposing.  The Ó Briain report also referred to such matters on page 18, paragraph 58:</P>
      <P>Questioning within the confines of a Garda Station can be a traumatic experience for all but the hardened criminal.  It seems appropriate that steps should be taken to draw up regulations governing questioning procedures in those cases where questioning is permissible, as, for example, the Offences Against the State Act, 1939. Such regulations should allow the Gardaí to ask questions in a fair and humane manner, and at the same time protect the person being questioned from feeling isolated, vulnerable or intimidated.  We believe that not more than two Gardaí should be entitled to question a prisoner at one time, and that not more than four Gardaí should be present at any one time.  Prolonged questioning should not be permitted; at most, four hours of questioning should be allowed, followed by a break of one hour...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words to which I want to draw attention are &ldquo;such regulations should allow the Gardaí to ask questions in a fair and humane manner, and at the same time protect the person being questioned from feeling isolated, vulnerable or intimidated&rdquo;. For example, the removal of eye glasses can be a form of intimidation and the removal of a watch can make it difficult to keep track of the time.  There have been instances where the removal of a watch has been cited as a form of <Col N="316" /> intimidation and disorientation.  One might think there is no need to cover points like this because behaviour would always be humane and reasonable and there would never be any intention to put a person being questioned at a disadvantage, but we know from experience that this sort of thing happens.  It is important that there be safeguards, whether in the Bill or in the regulations, to cover such incidents.  We are inclined to think of a person being bruised or beaten or having some injury to his shoulder or face which would leave some mark.  Those are very clear-cut situations but here we are speaking about psychological pressure placed on an individual, perhaps in a smaller proportion of cases.  It is quite clear that psychological pressure is used in certain instances during questioning. In one case on which an affidavit was sworn, the person told of a practice of shoving the questioner's fingers up against his eyes to such an extent that he was sure they would hit his eyes but they did not.  He said that he could not understand how they could keep coming so close to his face, like a bunch of grapes, and not actually hit it.  This became quite intimidating.</P>
    <P>The ordinary person, especially the innocent person who becomes unwittingly involved will feel very isolated and vulnerable in these surroundings.  There are also other methods of putting psychological pressure on people.  There should be certain minimum safeguards.  We propose that the personal belongings should not be removed except where necessary, particularly in relation to a person's own safety and that what is done in that respect should be recorded.  That is the intention behind section 5.  It could alternatively be dealt with under regulations, if appropriate.  I put it down at this stage to indicate our concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I accept the intention and the concern.  Deputy Woods' amendment falls into two paragraphs 6 (a) and 6 (b).  In the Bill, section 5 gives the Garda power to search a person who has been detained under section 3.  They may also, under section 5 (1) (f) <Col N="317" /> seize and retain for testing anything that he has in his possession.  Paragraph 6 (a) in Deputy Woods' amendment is directed at personal belongings.  It is intended to cover the retention or taking from a detained person of such personal belongings.  It attempts to provide that personal belongings shall not be interfered with, that is, removed from the person unless authorised by the section or, alternatively, unless it is necessary to do so for the person's own safety.  This paragraph adds nothing to the law.  The first part states the obvious, that the property shall not be removed unless the section allows it.  If the section did not allow it, it would not be lawful to remove it anyway.</P>
      <P>The second part is already the common law position and does not require restating in the section.  It is implicit in the right of search which the section gives.  I quote from Halsbury, fourth edition, 1976 on the common law position:</P>
      <P>Search of persons arrested.  There is no general common law right to search a person who has been arrested but such a person may be searched if there are reasonable grounds for believing:</P>
      <P>1.  that he has on his person any weapon with which he might do himself or others an injury or any implement with which he might effect an escape, or</P>
      <P>2.  that he has in his possession evidence which is material to the offence with which he is charged.</P>
      <P>The common law position prevents searching, in effect, except under those conditions.  It prevents taking objects from people unless they could injure themselves with them or, alternatively, unless the object could be a matter of evidence subsequently.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 3 of Deputy Woods' amendment, states that where anything is removed from the possession of a detained person the details of anything so removed shall be entered in the record of the Garda station by the member in charge.  I fully accept that and it will be covered by the regulations.  It is already existing Garda practice and there is no problem in accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> Just to give the House a flavour of what happens at the moment, I quote from the existing internal Garda regulations provide as follows:</P>
    <P>Searching of prisoners</P>
    <P>A person arrested on a criminal charge, may be searched and deprived of articles which might be used to inflict injury upon himself or others or to damage the place in which he is confined, and he may be deprived of anything suspected to be connected with the charge.  Persons who are arrested in a state of intoxication or insanity may be deprived of all their property for its safe keeping.</P>
    <P>Unless a person is likely to dispose of articles suspected of being stolen by dropping them en route to the station or is believed to be in possession of a dangerous weapon or is insane, a search should not be made until the prisoner is brought to a place of detention.</P>
    <P>Females are to be searched by a female searcher.  As a general rule, a female is not to be searched except when charged with larceny or when she has possession of counterfeit coin, or if the member in charge suspects that she has concealed upon her person any weapon, or any vessel containing intoxicating liquor.</P>
    <P>When a prisoner is not searched the member charging him should advise him to hand over, for safe keeping, any property in his possession, particulars of which should be entered in the Prisoners Property Voucher Book or Station Diary.</P>
    <P>When a prisoner is searched each article taken from him should be called out by the member searching him and entered in the Prisoners Property Voucher Book by the station house officer or in the Station Diary by the station orderly.  Coin and currency notes should be entered in their separate denominations.  A member should not search a prisoner at a station unless in the presence of the member in charge, station orderly or another member.</P>
    <P>When property is restored to a prisoner, <Col N="319" /> his receipt therefor should be obtained.</P>
    <P>The matter can be covered by regulation and I fully accept paragraph 6 (b).  The concept of removing objects necessary for the person's safety is contained under the present common law and in the Garda regulations.  There is no argument about what the Deputy has said, but it is not necessary to amend the Bill in the manner suggested.  I certainly think that (b) is an appropriate matter for the regulations.</P>

      <P>Certain things are specifically authorised by the section, but I have come across cases where a watch is removed.  It would seem hardly necessary to remove a watch where a person is not intoxicated or insane.  It would contribute to the isolation of the individual.  What is the present practice there?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is difficult to construe a watch as something which could be used either to effect an escape or to cause damage to a person. On the other hand, the glass in spectacles could be used to cut a person, to inflict damage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made to me is that removal of a watch has been a means of isolating a person.  Its removal would not be necessary if someone was going to be with the detainee during the time.  The Minister agrees that it is hard to see how a watch can be used other than that the person might try to swallow it.  If you get to that stage you are pretty bad.  Would the Minister look at that?  I accept that in his regulations the Minister will bear in mind paragraph (b).  In relation to paragraph (a) would he bear in mind the <Col N="320" /> question of the psychological effect on a person of things being removed?  Would the Minister circulate the regulations he has in relation to search?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When the new regulations come out they will be statutory.  I accept what the Deputy says and I will check about the watch.  The Garda find themselves in a difficult situation with the removal of possessions which detained people might have.  We have situations where there have been deaths in Garda stations.  I remember one in particular where Deputies in the House questioned me about whether the person was adequately searched, whether the person was searched for matches, whether laces were removed from shoes or the belt was taken from the person.  On the one hand, there is pressure on the Garda Síochána and on the Minister, especially if some tragedy occurs, to ensure that anything which could injure a person is removed.  There is the point which is now being raised that the removal of personal possessions should not be used in any way to put further pressure on a detained person and to use the 1976 Act or the Offences Against the State Act in a manner in which it was not intended to do.  The thing about the watch is interesting.  I had not adverted to it previously.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The powers in the section which will apply to persons detained under section 3 are considered to be the minimum necessary to enable the Garda to investigate an offence <Col N="321" /> properly.  They are identical to those provided in section 7 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, which apply to persons arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act with two exceptions, which are important.  First, the authority of a superintendent is required under the Bill for the taking of photographs or prints from a detained person and, second, strip searching is being prohibited under the Bill except for explosives and drugs and then only on the authority of a superintendent.  That is to maintain the provisions of unqualified search under the Offences Against the State Act and under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  It is certainly not a new power being introduced.  It is a limitation on the power of search in the Bill so that strip searching is excluded except where it is allowed under existing law and the unqualified provision for a search under the laws I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>As I said, in reply to one of the amendments, at common law the Garda have power to search an arrested person if he is suspected of having an offensive weapon concealed on his person.  They may also search a person charged with an offence in relation to property likely to be material evidence and to take such property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of fingerprinting is interesting. There is no statutory authority for taking the fingerprints of an arrested person, apart from the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act.  If somebody is arrested at the moment the Garda have not the power to take that person's fingerprints. At present the Garda rely on the Regulations as to the Measuring and Photographing of Prisoners 1955, S.I. No. 144, made under the Penal Servitude Act, 1891, for authority to fingerprint persons charged with an offence.  These regulations are of doubtful enough validity in the sense that they are regulations for measuring and photographing people and they are being used for fingerprinting. Even if the validity of regulations were not in doubt at all, they only apply to people who have been charged with an offence and they do not extend to fingerprinting people who are reasonably suspected of having committed an offence. <Col N="322" /> This section confers a general statutory authority for fingerprinting a person suspected of a serious offence who has been detained under section 3.</P>
    <P>I have already said that subsection (3) prohibits strip searching of a detained person except on the authority of a Garda superintendent or higher officer and then only where he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person has controlled drugs or explosives concealed on his person. There was a suggestion made during Second Stage that powers of strip searching should be extended to other serious offences.  I do not agree that it should. The power of search I am introducing here is the minimum necessary.  I do not want to introduce a new power of strip searching under this section.  I want to maintain the existing unrestricted power of search in relation to the Misuse of Drugs Act.  I have said this a couple of times because outside the House it has been said several times that not alone am I introducing the power to strip search <i>de novo</i> but that I am also allowing for a situation where people can be searched by members of the opposite sex.  This is not true.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a prohibition of the searching of females by male gardaí should be written into the section.  There is no necessity to do that because it is achieved under Garda regulations already.  The Offences Against the State Act has been operating for a long time now with these powers of search.  The Misuse of Drugs Act has been operating for seven years now.  Whatever other comment has been made on them nobody has complained on any occasion that females were being searched by male gardaí.  I know there has been comment outside the House and that this has been very long run outside the House.  It is already in the internal Garda regulations. I propose that this matter will be covered in the regulations relating to the treatment of persons in custody so that it will be a statutory obligation now that people will not be searched by members of the opposite sex.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) makes it an offence for a person to refuse to give his name and <Col N="323" /> address or to obstruct the taking of fingerprints. Deputy Woods spoke about this and I replied to him when we were discussing raising the fines from £800 to £1,000.  Subsection (5) brings the penalties in section 7 of the Criminal Law Act 1976 for obstruction of a garda into line with those in subsection (4) of the Bill. The fines are being increased under section 7 from £500 to £1,000.  I dealt with that when Deputy Woods asked questions about the necessity for this particular provision and when we were discussing the level of the maximum fine which would be required.  Basically, we are talking about the powers which are already in the Criminal Law Act, 1976, which apply to a series of scheduled offences. We are taking exactly the same section and putting it into this Bill with two exceptions in that the authority of a superintendent is required for the taking of photographs or prints from the detained person and that strip searches will be far more confined than the existing search provisions under the 1976 Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>
    <P>People have been arguing that the thrust of the Bill was to bring about a situation where the Garda would be relying more and more on confessions and self-incriminating statements.  This is the section which allows the Garda to investigate an offence and to establish forensic evidence, whether by photographing, fingerprinting, palm printing or taking swabs.  Deputies have been making the point that we should move towards the detection of crime, that the Garda should get hard evidence and should not rely on self-incrimination.  This is the section which allows the Garda to get the hard evidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Association of Criminal Lawyers have commented on the section as a whole.  They say that this section contains the powers of the Garda in relation to detained persons and also extends the powers in relation to persons detained under the Offences Against the State Act.  They go on to say that, standing on its own, section 5 (1) to (3) does <Col N="324" /> not make any great inroad into the present rights of detained persons but it does create an offence for failing to give a name and address, which can merit a fine or imprisonment for 12 months.  They state that there is no obligation on the Garda to inform the person of the provisions of the section and submit that the section should contain such a warning.  I made this point earlier.  A warning should be included and the regulations should include the giving of a warning that refusal to give a name and address or the giving of a false or misleading name and address would constitute an offence.</P>
      <P>We are creating a new offence and extending somewhat the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act.  The Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
      <P>To obstruct a member of the Gardaí in the exercise of these powers will be an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine not exceeding £800 or imprisonment not exceeding twelve months or both (subsection (4).  Subsection (5) provides for amendments to section 7 (2) of the Criminal Law Act, 1976 (which deals with the powers of the Gardaí in relation to persons detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939) so as to bring that subsection into line with subsection (4) of this section, i.e. the corresponding offence under section 7 of the 1976 Act will no longer be indictable.</P>
      <P>This brings the new offence into the Offences Against the State Act as well.</P>
      <P>We accept the need for the Garda to have powers in relation to detained persons. I assume that these powers will not be used as a regular practice.  Obviously a name and address will be demanded but presumably the question of photographing and so on will arise only when there is a reasonable indication that a person was involved in the offence which is being investigated.  The handling of the material acquired is dealt with under the next section.  We are supporting this section but I would ask the Minister to look at the possibility of giving a warning in relation to subsection (4).</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the section but I wonder to what extent it reflects reality.  I do not want to raise a hare about misbehaviour of any kind. Although the section refers to the kinds of detail which section 5 contemplates, at least those represented by a photograph, including a negative, a fingerprint and a palm print, there is the question of the physical prevention of somebody from making a photograph of a photograph or fingerprint or palm print.  I appreciate that the first subsection refers to every copy and record thereof, but practically that can only mean every copy and record thereof of which the Minister's agents or the police have knowledge.  We are being a bit unrealistic if we suppose there are not policemen in every police force who are so zealous that they will regard the fingerprint of Mr. X or Mrs. Y as something they would be sorry to see disappear, even after six months, and they will make sure that it does not.

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 creates a new offence, that of refusing to give a name and address.  I have already expanded on that point to indicate that it includes far more than this.  An offence will be committed if a person refuses to be searched, photographed, palm printed and so on. fairly significant new offences are being created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The natural reaction of an innocent person detained by the Garda who feels he is not guilty of any offence is to refuse <Col N="326" /> to be treated as a criminal and the taking of photographs would indicate to most people that they were being treated as such.  I have concrete examples of situations where young men stopped by gardaí felt they were innocent of any offence. Subsequently one of them ended up in court on a charge of assault on a garda arising from the garda's attempt to get them into a squad car.  Likewise the other person was charged with assault arising from questions being asked of them and so on.  It is not uncommon for people who regard themselves as innocent to react strongly against being taken away in a squad car to a Garda station.  In this case they will also be subjected to having their photographs taken and so on.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the provisions of this section be tightened up to ensure that a person will be fully aware that they will be guilty of an offence merely by obstructing the activities of the Garda in relation to them.  The case about which I was speaking resulted in a young man being sentenced in the District Court to six months imprisonment.  It cost him £1,000 to appeal the District Court decision, when the District Court decision was thrown out and the relevant court judge indicated that the charge being so flimsy should never have been brought in the first place.  Now the situation will be that a person can be charged with an offence simply by refusing to give his or her name and address or allowing themselves to be photographed or finger-printed. This section should not be passed too easily without some detailed discussion.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of this section about which I am concerned is that the court judgment given in relation to a young person being entitled to have a parent                                                                                               present during questioning, as far as I can ascertain, does not apply when the young person is being finger-printed, searched or photographed.  That is a major defect of this section.  Indeed the judge in giving his decision in the case to which I referred earlier &mdash; the Minister himself furnished me with a copy &mdash; indicated that it was important that the Garda be obliged to notify a parent and that a young person should not be questioned until a parent <Col N="327" /> is present.  If the judge felt that way in relation to questioning then surely it is equally important that a parent be present when a young person is being finger-printed or photographed.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that aspect.</P>

      <P>I have a couple of comments to make on this section.  We should realise that it is easy for us sitting in this House to be casual about the written word.  We should consciously appreciate the fact that what we are doing in this and other sections does involve a very substantial attack on and make in-roads into civil liberties.  Let us be clear about it &mdash; it may not happen often but there will be occasions from time to time when a completely innocent party will find himself or herself, by mistake if for no other reason, being detained for many hours in a Garda station, having their names and addresses demanded, being searched, photographed, finger-printed and, at the end of the day have it transpire that they were a perfectly innocent party.  We should be consciously aware of what we are doing here and assess the parameters beyond which we are not prepared to go, examining the extent to which this inroad into civil liberty is or is not warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out by many other Deputies, a new offence is being created here and people will not know of its existence. As a basic essential before a person would be guilty of an offence under this section, a new offence, there would have to be a warning given to him, have it specifically drawn to his attention that it would be an offence to refuse to submit to one of the tests involved, the rendering of name and address, taking of photographs, obstruction of a garda and that, if such a warning was not given and was not specifically drawn to that person's attention, then the offence would not be committed.  Just as for the offence of dangerous driving it used to be the position that before the offence was maintained the Garda were obliged to give notice of intention to prosecute, for these new offences it should be a condition precedent to the commission of the offence <Col N="328" /> that a person be specifically warned that if they fail to furnish the relevant information, fail to consent to photographing fingerprinting or whatever they would be committing an offence and that failure to give such notice would mean that that offence had not been committed.</P>
    <P>There could be a situation in which a perfectly innocent party was pulled in and detained.  Understandably such a person would be extremely angry.  He, knowing that he is perfectly innocent of any offence whatsoever, finds himself, to say the least, at loss of his liberty and in a harassed position at the hands of the Garda.  Such a person would be angry and it would be quite understandable that if an innocent party refused to give his name and address or refused to allow himself be finger-printed and so on a situation could evolve in which that person, who started off at the beginning of the exercise being perfectly innocent, ends up as a result of the procedures being guilty of an offence under this section.  It would be entirely intolerable that any person, having been innocent to begin with, would find themselves, as a result of the operations of this section transformed into a criminal, a criminal amenable to a fairly substantial penalty, £1,000, in accordance with the Minister's amendment, plus one year's imprisonment. For that reason I should have thought that it would be a basic requirement that a warning be given to such persons, it being drawn specifically to their attention that they would be committing an offence if they failed to comply and that they be given a reasonable opportunity and sufficient time to consider that and take a decision on the matter.  I agree that that infringement of civil liberties is necessary anyway.  But if that is to be, then as a minimum the safeguard ought to be implemented.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) reads:</P>
    <P>The powers conferred by subsection (1) (c) and (1) (d) shall not be exercised except on the authority of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> I would feel it would be better, meet the requirements of justice better and have justice seen to be done, if the requirement there was that of a district justice instead of any officer of the Garda Síochána.  Just as the authority of a district justice is required for searching premises, so should the authority or prior sanction of a district justice be required for searching a person.  When a person is in Garda hands I would say that there should be some independent official &mdash; namely, a member of the Judiciary in the person of a district justice &mdash; who would look at the situation objectively and determine whether or not these infringements were warranted in the circumstances that would be presented to the court by the prosecuting authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some brief comments to make on this section.  I agree with some other Deputies that, apart altogether from section 7 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, where if a person obstructs or fails to give his name and address and so on he or she is subject to prosecution, this would appear to be a new offence.  I do not understand the resistance of the Minister to the suggestion that people should be clearly forewarned, because it is unlikely in most cases &mdash; some examples have been given &mdash; that people will refuse for different reasons.  They may think they have a right to refuse to give their name and address but will then be subjected to a maximum fine of £1,000 or 12 months in prison.  The Minister felt that in practice gardaí tell people.  I do not know if that is the case.  In fact, it appears that it is not the case.  What I object to is this cute form of investigation, the cuteness of the whole thing, leaving it all to the goodwill of those responsible for the arresting and saying that they will not in any way abuse the powers, make fools of people or take advantage of their innocence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard of two leaving certificate girls from Coolock who while walking along a street one evening following the breaking of a window in an area were questioned by gardaí from a squad car in regard to that crime.  The girls refused to give their names and addresses because <Col N="330" /> they did not want their parents to know they were out at that time.  They were taken to the Bridewell where they spent the night.  On the following day they were brought before the court and through nerves, giggling and so on, not understanding the procedure in the District Court, were sentenced to seven days in prison for contempt of court.  A lot of people were outraged by that.  Such things happen.  I do not see any complication in inserting a provision to deal with such occurences.  It is not a good enough case to say that this is a complicated matter, that lots of forms have to be filled up and that a garda might inadvertently omit something.  It is a simple matter for a garda when he stops a person to tell him or her that refusal to give a name and address could render them liable to a fine of £1,000.</P>
    <P>Police work by its nature &mdash; it may be an occupational hazard &mdash; trains people to be suspicious and to watch out for things that the rest of us would not even dream of looking for.  In that sense people investigating a crime have an enormous advantage over innocent people in that they know a lot of things innocent people would not and could take advantage of. I do not understand why the simple warning I have suggested could not be given.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Bill is passed there will be an effort by the Garda to inform the public of their rights and the changes that have taken place.  In this case the quality of the warning should be clear.  It is not sufficient to say that a garda will give a warning.  It is necessary to outline exactly the form that warning should take so that people will not be under any doubt as to their rights.  A safeguard is needed.  The warning should be given in a proper manner.  I realise that in the final analysis people have the interpretation of the courts to fall back on.  We should advertise this aspect of the Bill and the fact that the Garda will be required to inform the people they arrest, if they refuse to give certain information, what will happen.  It is done in other countries, including the United States, where police refer to the Constitution and the rights of those arrested.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the <Col N="331" /> decision to increase the fine from £800 to £1,000.  The amendments under discussion, Nos. 21, 22, 28, 33, 34, 44 and 52, proposing to increase the fine to £1,000, indicate that people will need a lot of money.  Deputy De Rossa gave a good example today of people who in order to defend themselves, although they may be innocent, require substantial sums of money.  Very often people will not be in a position to raise that money.  Such an amount of money will not be available in most instances.  As I knew the farming community &mdash; one of my parents was from the country &mdash; there was always a large sum of money, £500 or £800, lying about because farmers did not go to town very often; but one would not find such an amount of money in most houses, particularly where the breadwinner depends on a weekly wage.  In most cases there would not be a bank account with a pot of money in it, particularly in city or deprived areas.  For that reason jail sentences will ensue in most cases, although it will not be the maximum sentence.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have clinics and look after local authority areas are aware of the many people who fall behind in their payments of rent and cannot catch up on the arrears although the amounts involved are small.  In some cases the amount is less than £100 but it can rise to as much as £2,000.  That is an indication of the pressure people are under.  Those people would not be able to get a large sum of money together.  It would be difficult for them to get help from their friends.  The people who are not badly off or the wealthy criminals are likely to have money and will not be affected, but it will be jail by default for the poor.</P>
    <P>I understand why in certain circumstances it is necessary to be in a position to take fingerprints, particularly at the scene of a crime.  That enables the Garda to check fingerprints found at a scene against criminal records.  That would be a useful way of improving the detection rate.  Section 5 (1) (c) and (d) required the authority of a superintendent before a person can be photographed, finger-printed or palm-printed and we know <Col N="332" /> from experience that that is unlikely to be refused.  This experience will not be forgotten by those who are detained and have to go through the humiliating procedure of being photographed, finger-printed and palm-printed.  However, I can understand the necessity, especially after a crime has been committed for fingerprinting, but I believe also that a great deal of resistance and bitterness will come about if this is used widely and if it is not controlled and used only in cases of absolute necessity.  The Minister has taken well the worries of Members in relation to searching, being searched by people of the opposite sex and so on, and I am reassured about all this.</P>
    <P>They are the only points I have to make in that regard.  Really it boils down to the fact that I cannot understand why there should be any resistance to giving a warning under this section.  In my mind at least there is a slight suspicion about the necessity for the Bill and the section when provision is not made for this warning.  I emphasise that people who are going to be detained or are brought into detention very often really do not know what is happening and they are in such a state of shock that it may not be enough for a garda or arresting officer to say later that he warned the person.  It will be necessary to give the warning in the form of a notice and to have it displayed in the place of detention.  I do not think that we will lose out at all by being absolutely frank and clear about what is likely to happen in the event of refusal to give name and address or other such information.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The powers being requested for the Garda under this section are the minimum that I consider they need.  It is fairly obvious that if powers are given without any sanction whatsoever and if the Garda can photograph, fingerprint and take the names and addresses only of people who are willing to volunteer this information then they do not need the power in the first place.  Any law requires some sanction if people do not comply with that law.  That is fairly obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of a new offence being created, that if you obstruct the Garda <Col N="333" /> you are liable to a maximum fine of £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment, that offence exists already under the Criminal Law Act, 1976, the Road Traffic Act and the Litter Acts, to go from very serious legislation in offences, so to speak, to less serious ones.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Sometimes they are prosecuted, I think.  In that situation nothing has come to my notice which would indicate that we must write into this Bill a warning to people.  I have had no complaints about the operation of that section of the 1976 Act.  My reluctance to accept the advice which has been given to me about warning that people may be in danger of committing an offence arises because I do not think it is necessary at all.  However, I am prepared to think about it again, not in the context of moving an amendment to the section but of seeing whether it is necessary to provide for that under the regulations.  It is a matter which has been plucked out of the section and is beginning to take on a life of its own here in the House.  I do not think that a serious concern exists there in practical life, but I will examine it again and if it is so I will see if anything can be done in terms of Garda practice and their internal regulations or in terms of statutory regulations that I am preparing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor made that point and he went on to talk about the powers being conferred here on superintendents whereby one can be photographed, fingerprinted or strip searched only if a superintendent authorises it.  It would not be sufficient for the member in charge or the arresting member to authorise these procedures.  His suggestion was that it would be more appropriate to take somebody before the District Court.  I do not think that is necessary, and it is not practical. The 20-hour detention arises only with the consent of the detainee, if questioning is to be suspended between 12 midnight and 8 a.m.  Therefore, the 12-hour period of detention and shorter will be quite frequent.  In addition, for many <Col N="334" /> people arrested on reasonable suspicion and detained under section 3 the questioning part of the procedure would be quite short, but the taking of fingerprints and photographs might be a very important part of the Garda investigation as they seek to detect a crime.  Somebody could be in the Garda station for half an hour or an hour, give his name and address, be asked a couple of questions and then fingerprinted because the Garda have fingerprints at the scene of the crime and they will want to match them against the prints of people of whom they have a reasonable suspicion of being involved in the crime.  Therefore, the question of going before a district justice for this part really should not arise.  A superintendent is a senior Garda officer and our superintendents can be trusted to carry out this authorisation in a trustworthy way.</P>
    <P>People talk about the humiliation of being photographed.  That is coming from people around the House here who are frequently photographed.  What humiliation is involved in being photographed? I am upset at times with some of the photographs published of me but I never felt humiliated when the photographing was taking place.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not see it as a major encroachment on civil liberties.  It is the minimum necessary for the Garda to investigate offences.  On the question of the fines which Deputy Skelly raised, these are maximum fines.  They are being lined up with what is proposed <Col N="335" /> in Bills that have gone through the House quite recently.  It is appropriate that fines should be in general lined up with fines in other legislation and should be updated from time to time.  Experience in the courts is that maximum fines are imposed only very rarely and the judge has discretion to choose a sum in accordance with the means of the person before the court.  The point was made on several occasions this morning that access to justice is as open as access to the Ritz.  If you can pay for it it is freely available.  That argument may have some merit, but the way it is being put is as if the cost of justice was the fault of the Government. It is expensive to take cases before the courts, particularly on the civil side, and it is very expensive to run them right up along through the whole paraphernalia of solicitors and barristers which one requies to get something into the High Court, but a great deal of the cost is due to the fees charged by solicitors and barristers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that this is really much in line with offences under the Litter Act and the Road Transport Acts but, whilst the fine may be the same, the procedure involves the invasion of a person's privacy and the behaviour that might be shown towards that person in detention in not alone taking his name and address but searching or causing him to be searched and photographed, and his fears as to how that photograph may be used arise.  A police station is not a photographic studio.  I am talking about the psychological pressures that can be brought to bear on people. They are subjected to an experience over which they have no control.  There is a sense of outrage, particularly in a person who is innocent.  At least people should be warned beforehand of the consequences if they obstruct this procedure. It is an undesirable situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the Garda, it would be easier for both parties if the Garda could carry out the procedure in a good mannered and civilised way, first having spelled out to the person concerned what the consequences of obstruction <Col N="336" /> would be.  If such a procedure was adopted it would help to ease the humiliating procedures to which people will be subjected.  Subsection (3) of section 5 states that these powers do not empower a member of the Garda to require a person to remove his underclothing, except where such member, with reasonable cause, suspects that he has concealed on his person a controlled drug or an explosive substance, and a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of superintendent so authorises.</P>
    <P>However, because of the prevalence of the drug problem it would be easy for a garda to say that with reasonable cause he might suspect a person was carrying drugs.  I should like to see the garda comply with all the procedures before strip searching a person.  A garda might use a threat.  A junior member of the Garda might think that a threat would render a person more vulnerable, would inflict psychological pressure, that the person would regard a strip search as extremely humiliating.  We know that in the case of young persons in particular even the threat of a strip search would be nearly psychologically unbearable.  Therefore, I suggest that we must ensure the the Garda would have to go to the superintendent first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what the Minister has said in regard to this.  I heard only the latter part of Deputy Skelly's interrvention.  Deputy Skelly suggested the idea that the section might do away with the specific requirement that somebody would be liable to punishment if he suspected these various forms of record, but this seems to be allowable in other branches of the law &mdash; the furnishing of records and so on.  In all these cases refusal to submit is an offence.  It may be that in exceptional cases those Acts go out of their way to provide that the officer would articulate the demand and the consequential offence on refusal.  In most cases people do not get specific warnings. That is wrong.  Any reasonable member of the Garda, or a health inspector, or a weights and measures inspector, or any such officer, as a matter of common decency will say to the person concerned: <Col N="337" />&ldquo;If you refuse to do certain things you are liable to prosecution and to heavy penalties&rdquo;.  Of course the inspector would not go out of his way to pretend that criminal consequences would not follow a refusal.</P>
      <P>Whatever validity Deputy Skelly's idea may have in regard to this Bill, the same validity must apply in regard to any other part of the law.  Therefore, I do not think this is a serious flaw in the section.  I must confess I am more or less on the Ministry's side <i>vis-à-vis</i> the points made by Deputy Barnes in regard to the seriousness of applying measures of this kind at all.  I do not want to go back on ground covered on Second Stage but the thrust of the Bill seems to be to push back the moment at which the citizen's suspicions are aroused.  People are every day subjected to such matters even though they may be totally innocent.  If somebody is arrested and a prosecution is brought he is still an innocent man but he may have to go through a court hearing before he is acquitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the Bill will be to push that back a little further &mdash; there is a certain inching back of the tide against the traditional conventions in section 3. However, as the Minister has pointed out, the powers of sections 3 and 5 cannot be exercised against any old person the Garda may bring up for any old reason, for example, hanging around the Phoenix Park when he should not be there. Section 3 (2) refers to a person whom a member of the Garda Síochána arrests, whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects of having committed a very serious offence, namely, an offence contemplated by subsection (1), an offence which by virtue of any enactment might attract the punishment of imprisonment for a term of five years.  It is a very serious offence.  As I have said, we are not talking about just any old person being taken up for a trivial offence and we are not talking about an arbitrary, completely subjective, belief on the part of a police officer. We are talking about a belief which a garda holds on reasonable objective grounds.  The garda must be objectively reasonable because the slightest element of malice or neglect or caprice in the <Col N="338" /> garda's behaviour will make him liable &mdash; at least in theory, and I am not trying to exaggerate the value of that theory in practice &mdash; to punishment for false imprisonment in the same way as any other person.  While the person to whom section 3 applies must remain an innocent person, he is not just any innocent person but one who, in the light of the Minister's encroachment on the smiling sands of civil liberty, so to speak, is in a qualified position <i>vis-à-vis</i> his previous situation. When we weigh the degree of the encroachment and the quality of it in an age in which there are so many horrors all around us, I cannot regard it as being very serious.  We are talking of photographing people, taking their fingerprints and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>And searching them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at one with Deputy Barnes in that it must not be the case that a garda would simply say in any instance that section 5 operates and that consequently all these measures must follow. Obviously, only those measures which seem appropriate to the circumstances of the case should be applied.  I am not trying to minimise what would be the seriousness of applying an arbitrary power of search or of searching someone capriciously or for the purpose of humiliating him, but in the kind of world in which we are living we must strike a balance and that may involve pushing the line a little distance.  That is something many people seem to agree with but which they seem unwilling to accept when it comes to the point.  Getting the balance right may involve pushing the line a short distance temporarily into an area which was conventionally one of civil liberty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other marginal matter to which I would like to draw attention.  This country might be easier to police if all of us had to carry identity cards.  I am not sure that the Garda have ever recommended such a step.  The use of identity cards might not alter very much the level of crime.  We would prefer not to have them but on the Continent they are the norm where it is an offence not to have some means of identification.  We apply <Col N="339" /> some rules which serve in large measure the purpose of the detection of potential crime.  Why, otherwise, must I carry number plates on my car and in addition keep them illuminated at night?  My criminal record is not extensive but about 20 years ago I was convicted for failing to light a rear number plate.  The bulb had become broken and I had not noticed it. Those were the days when a much smaller police force spent time prosecuting people like myself for such offences, but we are living in different times.  I only mention the incident by way of a humble illustration of a measure which one could easily argue has civil liberty dimensions, because the fact that one's car must have a number plate which is identified officially would in theory enable not only the Garda but any private person to track the motorist's movements, to find out who his friends were, the houses he had stopped at and so on.  We take that in our stride and we do so because it is directed largely at the detection of offences associated with road traffic.  The measure has not been applied unreasonably.  It has been applied by the reasonable people who make up the great majority of the police force.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not being blasé in taking it for granted that in respect of the powers of a section such as the one we are dealing with here, though I know they are incomparably more closely connected with the human personality than is the number plate on one's car, the same reasonable spirit which has informed the application of law and order in respect of traffic control and so on would equally inform the application of the types of powers we are discussing.  I hope that the Minister, apart from making the powers of the Bill temporary, will seek opportunities of finding ways in which the legislation can be debated by this House from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister has responded to various remarks made, he has not referred to the point I made regarding the presence of parents while young people are being photographed, searched, or fingerprinted.  I repeat the point that if the courts consider it necessary <Col N="340" /> that a parent should be present during the interrogation of a child it is equally reasonable that parents should be present when tests of various kinds are being taken.</P>
      <P>On the question of the age categories to which the Bill applies, as it stands it applies to anyone over the age of seven. The Minister has given an undertaking to raise that to 12 or something in that region.  But, even if he raises the age in this respect to 12, the legislation will apply to young people from that age upwards and I do not consider it acceptable that such young people should be subjected to these tests in the absence of parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has talked about access to justice and said that the Government could not be faulted so far as such access is concerned.  I appreciate that.  He then mentioned the size of the fees.  I appreciate that aspect of it, too, but I should like to keep it in the context in which the point was raised and that was in the context of the consequences of what we are doing in this Bill.  In that respect I raised the point earlier that all of us here have a responsibility and must recognise the difficulty which can arise and must provide for that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of fingerprinting has been discussed at some length.  I take it that the powers being provided for here are required to deal with such crimes as car stealing and house breaking in which instances it is not possible at present to take fingerprints.  Unless somebody is already in the system there is nothing to compare fingerprints with.  The provision here would enable the Garda to do a cross-check against fingerprints they would take at the scene of car stealing or of house breaking.  It is in that context that we see it as being useful.  There are a great number of house break-ins and car thefts at present.  The question of car thefts will probably come in under a Road <Col N="341" /> Traffic Bill.  In the case of a house break-in, for example, the Garda will take fingerprints but there is nothing to cross-check them with.  Perhaps the Minister might elaborate on that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the section which deals with the giving of a name and address and where a person fails or refuses to do so or gives one which is misleading, what about a person who is deaf or dumb or who is mentally handicapped?  I presume we would rely on the common sense of the Garda, but it is more marginal when a person is mildly mentally handicapped because they may appear to be normal. I do not know how the Minister will deal with that.  It may have to be left to the intelligence and goodwill of the gardaí operating the section.  It is important that we make it clear that we do not intend the section to be abused and would expect the Garda to be vigilant when applying this section particularly with regard to people who might not be able respond in the normal way.</P>
    <P>What extra resources does the Minister see as being necessary to implement this section?  Obviously a great deal of equipment will be needed to implement the section properly.  It may be some time before the equipment is provided and, therefore, some time before the section can be put fully into operation.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors stated that the net effect of these provisions was that considerable extra resources would have to be made available.  They said that extra sergeants and additional clerical staff would be required and that the accommodation in Garda stations would have to be improved.  They pointed out that many stations do not have proper interview rooms.  There would need to be a programme of in-service training for members.  There would also be a large number of standardised procedures and forms.  Has the Minister thought about the extent of the resources which will be required to implement the section?  In what percentage of cases does the Minister think this section will be used?  Presumably in many cases it will not come to this.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke about photographing and said it was not such a deprivation of liberty.  What happens to the photograph?  One would have to look at section 6 (2) which states:</P>
      <P>Where proceedings for an offence to which section 3 applies are not instituted against the person within the period of six months from the date of the taking of the photograph or print and the failure to institute such proceedings within that period is not due to the fact that he has absconded or cannot be found, the destruction shall be carried out on the expiration of that period.</P>
      <P>Nobody wants to have details like that on record.  One of the humiliating things about being photographed and finger-printed is that one is not treated in a usual way.  One would probably feel like a criminal. I do not imagine one would be relaxed or comfortable knowing that there is a record of this nature held in the depot and that when a crime is being investigated one's photograph and fingerprints are thumbed through and that one's name appears on a list together with those of other people.  This is a serious loss of liberty.  I do not think one would feel happy until such records were destroyed.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not see anything wrong with that, but then neither did he see anything in Deputy Woods' suggestion that every hour someone should go to the detained person to check that they were satisfied with the way the detention and interrogation was proceeding.  The Minister suggested that they might be asleep and would be disturbed.  That is a naive approach.  It seems that the Minister is not aware of the reality or is so naive as to think that a person would not be bothered by being fingerprinted or photographed or that a person could possibly sleep in the circumstances that pertain in our prisons or in the Bridewell. How many of the 33 women last weekend slept during their 30 hour detention?  it would be interesting to find out, as I am sure we will in the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not fair to assume that reasonableness will be used at all times.  It is not <Col N="343" /> reasonable that a man who is detained for allegedly causing £15 worth of damage to another person's car can be brought to a station and have his belt, laces and tie removed and be kept there for three hours.  That is not reasonable behaviour.  Deputy Kelly said we were not talking about any person or any crime but rather serious crimes under section 3. We had a long drawn out discussion on that over a number of weeks.  While it was not universally agreed it was made clear that we are talking about a wide range of offences which include larceny and the theft of small amounts of money which would enable this section to apply. Five years is the maximum sentence but the offences for which people can be detained and to which these two sections will apply are wide ranging.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Barnes and her comments on the threat of strip searching. Although this does not happen a lot, it does happen.  In cases where women were detained the threat that they would be strip searched by a male member of the Garda was used.  The thought of this often causes them to go into hysterics.</P>
    <P>I am glad that it has been mentioned and that the Minister is aware of it.  It is not permissible and it is not forseen that male members of the Garda will be allowed to do that.  We should take on board also the threat that that could happen because that in itself is very upsetting.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Woods made a number of points.  He hoped the powers in this Bill would be used sensibly by the Garda when dealing with people who were mentally handicapped or intoxicated.  I express that hope as well.  I cannot envisage a situation where somebody who is mentally handicapped could be considered to be guilty of any crime because they do not have the mental capacity to commit a crime. He mentioned also extra equipment being required at Garda stations.  I expect there will be a significant increase in the number of photographs and fingerprints being taken, but it is very difficult to quantify the additional demands which <Col N="344" /> will arise.  The power is framed in such a way that it would not apply to all detainees and it would require a superintendent to authorise the photographing and taking of fingerprints.  These powers are already exercised under the Offences Against the State Act and consequently the equipment is available throughout the State, particularly in the larger Garda stations where people are fingerprinted and photographed under the Offences Against the State Act.  There would be some increase in equipment necessary but I do not think it would be a significant cost in the context of the overall Justice budget.</P>
      <P>Where there might be a problem is in the forensic science laboratory.  I am concerned that the laboratory would be appropriately staffed and have the necessary equipment.  They are very well equipped at the moment but they will need extra staff.  In their submission the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors said they would need many extra sergeants and clerical assistants. Obviously that is what they would say. They are representing their members and they will make demands for extra resources once the Bill comes into effect. The resources which will be necessary will not mean a major increase on what is there already.  Remember, detention will take place in central Garda stations, three or four in a Garda division.  These are already well equipped.  There is a fairly extensive building programme underway throughout the country and the physical surroundings in stations will be much improved, as will the equipment available.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods asked if I could estimate the percentage of cases.  I could not, but there will be provision in the regulations for records to be kept of the number of people detained, the number photographed, fingerprinted and so on. We will get the pattern as we go on.  In my view it would not be appropriate for me to give an estimate now.  There is no intention that this will apply to all detainees, only to a proportion of detainees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Skelly mentioned the level of offences.  There is a wide range of serious offences.  In his previous intervention he <Col N="345" /> spoke about a garda stopping somebody walking along the road and asking him for his name and address and said that if the person did not give that information he would be liable under this section. That would not arise because the powers here only arise where a person is detained pursuant to section 3.  One has to be detained pursuant to section 3 on reasonable suspicion and taken to the Garda station before this section can be implemented. It is not an offence to refuse to give a garda your name and address if you are stopped on the street.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Skelly thinks I am naive because nobody said anything nice about me for months.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Strip searching or the threat of strip searching could be a pressure which would be objectionable, but if evidence or a confession is obtained under such a threat it would be inadmissible.  I take the point that was made and consider it was worth making.  I do not think anybody is enthusiastic about strip seaching and nothing in the Bill gives a new power to strip search.  This is maintaining the existing power under present law.  It is worth making the point, for the record, that explosives have been smuggled into places like Portlaoise Prison in the orifices of the body and explosions have occurred within the prison and on one occasion people lost their lives.  Drugs are smuggled into the country in the same manner. However distasteful we find the power which is there in existing law, I think these powers are necessary.  As I said, I am not extending the power in the Bill. As a matter of fact, the power of search in this Bill is being restricted so that it does not include body search, and the reference to drugs and explosives is to maintain the power under existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy Barnes and Deputy Skelly about the threat of strip searching being used as a pressure, because this is not something we could agree with.  Even where it might be appropriate to have a body or strip <Col N="346" /> search subsequently, where drugs or explosives are involved, the fact that the questioning garda would use it as a threat would cause that evidence to be inadmissible.</P>

In the case of a search it should be done by a doctor.  It is not the practice at present to bring in outside photographers but if we move towards the &ldquo;civilianisation&rdquo; of tasks in Garda stations, there are eventualities where photographers could be taken by a civilian employed by the Garda or brought in for that purpose.</P>

In theory that phrase &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; could mean literally any other person.  The Minister has expressed the opinion that only a medical person should be involved in body searches or strip searches.  That type of search should be confined and perhaps the best way of doing so would be in the regulations proposed to be introduced.</P>

That has not resulted in the Garda designating a third party.  The intention as I understand it was to allow for doctor to carry out a body search.  That is the way it has operated since then.

    <P>(3)  A failure on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána to observe any provision of the regulations shall not of itself render that person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings or of itself affect the lawfulness of the custody of the detained person or the admissibility in evidence of any statement made by him.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 40, to delete &ldquo;section directs.&rdquo;  and substitute &ldquo;section directs, save where notice has been received that:</P>
      <P>(i) civil proceedings may issue, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  a complaint has been lodged with the Garda Síochána Complaints Commission&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) says that every photograph (including a negative), fingerprint and palm print of a person taken in pursuance of the powers conferred by section 5 and every copy and record thereof shall, if not previously destroyed, be destroyed as this section directs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention in this amendment is to ensure that if these are needed by the <Col N="350" /> Garda Síochána Complaints Commission they will be available to them.  The Complaints Commission, through their procedures, may take a longer time to deal with a problem than the time limit mentioned for destruction of these records.</P>
    <P>According to subsection (2):</P>
    <P>Where proceedings for an offence to which section 3 applies are not instituted against the person within the period of six months from the date of the taking of the photograph or print and the failure to institute such proceedings within that period is not due to the fact that he has absconded or cannot be found, the destruction shall be carried out on the expiration of that period.</P>
    <P>If a complaint has been lodged with the Garda Complaints Commission, these may be necessary or useful to them, and also in the case of a civil action being taken.  If the fingerprints on the objects were found to be obviously not similar to those of the accused, it might be necessary to show this in a civil case.  Photographs showing bruises or other characteristics could be useful either in civil proceedings or where a complaint had been lodged.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts the intention and the spirit of this amendment, it will be necessary to have a provision that these be destroyed after such proceedings, or after the Complaints Commission had dealt with the complaint.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands, the prints must be destroyed six months after they have been taken, unless prosecution for a section 3 offence has been taken out in the meantime.  Where such proceedings have been instituted, they must be <Col N="351" /> destroyed, broadly speaking, when a person has been aquitted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods has given a number of examples about bruises, fingerprints and so on.  I find it difficult to visualise in what circumstances records of fingerprints could be material evidence, either at the hearing of a complaint or at civil proceedings &mdash; the point about the bruises, perhaps, in civil proceedings.  I have no objection to this amendment.  However, it would need to be redrafted, because, as the Deputy has now pointed out, there is no provision for the eventual destruction of the prints.  It would permit the prints and photographs to be held indefinitely if a complaint were taken through the complaints procedure, or if a civil action were taken.  The notice could obviously operate only if it was received before the prints were destroyed.  There could not be an obligation which could arise after the prints were destroyed.  If the Deputy presses the amendment I will accept it on the basis that it needs to be redrafted and I will come back with it on Report Stage.</P>

    <P>The amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;dealt with under the Probation of&rdquo; and also to delete &ldquo;Offenders Act, 1907&rdquo;.  This amendment would ensure that where a person has been in court and <Col N="353" /> the judge has decided that the Probation Act shall apply the fingerprints and photographs should be destroyed.  My understanding of the Probation of Offenders Act is that when a person is before the court for the first occasion and the judge considers he warrants the application of the Probation Act there should not be a file on that person in Garda control because the intention of the Probation Act is to ensure that a first offender does not have a record which can be held against him in the future.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This amendment would mean that if a person was dealt with under the Probation Act his fingerprints would have to be destroyed as if he were acquitted.  I am not accepting this amendment.  I said on Second Stage that the Probation Act is widely used in our courts and even people with several previous convictions have been dealt with under it.  A person can also be dealt with four, five and six times under the Probation Act.  In order for the Act to be applied at all in the courts, facts must be proved.  While, technically, this may not be termed a conviction it is far from an acquittal.  Many people under the Probation of Offenders Act come up time and again in the courts.  It is important to have those people's fingerprints because it will assist in detection of crime in a major way.  Up to 30 per cent of all crime is committed by people under 17 years of age.  There are young people who are habitual offenders, who are getting into trouble time and time again.  It would be of major assistance to the Garda also if records of people who are dealt with under the Probation of Offenders Act are kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The young person who appears before the court and has the Probation Act applied to him has, presumably, been found guilty of the offence or has pleaded guilty to the offence with which he is charged and the judge, having considered the matter, decides that the Probation Act should be applied because the offence was not a serious one or <Col N="354" /> because he feels that the imposition of a fine or a prison term would have a bad effect on the person concerned far and above the offence with which he was charged and found guilty.  For that reason the keeping of records on such a person is unwarranted in the circumstances.  I ask the Minister to look at it again and to consider that the Probation Act is applied only in circumstances where there is not a serious offence involved.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his position on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly support Deputy De Rossa on this amendment.  We have always regarded the application of the Probation Act as implying that there would be no record and that the person's record subsequently would be clean.  It is normally applied by the courts for offences of a minor nature and where the individual can show that his character and behaviour have been reasonably good.  The Probation of Offenders Act spells out the cases in which it is actually to be applied.  In view of that it is reasonable to say that there should not be a record in that case.  I appreciate the Minister's position and I appreciate that the Minister is being persuaded that some of these people will come back again with other crimes and that consequently it would be of great advantage to have the record there and to have it maintained. In the first instance, the records will not be destroyed for six months afterwards. Even at that it depends when the charge comes up.  How long after that will it be before these ones are destroyed?  Subsection (3) states that the destruction shall be carried out on the conclusion of the proceedings.</P>

    <P>It would be a very unhappy development in relation to the Probation Act if records were maintained.  It is reasonable that in the case of probation there should be no record, even though some of the people given the benefit of probation will come back again.  The whole spirit of the Act relates to people who would not be coming back again.  It might be better to put the juvenile liaison officers in close contact with people who are given the benefit of the Probation Act rather than <Col N="355" /> maintaining a criminal record for such people.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are proposing in section 27 (1) to have fingerprints taken of persons convicted of any indictable offence, even those dealt with under the Probation Act.  From the point of view of crime investigation, it is very important that a proper fingerprint record be built up.  There are practical difficulties.  I can see the concern of Deputies.  For the Probation of Offenders Act to apply the facts must be proven in court.  Technically one could argue that it is not a conviction but it is not an acquittal either.  Say in the case of car stealing or the run of breaking and entering in the city centre, the Garda information is that quite small numbers of young people are involved.  They come to notice again and again.  While there is a very strong suspicion it is difficult to get them into court.  I share the concern of both the Deputies who have spoken on this matter about people going through life with a police file because they had done something when they were young.  I would put forward this suggestion which might be helpful.  While it is necessary for the Garda to have records of people who are convicted because there is a tendency for them to repeat their crimes, but I could examine the possibility of introducing an amendment on Report Stage which would involve the destruction of the fingerprints of people dealt with under the Probation Act if they had stayed out of trouble for a particular period.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Garda interest would be that they would have a record of fingerprints so that they could match up in cases of larceny, burglary or car theft, but if a young person stays out of trouble for a period I do not see why there should be a Garda file on him.  I will come back with an amendment along those lines on Report Stage.  I want <Col N="356" /> to maintain the power within the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the destruction of records and it is one about which we would have considerable concern. There should be a process by which records are destroyed after a period.  This section makes such provision and is a safeguard.  It is to be welcomed as such, since the Minister has given an undertaking to examine and come back to us on Report Stage.  The proposal that there be a limited period for those dealt with under the Probation of Offenders Act seems to be a reasonable compromise.</P>
      <P>In regard to the section generally, of course we would be concerned that the destruction would actually take place, that there would not be any sort of secret retention of particular files or photographs. I presume that in subsection (1) where there is reference to &ldquo;Every photograph (including a negative)&rdquo; means also diapositives and that anything else taken will be destroyed after the given period. Subsection (3) (a) is the one we have just been discussing concerning the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907.  Subsection (3) (b) is where the person, having been tried on indictment, is acquitted, on the acquittal. There may be a need for a subsection (3) (c) which would read something like the following: that the destruction shall be carried out&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) where a <i>nolle prosequi</i> has been entered, within one month after it has been so entered, unless an order has <Col N="358" /> been made by the District Court pursuant to subsection (5) of this section.</P>
    <P>In other words, where there has been a hearing in the District Court, on the conclusion of proceedings it may be necessary to include &mdash; and I would ask the Minister to examine this &mdash; a situation in which a <i>nolle prosequi</i> is entered in the course of the proceedings.  It may or may not be covered, but if it is not it could be done by the tabling of a suitable amendment on Report Stage.  It could happen that after a person had been returned for trial the Director of Public Prosecutions might enter a <i>nolle prosequi,</i> thereby dropping the charges at that point. Because that did not come up for determination in court the relevant records could remain floating.  This is something the Minister might examine.  One does not like to see the extension of these records over such a wide area.  Nevertheless it is necessary in practical terms and we are prepared to support the section bearing in mind the undertakings the Minister has given us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On the question of the <i>nolle prosequi,</i> I do not think it is necessary but I will examine it now that the Deputy has raised the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of there being no guarantee that the Garda would not secretly retain records after the prescribed time had expired, no one can give that kind of guarantee.  All I would say in a general way is that there is a statutory obligation to destroy the records and copies thereof once we make this the law.  Any breach of such an explicit direction would leave those members of the Garda Síochána responsible open to serious disciplinary action, including the possibility of dismissal from the force.  To become involved in the kind of situation about which Deputies have expressed concern would require quite a number of gardaí. To be quite frank about it, there is one thing happening at present, as a result of our deliberations here and public criticism of individual members of the Garda Síochána, and it is this: any member of the Garda Síochána is not now going to put one foot past the other, getting himself <Col N="359" /> into any kind of situation in which he could involve himself in disciplinary charges.  That is a very good thing for the behaviour of the Garda Síochána and they are now very concerned with it.  It is public knowledge that a number of gardaí have been dismissed in recent times for breaches of one sort or another or for acting in a manner which was not befitting the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>There is another matter of which we should be aware as well, that is, that the Garda have to operate and that they are the only Garda force we have.  If the Garda feel that they are constantly at risk in the carrying out of their legitimate duties then we will not have a very effective Garda force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We must make it quite clear that we are talking about giving the Garda extra powers &mdash; we are not talking about anything else &mdash; and we are talking about maintaining a reasonable balance in giving such powers and having reasonable safeguards.  As far as the Garda are concerned, the House is going a long way in relation to their requests.  There is no question about that.  The Minister is going a long way in the same direction, inserting provisos that the powers be reassessed after four or five years, whatever the prescribed period turns out to be.  I want to keep our discussion in that context: that we are talking about the additional powers being given and perhaps their accompanying safeguards.  But I accept what the Minister says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister mean that the non-destruction of records within the statutory period would form the subject of disciplinary procedures within the Garda Síochána?  Would that be incorporated in the regulations the Minister envisages introducing?  Perhaps the Minister might comment on what Deputy Kelly mentioned earlier, that copy photographs, including negatives &mdash; I think the wording is &ldquo;Every photograph (including a negative)&rdquo;&mdash; would be destroyed also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A photograph is a photograph, a copy of a photograph <Col N="360" /> is still a photograph, and a negative is a negative.  It involves all positives and all negatives being destroyed.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether a breach of this law would constitute a serious disciplinary offence, of course it would. Any garda who breaks the law places himself in a very difficult situation.  We are talking about inserting a statutory provision in this Bill that the records be destroyed after a certain period.  If a garda or gardaí did not comply with that requirement he or they would be placing themselves in a frightfully serious situation. That has been the situation for many years under various Garda Commissioners. No Commissioner has ever stood over gardaí breaking the law.  That is what would be involved here if they kept copies of photographs or anything like that.  However, I do not think it would arise.  I might repeat what I have said. We can overstress it to an extent that the normal reaction of the ordinary garda would be to remain so far on the right side of the line that we could end up with a Garda force which would not be very effective in the fight against crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take Deputy Woods' point that we are here talking about extra powers and, in so far as they are concerned, we need to be satisfied that they will be applied properly and will carry proper safeguards.  So far, the people who have contributed most to this debate are doing a reasonably good job in that respect. What I am endeavouring to get across is that there is another difficulty.  If we keep hitting that note all the time, keep hitting it too hard, we could end up in a situation in which certain members of the Garda Síochána would say to themselves: &ldquo;Play it safe all the time.  If one does anything at all one is putting oneself at risk.  There are those fellows up there in Leinster House who are ready to come after one.&rdquo; That is a real risk.  I have no intention of advising any members of the Garda Síochána to play it up to the margins of the regulations or of the law.  The Garda know quite well that any breach of the law &mdash; for example, a breach of this law &mdash; would be a very serious matter indeed <Col N="361" /> for them and I do not think I need to stress it further.</P>

      <P>In regard to subsection (5) which has to do with the authority given to the District Court to extend for a period not exceeding six months the preservation of a photograph or print, I might ask: six months from when?  Does that mean from the time they were taken or from the time of the court decision? There is some ambiguity there.  My first reading of it is that it means six months from the conclusion of previous proceedings but I am not sure if that is what it means.  In the interest of clarity, and for the benefit of prosecution and defence, the Minister should clarify &ldquo;not exceeding six months&rdquo; and from when.</P>

    <P>That implies that there was already a set <Col N="362" /> of proceedings in respect of the offence. My reading of the draftsman's intention there would be that if the prosecution was brought, let us say in the District Court, and the prosecution concluded perhaps by an acquittal or a <i>nolle prosequi</i> five months after the prints were taken and the Garda decide at that point &mdash; it could be one year later because the proceedings could be pending still &mdash; that the material may be required, as the section states, for the purpose of further proceedings, they could then make the application.  Is it the intent of the subsection that it would be on the conclusion of the first set of proceedings?  Otherwise, the expression &ldquo;further proceedings&rdquo; would be meaningless.</P>

      <P>Would it not be prudent to specify the time limit within which material must be destroyed after the conclusion of the proceedings under subsection 3?  It does not state that the material has to be destroyed within 24 hours, seven days or 14 days.  It could be said that the material will have to be preserved because there may be an application under subsection (5) or because a person would complain that an application under subsection (5) was no longer warranted and that material could not be used because it had not been destroyed, technically speaking.  Under subsection (3) as it stands the very instant the proceedings are concluded there would surely be an obligation to destroy the material in which case an application under subsection (5) would not be possible.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This section relates to applications to persons in custody under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  The section ensures that sections 3 (7), 4, 5 (2) and 5 (3) shall apply with the necessary modifications in relation to persons in custody under section 30 of the Act of 1939 and to the powers conferred by section 7 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, as they apply to persons detained pursuant to section 3.  Section 3 (7) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where it appears to a member of the Garda Síochána that a person arrested <Col N="364" /> in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (2) is in need of medical attention, or where during his detention it comes to notice that he is in need of such attention, and he is taken for that purpose to a hospital or other suitable place, the time before his arrival at the station or the time during which he is absent from the station, as the case may be, shall be excluded in reckoning a period of detention permitted by this section.</P>
    <P>Under this section we are applying the provision I have quoted to the Offences Against the State Act.  In effect it ensures that the period at a hospital, or other suitable place, will not be included in the reckoning of the time.  Therefore, it means that the 24 hours, or the 48 hours, will not include that time.  That explains what the Association of Criminal Law-years had to say about the section.  It was their view that the section applies the extra powers under the Bill to persons in custody under the Offences Against the State Act but the association, although they did not wish to make any submission regarding the section, noted that the section was an explicit admission that the Bill contained wider powers than those contained in the emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3(7) in effect is an increase in the time under the Offences Against the State Act because it excludes the time which is taken for attendance at a hospital. When dealing with section 3 we proposed an amendment which related to section 7.  We proposed:</P>
    <P>provided that such person has not been questioned for the purpose of investigating an offence during that time.</P>
    <P>We found that that would need some modification to ensure that it did not exclude all the time.  I withdrew that amendment and said I would deal with it on Report Stage because the Minister agreed to have a look at the matter to see if our intention would be carried through in an amendment which did not leave the matter open-ended but specified the time when the questioning took place, if it had to take place in a hospital.  The Minister did not visualise that taking place very <Col N="365" /> frequently, if at all, in a hospital, but I understand that it can of necessity take place and can be there for some time. Section 7 then is related to section 3 (7) on which we have had those suggestions. A suitable amendment to that on Report Stage from the Minister, ourselves or somebody else in the House would improve the position.  As the section stands it just extends the time; it would seem to extend the 48 hours or 24 hours, whichever was in question.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is also being applied to the Offences Against the State Act.  Section 4 provides for access to a solicitor and notification of detention.  The notification of detention and information of the right of access to a solicitor would then be carried into the Offences Against the State Act, and that is wholly desirable. We proposed an amendment to section 4 to the effect that where the member in charge of a Garda station has been given the name of a solicitor and fails after reasonable efforts to contact the named solicitor he should give the person detained the opportunity of naming another solicitor and should cause any solicitor so named to be notified accordingly as soon as practicable.  If I remember rightly, the Minister accepted the spirit of that amendment and he is examining that for Report Stage.  That again is a desirable development.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) also is to be applied to the Offences Against the State Act and it states:</P>
    <P>The powers conferred by subsection (1) (c) and (1) (d) shall not be exercised except on the authority of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) (c) refers to photographing and section 5 (1) (d) to taking or causing to be taken fingerprints or palm prints. Section 5 (3) states:</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) (b) does not empower a member of the Garda Síochána to require a person to remove his underclothing, except where such member, with reasonable cause, suspects that he has concealed on his person a controlled drug (within the meaning of <Col N="366" /> section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977) or an explosive substance and a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent so authorises.</P>
    <P>This again would appear to be a very desirable inclusion within the Offences Against the State Act in relation to persons in custody under section 30 of that Act.  Regarding section 5 (2) and 5 (3) we proposed amendments in relation to the removal of personal belongings, to the effect that where anything is removed from the person or possession of a detained person details of anything so removed should be entered in the records in the Garda station by the member in charge.  The Minister said that, generally speaking, he would agree with the inclusion of that in his regulations, therefore that provision would apply to the regulations and the regulations would also apply to the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>With those comments about the sections which are being carried forward we accept this section 7 and will support it.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Woods has pointed out in detail what is contained in section 7.  Section 4, section 5 (2) and section 5 (3) are, in effect, extending safeguards provided to detainees under section 3 of this Bill to people detained under the Offences Against the State Act, so I think they will be generally accepted.  Naturally, when we are talking about section 4, section 5 (2) and section 5 (3), we are talking about those sections as they will be if amended on Report Stage and subsequently enacted.</P>

    <P>Section 3 (7) deals with the nonreckoning of any period of part of the permitted period of detention during which the detained person is absent from the Garda station while receiving medical attention.  This is a cause for concern and has been debated already when we were debating section 3 (7).  It is in the Bill as a result of the experiences under the Offences Against the State Act.  There is a real problem especially related to crime perpetrated by members of subversive <Col N="367" /> organisations.  If people are shot and wounded and taken to hospital it is very difficult to know the exact position at the moment.  It is very difficult to know when the clock begins to run for the detention period.  If somebody is taken to the Mater Hospital, for example, suffering from gunshot wounds and is arrested by the Garda Síochána before being taken to hospital and is under arrest, does the 24-hour period begin to run as soon as that person arrives at the hospital or while he is being conveyed to the hospital? Then does the whole period expire while he is in hospital and will it not be possible for the Garda Síochána to question somebody suffering, for example, from gunshot wounds?  It is the same problem that we have dealt with in detail and I am proposing that we extend section 3 (7) to the Offences Against the State Act also.  Section 4, section 5 (2) and 5 (3) are in effect an extension of the safeguards being provided to detainees under section 3 here to the Offences Against the State Act.</P>

      <P>The extension of the safeguards is welcome so far as they go. However, on section 3 (7) I have doubts about the idea that a person should be detained while in reality not being detained if that person has to be brought to a hospital.  The Minister gave an example of a person who would have been shot in the course, presumably, of some subversive activity and that would seem to be a reasonable point.  However, it appears that the numbers of people detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, the vast majority, 90 per cent or more, are released without charges being preferred.  Very few statistics are available to indicate if any of them have been hospitalised during their period of detention, but it must be assumed that in the vast majority of cases the people detained under section 30 at present are being held for interrogation of some kind or, as appeared to happen at the weekend, a woman in Phoenix Park was detained under section 30 simply to keep her out of circulation.  I am not aware that any charges arose out of <Col N="368" /> that detention.  Therefore, to extend the provisions of section 3 (7) to the Offences Against the State Act is not necessarily a good idea.</P>
      <P>We have the power under section 30 to detain for 48 hours.  On section 3 the Minister argued that the period was six hours plus six hours, that the person would have to be brought to hospital for bandaging or something, and that that could take hours, cutting unnecessarily into the period available for questioning. In section 30 the power is for 24 hours plus a further 24 hours.  The same case does not stand, therefore.  I argued against the case made for section 3 (7) but the case against the Offences Against the State Act is much stronger because of the period of detention permitted in that Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have spent a fair period discussing this.  The main query in regard to this is the extension of the period.  The new section will enable the period to be extended beyond 48 hours.  I was anxious to get the Minister to introduce a proviso that a person should not at any time be detained without being charged for consecutive periods exceeding 48 hours.  The new section goes part of the way only. Subsection (3) (b) states:</P>
      <P>in connection with any other offence of which, at the time of his arrest for the first-mentioned offence, the member of the Garda Síochána by whom he was arrested suspected him or ought reasonably to have suspected him.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) of the new section provides:</P>
      <P>(3) Where a person who has been arrested under section 30 of the Act of 1939 in connection with an offence is released without any charge having been made against him, he shall not be detained pursuant to section 3&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister is trying to avoid multiple arrests.  Therefore, the new section is welcome. Earlier, the new section states that a person may not be arrested for any offence of which, at the time of the first arrest, the member of the Garda Síochána by whom he was arrested suspected him or ought reasonably to have suspected him, and subsection (1) (b) goes on:</P>
      <P>except on the authority of a justice of the District Court who is satisfied on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána since the person's release as to his suspected participation in the offence.  A person arrested under that authority may be detained pursuant to section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is quite clear-cut.  Having done the 48 hours, the person shall not be detained for another 20 hours.  However, if a further <Col N="371" /> offence arises in the course of questioning, it will be possible to continue the detention by applying section 3, making it possible to have detention of 48 hours plus 12 hours.  There can be 48 hours detention following by 12 hours, or <i>vice versa.</i>  I suggested to the Minister earlier that he might introduce an amendment on the lines of amendment No. 14 in my name, whereby no detention would exceed the present upper limit of 48 hours.  In that amendment I attempted to ensure that there would not be a combination exceeding the present maximum. Although I appreciate that the Minister has covered a number of loopholes, we still can have detention of 12 hours, followed by 48 hours, or 20 hours if the detention is during the night, giving a maximum of 68 hours.</P>
    <P>That aspect remains.  The Minister was not anxious to interfere with the separate operation of the Offences Against the State Act.  Consequently that would mean that the overall period could be extended to 68 hours.  I am asking him to consider that position again for the Report Stage because I am confident it was never the intention to extend the 48 hours to 60 hours.  One of the problems that arose was that the first part of the Offences Against the State Act &mdash; that relating the 24 hours or the 48 hours as the case might be &mdash; was being used for trivial offences.  That was useful to the Garda in relation to the investigation of such offences but it is an abuse of the Act in the first instance.  Therefore by providing for the six-hours detention followed by another six but with a maximum of 20 hours, we would be providing for that situation.  It seems then that it should not be necessary to extend the overall period to 60 or to 68 hours.  I welcome the new section.  It represents an honest attempt to meet the questions raised earlier about re-arrest but there is a point of difference between us in relation to that aspect of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The purpose of the amendment is to deal with problems raised on Second Stage.  These problems were in two areas: first, the <Col N="372" /> possibility that the powers of section 3 could be rolled over so that subsequent periods of detention of 12 hours could be used to detain persons for long periods. The second problem was that the combination of the Offences Against the State Act and section 3 of this Bill could be used also to detain persons for extended periods.  The new section 8 rules out the possibility of the roll-over effect of section 3 and, except where new offences come to light it rules out a combination of section 30 and section 3.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (1) (a) provides that a person cannot be arrested again for the same offence.  Therefore, if a person is arrested under section 3 and held for 12 hours or any part thereof he cannot be arrested again for the same offence under the Offences Against the State Act.  That rules out the possibility of 12 hours plus 48 hours being used for detention purposes. Subsection (3) provides that:</P>
      <P>Where a person who has been arrested under section 30 of the Act of 1939 in connection with an offence is released without any charge having been made against him, he shall not be detained pursuant to section 3&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) in connection with the first-mentioned offence, or</P>
      <P>(b) in connection with any other offence of which, at the time of his arrest for the first-mentioned offence, the member of the Garda Síochána by whom he was arrested suspected him or ought reasonably to have suspected him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, a combination of 12 plus 48 is ruled out in subsection (3) (a) while the combination of 48 plus 12 is ruled out in both (a) and (b) except in the very limited area which Deputy Woods has pointed out.  We discussed this previously and I have said I will look at it again between now and Report Stage.  I am not sure if it is possible to overcome the difficulty because there is public interest involved. If something of a serious nature occurs, for example a murder, there is an onus on the Garda to investigate it.  I accept the way Deputy Woods has put the case. We are now at a very confined area of <Col N="373" /> disagreement.  The work we have done in this new section deals with almost all the points raised on Second Stage.  However, I have not yet come up with anything that is near a complete solution to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is intended to be in ease of a person who has been detained.  In so far as there is the intent at least of doing that, it is to be welcomed but I wonder to what extent it goes towards meeting that purpose.  It seems to me that as an example of draftsmanship the section leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
      <P>What puzzles me in respect of subsection (1) is that when a person is detained under section 3 there is no procedure whereby he may know the offence of which he is suspected and consequently detained.  That is something that is in the mind of the arresting garda.  We are not talking of a case where a person is arrested and charged with a specific offence. That would be clear but we are dealing with a situation in which a garda is supposed to have a suspicion that an individual committed a certain offence and consequently detains that person. The detainee is not told what he is suspected of.  Consequently, how is he to know whether, in the event of rearrest, he is being rearrested for the same offence? Perhaps the situation could be dealt with by way of keeping a written record of the suspected offence, whether in the daybook or in the records of the Garda station concerned.  In the event of some such procedure it would appear that the protection which is sought to be given by the section will be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we examine the wording of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) we find that we are into airy-fairy land because the wording is that a person may not be arrested for any other offence of which at the time of the first arrest the member of the Garda by whom he was arrested suspected him or ought reasonably to have suspected him.  Here we are in the realm of trying to determine what was in the mind of the garda at the time, whether he suspected the person of having committed a certain offence.  The imagination baulks at the idea of a court <Col N="374" /> trying to determine whether a garda suspected that a person had committed a certain offence.  The words &ldquo;ought reasonably to have suspected him&rdquo; are even more in the air.  Are we now to call on the courts to determine what a garda ought reasonably to have suspected someone of?  What is a reasonable suspicion? Some people are very suspicious while others are very credulous.  Gardaí, like everyone else have different standards. One disagrees with the likelihood of courts being asked to determine whether on a given set of facts and depending on what a garda saw, he ought reasonably to have suspected a person of having committed a certain offence.  I realise the difficulty in framing the section well and clearly but this wording is marginally better.  Clearly the opinion was that the original section did not quite get it.  I do not think this substitute section quite gets it either.  I suppose the point the section is trying to make is that where the offence is of a particular type within a comparable category and if a person is detained on suspicion of having committed an offence in that category he should not be rearrested for one that is cognate to it.  Perhaps I am wrong but if that is the intention it does not quite come across.  The existing wording of the section will give rise to great difficulty.  If at all possible it should be simplified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with the form which the Minister has chosen and proposes in amendment No. 27 relates also to the practical aspect of the court proceedings in which this part of the subsection might fall to be considered.  I ask the House to consider who would be interested in challenging the arrest envisaged under subsection (1)?  Obviously the person who was arrested.  The person arrested under the subsection for some other offence and anxious to rely on the conditions envisaged in paragraph (b) would be in the absurd position of having to say to the court: &ldquo;The garda suspected me or ought to have because there was item X and Y against me and these items put together made a reasonable case against me&rdquo;.  Unless I have misunderstood the wording of the section this is a <Col N="375" /> fairyland position.  The fact that the Minister brought in an amended section 8 shows that he is striving with might and mane to satisfy all sides.  I pay tribute again to the extraordinary openmindedness, not by any means common in a Minister for Justice, which he is bringing to bear on this.  I invite him and his advisers to put themselves in the position of the person who is arrested and in prison or who is in the course of his trial.  Perhaps at this stage he wants to challenge what has happened to him, and his evidential position is that he must build up a case against himself.  Perhaps the Minister might look at it in the light of that rather unreal hypothesis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We dealt with this in its previous existence as amendment No. 27.  Deputy Taylor is incorrect when he says that a detained person does not know why he is detained. The Garda are obliged under existing law to inform a person of the offence for which he has been arrested and give the reason why he has been arrested.  A detainee will know why he has been arrested. When debating the amendment I said it was a matter for consideration in the context of the regulations whether this would be recorded in the daybook or records in the Garda station.  If there is a need to do that in the statutory regulations, I will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's point about &ldquo;is arrested for any other offence the member of the Garda Síochána by whom he was arrested suspected him&rdquo;, &ldquo;suspected him&rdquo; refers back to what he told him he was suspected of.  That would be a matter of record.  So the Deputy's second objection to the section does not stand.  The more difficult situation is where he ought reasonably to have suspected him.  &ldquo;Reasonably suspected&rdquo; goes back to a concept which has been in the law for a long time &mdash; the idea of arrest on reasonable suspicion.  It is fundamental to the power of arrest which the Garda have.  It is an objective test.  It is not airy fairy.  It is not something that exists in the minds of the garda.  If a person is arrested it is a matter to be <Col N="376" /> determined objectively whether the garda suspected him or ought reasonably to have suspected him.  The garda will have to say on oath what he suspected him of.  If that was not enough he would have to discuss on oath what he ought reasonably to have suspected him of.  The section is an improvement on the existing one.  It tightens it up considerably.  It is a difficult area but it is not drafted in a loose way.  Every word is weighed.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Kelly's point about someone being in a position where he would have to make a case against himself to show that he would have to have been reasonably suspected of an offence, I will look at that.  Section 8 is a statutory instruction to the Garda on how they should exercise the power of arrest for detention and the power of rearrest.  It is a clear instruction to them that they cannot arrest a person for a second period of 12 hours.  If they attempt to arrest someone for the offence they arrested him for originally, they cannot arrest him for a second period.  Neither can they arrest him again if one of the offences in the course of offences for which the facts would supply the basis of a reasonable objective suspicion.</P>
    <P>The question of reasonable suspicion is something with which the courts are familiar.  At an early stage in the debate I read into the record a case in England where a member of the police in London was sued for unlawful arrest.  The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis that the policeman could not objectively have had reasonable suspicion when he was arrested and detained.  There is case law in the neighbouring jurisdiction where a similar power of arrest applies.  The section is a good one and tightens up the powers.  It removes possible anomalies. I will look again at the points raised by Deputies Woods and Kelly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I have succeeded in making my point.  I asked the Minister to consider a situation which I thought of off the top of my head.  Perhaps it is not a very good example.  I could think of better ones.  Suppose somebody is detained pursuant to section 3 because he has been suspected of being in possession <Col N="377" /> of a firearm with intent to endanger life, and suppose he is let go without being charged, for whatever reason, if he is then rearrested for an offence connected with the same set of alleged facts, a person who wishes to challenge the right of the police to rearrest him under section 8 must look at every component of paragraph (b).  In order to challenge his rearrest he will be looking at this concept of what a garda ought reasonably to have suspected him of.  The only way he can challenge this objectively is by saying to a court that the garda ought reasonably to have suspected him of the offence for which he has been rearrested. He could say that the garda might have rearrested him when he was first held under section 3 because of factors X, Y and Z.  By asserting those factors in that context, he is estopping himself from denying those factors at some future date and in a different context.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to make difficulties for the Minister.  I am trying to save this House the reproach of absurdity in passing at the instance of an obviously well intentioned and very anxious Minister something which will not work or which will produce an absurdity.  I think the Minister was quite right in his rejoiner to what Deputy Taylor said.  As Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy said nearly 40 years ago, no one is obliged to submit to an arrest unless he knows why he is being arrested. The mere fact that a man, even though he wears a blue uniform, comes up and makes arresting movements towards you, does not oblige you to submit to an arrest unless you know why it is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding of the way the law has gone &mdash; I hope my very poor memory has not let me down here &mdash; is that unlike many other dimensions of the law bearing on personal liberty, this particular aspect of the law of arrest has not become liberalised in recent years, but has become somewhat qualified.  A recent Supreme Court decision said it is sufficient, if the circumstances are such that the Garda are entitled to assume that the arrested person knows why he is being arrested, and if they at least do not mislead him.  I do not quarrel with what the Supreme Court said; I do not think it is unreasonable <Col N="378" /> but I think it is a retreat, perhaps not a very significant one, from what used to be the law, that somebody has to be told why he is being arrested.  I put that in as a footnote to contribute my pennyworth of what I hope is the correct understanding of the law.  Subject to that pennyworth of information the Minister is right in saying that a person has to be told why he is being arrested.</P>
    <P>In the special context of the Offences Against the State Act, the courts have repeatedly held it is enough if the Garda tell a man they are arresting him under section 30 of the 1939 Act.  As a general proposition, at the very least the arrested person must be given an indication &mdash; perferably a clear indication &mdash; why he is being arrested so that he can decide whether to resist or acquiesce to the arrest.  The Minister is right to point that out because I do not think this section makes any inroads into that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the contributions of the Minister and Deputy Kelly, I cannot say I am 100 per cent satisfied on that point, it cannot be said that existing decisions and precedents dealing with arrest would apply in this new situation.  The existing position on arrest is that a person is arrested to be charged with an offence, and under the existing law he is entitled to know why he is being arrested.  This is an entirely new situation involving a detention on suspicion, not for the purpose of being charged.  I do not think it necessarily follows that the precedents which applied in a completely different situation of arrest for charge purposes necessarily apply under section 3, which is an entirely new concept and it may be held that they do not.  Just as the situation has evolved where persons are told they are being arrested under section 30, we may find ourselves in a situation where persons are told they are being arrested under section 3 of the Criminal Justice Bill.  If that is all they are told, that will not meet the point I am making.  They will not know that they are being detained on suspicion of having committed a particular offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comment made by the Minister is helpful.  He indicated that he would make <Col N="379" /> arrangements in the regulations &mdash; and that is to be welcomed &mdash; that it would be recorded in the station records when the person is brought in, for the commission of which offence or offences he is suspected, and for which he has been detained under section 3 of this legislation. If that is done that will meet my concern.</P>
    <P>I found it hard to follow the Minister's reading of section 8 (1) and Deputy Kelly explained the point very well.  One could visualise a situation developing in this way.  If a person is detained on suspicion of larceny, inquiries are made and he is let go; if he is then rearrested on suspicion of receiving, possibly in respect of the same goods, he or his advisers could issue an application to the High Court for <i>habeas corpus</i> challenging the legality of his detention and making the point that when he was arrested on suspicion of larceny the Garda should have suspected him of receiving, for which he has now been arrested.  There would be a High Court determination on the issue: did the garda suspect him at the time of the first arrest of receiving or should he reasonably have suspected him at that time of receiving?</P>
    <P>I agree strongly with Deputy Kelly and I am concerned that potentially ridiculous situations could arise under which a person would be saying to the court that the garda ought to have suspected him of having committed a particular offence. That is a position which the courts would find untenable.  This matter has to be re-examined because the courts could be inundated with <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings if persons were rearrested.  In my view this section, even in its new form, does not give the protection which is reasonably required.</P>
