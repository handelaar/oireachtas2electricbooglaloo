      <P>Is the Minister aware that the register as compiled in the European countries to which he has referred is drawn up on a different basis from what happens here, namely, it would include people who have not been in employment and that therefore we are not comparing like with like even in terms of the tabular statement?  If our register were to indicate the true position regarding young people without work, as happens throughout Europe, it would show a very much bigger gap than that indicated by the tabular statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> It is fair to say that there are different legislative and administrative practices in other member states and that this can have the effect of changing figures.  In Greece, for instance, an unemployed person who is under 25 but who comes from a farm, for example, would not be included on the register.  The figures are related only to industrial unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking in respect of the countries for which the Minister has figures available if he is not aware that the register will disclose people as unemployed who would not be registered here because of their having not come into employment yet?  I am talking of the countless thousands of young people who are waiting for jobs or who are undergoing training courses.  In this situation <Col N="2358" /> would the Minister not agree that the gap between the level of unemployment here <i>vis-à-vis</i> the situation in Europe is very much wider than would appear from the figures given?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are being made by the health boards to implement the provisions of the Health Services (No. 3) Regulations, 1983.  This involves writing to all medical card holders in the 16 to 25 years age group informing them of the provisions of these regulations.</P>
      <P>An opportunity is being given to claim exemption where the regulations do not apply.  Until such time as those arrangements are implemented in each area, students from that area are not being removed from the general medical services register by virtue of the regulations.</P>
      <P>The information which the Deputies are seeking would tend to vary from day to day as health boards proceed with the task of implementing the regulations. The total number of students removed from the GMS register in any area at any time is not available routinely in my Department.  I suggest that the Deputies get in touch with the appropriate health boards in order to get the most up-to-date statistical information that is available on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the serious problems created by the removal of medical cards from those between the ages of 16 and 25 and in view of the fact that a number of students are now in prison, would the Minister consider suspending <Col N="2360" /> the regulations and reconsidering the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I am not in a position to accede to that request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the students are very concerned about the hardship this change would create and in these circumstances would he not reconsider the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that generally there is hardship being created. On average, students use the general medical service for the purpose of visiting GPs about twice a year and for two to three prescriptions per year.  That level of usage has been long-established. The only thing that is being withdrawn by way of automatic entitlement without charge is access to a GP or to drugs.  For the umpteenth time I would stress that hospital services, inpatient and out-patient, and consultant services are not being withdrawn under the regulations. I repeat again that any student who informs a health board that he or she is suffering a degree of hardship will not have the medical card withdrawn.  That is the position.  Automatic entitlement is being withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the students have been making so light a demand on the health services, will the Minister not accept that it was not worth his while establishing a whole administrative process to assess their eligibility for a medical card?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The administrative process is not complex.  Yesterday I was in the headquarters of the North Western Health Board &mdash; Deputy Gallagher's area.  By means of a simple computer print-out and the automatic issuing of forms the whole business is done in a matter of a day.  I will point out to Deputy Gallagher who has put down a question on the matter that to date no medical card has been withdrawn.  Further, I would point out to him that since 62 per cent of the population of his county have medical cards, by and large 62 per cent of students will retain the cards.</P>

      <P>Before we move to the next question I should like to ask the Minister another question with regard to students.  In deciding to withdraw medical cards from students, did he take into account the dramatic increase in fees for third level education that was introduced by his colleague?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out to the Deputy, and I take no great pleasure in it, that there is major State subsidisation for students in second and third level education.  There will be a saving to the health services of approximately £2,500,000 per annum by no longer giving automatic entitlement to second and third level students irrespective of income.  Approximately 120,000 students are involved.  However, more than 40,000 students, by virtue of the fact that their parents' incomes are below the limits of income eligibility for medical cards, will automatically retain their entitlement.  I find it incredible that Deputies on the opposite side should suggest that people in the upper income group who are quite wealthy and whose children are in third level education should automatically be given entitlement to free access to GPs and to drugs.  The cost on average is about £30 per year: two consultaions to a GP and about two attendances to a pharmacist to get drugs.  The total cost on average is between £25 and £30 and for 80,000 people we will save approximately £2,500,000 in a full year.  Despite all the <Col N="2363" /> special pleading by the Opposition with regard to this matter, I reiterate that this measure was included in the Government memorandum of June 1982 and was approved by the then Government for implementation.  However, Deputy Woods and Deputy Haughey ran away from it.</P>

In relation to covering their dependants for VHI, there is full income tax relief at the top tax rate and in relation to the attendance of their children in second and third level institutions there is a substantial tax allowance available.  My son who is in third level education has lost his medical card and this should apply also to students whose family are in the upper income group.</P>

      <P>The present economic situation has made it necessary to examine critically the costs of providing <Col N="2366" /> our health services.  In the light of this economic climate the granting of medical cards to students and other young dependant adults without reference to their parents' financial circumstances was considered to be unjustified.  Such persons whose parents have medical card eligibility will retain their medical cards.</P>
      <P>The medical needs of those from whom medical cards were withdrawn was taken into consideration and special provision was incorporated in the regulations whereby the service would still be provided free of charge if the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board considered that its withdrawal would cause undue hardship.  In addition, it was provided that persons from whom medical cards were withdrawn under the regulations would retain their entitlement to free hospital services, both inpatient and outpatient including free consultant services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is far more serious when politicians indulge in special pleading, for example, when they visit young people in prison and indulge in special pleading on their behalf.  The reason young people are alienated and disappointed in politicians is that they are not told the truth about the realities of the situation by all politicians.  The choices facing me were that I could impose charges on out-patients; I could insist on everybody, including students, paying for full consultant services, irrespective of their incomes; I could have proposed charging students availing of public wards or, I could have allowed them retain their medical cards and impose a charge on every prescription.  I did not do any of those things.  Instead I decided to introduce a measure which would not cause hardship for students.  A sum of £2.5 million has been saved and I deliberately transferred £500,000 of that money to the elderly, giving for the first time in the history of the State, additional income eligibility for people over the age of 65 and 80 years of age, people who are in far greater need&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Would the Minister say whether he has considered the facts, that young students are indifferent about their health, because of their immature age, that they tend to regard themselves as normally healthy?

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>The general medical services scheme is funded largely by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.  The expenses of the board are provided for in subhead G.3. of the Health Estimate.  The provision for such expenses in 1984 has been reduced to the extent of the estimated savings arising from the decision to withdraw medical cards from persons between the ages of 16 and 25 years who are dependants of persons who do not qualify for medical cards.</P>
      <P>The overall savings resulting from implementation of this decision are estimated at £2 million for 1984 and £25 million in a full year of which about £170,000 might be associated with the North-Western Health Board area.  As mentioned, however, the benefit has been reflected in the provision under subhead G.3. of the Health Estimate. Finally, I might make the point that the provision for the GMS in 1984 is £85.25 million and the provision, reflecting savings estimated at £2 million this year and £2.5 million in a full year, is included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The information which the Deputy is seeking will tend to vary from day to day as the health board removes some persons from the general medical services register and adds on others.  The total number of persons removed from the general medical services register in any area at any point in time is not routinely available in my Department.  I suggest, therefore, that the Deputy might get in touch with the Midland Health Board in order to get the most up-to-date statistical information available on this matter.</P>

      <P>When a question is put down demanding a simple answer it <Col N="2372" /> is not good enough to be told by the Minister that he cannot obtain the information, that I should go to the Midland Health Board.  I understood that the machinery of putting down questions to a particular Minister was to extract a specific answer.  I do not accept that a Minister can say to me he cannot readily get it or that I should go to the Midland Health Board and get it.  I am entitled to receive it here in this House.</P>

      <P>In no way do I not want to provide information to the House on any matter.  But the latest information I have relates to the year 1983 which ended only six weeks ago.  For the information of the Deputy, there were 1,488 medical cards covering 2,583 persons cancelled last year in County Westmeath. In the same year there were 1,997 new cards issued covering 3,397 persons, a net increase at the end of the year of 814 persons.  I might stress that, in the first year of my term in office, there was a substantial increase in the cover given to the population, which increased from 38 per cent to approximately 39.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question I asked.  Quite naturally the increase is reflected right across the country, not alone in the Midland Health Board because, sadly, the growing number of unemployed and people who must have recourse to medical cards, whose disposable income has dropped enormously has increased.  The question I asked and to which the Minister, under pressure, gave a reply related to the number of medical cards withdrawn from applicants in the Midland Health Board which he said was 1,488 affecting 2,500 people.  Arising out of an earlier reply of the Minister I might put it to him that surely he, as Minister for Health &mdash; as all Ministers for Health &mdash; should be advocating preventive medicine and not advocating, as he is, to students to go to hospitals, to casualty officers and partake of the hospital services when preventive medicine with one's local friendly general practitioner is by far the best type of medicine particularly for young people who would seek to establish a rapport with their doctor?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas I support the continuation of the general medical services scheme it is not necessarily proving to be the best in terms of preventive and community care.  For example, for every £1 of a visit which a person makes to a GP at present approximately £3 of drugs is issued, that is for 40 per cent of the population.  For the other 60 per cent the ratio is about one-third of that. Therefore, there is something very wrong in terms of our expenditure in that area when we are spending £85 million a year, £50 million of which is on drugs.  Quite frankly, I have the gravest reservation about the extent to which that has an impact on preventive and community care.  I should like a different system to be agreed between myself and the medical profession of real preventive and real community care, not based on a fee per item of service, that every time one walks into a doctor £X is paid and there is then the incentive to issue a prescription for more drugs to be consumed, for example, giving £10 million to pharmacists, £40 million to drug companies and approximately £20 million to doctors for doing what I regard as not necessary in the interests of the best preventive care or health system.</P>

      <P>I agree completely but I fail to see a differentiation of 5:1 whereby people who are holders of medical cards, 40 per cent of the population, have an incidence of visitation five times greater than the rest of the population and an incidence of consumption of drugs four or five times greater as well.  There are some very serious questions to be posed about that &mdash; whether the system as it operates is an incentive, not for <Col N="2374" /> health care but for visitation, for the issuing of prescriptions and for drugs consumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The average cost in 1983 of health services provided for a person aged between 16 and 25 years by virtue of his being eligible for a medical card is estimated to be roughly of the order of £27.  The corresponding estimate for an old age pensioner is £110.  For a person who is not in either of those categories, the average cost is estimated at £60.  These estimates are tentative.  They are based partly on information relating to years prior to 1983.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of this, does the Minister not consider that the savings which he is alleged to be making are very tiny compared with the overall cost of the medical services?  In effect, he is simply transferring the cost of treating students to the hospital services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Deputy's argument about the size of savings is advanced in relation to all efforts to resolve any question of savings in relation to any services &mdash; Departments of Health, Education or Social Service. That argument does not hold up.  On the second part of the Deputy's argument, since students avail of GP services only a couple of times a year, they are not likely to require, by and large, hospitalisation. There is no evidence that those who do not require GP services automatically arrive at the door of a hospital, demanding praticular services.  The co-relation is not there and that argument will not stand up on examination in the months ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The co-relation is between people having medical cards and attending in the surgeries of general practitioners. The number of those who are subsequently referred to hospitals is rather interesting.  The vast bulk of students who attend doctors, from the information available to us, attend about twice a year.  The degree of hospitalisation is minimal, as one would expect for 16 to 25 year olds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an argument. It relates to the prospect of hardship involved.  Forty per cent have total exemption from any cost in relation to their children at second and third level institutions and for the remaining 60 per cent the average cost would be about £15 or £16 per annum for attending a GP and perhaps another £10 for drugs &mdash; about £25 a year.

      <P>The Minister stated that there was no evidence that persons who did not have medical cards would use the casualty services.  Would he not accept that students are a special case, particularly <Col N="2377" /> students living away from home? He gave the example of his own family who are living at home, so he may not be aware of the problems created for students living in flats, say in this city who find themselves ill and without the money to go to a family doctor.  Surely, the Minister will accept that they will go to hospital outpatient departments as an alternative and that this will prove very costly? A number of times this afternoon the Minister has stated that we are talking about two visits to the GP per year. Surely he will accept that an average of two visits per year does not mean that parents will be faced with only the cost of two visits.  It means that many parents will be charged for ten or 12 visits and others will have no charges.  Indeed, on the question of hardship, will the Minister not accept that in many cases &mdash; and particularly in regard to those living away from home &mdash; the hardship arises only when they become ill and the CEO is not in a position to anticipate the students who will suffer hardship?</P>

In view of the figures of £27, £110 and £60 with respect to general medical services for those from 16 to 25 years of age and old age pensioners and those in between, could the Minister explain the reasons for the difference in the costs?

I stress that an unemployed young person who applies for unemployment assistance has an assessment of his board and lodgings taken into account and a value put on these by the social welfare officer who is investigating the case.

Could the Minister give an estimate of what the cost would be in view of the fact that it costs £50,000 to send out a single letter notifying students that their cards are being withdrawn?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cost involved is a very tentative estimate spread over all the health boards.  In some health board areas, however, the register is fully computerised, it is merely a question of a print-out and postage.  In that case the cost would be minimal and most of our health boards are highly efficient in that regard.</P>

The degree of hypothetical complication introduced by Deputies is extraordinary and intriguing.  If a student says he has no income and the health board are satisfied that that is so he will get a medical card provided he furnishes proof as to his lack of income.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my pleasure to welcome this Bill which extends the duration of the State guarantee for borrowings by An Bord Bainne for a further six years to December 1989.  This Bill will give a much needed boost to the dairy industry which is experiencing major problems, many of which are not of our making but have been imposed because of the policies pursued by various Governments in the EEC.</P>
      <P>The problems relating to our dairy industry are twofold.  Some have developed as a result of ever-rising inflation during the past five years which has increased substantially the cost of inputs. In addition there are massive problems with regard to disease control and substantial losses have been faced by many farmers who have been badly affected by outbreaks of disease in their herds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as these internal problems there is also the difficult problem regarding the proposed super-levy.  I compliment the Minister on the tremendous efforts he has made to fight the farmers' case in Brussels.  It is vitally important to get a derogation from the super-levy. Unlike other economies in the EEC, <Col N="2463" /> agriculture is the motor of the Irish economy.  It is around agriculture that the whole economy revolves and if agriculture is not thriving our economy will stagnate.  It is extremely important that the Minister should continue to pursue the line he has taken and resist any attempt to impose this super-levy.  We have a greater percentage of dairy exports than any other EEC country.  We depend more on agriculture and dairying than any of our EEC partners.  We have not caused this glut which is flooding the European market with milk and butter. These problems are caused because of factory farming carried on by some of our EEC partners.  The sooner the better our partners face up to that fact and realise that we are not causing the problems and should not, therefore, be expected to contribute to solving it.  Our total exports are a very small percentage of overall EEC production and the implications of the super-levy would be devastating, not alone for the farming community but for the whole economy and for employment.</P>
    <P>Much of the raw material for our beef industry stems from the dairy industry.  If the dairy industry is not thriving we will not have sufficient raw material for the beef industry.</P>
    <P>The way our partners have treated us <i>vis-à-vis</i> the super-levy is very unfair.  It is in breach of the principle of the Treaty of Rome whereby the weaker partners should be helped in the developing of a united approach throughout the whole of Europe.  We are all behind the Minister in his efforts to defend this country from the effects of this levy.  We cannot look on this levy in isolation but must also examine other aspects of agricultural production which are under attack from the EEC Commission.  I speak of decisions taken recently regarding intervention payments and subsidies which we enjoy on exports to Third World countries.</P>
    <P>We are getting a very raw deal from the EEC.  They should recognise the vital importance of agriculture to our economy and to the livelihood of a large section of our people.  We depend basically on our exports, whether dairying or beef, because such a large percentage <Col N="2464" /> of our output is exported.  I deplore the response we are getting from the EEC.  When one looks at this Bill and talks about the dairying industry one cannot but wonder why, at a time when we are finding it exceptionally difficult to get rid of our butter mountain, our industry does not diversify into other areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the money invested by An Bord Bainne in research and examination of other products which can be manufactured. A far greater proportion of our milk production should be diversified into cheese, milk powder, chocolate crumb &mdash; for which there seems to be a market &mdash; cream casein &mdash; for which there is an excellent market in the USA &mdash; yogurts and liqueurs.  It is important to examine what can be done in those areas.  Milk is being manufactured into butter and this causes two problems, a butter mountain and a skimmed milk powder mountain.  If we do not diversify I do not see any hope of reducing those mountains.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision taken recently in regard to the reintroduction of the farm modernisation scheme.  I would like to compliment the Minister for reintroducing this.  It is important to encourage the removal of cattle from land and their housing during the winter.  They do untold damage on the vast majority of our farms.  I also welcome the decision by the Government to appoint four Ministers of State with direct responsibility in the food processing area.  This is one area where we can create a large number of new jobs.  I believe we should be processing a far greater percentage of our food, whether dairy produce or beef. It is in the national interest that we do this and try to create the maximum number of jobs for our young people in downstream industries.  I appeal to the Minister to reduce the amount of imports from third countries.  I am very disappointed that while on the one hand, our producers will be penalised if the Commission get their way with the super-levy, on the other hand, we are importing dairy produce from third countries.  This is very unfair and it is difficult to understand why those imports can be the cause of our farmers being penalised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2465" /> The MCAs are creating major problems for our farmers.  The Minister should do everything possible to alleviate the major problems which those subsidies are creating for our producers.  It is in the interest of everybody that everything possible be done to stimulate agricultural production.  We are having a very difficult time in relation to the discussions which are taking place in the EEC and the threat this could be for many of our farmers. I am sure the Minister will do everything possible to protect our vital national interest.  I compliment him on the stand he has taken so far.  It is vital that we get a derogation from this levy.  I welcome the Bill and I consider it appropriate that it be introduced at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill.  I want to pay a tribute to the great success of Bord Bainne.  This organisation was founded as a semi-State body before our entry into the EEC and has sold the name of Ireland right around the globe very successfully.  If the present trend continues Bord Bainne will become an intervention agency.  We have lost some of our largest markets.  I refer specifically to the Mexican market which we have been priced out of.  It is very bad to lose that market and other markets at this time because of the oversupply of dairy products.  Those problems have been caused by the expansion of agricultural production in the USA, possibly under the Carter policy, and in a more recent change in policy by President Reagan the world market is now flooded.</P>
      <P>The Minister should communicate with Bord Bainne on a very regular basis and he should get the Government to make money available to Bord Bainne to enable them to retain the markets they have. They should be given money for promotion and possibly transport subsidies which are not in breach of any of the EEC regulations.  If we are not able to compete in relation to intervention, the countries which will get in now will be there for the brighter days.  They will retain those markets and will reap the benefits of the substantial increase in prices which will come in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been very successful with the <Col N="2466" />&ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; brand but we have got ourselves into deep water in the UK market. We have practically lost all that market. We are a disadvantaged nation as far as our EEC membership goes in relation to exports.  We must look at a more co-ordinated approach in our marketing. Córas Tráchtála on the industrial side have done an excellent job.  We have the PBC for which support was expressed here last week and we have An Bord Bainne.  There may be other bodies also but we must co-ordinate those three.  We as a small exporting nation cannot afford to be fragmented.  The three bodies frequently have gone in separate directions and that has not happened without notice in the various trade fairs around the world.  That is not good.  We should be able to harness the three together and then we will be able to make a major success of our agricultural exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That must be our way forward.  In recent years we have come into a strong position with five or six large co-operatives who have their own brand image, but it should be possible for an organisation such as An Bord Bainne to permit more extensive use of that brand image if advantage is to be gained thereby.  In centralised markets incentive very often can be killed because all are equal and lack of competition can kill our marketing in terms of quality and of sales. Bord Bainne have protected their &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; franchise.  They should have broadened it and allowed some if not all of our major co-operatives to sell &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; on their own.  Any of them might have a vital market which could have been doubled in the last ten or 20 years before An Bord Bainne were founded, and we are aware that that board have not total co-operation from the dairy industry.  The will is there to give them support and the outlook must not be narrowed. I appeal to the Minister, the Government and the people for a more co-ordinated marketing approach.  We should be able to incorporate all the brands.  France, a very big agricultural <Col N="2467" /> country, has a number of brand images and is not confined to one or two.  There are many which anyone going to the Continent will notice and I am sure the Minister has seen them on his table in the morning in Brussels.</P>
      <P>We must look at the super-levy.  The Government have failed to alert all other European countries to the grave and serious implications that this levy will have for this country.  The Taoiseach has visited many European capitals but he was late in the day.  He should have made those visits and alerted the people of this nation to those implications early when the super-levy was first announced.  We have seen the milk-and-water approach of the Ministers to defending our farming and our dairy farmers.  The first effort to educate the EEC Commission was the intervention adjustment by our Government which meant a substantial loss to our dairy farmers and to our economy. After that came the EEC decision to add another 30 days to that.  We are entitled to a special deal inside Europe.  We are one of the most disadvantaged members of the EEC.  If we produce a pound of cheese, beef or anything else it takes an extra 1p to get that on to the British market and another 1p again to take it to a continental market.  That is our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the mainland countries of Europe and our small volume of production. We must have a major case in Europe.</P>
      <P>We are strategically well positioned. We must admit that the influence the US has on the market in Europe has given New Zealand its advantage because the US are prepared to defend New Zealand and give them a concession as a friendly nation.  We should use our bargaining power in that area to get what is best for our people, especially for our farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech last week said that milk would be in deficit in 1988-89 and we would have the right to apply for an increase in quota.  If there is an increase to be adopted in the quota we should have a right to a higher percentage increase in that quota than any other nation and any new agreements being drafted must have that written into them. <Col N="2468" /> We have accepted that 1983 will be the base year.  We should not have shifted on that.  We should have retained the argument that 1981 would be our base year for the super-levy and that it would be open-ended until 1993.  That would have taken care of what I have spoken about and we would have no problem.  As I have said, we are a totally disadvantaged area in every way.  No part of this country has the advantages which Brittany, Normandy, the Dutch in spite of their factory farming, the Danes or the Germans possess. We have not argued our point or made our case strongly enough in Europe.  Up to now we have lost approximately £100 million because the Government have not the commitment to put in that £1 to get back the remaining £s to support us.  While the Government lack that commitment our agriculture can go in only one direction, continue to contract rapidly.  The farm modernisation scheme, which is relevant to any dairy expansion, has suffered interference, and that has eroded the confidence of our agricultural community.  Farmers had plans and they assessed that they would be entitled to £5,000, £6,000 or £7,000 grants.  What happened?  Overnight the stroke of a pen of the most uncaring Government ever in office eroded that.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the four Ministers of State dealing with food.  How in the name of God can they be serious when a promise was made on the floor of this House that £1 million would be made available to set up co-operative type producer groups, and then we got a paltry £100,000 in the budget?</P>

      <P>That was the commitment. That is what we got.  A great deal of blame has been laid on cereal substitutes coming into the EEC from Thailand and, more recently, China.  The one most frequently referred to is manioc, or tapioca as it is better known.  We should seek a concession for new articles of association similar to those drawn up in Europe in 1958 when the coal and steel agreements were being drawn up.  At that <Col N="2469" /> time manioc was unheard of as also was maize gluten which was a substitute for or a by-product of maize.  Those are the commodities that are harming us now and it would be in our interest if an embargo or a very high levy were placed on them coming into the EEC.  We should seek this embargo and we should look for new terms and agreements to be drafted to take care of this situation.  These commodities are produced cheaply outside the EEC and it suits the Dutch, the Germans and the French in the north of their country to have those substitutes as cheap feed.  That is to our disadvantage because we as a peripheral nation in Europe are totally disadvantaged and often we are left with the rubbish, the residue in the boats which transport these commodities. How often have we seen that in the loads dumped in the yards of our provender mills?  Therefore, I appeal for new articles of association and that our case be made in Europe regarding this.</P>
      <P>I tell the four Ministers of State to whom I have referred that they must start with the right approach to getting concessions for us and then our agriculture will develop.  Lack of commitment is our problem.  In this Government we need someone like Deputy Cluskey who, when he was not getting his own way, was honourable enough to resign.  That is what the farming community are looking for because they are totally disillusioned. We have seen levy piled on levy.  The provisions in this budget for 1984 will cost the dairy industry and our food industry a figure which I will round off at £10 million.  They are the losses I am concerned about.  Many of our dairy co-ops and those involved in the food sector are financed in this manner.  I have no doubt that somebody involved in the production of the Telesis report was able to convince the civil servants in the Department of Finance that this should not continue. While we have a Minister for Finance who is more a civil servant than a representative of the people we will have more of this piled upon us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are serious about developing our food industry we cannot ask people to operate with expensive finance.  The <Col N="2470" /> problem is that the Government do not have a policy on food production and the Left in the Government do not know what the Right are doing.  The Government do not have any commitment.  I have no doubt that when the demand is put to a Minister like Deputy Barry Desmond to cut the Health Estimate by £2 million he passes on that demand to Agriculture.  Agriculture is on its knees in this recession.  I appeal to the Government to have another look at section 84 and make an effort to develop the industry.</P>
    <P>There has been talk of a levy to develop Bord Bainne and I should like to know who will be expected to pay that levy.  I have no doubt that the Government will ask the farming community to pay it.  Last week the Minister referred to a report in a newspaper to the effect that 10p per gallon would be dropped off milk because of intervention regulations in regard to acid test, moisture content and low fat levels.  We have been told that there is a reluctance by intervention agencies to purchase milk and that will hurt our economy.  Our problem is that the Government are not prepared to fight our case in Europe.</P>
    <P>There is practically no butter surplus. In regard to this we should be leading the way and making butter available at a cheap price to old age pensioners and social welfare recipients.  That would amount to a commitment by the Government that they are determined to remove the surplus in Europe.  In the Community about eight million people are employed in agriculture directly while in Ireland the figure is in the region of 231,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what has happened to the school milk scheme.  Consumption has dropped from 45 per cent to 27 per cent but the Government are not doing anything about that.  The Government should make a decision to provide fridges in all schools.  That would not be expensive.  The quality of the milk delivered to schools is often questionable and we should look at the quality of bottled milk and insist on high quality.  The Department should initiate a research programme to discover the flavours children would like in their milk.  That would <Col N="2471" /> help solve our dairy surplus and it would not cost the Exchequer a lot of money.</P>
    <P>We have the cheapest method in Europe to produce milk although climatic conditions can often present difficulties. There are 70,000 full-time dairy farmers here and our average herd number is 22 cows giving an average yield of 700 gallons.  The average yield in the Community is about 950 gallons.  If present trends continue I have no doubt that 20,000 farmers will be forced off the land thereby creating greater social problems in urban areas.  That will happen if the Government do not change their attitude to agriculture.  They do not have the will to defend that industry and the dairy industry is under attack from them.  Massive unemployment will occur unless the Government change their tactics.  We must remember that agriculture is not fully developed.  Where will the 20,000 farmers move to?  I have no doubt that there will be more pressure on housing and schools in urban areas.  The Government should produce a policy for agriculture similar to that operated under Fianna Fáil.  They should not run away from agriculture.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not bother about the resource tax or the 2 per cent levy.  He will get his own resource tax and levy when he returns to Meath.  All newspapers have criticised the Government over their attitudes to agriculture.  The monthly bulletin produced by the ICOS and the <i>Farmers Journal</i>, the Government's own paper, have been critical of the attitude of the Government in recent weeks.  They have highlighted the likely losses farmers will suffer.  The Minister should do something positive for the industry and not adopt a shortsighted approach because the economy is in recession.  There will be brighter days again.  The Boston report on the dairy industry compiled by Bord Bainne was issued recently.  As a native of one of the most influential dairy towns in the country that has a great history of <Col N="2472" /> cheese-making, I am anxious to know why Bord Bainne compiled such a report. In my view they did so because of the pressure on the cheese-making business. We must have some protection in regard to that section of the industry.  If we do not fight our case in Europe we will not have any cheese-manufacturing unit here.  That is a warning I hope the Minister will heed.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of talk about diversification. Diversification is not of much use to us because we do not have the population to sell to.  We have been involved in skim milk powder, whole milk powder and butter and skim.  The Minister should return to Brussels with a heavy hand and make demands of the Commission.  If he has the support of the Government he should use it in his negotiations for the benefit of the country.  We have been let down on too many occasions.  I believe that as far as agriculture is concerned we are the most disadvantaged state in the Community.  I understand the position of the Fine Gael Members because the social side of that party does not have any time for or commitment to agriculture.  I advise the three Ministers responsible for agriculture to adopt the Deputy Cluskey attitude.  If they threaten to do as he did the Government will realise how serious the problem is.</P>
      <P>I wish Bord Bainne well and I accept that they have a difficult task ahead.  They should try to retain their markets so that we do not become an intervention agency.  Existing markets are vital for the farming community and the economy in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the House will by now be very familiar with the purpose of this Bill and I am sure that like me, they will fully support its objectives.  The Minister has fully explained the necessity for a State guarantee for Bord Bainne's borrowings for a further six years.  During this period, it is hoped that the board will further increase their own resources, thereby becoming less reliant on State backing for a proportion of their borrowings.  In the meantime, however, I think it important <Col N="2473" /> that Deputies on all sides of the House should recognise that quite apart from the tangible support which the provision of a State guarantee affords Bord Bainne, it is vital at this present time that the symbolic value of the guarantee be fully appreciated.</P>
      <P>No Member of this House needs to be told by me of the central importance of the dairy industry to the whole agricultural industry in Ireland.  Over the past six months or so since the EEC Commission published their proposals for reforming the CAP, with particular emphasis on the milk sector, we have all been made to realise the importance of dairying in the context of the overall economic and social development of this country.  I am not talking simply of an industry which would maintain its present position. Rather, I am referring to a progressive and imaginative industry which, given the opportunity, would expand further and I know that Irish dairying has the potential to fulfil this role.  I am confident that the Government's negotiating efforts in Brussels will secure a climate in which continued, profitable expansion of milk output will be possible, but increased output, vital though it is, is still only half the story.  For the industry as a whole to prosper, we must maximise efficiency in processing and marketing.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to all this diversification we have heard so much about in this debate and in others in the House. It has become a cliché in the mouths of many people.  I will bring a number of things to the notice of the House.  First, I suggest that research and development are very important in every walk of life and in most industrial projects.  Some of this has been done here with very good results, which I will refer to later, but it is a huge area in which our dairy co-ops and An Bord Bainne for many years seem to have been fighting shy of getting deeply involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there are good reasons for this and I will outline them in a few moments.  At the same time, any businessman with an eye to future markets must see that unless a great deal of time, thought and effort are put into products many years before they are expected to <Col N="2474" /> hit the shelves in the shops or the tables of the consumers, time will overtake such products and somebody somewhere else, with a more modern approach earlier, somebody who has back-up facilities in research and development, will push us out of particular markets.  I am informed reliably that it can take as long as five to ten years from the inception of an idea on diversification of milk into other products before these products will appear on supermarket shelves and try for themselves the rigours of competition. By any standard that is a long time.</P>
    <P>First of all, such new products will have competition on the home market, a small market, according to Deputy O'Keeffe, of three million consumers, not enough by any standards to ensure the success of a new product.  Such new products would have competition on our shelves here from foreign producers because of free trade.  We are confined to the small consumer base.</P>
    <P>Another militating factor that has created a problem for us here is that our taste changes very slowly.  People in chemistry will tell you that it takes a long time before we accept what would have been accepted in Europe long before.  An example is yogurt.  It came on the market but many people here at first said they did not particularly like it.  We here do not seem to have an aptitude to change our tastes quickly.  I think we are overcoming that now.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem of all about the introduction of any new product in Ireland is the long time that intervenes from the inception of the idea and its introduction to the market as a competing product.  Any Irish concern in the dairy processing industry must have great foresight to be able to say that any product, irrespective of how good it is, would have a future by the time it would reach the market or that a market would be there for it.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic about this.  We have known for many years in this House and in the creamery industry that we would need diversification.  Deputy O'Keeffe a few months ago &mdash; because he is an Opposition spokesman he apparently has the answer to everything &mdash;<Col N="2475" /> made a number of points, some of which I agree with and could see some sense in, but it is true that because the total amount of milk one could expect to put into a diversification programme in the years to come compared with out total production would be so small, diversification would not make an impact, if we take what has happened in the last ten years.  Deputy O'Keeffe forgets that all the other avenues have been choked because of intervention.  There is a jam in Europe.</P>

      <P>I like the sound of the Deputy's name.  As regards the diversification programme I have seen important developments take place.  The Tipperary Co-operative in conjunction with a German interest have gone into the cheese manufacturing area.  This type of venture involving an Irish co-operative with its shareholders and board of directors doing business with a German interest is to be recommended.  In the heel of the hunt we would like to pilot our own aircraft all over the world but we might be better off to use an international vehicle to carry our products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to give a lot more thought to this kind of a link-up as we will be going into markets which are many times bigger than our own.  On one occasion I had the good fortune to <Col N="2480" /> be in County Cavan and saw Virginia Milk Products Limited.  They are a shining example of what can be done.  That is a local County Cavan co-operative and together with Baileys they produce what has become a world renowned cream liqueur.  There were many reasons why they were fortunate in that respect but one of these was their linkage with a great marketing arm.  That is another example of a local Irish co-operative succeeding by way of a link-up with a group who had a foothold in a far bigger market.  Likewise, Waterford Co-operative in conjunction with a French interest are selling their product in Britain.</P>
      <P>When one has access to a market the task of selling another product on that market is made much easier.  I would advocate that the various exporting agencies, and particularly Bord Bainne, pay even greater attention than they have been paying in the past to this aspect of exporting.</P>
      <P>I do not intend taking up the time of the House in talking on matters that have been dealt with many times before but I should like to refer to the dairying industry. We have particular problems, financial and otherwise, in regard to our supply pattern of milk, and that can have repercussions on our production of cheeses.  Perhaps there is a case to be made for a massive co-ordinated approach among the interests in cheese manufacturing for the purpose of arriving at some type of loose arrangement which would involve a commitment to cheese production all the year round.  This is a matter that is being pursued actively at the moment and I hope that there will be a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that in the pre-EEC days of the sixties there was great interest being expressed in finding some kind of market leader.  We came up with Kerrygold butter, a product that has brought the name of Ireland to many communities throughout the world.  However, in the context of research and development we must ask ourselves why our share of the British market has been reduced to 7 per cent especially since Britain is our nearest customer and one with which we have done business in many respects for many years. <Col N="2481" /> Having regard to the success the Danes have had with the type of unsalted butter they produce I am surprised that we did not change over much earlier to lactic butter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister's research is very limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Danes could do it, there is no reason for our not being able to do it.  The Kerry Co-Operative's involvement in the US market with caseine is a very good development.  I am hopeful that other societies, working in conjunction with Bord Bainne, will adopt this type of pioneering role in the near future.</P>
      <P>On the question of the review taking place in Europe, I should like to put on record our exact position in so far as our dairy industry is concerned.  Anybody who would suggest that we do not have a problem could not be said to be conversant with the facts.  We have a problem in that there is a huge milk and butter surplus in the EEC which is becoming very difficult to sell off, no matter how low the price &mdash; and low prices are always at the expense of the taxpayers of Europe.  On the other hand, we are arriving at a situation where we must insist on something being done.  This is something that the Commission will have to take a lot of responsibility for.  Four or five years ago the danger signals were already flickering in Brussels.  Each year at price-fixing time everyone thought of the problem of the CAP and of the future financing of the Community, but because there were easy options then for all Governments a blind eye was turned.  The only situation that ever brings a group or an individual to their senses is when the money runs out, and that is exactly what has happened. We now have the situation in which big industrial nations such as the Germans who, unlike us, put more money into the Community than they take out of it, have decided now to call halt.  Therefore, before we have anything to do with own resources in the future we must make sure there is light at the end of the tunnel.</P>

When one considers that this nation is a net beneficiary &mdash; for every £1 we pay into the EEC we benefit to the extent of £5 &mdash; one realises that our EEC involvement is very important to us as a nation.  When the finances are being put in order in Paris in a couple of months time we can only hope that the big industrial nations, having regard to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome, will see fit to treat small nations as we believe we should have been treated when we joined the Community.  We have done enough on a diplomatic and political level to ensure that we have persuaded the big nations that it would be suicidal for us to do what everybody wants everyone else to do.  This is the problem from a negotiating point of view.  The Minister will be going to the table on the basis of the importance of the restricted production of milk in the EEC while on the other hand he will be asking for special concessions for Ireland.  That will be a very difficult job but anyone who followed the proceedings at Athens will agree with me.</P>

      <P>It is very important on an occasion like this that one shows the need there is for a balance.  One would have thought that anyone who took an interest in the Athens summit would have realised that we were resolute, dedicated and that above all else we were able, in a balanced way, to put a particular proposal to our EEC partners, most of whom are much stronger than we are but who must all understand that we have an important commitment on the European scene.  If that were not the case, we would not have been admitted in the first instance.  As a nation we have much to offer.  Our dairy industry is important and if certain things are done at EEC level this country will progress.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk of doom and gloom with regard to the agricultural industry and perhaps I should inform the House of certain figures recently released by the EEC.  Our farming income has increased by 3½ per cent, 11 per cent before one takes inflation into account. That increase was the largest in Europe last year.  All of us would like all farmers to do much better but it is important that we put the position of farmers in proper perspective from an EEC point of view. In relation to other farmers in the Community, we have made considerable progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that after the successful conclusion of the Paris summit, Irish agriculture will get the shot in the arm that is needed. The market for cereals and sheep is bright.  There have been dark clouds over the whole area of milk production in the past two or three years and particularly <Col N="2484" /> in the past 12 months but when those clouds disappear Irish farmers will see that it is in their interest to ensure we have top quality milk products.  Because of the favoured position we will have then <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries, Bord Bainne must see to it that we produce as much milk as is possible.  I should like to commend Bord Bainne for their recent announcement that they were considering a small levy on milk for the promotion of research, development and marketing. I understand they are talking at the moment about 0.5p per gallon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said a few moments ago, Bord Bainne should have done this years ago.  Perhaps they are a little late in the day with their action but it is never too late.  We have to realise that we must use whatever facilities are available in Europe, such as intervention and other measures, but after that we are on our own.  We must be competitive. We must use the best marketing expertise. If Bord Bainne carry out a worthwhile development and if that means we can have new products, the future is bright for Irish agriculture and for milk products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxpayers may ask why we do not send butter to starving people in view of the fact that we have a butter mountain here and elsewhere.  Many Deputies have considered this matter and I should like to see a greater interest shown in it.  It does not make sense to overproduce a certain product so that we get to the stage where we cannot sell it.  As the House knows, it is more costly to store butter under refrigerated conditions than it is to manufacture it.  It should not be beyond the capacity of a sophisticated EEC Community to adopt some system to ensure that some of this butter is sent to starving people.  This will not solve all problems but if we have to subsidise it at least we <Col N="2485" /> will know the product is being put to good use.</P>
    <P>While the nation waits with bated breath for the Paris summit, it is important to point out that this Government have shown resolve, enthusiasm and dedication in pointing out our difficulties.  It has finally got across to our EEC partners that under no circumstances can we have a ceiling on production.  We have made that very obvious.  When the summit is over I am confident they will accept that we have problems but I cannot let the occasion pass without putting it on record that this is the toughest fight for any Irish Minister for Agriculture.  We have had very good Ministers in that post since we joined the EEC but previously we have had the benefit of a devaluation of the green £.  Usually when a Minister for Agriculture came to the Dáil after price fixing negotiations there was always some good news.  During the years we were able to tag on important aids such as a subsidy on lime or an AI or a calf premium. The problem now is that the oversupply of milk was not tackled four years ago or in the intervening years.  Now we have a huge problem to face.  I do not think anyone should be under any illusion about the task facing the Minister for Agriculture and eventually the Government in the negotiations that will take place.  Following the Athens Summit enough has been done and said in the way that counts, behind closed doors, with the people who wield the power.  I believe the Taoiseach and the Minister got it across to the people who count that there are certain things we could live with and others we could not, and the super-levy is something this country cannot live with.</P>
    <P>I hope that this year once again we will top the income league of European farmers. That was a great achievement for our farmers last year under difficult conditions, but they have the type of resilience and dedication that is necessary.  The Minister, in my view, will be able to negotiate the type of opportunity our farmers are looking for when he goes to Paris in two months time.  Whether a country is big or small, the spirit of the <Col N="2486" /> Treaty of Rome means all countries are treated equally around the negotiating table.  I believe Ireland is particularly lucky to have a Minister for Agriculture with the negotiating skills of Deputy Deasy.  No matter what the odds may be, he will ensure that Irish farming gets the recognition it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope everything the Minister of State wishes comes true. Being a farmer I agree wholeheartedly with his sentiments but I cannot share his optimism and I hope what he says is true.</P>
      <P>We support the Government's opposition to the super-levy.  Anything I or my colleagues say will be in the best interests of our farmers and in the genuine belief that if our economy is to get off its knees we must have a sound and solid agricultural industry.  It is very easy for me to support this Bill which provides for the continuation of the guarantee for £90 million for Bord Bainne because it is my contention that Bord Bainne is one of Ireland's success stories and must be supported. Bord Bainne, under severe pressures from time to time, have done a tremendous job.  This is recognised by all, certainly by my party.  In his speech the Minister supported and commended Bord Bainne.  That company cannot be commended often enough.</P>
      <P>In my view the Government support can only be regarded as lip service.  <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> dated 5 February 1984, had an article headed &ldquo;Bord Bainne and co-ops hit by Section 84&rdquo;, written by Des Crowley.  It said:</P>
      <P>The abolition of tax-based lending in the budget could pose major problems for the co-ops and Bord Bainne, which use Section 84 loans to a greater degree than most other businesses.  The abolition of the Section 84 facility could lead to an increase of 5% in the cost of loans from now on.</P>
      <P>To put that more plainly, Bord Bainne's interest charges could rise by £1.5 million to £2 million.  This makes one wonder about the Government's sincerity and about their commitment to Bord Bainne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the Minister and his two Ministers of State agree that Bord Bainne <Col N="2487" /> have done a tremendous job, but they are not getting support from their colleagues in higher places, or from the real Taoiseach, Deputy Dukes.  He is the person from whom the commitment or the congratulations must come.  Only by financial support will these commendations be seen for real.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made about diversification but there seems to be differences of opinion on the Government side.  Deputy E. O'Keeffe would not favour diversification as much as I would, but I believe that some of the answers to our problems lie in the diversification of dairy products.  I was interested to hear the Minister support this idea on many occasions.  There were many successful projects throughout the country and last week Deputy Walsh of Cork outlined a number of these projects.</P>
    <P>In this month's issue of &ldquo;Co-Op Ireland&rdquo; I noticed an article headed &ldquo;Town of Monaghan Co-op launches new range of Irish-made yogurt&rdquo;.  They are to be complimented.  I would like to quote from that article which says:</P>
    <P>Town of Monaghan Co-op this month announced the introduction of a new range of top-quality dairy products which are being manufactured in a new factory at Coolshannagh, Monaghan by its subsidiary company, TMC Dairy Products Ltd.</P>
    <P>The range is being sold under the brand name MONA and at present consists of a variety of yogurts, desserts and mousse.  Other products will be added to the range as they are developed.</P>
    <P>Cecil Henderson, Chairman of Town of Monaghan Co-op said &ldquo;This is the most significant development in the Irish dairy industry for many years. It should be noted that all Mona products are being made in Ireland, from Irish milk, and by Irish labour.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We intend to establish ourselves as a leading supplier of an extensive range of fresh dairy products to the Irish market. By so doing we will be unique in Ireland and will offer the Irish food <Col N="2488" /> trade and the Irish consumer an Irish-made alternative to the ever growing number of imports in this market.</P>
    <P>The enterprise has created 25 new jobs, rising to 60 at full production. Additionally, 7 jobs have been created directly with independent distributors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From that we can see that this can be the answer to some of our problems.  Like the Minister and his Ministers of State, I believe grave difficulties are facing us. The initiative taken by the people of Monaghan is a step towards solving our problems.  We import a great deal of dairy products and it is obvious that the Irish dairy industry must diversify to take up some of the existing market.  That is one argument but another is that many jobs can be created.  This is vitally important. That small co-operative in Monaghan created 67 jobs.  That is not something to be sneezed at in these very difficult times when we take into account that there are 225,000 unemployed at present.</P>
    <P>There has been a yogurt-making plant in County Wexford which has been quite successful.  I think Monaghan has followed that lead.  There have been many other types of initiatives taken such as that at Waterford Co-operative with their cream liqueur.  Despite the amount of strawberry growing in County Wexford the strawberries used for yogurt-making are imported from France.  I am asking the Minister to take up this matter with his Department.  Since it has been proven over the years that this is a good country for the growing of strawberries the Minister should insist that Irish strawberries, or a particular type of Irish strawberry, be grown which would be suitable for yogurt-making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that An Foras Talúntais had perfected a strawberry which is suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>An Foras Talúntais are in the process of doing so and are making progress.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that we get quick results.  I know that strawberry importation amounts to approximately 40 per cent only but any imports are costly, particularly bearing in <Col N="2489" /> mind that we have the wherewithal ourselves. I am asking the Minister to have An Foras Talúntais speed up that process and come up with a suitable strawberry within the next year.</P>
      <P>From time to time it has been said that our butter is sold abroad, particularly to the Russians, for a very small amount. Yet our old age pensioners, some of whom are on the poverty line, must pay the full amount with possibly the odd pound being subsidised here or there. There is a market for our butter at home. If some of it were given to our old age pensioners at a reduced rate then that would diminish somewhat the butter mountain about which we hear so much. We could not eliminate totally the butter mountain but such a step would be another milestone on the road to eliminating the tremendous surpluses obtaining. I think it was Deputy Joe Walsh who said last week that the idea has got abroad that butter is bad for one.  Despite the great work done by An Bord Bainne they do not seem to have been able to change that public perception.  I would ask them to take up this aspect more strenuously, reassuring people that, as I believe to be the case, butter is not bad for one.  The same might well be done with regard to milk.  I understand that there will be an effort in this direction in the bar of Dáil Éireann very shortly which will hopefully encourage more sales of milk in bars henceforth.  This type of effort must receive full support.  While there are greater markets here for our butter and milk let us go after them in an effort to eliminate the difficulties confronting us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the diversification and sales of more dairy produce on the home market I have been very disappointed to learn that in recent times the Minister for Finance, and apparently the Minister for Agriculture, have agreed that the colleges of home economics are to be closed in June next.  Those colleges have provided courses for the training of young girls in particular kinds of cheese-making, as well as other courses.  I remember the Minister for Agriculture pointing out that in France and other European countries there are cheeses <Col N="2490" /> and wines produced in different town-lands and areas.  We have the same opportunity available through the training of young people in the art of cheese-making which they might eventually produce themselves, cheese of a particular brand.  For example, I can well see the name &ldquo;Wexford cheese&rdquo; taking on were it only given a chance.  I appeal to the Minister to request his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to provide £100,000 to keep Ramsgrange College in my constituency open.  That college takes on approximately 60 girls annually.  From a survey carried out over the past ten years, it has been ascertained that 60 per cent of all girls trained there found their way back to farms.  Another important aspect to be borne in mind is that the remaining 40 per cent are all in employment, which speaks well for the type of training these young girls received at Ramsgrange and other such colleges.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is aware of the vital importance of the farm wife to the family farm unit today.  Going on the old adage that two heads are better than one, I can assure him that it is a worth-while combination and one that should and must be supported.  From a survey carried out of Wexford farms it was found that where the farm wife had attended a college such as Ramsgrange invariably those farms were the better ones.  The Minister will be aware that some farm families put in 100 hours a week and are given little or no recognition therefor.</P>
    <P>The tremendous input of the farm wife is about to be reduced or eliminated by this decision to close these colleges. About a fortnight ago a deputation from Wexford met the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hegarty, who expressed his dissatisfaction with the proposed closure of these colleges and promised them a meeting with the Minister himself and with the Minister for Finance, a meeting that has not yet been held.  In the interests of agriculture, of successful investment in education I am asking the Minister to ensure that that meeting takes place in the very near future.  Any viable project should and must be supported in these <Col N="2491" /> times.  I believe the Minister's decision to close these colleges is a short-sighted one and the excuse being offered, that the curriculum is outdated, is insufficient. The curriculum may well be outdated in some aspects.  However, the Sisters of St. Louis at Ramsgrange have agreed to change the curriculum to suit the Minister's ideas.  Even at that, the Minister does not seem to have been satisfied.</P>
    <P>For many reasons confidence in Irish agriculture at present is very low, the Minister himself being the cause of some of this.  Indeed, some of the Minister's strongest supporters, such as the <i>Farmers' Journal,</i> to date, and the ICOS Magazine &mdash; which supported the Minister in earlier times &mdash; are beginning to scuttle the ship because they see the situation for what it is.  I might quote now from this month's issue of the ICOS Magazine in which, under the heading &ldquo;Farmer Confidence Further Eroded&rdquo; it says:</P>
    <P>ICOS President John Barry says that the EEC Commission should stop its piecemeal interference with the price support system for dairy products.  Following proposals to implement more stringent policy standards for skim milk powder sales to intervention which were discussed in Brussels, Mr. Barry said that these proposals are the latest in a long line of changes which have been proposed or implemented since proposals for rationalising the common agricultural policy were announced in July last year.</P>
    <P>He went on to list about ten proposals which were affecting farmer confidence.</P>
    <P>The importance of the dairy industry to this country has been spoken of in this House on many occasions, particularly on this Bill.  For the record, there are 67,000 milk producers here, with some 10,000 employed in the ancillary industries and some 5,000 in the beef industry, meat factories and so forth.  Many more jobs could be created in this sector.  Some EEC nations, I understand, have a ratio of one to one.  That is the target which we should set ourselves.  That would eliminate part of our enormous unemployment problem.  The importance of our <Col N="2492" /> dairy industry can be gauged by the value of dairy exports which in 1982 amounted to £374 million &mdash; an enormous amount of money.  If anything were to affect those exports it would spell disaster.  From January 1983 to end October 1983, the value was £350 million.  Taking the full years into account, the figures for both years would be more or less the same.</P>
    <P>We are very worried about the outcome of the Paris talks.  It has been said time and again that our dairy industry have contributed about 4 per cent to the present butter mountain.  Our level of production is approximately 700 gallons per cow, but I understand the EEC average is over 1,000 gallons per cow.  When we entered the EEC first we were given to understand that the EEC would be a great leveller and would encourage our farmers to produce as much as their European counterparts.  There is an obvious discrimination against Irish farmers at present.  I dearly wish, as the Minister of State Deputy Connaughton does, that the forthcoming Paris talks will bring about a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister that anything we of the Fianna Fáil Party can do to help that to come about, we certainly shall do. We have no desire whatsoever to scuttle the Government or harm them in any way.  At the same time, we must let it be known pretty clearly that we are not satisfied with their performance to date.  It is my contention that the Minister for Agriculture, aided by the Minister for Finance, brought about the suggestion of the super-levy once again.  As every Member knows, the idea of this levy has not just arrived, it has been with us for some years now.  The Minister's predecessors have fought off the super-levy in other years, particularly Deputy MacSharry and Deputy Lenihan.  The Minister has said in the House that times were not so tough then, but times are always tough when you go to Europe and when all the EEC nations are anxious to ensure the best for themselves.  The Minister's weakness has reintroduced the subject of the milk super-levy.  This was caused by the complete lack of commitment on the part of the Minister and his Government to our farmers in the dairy industry and <Col N="2493" /> as a whole.  In the budget of 1983 you allowed £156 million to be taken out of the agricultural industry and you scuttled the farm modernisation scheme almost in its entirety&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;showing quite clearly that you had little or no commitment to it.  It was very shortly after that, early in April, that the idea of the super-levy was put on the table.  It is our contention that it should not have travelled beyond that room.  It was clearly shown in July that they meant business. You were not taking it seriously at that stage because, immediately after the summer recess, the Taoiseach told me in answer to a question that he did not think it necessary to tour the European capitals to tell the other heads of state of our special position.  Yet, just before Christmas, he found out that our advice was correct.  Unfortunately, he left it too late.</P>
      <P>Your lack of commitment, weakness and inability to attract investment from your own Government into the agricultural industry has put us in our present position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Please forgive me.  The Minister has not been addressing the real enemies of this country or of the EEC and does not appreciate the necessity to eliminate this butter mountain.  What has caused the butter mountain?  Obviously, over-production &mdash; we all accept that. However, our over-production can hardly be treated as a crime when Britain are importing 80,000 tonnes of butter each year and when an enormous amount of cereal substitutes is being imported every year into the EEC.  Obviously, the cost of milk production on the part of our European counterparts will be far less because of the cheap cereal substitutes. When the Minister goes back to Paris next month I ask him to make an all-out attack on the imports of cereal substitutes <Col N="2494" /> and of New Zealand butter.  While I have heard him from time to time speak here in the House about New Zealand butter imports, we do not hear much about that in Europe.  He should attack the real enemies and not be as much on the defensive as he appears to be.  If you tot up the figures saved by the elimination of New Zealand butter and cereal substitutes you would find that we would be in a relatively comfortable position in which our farmers could continue to produce and increase production without the fear of this disastrous milk levy.  That is why the Minister should attack nations who import great numbers of substitute cereals. They are the cause of the terrible problems facing us.</P>
      <P>The Farm Modernisation Scheme was scrapped last year and when the Minister reintroduced a very limited modernisation scheme this year the EEC withdrew their support immediately.  It was on the Minister's prompting that this happened and I should now like to ask him if the Farm Modernisation Scheme will be continued, even with the measly £26 million allocated to it.  I believe that the Government have lost all credibility in Europe and especially among Irish farmers. What is the Minister's policy in relation to the forthcoming Paris talks?  What input has the Minister made since Christmas after the failure of the previous talks?  Could he outline in detail what steps he has taken since to protect our position in the dairy industry?  Have any steps being taken?  I do not think so, because Deputy Connaughton told us today of what he would like to see and what he hopes will happen.  Pious platitudes or hopes will get us nowhere.  We want action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had an opportunity of taking action since last Christmas but I very much doubt if he has done anything. Of course, it is very hard for the Minister to try to make a case abroad for Irish farmers when other Government Ministers are scuttling his plans behind his back.  What interest have the Government or the Minister shown in farmers in financial trouble?  There may be 6,000 or 7,000 in that position at present and in 90 per cent of cases they are classed as good <Col N="2495" /> farmers.  In 1976 to 1979 the banks and the ACC had been almost forcing farmers to take finance.  They were supported, in turn, by our agricultural advisers who were telling farmers that it was a good idea to invest and borrow.  When interest rates rocketed the Government, the banks and the ACC scuttled the farmer and left him holding the baby.</P>
    <P>Will the elimination of 6,000 or 7,000 of our best farmers and the enforced sale of their land help the economy?  The Minister should address himself to that question as he has just sat idly by while the farmers in financial trouble go deeper and deeper into debt.  The ACC give the impression that they are doing their utmost to help farmers and to negotiate with them.  This is pure deception.  I know farmers in County Wexford who have done their utmost to accommodate the ACC and who have suggested that they are prepared to pay them back over a 15 year period.  However, the ACC are moving in receivers behind their backs.  The Minister must take this very seriously.  Is it a good idea to take land off farmers? Who buys the land in these instances? The banks are putting off sales of farms from day to day but in the end it is the non farmers or bigger farmers who will buy them.  Unless drastic measures are taken in this regard it will be disastrous for agriculture.</P>
    <P>Land leasing would help the dairy industry if a suitable system was adopted. The Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, has preached about land leasing. I agree with many of his ideas but, unfortunately, it is still only an idea. What is happening in the meantime?  The Land Commission, who have been dealing with the business of taking over land and making it available to the smaller farmers, are not being given any more money, so when land comes on the market they cannot buy it.  The big farmer is buying more land.  I know of instances in County Wexford where big farmers are becoming bigger and have gone from owning 200 acres to 400 acres.  This is caused by Government policies.  If the Minister has ideas on land leasing it is no good floating them here unless he is prepared <Col N="2496" /> to allocate money to implement them.  The Land Commission have not been as successful as was hoped.  Many of their activities are questionable and I can give examples.  However, they were serving a purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you are aware of the problems in agriculture and I am making a case for the small dairy farmer and how he might increase his land holding to increase production.  If the Minister for Agriculture and his Minister of State come back with a great deal from Paris there will be scope for an increase in land holdings.  Land leasing is a good idea, but it is quite useless without the money to support it.  The Minister should immediately start funding the Land Commission until such time as his famous scheme gets off the ground.</P>
      <P>The commitment of the Government is and has been questionable.  This has been noted by all agricultural commentators. Everybody supported the Government during their first period in office.  I was quite surprised that some people well acquainted with agriculture supported them but at this stage they have scuttled them.  Last week's edition of the <i>Farmer's Journal</i> reports that 2.3p per gallon is to be slashed from the price of milk and they lay the blame on the Minister and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State says that there are answers to our difficulties.  I do not share his optimism but we would all be delighted if he could put that optimism into action.  We support the complete negation of the milk levy.  Anything less would be disastrous.  Now is the time for the Government to work on this matter. They must not wait until the Paris talks but must draw up a programme of action and follow it diligently.  This may enable us to escape the disastrous effects which would follow the introduction of the milk levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Bainne have taken on a tremendous task and have done great work over a number of years.  They have undoubtedly <Col N="2497" /> been very successful and are probably the greatest success story in Irish marketing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I congratulate Bord Bainne on their excellent work for the dairy industry in the promotion of dairy products in Europe and elsewhere. Agencies such as Bord Bainne, CBF, CTT and the Pigs and Bacon Commission are selling different Irish products and all these agencies are doing an excellent job. I believe that in 1984 they should be united under one flag.  This would ensure better results for the producer than can be achieved while they operate individually and would probably give a better return for money.</P>
      <P>Bord Bainne have done an excellent job and their work has contributed to the fact that less than 1 per cent of our dairy produce is in intervention.  We are causing less than 1 per cent of the dairy mountain about which all the argument is taking place.  There are areas where Bord Bainne could become more deeply involved.  They have introduced milk flavours in a small way but there is wide scope for this product.  I had the opportunity a few years ago to visit the United States and every second advertisement on television was related to milk flavours. We should think seriously about developing this aspect of the dairy industry.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have failed disastrously in regard to food processing, though they have paid lip service to it. Only recently has there been any real progress in helping co-operatives and individuals to set up a proper food processing industry which can produce products acceptable to the Irish housewife. If this had been done in the mid-sixties we would have no problem in competing with our European counterparts. We now find ourselves competing even in regard to the potato.  Growers have been receiving very poor prices.  One year in every four is excellent but the other three years are a disaster.  I must emphasise the work of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hegarty, by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I must make reference to some of the points made by Opposition colleagues.  In discussing this Bill many Deputies have referred to the period from 1976 to 1979.  I was one of the people at that time who took the initiative that all the politicians in this House and throughout Europe were talking about, to develop and increase output to help the economy.  We did that with the assumption that Bord Bainne would be available to help sell our products and on the assumption that we would be able to borrow money at about 12 per cent.  A large percentage of the 7,000 farmers who are in financial difficulties at this time did likewise to ensure that they could provide a better living for their families and increase their overall output. The value of exports in the dairying industry in 1983 was £735 million, which is approximately 12 per cent of the total exports for that year.  At that time we did not realise that we would have a Government who would help to increase inflation and interest rates to the tune of 20 per cent and 22 per cent, which nobody <Col N="2499" /> in any industry could afford to pay.  This gets us back to the real problem of where the decline in agriculture was and the reason so many farmers have got into financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>I could not let this opportunity pass without referring to some of the points which were thrown across the House today about the Government running away in regard to their commitment to agriculture.  At the time I am talking about we had a Government who presided over a decrease in family farm incomes by 52 per cent in three years. This, as well as a high inflation rate and high interest rates, is the root cause of the problems we have today.  There is a very good case to be made by our Ministers in relation to the financial problems those people have today.  While I am totally against putting receivers into any of those farms I must say that where co-operation has not taken place those people have not any other option.  If there are people doing their utmost to make a living on family farms and make their repayments but because of high interest rates over years of high inflation they are unable to repay they should be listened to.  I hope something can be done to increase the number of years they are allowed in which to make their repayments and also do away with some of the increased interest rates charged by the financial institutions over the last few years.  With regard to Bord Bainne helping different co-ops, Deputy Wilson will be able to verify that Monaghan and Virginia have been mentioned.  We could not let this opportunity pass without mentioning Bailieborough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>And Killeshandra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Killeshandra is a little nearer to the Deputy than it is to me. Those co-ops have done great work in relation to food processing, having our raw products processed and left on the shelves for our consumers.  Over the years we have fallen down in that area. The farmers and the co-ops cannot be blamed for this.  We must blame the Governments who were in power over <Col N="2500" /> the last 15 years.  Now, when there is a problem in Europe and when there are mountains of butter and milk products, we realise that this is where we could have done something constructive to get those products available for sale within the EEC and outside it.  We have gone a little way in the last few years because of the increased incentives which co-operatives have because they are nearly all farm-owned.  Those people have done a wonderful job.  I am delighted the Government have shown the initiative to help those co-ops along the way.  I hope help will be provided in the areas where it is still required.</P>
      <P>Mention was made earlier about the development of the increased amount of land which will be made available to small farmers by the Land Commission in order to help them increase their output.  We know that in the last five years the land made available by the Land Commission was so dear that the small farmers who were being helped out were unable to make the repayments.  I welcome the introduction of the land leasing system by the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton. I was interested to hear one of the Opposition speakers referring to this as the phoney scheme of the Minister and say that when it was introduced it would not be sufficient.  At least it is going some way towards getting land for young farmers. It is going much further than the Opposition junior Ministers did during any period of the long time their Governments were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the most serious problem facing all of us, whether we are in farming or in industry, is the proposal coming from Brussels about the introduction of a super-levy.  I do not believe what some of the speakers have said about the Minister for Agriculture or the Taoiseach not having made the other Ministers for Agriculture aware that we were totally against this proposal.  It is not very helpful for anybody to come into the House and say that the Ministers pre-empted the proposal for a super-levy in Europe.  We are all aware that there was a proposal before the different Ministers for Agriculture over the last five years to do something about the inevitable high proportions <Col N="2501" /> of dairy products which would be in Europe in a few years time if something was not done.  We have the use of the green £ to help our farmers in regard to devaluation but it is not right to say that other Ministers ensured a good deal for us.</P>
    <P>D-Day has come and it is essential that we beat this super-levy proposal.  It is our major partners in Europe, the Germans, Dutch and British, who have caused it. Britain has been importing 90,000 tonnes of New Zealand butter and the Dutch and the Germans have been using cereal substitutes for their factory farm systems. Our milk production is only 700 gallons per cow compared with 1,300 gallons in Europe.</P>
    <P>We have got to ensure that this super-levy will not be imposed.  Three or four years ago, when the problem was comparatively remote, we said that if the problem was not tackled then we would have this dilemma.  In those days the Government took the easy way of putting off consideration of it and letting somebody else try to solve it.  That is what the party opposite did when they were on the job.  The Ministers for Agriculture and Foreign Affairs, and the Taoiseach, must be complimented on the efforts they have been making.  We did not threaten the veto, but I have been in business and in politics for a while&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been around a little while and I know that you do not show on day one what you will do on day nine.  The Government have done a good job in this respect despite the disbelief of the Opposition that they would.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I suggest that soon the agencies working in this field should be amalgamated to give Ireland better representation in the market places of Europe and further afield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment An Bord Bainne on the work they have done, but they have a lot to do.  All parties here should have a firm commitment to our food processing industry because it has great potential for <Col N="2502" /> job creation.  An Bord Bainne should see that all consumer goods on the Irish market will be manufactured at home instead of being exported and imported later in English and European packets.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of introducing levies in the last 12 months but despite this allegation Irish farmers have had the best year since 1978.  They have benefited from the reduction in inflation for which this Government are responsible, and consequently their real incomes have been improved.  I wish to remind the House that a few years ago the Government imposed a 2 per cent resource tax on farmers, who suffered a 52 per cent reduction in incomes in a three year period.  That is when the damage was done, and we know who presided over our affairs at that time.</P>
    <P>I hope An Bord Bainne will continue their excellent work, but I repeat that there should be amalgamation of all the agencies selling our produce wherever they can find markets.  It has been said that Governments here have hindered these agencies.  It is time for us to get out into world markets to sell our processed food products and to give ourselves a proper structure at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is framed to guarantee the continuance of the State guarantee for Bord Bainne borrowing.  Anent what Deputy Farrelly said, that it is appropriate to compliment An Bord Bainne who have not had to call on their full borrowing authority, the Minister has told us that from the time An Bord Bainne were set up they have not had to call on Government money.</P>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly suggested that we should get all of these agencies together. That looks to be a rational suggestion but it should be pointed out that An Bord Bainne are practically unique because they have not been running to the Government for money.  Indeed I would be dubious about whether the Government, under EEC regulations, would be allowed to give them money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise, with my fellow Opposition Members and Government speakers, how important it is to resist the <Col N="2503" /> imposition of what has come to be called the super-levy.  I had discussions with the leaders of the co-operatives Deputy Farrelly mentioned in my own area, namely, Bailieborough, Killeshandra and Virginia. Lough Egish, Monaghan, are also in my constituency.  They are convinced &mdash; they do not say this for propaganda reasons &mdash; that the industry would be beheaded by the imposition of this levy in its original form or in any modified form.  I should like the Minister of State to confirm that the average gallonage in Europe is 1,050 or 1,075.  Deputy Farrelly said it was 1,300 but I do not think it is that high.  In my area there is an average gallonage of 800.  We had been making progress towards achieving the European level of production.  Not only would this movement be stopped in its tracks but the production we had was to be cut back.</P>
    <P>In general the Minister for Agriculture understands the importance of the super-levy.  I would not be surprised if the Government or his colleagues were not as convinced nor am I sure that other people in Government have exercised the muscle they had at the various councils to try to fight this at European level.  It does not merely affect agriculture.  The Taoiseach has a responsibility as Taoiseach. The Minister for Labour is also seriously involved from the point of view of employment arising directly from the milk industry.  The Ministers for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism are equally involved.  For that reason it is undesirable that Ministers should fight their own corner and leave the Minister for Agriculture on his own to fight this very serious attempt to curb production.</P>
    <P>I cannot help thinking that the new standards imposed for skimmed milk powder is another European device to cut production.  They demand less moisture and less acidity.  Have the Commission in the past marketed skimmed milk powder with a good conscience when it contained too much moisture and acidity? Will they tell the people who are asked to purchase the skimmed milk powder which is stock-piled in intervention that there is too much moisture and <Col N="2504" /> acidity in it?  It smells to me of sophistry. It seems to be a gimmick to cut down on production.</P>
    <P>Commentators on the milk scene have stressed time and again the importance of research and development.  It is a truism that research and development in all facets of industry and of agriculture are of paramount importance.  Today I was speaking to someone who told me there may be some difficulties in marketing but one of the successes of the marriage of the results of research and development in the dairy industry has been the cheese which was developed for export to Greece, Crete and the Middle East. The Dairy Science Faculty in University College, Cork, was asked to examine chemically and bacterically the cheese that sold well in that market.  They did an excellent job.  They linked up with the co-operative that produced the cheese.  I was very pleased to see in the huge cruciform market in Kania Irish cheese on sale with a Greek label.  I understand there may be some marketing difficulties in this regard.  Here we had market research and scientific application.  Close attention was paid to what the customer wanted to buy.  All the information was used in the creamery to produce this cheese.  I could not buy any of the cheese in Greece because they would only sell a huge cartwheel of it.  When I came home I had an opportunity to taste it.  It is not exactly our taste in cheese but &mdash; this may sound like a commercial &mdash; it is well worth tasting.  I mention that because it is an example of how scientific research can be applied and market research and production interwoven to produce something worthwhile.  I discussed it afterwards with our Ambassador in Athens. It is important to realise that, if there is an argument about importation now that Greece is a member of the EEC, we contribute substantially to the Greek economy.  Thousands of people go on holiday to Greece.  We have a quid for their drachma.</P>
    <P>In guaranteeing the loans for Bord Bainne, due to the peculiar system we have we are also involved in beef production. For that reason Deputy Farrelly was relevant when he discussed the processing <Col N="2505" /> of our agricultural produce and how important it was for the future. Thanks to a man who at the time did not know the business end of a cow from the other end, Mr. Tony O'Reilly, we had a remarkable success in marketing Kerrygold butter.  It is a household name in many areas.  Along the coast of the Mediterranean and in the Canaries one can get salted or unsalted Kerrygold butter but one will look in vain for tins of beef from this country.  We produce great meat.  We kill early.  I remember a former head of Siemens-Schukert, the electrical engineering firm, telling me we did not know how lucky we were to have the meat we have.  He told me that when he came out of his office he could buy a steak, take it home and cook it in less than ten minutes.  He said he would have to beat the meat in Germany around the kitchen before he could do that.  Why we cannot process our excellent beef and lamb and sell it as the Germans, the Dutch, the Danes and the French do, I do not know.  If one searches on a supermarket shelf in any of these countries where tourists have been crowding for the past number of years, one will look in vain for an Irish product so that Deputy Farrelly was touching on something that I feel very strongly about.  I shall not continue on that line since it is specifically the Bord Báinne guarantee we are dealing with here but the area I am talking of is one that requires research and development and hard application on the ground.  I hope that we will see more action in that regard in the future.</P>
    <P>If we take forestry, for instance, something I regard as one of the school heresys, we find that there is no processing of our timber but likewise there are serious questions in the whole area of the processing of food.  Erin Foods made an effort in this direction but were not successful. However, that is another story.  So far as diversification is concerned, the people involved in dairying have addressed themselves to this question.  If manufacturing industry had achieved the percentage increase in production that our farmers have achieved we would read about it in every magazine and newspaper.  This House should be prepared to commend <Col N="2506" /> our farmers on the magnificent increase in production they have achieved in a very short period.  I might add that in a recent assessment of productivity my area came second to south-west Cork. Farmers in general have shown the way in increased production and they have done so to an extent that we have not commended them properly for.</P>
    <P>In my constituency Virginia Milk Products are involved in the production of Bailey's Irish Cream.  I do not have an up-to-date statistic but I understand that approximately 35 million gallons of milk are processed for that production alone. It has been a wonderful commercial success. Developing also under the aegis of the Bailieborough Co-Operative is Emmets Liquor Cream.  A large extension has been made to the factory there and exports of the cream are very high. These are not the only cream liqueurs on the market but they are the only ones I intend mentioning since they are produced in my constituency.</P>
    <P>All the prestigious journals in the world &mdash;<i>Paris-March, Der Stern, Time</i> and so on &mdash; are carrying advertisements for those creams and in particular for Bailey's which was the first on the market. It is very important for our dairying industry that we have that kind of demand for those products in so many countries.  This is the most successful diversification of products in recent years. The quality is rated very highly so one hopes that the standard will be maintained. I know that it will be maintained in the case of the two I have mentioned and I have no reason for not believing that the other people involved in the same type of product will not also maintain these standards.  However, as is the case sometimes with Hollywood film successes, three or four versions are made subsequently, one worse than the other and all spoiling the original worthwhile production.  This sort of situation has developed in relation to the export of lamb and so on.  Marketing and market research are very important in terms of the export of any product.</P>
    <P>A number of people have mentioned New Zealand exports.  Long before this question became so acute, I had the <Col N="2507" /> opportunity of talking for a long time with the Minister for Agriculture in New Zealand.  He could not see any logic in our position on the question of imports from that country.  Anyone who has examined the Articles of the Treaty of Rome will realise that long ago UK imports of New Zealand butter should have been stopped.  That is the iron logic of the Treaty of Rome.  Admittedly when bargains are being made many factors have to be taken into consideration and the UK has a market in New Zealand for some of its products.  Consequently, the UK is gaining something apart from the old Commonwealth idea.  Sometimes in the market place the whole grá-mo-chroí attitude dies a sudden death but in this case Britain gains considerably from its importation by having a market in New Zealand for its own products.  An <i>ex parte</i> advantage to one member of the Community is a situation which is not desirable. As of now the importation to the UK of New Zealand butter and lamb is affecting us very badly.  Even <i>pro tem</i> we should say that there should be some advantage not only to one member state but to others, particularly the weakest, in any such situation.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are adopting a very strong position with regard to imports from New Zealand.  I understood &mdash; and the Minister may correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that the late seventies were to be the deadline for permission to import from New Zealand but the UK with New Zealand have succeeded in having that deadline extended.  For one reason or another the EEC collectively have not invoked the guillotine.  However, they intend doing so in respect of this country and in terms of an industry that is vital to our economy.  I refer to the super-levy.  Therefore, there are double standards being applied: the letter of the Treaty of Rome is adhered to in some instances but not in others.  In this case we should fight to the death rather than have the super-levy imposed on us.  We have strong moral grounds for doing so.</P>
    <P>To buttress that I wish to refer to the section 84 ban which is envisaged as costing producers a half penny per gallon on <Col N="2508" /> milk.  Together with the intervention delay which will cost them 2p per gallon, and the various levies which will cost them 5p per gallon, one is talking of 8p per gallon and that would be a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>In my area there is constant talk in the context of another but allied fear, that is, the question of the MCA's.  There is a whole area that needs revolutionary action in so far as monetary systems are concerned.  I have spoken already in another place and in this House, too, about the unsatisfactory state of international exchange.  I will not go into that now.  The UK did not join the EMS but I think that was a great mistake on their part and it was detrimental also to the EMS as a whole.  I will not go further than that.  It is imperative that order be brought into the monetary system with regard to the marketing of all produce but particularly the produce of the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>There were arguments by some of those who were importing cereal substitutes in Europe &mdash; speakers from both sides of the House mentioned this as the big problem in relation to factory farms &mdash; that they were buying cereal substitutes at least in part from under-developed Third World countries.  That was specifically in relation to one cereal substitute. Subject to substantive denial, I say that the people who were advancing the argument that they were helping poorer, Third World countries by these imports were involved in the big business of producing cereal substitutes and importing them.  I do not want to expand further on that but there is a slight immorality in that if that is the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister also has a problem directly related to the milk industry with regard to calf premiums.  There is a proposal to abolish them but as far as we are concerned that will have to be fought with persistence.</P>
    <P>Some time ago <i>The Economist</i> made a survey of the butter industry.  They were not talking about commercial butter purchase and usage but they indicated that if one day's consumption of butter in the ten countries of the EEC were destroyed by fire the total butter mountain would <Col N="2509" /> disappear.  I do not know if this is true now but when <i>The Economist</i> made the survey some time ago that was the case. The butter mountain cannot be all that big even now.  The question of factory farming and cereal substitute imports will have to be hammered out at EEC level. In the proposal there was a 4½ per cent impost on large factory farms but that is not sufficient for our purposes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the farm modernisation scheme, the Minister made a grave mistake on 9 February when he decided to suspend the scheme.  In the context of my constituency, farm modernisation means modernisation for dairy production and that is relevant to the Bill before the House.  People, including myself, have referred in this House to what I regard as the immorality of that decision on 9 February. It was an immoral action on the part of the Minister to cancel that scheme without warning.  Throughout the country many farmers, particularly small farmers who were ambitious to improve their holdings and the production and the quality of their farms, had been working on schemes under the guidance of agricultural advisers throughout the winter of 1982 and up to the time the Minister spoke about the scheme.  They were convinced that the scheme would continue and they accepted the advice of the agents of the Minister.  I put it to the House that if those people came together, instructed counsel and sued the Minister, because his instructors and advisers were acting as his agent, they would win a case in any court.  I would advocate and advise them to do so.  Farmers expended considerable sums on the small dairy farms in County Cavan on the advice of instructors.  They did not know the Minister was going to pull the carpet from under the feet of the instructors. The Minister and his Ministers of State should face up to this.  If they do not I hope the farmers will join together, take a case to court and see to it that they are paid for schemes upon which they had embarked under the guidance of agricultural advisers.  I do not think any judge could hold otherwise than that the advisers were acting as agents for the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Town of Monaghan Co-operative <Col N="2510" /> announced recently a scheme for the production of yoghourt and various flavoured milks.  In the context of a small town this will provide substantial employment in the future.  For a while I had great hopes butter oil would be a profitable substitute for butter.  The Minister and his Minister of State, our spokesman for agriculture and I have mentioned that diversification is important. However, from consultation with managers of co-operatives I am afraid that butter oil, which held out such great prospects, is not now so regarded.  We had a market in Mexico but the Mexicans had serious financial problems in the recent past and that may be one reason why the market that was established there has died.  Another reason may be what the Minister referred to in his opening speech, namely, that the United States is under-cutting dairy products in Mexico and in other places.  That is a problem that has to be faced but it is one about which we can do little on a national level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh mentioned the importance for the dairying industry of promoting early calving and he gave the House some statistics.  He mentioned the figure of 25 per cent on 1 April and if one could bring that back to 1 February it would mean substantial gains for the dairying industry.  We can rely on the agricultural advisory service &mdash; both that for which the Minister is responsible and the very important educational service being provided by individual co-operatives &mdash; to concentrate on this matter. However, it all hinges on not being shackled or inhibited by this crazy idea of blocking development in the most under-developed dairying area in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word of praise for the agricultural advisory and educational service.  Nowadays it has become almost a tradition to knock various professions, to be cynical about large fees for court appearances and so on, but I do not think anybody could criticise the commitment, the almost missionary zeal, of the majority of those involved in agricultural education almost since the war.  It would be to our advantage if we could find out who <Col N="2511" /> instilled this into them because it is the purest form of practical patriotism and the results on the ground have been remarkable, particularly with regard to increased productivity.</P>
    <P>In my area special newsletters are sent out by the agricultural advisers to the co-operatives, and I am sure it is the same in other areas.  The gradual spread of ideas by this means has incalculable benefit for the farming community.  The fact that these advisers make themselves personally available to the farmer to give advice so that the written word in the education sheet is matched to the personality of the person who produces it is one of the great efforts in education.  They are doing for agriculture almost the same as the múinteoirí taistil did for the Irish language at the beginning of this century, and they show the same kind of commitment and love of their job.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made in this debate of assessing milk not merely for its butter fat content but for its protein and lactose content.  Many years ago I put down a question to the then Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Clinton, about the possibility of assessing protein for the payment of farmers.  He was very sharp with me; it was not his usual form.  He more or less indicated that he knew nothing about protein and neither did I.  I do not think that was a fair remark and I said so to him.  He was a fair-minded man.  I see that now payment for protein content is under way in some areas, in some progressive co-operatives.  The idea that people should be paid on gallonage alone is one I would be a little chary of because it would take the concentration away from the production of quality milk and that might be dangerous.</P>
    <P>I am glad people have interested themselves in the IDA's role with regard to milk and milk products.  I cannot understand how this did not happen long ago. Over the years the IDA have garnered considerable expertise.  Because our agricultural industry is so important and we have the raw material for the development of processed food, the IDA should be encouraged to take action as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2512" /> Some time ago I was asked by the then Minister for Agriculture to speak at a Bord Bainne function honouring some of the founder members.  I made a reference to the butter and health link.  In an increasingly urbanised society this has caused people to be scared of butter.  The simple fact is that people who take enough exercise or who work physically very hard have nothing to fear from a love of butter.  It is in the sedentary occupations that experts say damage may be done, but there is a very easy remedy. People should be encouraged to develop physical fitness and at the same time use the natural food of the country.  The marketing people have missed an opportunity of linking healthy wholesome butter to the campaign under way in most countries for more physical exercise and fitness. This would in some way counteract a certain amount of propaganda of dubious merit from the manufacturers of butter substitutes who have been praising their own products with regard to calories, fitness, health and so on.</P>
    <P>There is serious worry about farm modernisation which in my area is a dairying problem because the whole area is committed to dairying.  I would like to reiterate what our spokesman, Deputy Noonan, said with regard to the fight re the super-levy, calf premiums and so on. We totally support him.  We are critical that the Minister has not gone in fighting as hard as we think he should have.  I am dubious about the support he gets in Government and I have mentioned specific Ministers who have a direct involvement in this.  I mentioned Labour, because there is a high employment content here, and Trade, Commerce and Industry.  We are appealing to the Government collectively and individually to hammer this point home as far as the as not yet fully developed dairy industry here is concerned.  When we reach the level of development of other members of the EEC, we will not be making any béal bocht.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate the importance this House should attach to the information that Bord Bainne did not have to call on the Government for any money and to voice our admiration for them and hope <Col N="2513" /> that will continue because there has been a tendency to do what the Americans call the laid back act, that is, have the Government pick up the chit later and the company does not have to make any effort.  Bord Bainne and the dairying industry deserve our praise in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am in full support of this Bill.  I hope that the points made in the course of this debate will be taken in the right spirit by the Minister as an indication of how committed all sides of the House are to the potentiality for development in the dairying industry remaining with us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Representing a dairying constituency, South-West Cork, I congratulate the Minister on his foresight, wisdom, courage and capability in extending the provisions of the Dairy Produce (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1973 which will safeguard the future of An Bord Bainne until 1990.  As we are all aware, An Bord Bainne have played a most important role in the development of our agricultural industry.  Whenever I travel abroad it is a great source of pride to me to see their products being marketed perhaps more predominantly than any of their counterparts in Europe.  The board are due a considerable amount of praise in this respect because they have got Irish milk products into valuable outlets in countries other than those in Europe, places like the Canary Islands and the Far East.  Anywhere one wishes to go one will find their products taking pride of place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that competition, especially from the USA and New Zealand, is very keen and we must become more efficient if we are to maintain our place on international markets. There is an ever-growing need for diversity of dairy products.  This is a must if we are to succeed.  We have seen the impact of that dynamic Beare Island man, Bernie Cahill, on our agricultural industry. I refer to the managing director of Carbery Milk Products in Ballineen, who has made this produce immensely popular worldwide.  His break-through there in the conversion of whey into alcohol, resulting in a superior cream liqueur, has vast potential on international markets. <Col N="2514" /> The USA have called on his expertise and the New Zealanders were quick to seek his advice also.  It is men of his courage and capability we need today in this country and in western Europe generally. We are especially dependent on the expansion of our greatest industry, dairying.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the cornerstone of our economy.  I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture in having created this new group of four Ministers of State, giving more impetus to the marketing of our agricultural produce.  This is a step in the right direction, relieving our hard-pressed Minister, who works day and night for the promotion of our agricultural industry.  I feel certain this new group will play their part in helping him out in a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>There is also vast potential for our bacon produce.  There is demand for a special type of ham that could quite easily be produced here for southern European outlets, in places like Spain, the Mediterranean Islands and in Italy in particular. I believe there is a lucrative market for our bacon produce in the USA also.  Anybody travelling through the major cities of the United States will have found that their bacon products are not as good a quality as ours.  We need to do a &ldquo;Tony O'Reilly&rdquo; on &ldquo;Bord Bainne&rdquo; exercise on our bacon industry which will then flourish in world markets.  The quality of our rashers and sausages is second to none.  All that is needed is aid, encouragement, greater dedication and more drive on the part of the people responsible for marketing our agricultural produce to make our bacon products as successful as have been our milk products. There must also be a market for Irish veal products, another on which we failed to capitalise or impress on foreign markets. I have no doubt that the quality of our veal is better than a lot served in high-class European restaurants today. There is scope for the improvement of our veal exports also.</P>
    <P>It is well known that today we skim the surface only so far as sheep production is concerned.  Coming from a mountainous terrain in south-west Cork I know only too well what could be done to improve <Col N="2515" /> the sheep population in that area.  It is a well known fact that our mountain ranges, from Donegal to West Cork, are denuded of fertiliser and lime and that, if we are to improve the quality of our sheep production, we must begin at source, that is, the improvement of the fertility of mountain pasture.  In this day and age surely it is not impracticable to have those mountain ranges treated with lime and fertiliser?  That would improve the stocking capacity of the mountains and benefit that very considerable asset of the nation, the sheep industry.</P>
    <P>Commonages work against the advancement of this industry.  The day will soon come when they will have to be divided, even if only from the animal health point of view.  There is a growing need to have these commonages divided as quickly as possible.  If every farmer in the west and along the western seaboard could have this mountain commonage divided, he could there and then get his land fenced and do his best to bring back the fertility of the mountain soil.  In the lowland areas of the west commonages are also a curse to farming.  The sooner the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, tackles that problem, the better for our agriculture.  It is well known that our sheep industry has been treated as the Cinderella of the agricultural sector.  I appeal to the Minister to devote as much attention as is possible towards improving that industry.</P>
    <P>On my journey from my home in south-west Cork to Dublin, I travel through the greater part of the country during an almost five hour trip by car. When I leave Cork city and strike the plains of Kildare coming near Dublin, I can see a vast amount of land under-utilised. If that were in south-west Cork, south Kerry, west Galway, west Donegal or west Clare, I guarantee that it would be utilised.  In those areas, for generations the small farmers played an important role in the development of our agriculture, eking out an existence, winning back land by reclamation.  In the fertile plains of the midlands, hundreds of thousands of acres could produce more. One-third of our agricultural land is lying <Col N="2516" /> dormant, completely unproductive.  Our future agricultural plans must incorporate that potential acreage in full production. It would thus play the part in our economy which it is not playing at present because it is certainly not stocked to capacity.  It is not paying to the Irish Exchequer what it should be paying.</P>
    <P>I listened last week to the chief Opposition speaker, Deputy Noonan, criticising our Minister for not tackling the agricultural problems.  What other Ministers had the guts to tackle the agricultural problems in the way that the Fine Gael Ministers have since the foundation of the State?  Was it not Paddy Hogan who thought up the slogan &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough&rdquo;?  That slogan swept the headlines in the early days of the State.  Was it not Jimmy Dillon who, as Minister for Agriculture with the first Coalition Government, had the lime lorries rolling into the Irish fields which had been starved of lime and fertilisers until he took over?  Was it not Mark Clinton who piloted this country into the EEC? Was it not he who brought off the greatest deal which Irish farmers have enjoyed in the past decade?</P>

      <P>Was it not Alan Dukes who, when Minister for Agriculture, gave the stimulus to Irish agriculture?  Today, it is Fine Gael's Austin Deasy on whose shoulders this mantle is falling to pilot Irish farmers through one of the most serious difficulties &mdash; the milk super-levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to all my friends on the opposite side of the House that instead of trying to earn political kudos they should be standing behind our Minister and giving him every possible encouragement to <Col N="2517" /> help him to bring back the best possible deal for our dairy industry.  That is what I would expect from my friends in the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael as a party have always stood behind the farmers since the foundation of the State and now do so as the major party in this Coalition Government.  They have played their part in formulating successful agricultural policies.  I have no doubt that if given the chance they will play their part now in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>One of the Opposition speakers said that more milk should be drunk locally and I agreed with him.  Our GAA, golf and other sports clubs, some with their recently installed luxurious lounge bars, should make milk bars available to their patrons.  That would be a big help towards reducing the surplus stock of milk produced here.  Ireland has been impeded from raising its milk yields to EEC standards.  Among the serious impediments to the development of our agricultural industry is, firstly, that 23 per cent of our farmers are over 65 years of age, as compared with 7.6 per cent in The Netherlands.  Until such time as our young farmers have the chance to play their part in the development of agriculture, the future will not be as bright as it should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to take immediate action to protect the interest of members of the general public who place money on deposit with finance houses, provident societies and similar institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be appropriate if initially I read the motion in my name and the amendment in the name of the Minister so that the House is aware of the position it is considering having regard to the Government amendment.  The motion in my <Col N="2518" /> name proposes that Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to take immediate action to protect the interests of members of the general public who place money on deposit with finance houses, provident societies and similar institutions.</P>
    <P>The amendment in the name of the Minister proposes that Dáil Éireann notes that deposit taking institutions are subject to statutory regulations and that it is the intention of the Government to take such further steps as they may consider necessary to strengthen control in this area.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the motion in my name is threefold: first, to evoke a response from the Government, secondly, to raise in public debate in the Dáil, the most appropriate forum for it, issues of this nature so that not only those who may have been affected by recent developments in provident societies are safeguarded but that those who invest in the future are aware of issues and constraints that may arise and, finally, to create a reassuring climate for investors generally and to restore confidence in the investment climate, especially in what was seen as safe haven investments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government have, even in the terms of the amendment, already indicated a response in that the Minister obviously conscious of the fact that we are subject to statutory regulations in deposit taking institutions indicates that it is the intention of the Government to take such further steps as they may consider necessary to strengthen control in this area.  There is an express indication that the Minister feels it is necessary to strengthen control in this area.  There is an express indication that the Minister feels it is necessary to strengthen control and that the Government are considering further steps in this area.  On that basis, obviously, I am anxious to hear, to the extent that the Minister can at this stage, what kind of steps he has in mind to protect deposits of this type and, if necessary, to strengthen the controls under the Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>When a circumstance arises where investors in provident societies encounter problems like those which emerged <Col N="2519" /> recently in the Private Motorist's Provident Society, one must face the fact that hardships arise.  Of course one can say that people should be more aware, more cautious and should ensure in every case that their investments are not only potentially profitable but secure in every sense. I wish to make it clear that I want to avoid political implications in this matter in the interests of what I hope can be achieved here this evening.  Nonetheless, it is fair to say that there has been a trend in recent years to invest in what are called safe haven investments as distinct from investment in industry because of the unfavourable climate, not just here but for investment in industry generally and also for tax provisions.</P>
    <P>Those who are well informed can distinguish between investments in bank deposit accounts, building or provident societies.  However, for a certain type of investor who just wants to have a safe and secure return for his investment they are all of a kind.  It is probably true that the more prudent and cautious the person is the more he will concentrate on outlets of this nature without necessarily distinguishing between them.  That has been the case in examples we saw recently in relation to the PMPS.  I am not trying to wring tears from anybody but the Minister must be aware of the profile of the investor in this case.  I am told that there are approximately 9,000 depositors and we have all been approached by individuals. Like other Deputies, I have been made aware of genuine hardship cases.  I do not want to imply that people who invested elsewhere are different from those in this instance but I will give two examples of the kind of person I am speaking about.</P>
    <P>I am personally aware of a young farmer in the mountain regions of north Tipperary who has a farm of approximately 40 acres.  By the standards of that region he is very progressive and has invested £12,000 in the PMPS.  He is a young married man with three children and could not be described as anything but a prudent, hardworking young man. I am also aware of a disabled person who has three unemployed children between <Col N="2520" /> the ages of 18 and 24.  He invested the proceeds of an accident award, over £20,000, in the society.  I must ask the House and the Minister to take it on trust that these two cases have been brought to my personal attention.  I am not saying that there are not other similar cases but we owe them some response here.  I know there are difficulties for the Minister in this regard and I am also aware that the consequences of a decision in a particular case can give rise to issues in relation to other similar cases.  However, we must measure each case separately.  I am not making a case in respect of any one society but the public will be particularly aware of the circumstances relating to the PMPS as it has even been discussed on television.  Rather than leave it in that kind of limbo we should at least have an opportunity of raising the matter here.  I welcome the response from the Government even though it might be said that perhaps the Minister might have indicated, without having to await a motion from this side of the House, that he was contemplating looking at the statutory provisions already in existence and that it was his intention to take such further steps as might be necessary to strengthen controls in that area.  It would have been well if the Minister had done that without the necessity to put down this motion.  I do not want to make much of that.  He has given us that indication now.  That is important.  I will be anxious to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>
    <P>When circumstances of this nature arise, the first responsibility is the responsibility of the Government.  I am not trying to pin it on the Minister on the basis that they now have responsibility in this area, that we do not, that we can make all the promises and they have to deal with the consequences of the promises we make.  That would not be appropriate or right.  Nevertheless, the Government have responsibility for the actions they take in any case.  In relation to the PMPA company the Government took immediate action which was seen to be firm and effective.  I do not want to go into all the details, but that action secured the position of policy premium holders and ensured that the insurance industry <Col N="2521" /> was protected and vindicated.  The Government had their own reasons for that action from information which is not available to me.  Incidentally, I do not think that it is necessary that I should have that information.</P>
    <P>That action had a stabilising effect on the insurance industry generally and on policy-holders in particular.  Something similar is worthy of consideration in respect of what one might call a sister society having regard to the profile of investors generally.  It seems we are talking about small depositors.  Perhaps the two cases I mentioned are not representative in the sense that many depositors would deposit sums smaller than the figures I mentioned.  They are people who have been prudently putting aside their savings with a view to finding a secure haven for their investment.</P>
    <P>There is another factor which we must take into account.  People are being encouraged to save and invest in Irish companies.  Many people respond on that basis and those most likely to respond are members of the older generation who have prudently put aside savings and would like to be seen to continue to make a contribution to Irish companies.  The evidence is that, in most of the societies, small investors, many of them retired people, tend to look in this direction, as distinct from young investors who for one reason or another might be prepared to take a chance on the stock market and in other areas.</P>
    <P>This is not a matter which concerns the Minister immediately but, when we are talking about the investment climate generally, it is important that we should present a more reassuring front to the outside world.  There has been a considerable deal of speculation in oil shares.  In a bigger stock exchange that might not be of such considerable importance but, in a stock exchange of the size of the Dublin Stock Exchange, it tends to dominate dealings.  It does not necessarily promote the greatest degree of confidence in our stock exchange when we see such fluctuations as we have seen in recent times.</P>
    <P>We also have equities and gilts and securities of this kind.  If we have fluctuations of the kind I have mentioned on the <Col N="2522" /> stock exchange, and what appear to be collapses of the kind I have been referring to in provident societies, there is cause for a certain degree of concern.  Only the Government, through legislative action, can take the necessary corrective measures. I hoped that by raising the matter here this evening we could have endeavoured to create a healthy and secure climate for investment, particularly in the service sector of our economy.  It is becoming quite clear that it is only through investing in the service sector, in addition to the manufacturing sector, that we will be able to generate the necessary jobs and job opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be familiar with the difficulty in attracting manufacturing industry to Ireland at this point.  He will acknowledge that in other countries where they coped better with the worldwide recession than we did &mdash; and that may be due to demographic factors as much as anything else &mdash; growth in the service sector, as distinct from the manufacturing sector, has maintained a level of employment to cope with the impact of the recession.  We should be encouraging security for those who invest in that sector, in provident societies, banks and financial institutions generally.  That is why I framed the motion in terms of finance houses, provident societies and similar institutions.  The climate for investment in these societies must be healthy and in so far as the Government can ensure it, it must be seen to be as secure as any other prospect the State can offer.  Where there seems to be a risk, or hardship, or insecurity, the Government have a particular responsibility to step in and take action.</P>
    <P>There is another type of action which can be contemplated in cases of this nature, that is, legal action.  Of its nature, legal action does not solve problems.  As a lawyer I have to acknowledge it can only do what is available to it within its area of responsibility.  It can only come to a judicial conclusion and make a decision on that basis which may have consequences in terms of the investment climate which it is no function of the Judiciary to consider.  Their function is to make a decision between the parties on <Col N="2523" /> the question at issue.  It is likely that legal action is contemplated in cases of this nature.  Depending on the indication the Minister can give us this evening, I hope it may not be necessary to pursue to a legal conclusion action which may be contemplated. I am not suggesting people should not consider their legal rights.  In the event that the Government may be able to give some indication of what their proposals may be, actions which may already be under consideration might be stayed until such time as we can see the outcome of those considerations.</P>
    <P>If these figures are correct and if upwards of 9,000 small depositors are involved, we can see that in a small integrated society such as ours not only are those 9,000 small depositors immediately affected but their experience will be communicated to others who might intend to invest in what are generally perceived by that type of person as safe places for investment.  This would make them even more cautious and more reluctant and it could well be that the funds necessary to maintain and develop the programmes of provident societies, building societies and even banks, might not be as forthcoming from the public as they otherwise might be.</P>
    <P>It is important and necessary to note that people have a responsibility.  If not fully informed, people should seek the best possible advice before making investments.  I would hope that this debate and the manner in which it will be conducted will make potential investors conscious of the need to get the best possible advice when they are contemplating investing their lifesavings or the greater portion of them.  The Government of the day cannot pick up the tab in every case, no matter how unfortunate the consequences.  I would not suggest the introduction of a new principle whereby in circumstances of this nature the Government would always pick up the tab.  It is important that people should inquire very closely and should be influenced not just by the level of interest payable but also by the security, in so far as it can be ascertained, of the investment they are making.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2524" /> The fact that the Government took certain action in relation to the PMPA cannot be ignored when one looks at the situation of the PMPS.  I should like to see a strengthening of the legislation involved.  In the public mind a question is being asked: what is the difference between a policy-holder who is secured and protected and the small investor who has taken a prudent step, as he sees it, by investing in a society?  In the public mind there is not any great distinction in that both parties might have thought they were being prudent.  Where there is a connection between the insurance company and the society it can be fairly argued that action taken in respect of one suggests to the depositors in the provident society that the Government might contemplate some protection in respect of them as well.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate that I should go into details in respect of any one society and what the assets might be.  I know that the liquidator examines all the circumstances and I do not intend that the Dáil should constitute itself to be a committee of inquiry.  A committee of inspection has already been set up and has been in contact with the liquidator.  The Minister can communicate with the liquidator and find out all the information available.  He knows the extent of the liability and the prospects for the viability of this and every other society.  I suggest that before coming to a conclusion the Minister should examine all the possibilities in the greatest detail.  It may well be that there is considerably more for distribution to depositors than is being publicly suggested. It is not my business to know that information at this point but it is the Minister's business, although whether he would feel free to give that information publicly in the Dáil is another matter.</P>
    <P>If there is a need for more immediate and direct intervention by the Registrar of Provident Societies and if the legislation which regulates these societies is not as effective as it should be in ensuring such intervention at an early stage, then the Minister would have the full support of this side of the House in any action he would propose to deal with it.  With the changing climate for investment it may <Col N="2525" /> well be that legislation which seemed adequate in 1978 is not either effective or adequate in 1984.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see that the purpose of this motion is not to put the Government in the hot seat.  It has the three-fold purpose I mentioned: firstly, to evoke a response from the Government; secondly, to raise the matter in public debate here in a calm and restrained way so that people will become conscious of their own obligations; thirdly, to endeavour to assure the public that we have a healthy and safe climate for investment, particularly at a time when investment in the service sector is becoming more important.</P>
    <P>Where there are hardships of the kind I have mentioned, we have responsibility. I know the taxpayers' capacity is not unlimited to meet hardships of all kinds but the Minister will find that investors in these societies are people who need to be protected and who otherwise will suffer considerable hardship and might have to be helped through social welfare.  They are trying to be independent through saving for old age or providing a secure basis for developments taking place on their farms, in their homes and elsewhere.  I would hope for a positive and sympathetic response to our motion.  I wait to hear in greater detail what the Minister has in mind when he elaborates on the terms of his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2526" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that deposit-taking institutions are subject to statutory regulations and that it is the intention of the Government to take such further steps as it may consider necessary to strengthen control in this area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In dealing with the subject matter of this debate I propose to deal with the following subjects in order: firstly, the banks; secondly, the building societies; thirdly, the Post Office, ACC and other State guaranteed bodies; then trustee saving banks, credit unions, industrial and provident societies, financial brokers, insurance and then insurance brokers.  I will have something to say under each of those headings.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general question of deposit-taking institutions, they are required to be licensed under the Central Bank Act, 1971, unless specifically exempted from the need to hold a licence. The exempted institutions cover a broad range including the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Industrial Credit Company, the Post Office Savings Bank, the Industrial Savings Banks, building societies, the industrial and provident societies and unit trusts.  Before dealing with the exempted institutions I will mention the position under the Central Bank Act for those that are not exempted, basically the banks.  At present there are 41 licensed banks operating here.  Before being licensed, applicants for a bank licence must satisfy specific requirements laid down in the Act which require among other things (1) an adequate capital base, (2) a suitable management structure and (3) a clearly defined set of objectives. Ongoing supervision of these banks by the Central Bank is to ensure that the banks remain liquid and solvent and remain in accordance with the initial requirements for the granting of a licence.</P>
    <P>I will now move on to the exempted institutions which are not subject to the controls I have just mentioned under the Central Bank Act.  I will deal firstly with building societies.  They are incorporated and regulated under the Building Societies <Col N="2527" /> Act, 1976.  They may take deposits but in fact their principal means of raising money is by the issue of shares to their members.  However, such shares may be cashed readily in accordance with the rules of the various societies and, in fact, they are the same as deposits.  The societies lending is restricted to loans to members on the security of a mortgage. Since powers of control and supervision of building societies exist at the moment covering such matters as advertising and taking of deposits, making of loans, the prudential ratios to be maintained by the societies and the suspension of their operations, we can say that fairly good controls exist in regard to building societies.</P>
    <P>The next category are the Post Office Savings Bank, the ACC and the Industrial Credit Company.  All the deposits with those institutions are in fact State guaranteed.  The next category are the trustee savings banks.  These are long standing banking institutions dedicated to the promotion of thrift and the fostering of savings among the public.  The bulk of the savings with the trustee savings banks are in fact placed with the Exchequer and therefore they are safe.  The licensed banks and the specialised credit institutions I have just mentioned hold between them £10.3 billion and they are well regulated bodies with a record of soundness and stability.  The difficulties that have been mentioned in this debate should be seen against the context of a very large mass of well regulated bodies with whom the vast bulk of savings are deposited.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to the position of credit unions.  Credit unions, as the House is aware, perform a very valuable social function.  Apart from the application of a principle of self-help they provide money on loan to persons who stand little chance of obtaining credit from the more conventional lending sources.  Too few people realise how important is the contribution which credit unions make as a source of national savings.  The importance of credit unions can best be illustrated by the fact that in 1969 approximately £6½ million of investors' money <Col N="2528" /> was held by credit unions and by 1981 this figure had risen to £130 million.  This achievement is proof of the dedication, skill and commitment of the many people involved in the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>However, there is no point in denying that the bigger the volume of money being handled the bigger is the element of risk.  It was to this end that the scope of the powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies were extended under the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1978, with regard to credit unions to enable him to do the following things: (1) inspect the books and other documents of such bodies; (2) investigate their affairs; (3) call a special meeting of the members; (4) appoint a person as director and (5) direct the suspension of acceptance of deposits, loans or shares and of payments.  In order to assist the registrar in implementing these controls the annual returns from credit unions, which are furnished to him, are carefully examined by the registrar and certain ratios extracted from them to identify societies where problems might arise and where as a result a timely inspection of the society would be desirable.  Under the 1978 Act the first inspection of the books and records of a credit union took place in 1980.  Since then 35 credit unions in all have been inspected and follow-up action has been taken, particularly in the form of discussions and other contacts with the credit unions, to get them to put themselves in a better condition.  It is intended to carry out inspections of a further ten unions in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I now move to the difficult area in this discussion, that is concerning the Industrial and Provident Societies.  The Act governing these societies, as the House is no doubt aware, is the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893.  These societies are bodies corporate and may be formed for carrying on any industry, trade or business including dealings of any description with land.  The 1893 Act has traditionally been used for the registration of co-operative enterprises and has nothing to do with the banking sector; but in the absence of any specified co-operative criteria in the Act, societies <Col N="2529" /> which could not in any respect be regarded as genuine co-operatives have in fact been registered under this legislation from time to time.  Industrial and Provident Societies were, for reasons which one would need to go back to the time in question to determine, exempted from the provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1971.  It indeed continued to be legitimate for people to use the industrial and provident societies legislation to carry on a banking business.</P>
    <P>The only specific controls that exist in regard to this in the 1893 Act in relation to the banking operations of a society were that a society could not (1) have a withdrawable share capital and (2) had to display a very limited form of financial statement in their registered office twice a year.  Such meagre requirements, when compared with the very stringent controls which I have just indicated are exercised by the Central Bank and also under other legislation such as that applying to building societies and credit unions, one would have to regard as not being very adequate. The reason for the exclusion of these societies from the 1971 Act was that it was desired not to interfere with the traditional acceptance by some agricultural co-operatives at the time of deposits from their members.  Often the problem of inadequate capital resources in these co-operatives was alleviated in part by the acceptance of deposits from members. In any event, deposit-taking activities generally constituted a relatively unsubstantial part of the business of the co-operatives.</P>
    <P>It has to be admitted that the exemption of the societies from the requirements of the Central Bank Act of 1971 provided the opportunists with a chance to ride a coach-and-four through the controls applicable to the normal banking sector.  It led to the registration of societies whose principal business was the acceptance of deposits and the making of loans.  Such a situation, whereby the public could deposit their money with societies and not enjoy normal adequate safeguards for their investments was totally unacceptable and could not be allowed to continue.  There was concern also about the solvency of some of the societies; <Col N="2530" /> though some showed book net assets they had made inadequate provision for bad debts.</P>
    <P>To rectify that situation, the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1978, was enacted in November of that year.  The problem which I have outlined was tackled in two ways by the 1978 legislation.  First, the possibility of any new societies being formed to carry out banking business was eliminated &mdash; it dealt with the problem of those in existence before 1978.  Number two, existing deposit-taking institutions under the Act were given a period of five years during which they had to exercise one of the following three options: one, to attempt to meet normal banking criteria and qualify for a banking licence under the Central Bank Act &mdash; in other words, they would have to go back and meet all the requirements I outlined earlier; two, to re-finance their deposits by other funds, for example, bank loans; or three, to wind down their deposits by disposing of assets.</P>
    <P>A number of societies opted for number one, to become normal banks, but none of them was able to satisfy the registrar or the Central Bank that they could meet normal banking criteria in a reasonable time.  Accordingly, no society was granted permission to advertise for deposits.  Therefore, it has been illegal for any deposit-taking industrial and provident society to advertise for deposits since November 1978 when the Act came into force.  A small number of infringements occurred and were dealt with by the registrar in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The remaining two options open to the societies were to re-finance their deposits out of other funds or to wind down their deposits in a period of five years. Obviously, the ability of any society to avail of these options in an orderly manner depended to a considerable extent on the quality of management and on the society's overall financial position.</P>
    <P>In this respect it will be recalled that at the time of the passing of the 1978 Act real fears were expressed concerning the management and solvency of some of those societies.  Unfortunately, these fears have proved to have been fully justified <Col N="2531" /> in a number of cases.  Of a total of 16 societies, six have been the subject of various court orders; four are in liquidation, one being at present in provisional liquidation; one is in receivership; and one is the subject of a direction by the registrar under section 16 of the Act.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the difficulties of these societies vary according to individual societies.  They include managerial weakness and in one case fraudulent conduct by a promoter who is at present serving a term of imprisonment in the UK.  It is difficult to estimate the likely level of deposit losses.  In the kind of circumstances which have arisen in some societies it will be appreciated that the task of the supervisory authority is particularly difficult. I do not doubt that the registrar and his staff carried out their difficult assignment as well as they could but the reality of the assignment must be understood clearly.</P>
    <P>Obviously, they were dealing with a number of situations which at the end of the day left liquidation as the only real option.  Naturally, that option would be contemplated only when all other means had been exhausted.  Throughout most of the five-year period, the Act itself, and this is important, was being challenged in the courts on constitutional grounds by certain societies.  It may well be asked whether such action was intended, at least in part, to achieve maximum delay in the implementation of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy more details on that.  Warnings were issued to the public about the dangers of investing in industrial and provident societies.  Of course, it was debated in 1978 when Deputy O'Malley introduced the legislation.  Therefore, it can be said that people were warned and were put on notice, particularly since November 1978, of the dangers of investing in those societies &mdash; I am quite sure they were warned before then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitutionality of the 1978 Act <Col N="2532" /> was challenged promptly in the courts.  In 1981 Miss Justice Carroll found in the Minister's favour &mdash; the Minister had defended the Act in the High Court.  That decision was appealed to the Supreme Court and in May 1983 the Supreme Court upheld the High Court decision. When the Supreme Court gave their decision they quoted the following extract from the earlier High Court judgment:</P>
    <P>Miss Justice Carroll had also concluded that the reason for the prohibition in the 1978 Act was because the societies were operating a substantial banking business outside the control of the Central Bank without regard for the principles of sound banking practice and the general public who placed money on deposit with them was at risk.</P>
    <P>A very clear warning from a High Court judge in regard to depositing with such societies was issued.  That statement by Miss Justice Carroll received widespread publicity in the media in May 1983.</P>
    <P>It will be acknowledged that a problem in relation to deposit-taking provident societies was identified and appropriate action was taken by the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, in 1978.  It consisted principally of a mopping-up operation, because at the time the action was taken a prohibition had been inserted in the Act that no new industrial and provident society could be established.  The unfortunate closures that have taken place in recent times were therefore not the result of any new development but the outcome of a rot that had commenced many years previously. That rot was identified and action was taken by the Government as far back as 1978.</P>
    <P>This is important in putting the whole discussion in its proper context.  It is not something which has suddenly burst on us anew.  I spent a lot more time on the industrial and provident society than the relative importance of these societies in the total financial sector would justify. The amount of money involved is relatively small by comparison with the total amount on deposit in the Irish financial system.  It is important that the House <Col N="2533" /> and those who reflect on what is transacted in the House realise that we are talking about a very small part of the total financial system on which timely action was taken by the official agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I realise that many people have sustained losses in the recent collapses.  It is a natural reaction for us as public representatives to seek help for these people.  However, the Government must take a broader view.  The funds are not available to the Exchequer in the present climate to underwrite all these societies.  Even if they were, there are substantial arguments of principle as to why the State should not guarantee the safety of investors.  I note that Deputy O'Kennedy did not urge such a course on the Government.  The fact that those principles were set aside in 1977 regarding the Irish Trust Bank does not invalidate them.  The reality is that people who invest in their institutions do so in response to the lure of higher returns on their investments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally the higher the return the higher the risk.  People should not be cushioned from the need to be careful about their investments. Deposit-taking institutions must not be allowed to evade the standards of common prudence expected of them.  To have compensated depositors in failed institutions who had already taken a relatively high return would be unfair to the mass of careful savers who were more selective in where they put their money and to the financial institutions who had acted with greater care than had been displayed by the institutions which found themselves in difficulty.</P>

      <P>It would be inappropriate that deposits in certain institutions, deliberately set up in the seventies to evade the Central Bank regulations, should now be compensated.  While the record of regulated institutions is good it is appropriate that the situation should be kept under review and any weaknesses that appear tightened up.</P>
      <P>The legislation concerning licensed banks, which I referred to, is governed by the provisions of the Central Bank Act.  This is being reviewed at present by the Minister for Finance.  The matters receiving attention in this context are the various ways in which funds may be raised from the public.  Certain fringe institutions other than those legally entitled to do so, raise money for various purposes and thus largely escape official regulation.  They may, for example, be providing brokerage services for insurance, financial or property investments of one kind or another.  If such bodies take deposits they are acting illegally but the nature of their fund-raising activity is not always easy to establish by law.  It is not always easy to establish that they are actually deposit-takers.  This area is being looked at to see if further legislative action is needed.  It is necessary to ensure that any action will not interfere with the legitimate raising of capital by normal business enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already mentioned the question of insurance intermediaries or brokers. In so far as there have been closures of insurance intermediaries in the past year and in so far as the loss of funds has been connected with some of these closures, I consider it appropriate that I should also <Col N="2535" /> deal with them.  Arising from the recommendations on insurance intermediaries in the final report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Insurance Industry in 1976 my Department received representations and submissions over the past few years arguing for the regulation or registration of insurance brokers and intermediaries. In the main these requests have been put forward by insurance brokers and their representative bodies.  In examining these proposals the basic criteria must be whether they would provide effective protection to the public and ensure they do not act to enhance the status and protect the business position of existing brokers.  It is not clear so far that the proposals put forward would achieve the desired balance in this regard.  The matter continues to be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A slight change of attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>To the extent that the State enforces strict control over insurance companies as such, requiring them to be authorised and to have adequate reserves to meet liabilities and adequate financial strength to maintain solvency, the prospective policy-holder, whether dealing directly with the insurer or via the broker, benefits from the protection which is given in respect of the insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was concern that some regulation of brokers as such was called for. The vast majority of insurance brokers run their business with the highest integrity. The aim of any regulations which might be contemplated would be to ensure that they all do.  Sums of money reported to have been at risk in the recent collapses of such insurance brokers are minimal in relation to the total amount invested in the insurance market.  I say this in order to put the matter into perspective. I have asked the Department to re-examine the issue of the regulation or supervision of insurance brokers and to put proposals before me which would provide some effective means of protecting the public.  Public regulations can usually only provide the background for <Col N="2536" /> protecting the public in these situations. It cannot substitute for the use by individuals of their own common sense and acumen in dealing with those with whom they do business.  If one is thinking of investing a large sum of money in a life insurance policy, one should only deal with a reputable broker.  If in doubt one should check with one of the broking bodies.  Where possible, one should make out a cheque for the premium to the insurance company.  If there is any doubt about the status of the insurance company one should check with the Department. Copies of the policy documents should be obtained.  One should read them carefully and not sign them before having read them.  Any moves I make in consequence of this review in regard to insurance intermediaries would require legislative backing and would come before the House for discussion.  I am satisfied that the regulations in the area of deposit-taking institutions has proved to be effective.  Losses incurred are obviously regretted.  However, without wishing in any way to belittle anyone's personal losses, these should be reviewed against the vast size of funds in this sector when endeavouring to guage the overall effectiveness of the controls.  There is always a need to keep this area under review.  I welcome this debate on the subject and I hope that the suggestions put forward will enable us to strengthen the legislation where necessary and that the publicity given to the issue will encourage continued and increased improvements for people investing their money so that they will take whatever steps they can, by way of prudent inquiry and so on, to safeguard their investments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the Minister's contribution to this Private Members' Bill. It is only fair to say that when dealing as legislators with financial institutions we must be extremely careful lest anything we might say or do would in any way promote a lack of confidence in areas that may be in genuine need of a boost in terms of confidence. However, all financial institutions should have our constant vigilance <Col N="2537" /> so as to ensure that they are kept on the right track and that they make adequate provision under the various Acts to provide for their depositors or for any other financial commitment that may be incurred.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has outlined, the financial operations within any country are very wide-ranging.  The commercial and industrial banks deal with the vast proportion of the moneys in circulation in any economy.  Therefore, it is right and proper that at all times we should take into account the degree to which our banking institutions are complying with the 1971 Central Bank Act.  It is right and proper, too, that we should encourage confidence in their transactions and in their stability.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that he acknowledges the need for legislators to ensure such vigilance, thereby encouraging the financial institutions to comply with the provisions of the legislation and to operate at a level which is safe and which is in the best interest of the public generally as well as of the customers of the institutions.  We must look on an on-going basis at the existing structures and ask ourselves if there is evidence that any of the transactions that have taken place between the financial institutions and the public have in any way promoted a lack of confidence in the ability of the institutions to continue on a viable and stable basis.  We would be foolish to turn a blind eye to operations which might not be in the best interest of the public or to ignore the possibility of there emerging financial institutions in a competitive financial market operating in a manner which could eventually cause their downfall and cause injury to the public.  Therefore, irrespective of the type of category of the financial institution concerned or of its size or of the quality or composition of its depositors, it is essential that we make no apology about examining, on an ongoing basis, the viability of the financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important also that we examine the methods by which we promote public awareness as to the degree of stability or otherwise that exists in our financial institutions. We must not take for granted <Col N="2538" /> that the public generally have available to them the facilities to enable them to assess the stability of any institution because such operations are very complex. In general the ordinary potential investor does not know how to seek out the kind of information he would need to have before entrusting his money to these institutions, and that is why we must accept the need to keep under constant scrutiny the whole range of operations of these institutions.  We must be seen to be endeavouring at all times, by way of Acts of the Oireachtas and of ministerial statements and discussion here to inculcate prudence in investors.  I am glad the Minister has accepted this need.</P>
    <P>A number of factors have made our task much more difficult and one of these is related to the attempts on the part of an increasing number of people to establish financial-type institutions or to expand the level of operations of existing institutions of different sizes.  This sort of situation creates great difficulty for the ordinary depositor or potential investor. It can create a good deal of confusion and can lead to prompt decisions which a prudent person would not make otherwise. Therefore, we may have to break through the complexity of the system. We have a duty to promote savings so that projects throughout the country can be financed and to that extent also we have a duty to simplify the operations for potential investors and to direct them as objectively and as constructively as possible into making investment decisions which are safe and which are in their best interest as well as in the best interest of the country.  That is a very fine balance to achieve and one that presents a difficulty for any Government.</P>
    <P>In the past few years we have witnessed difficulties which arose out of the level of operations of some small financial institutions which the Minister has told us do not come within the scope of the Central Bank Act of 1971.  Because there are institutions which do not come within an Act which by and large is regarded both domestically and internationally as being very effective, we must be increasingly vigilant.  As one of the Deputies on this side has said already, because a certain <Col N="2539" /> financial institution or a certain category of financial institution represents, first, a small amount of finance in terms of the total finances in circulation in the economy or because it represents a small group when all the different units of that category are taken together, I do not think that that should be used in any way as an argument for us to say that we do not need to give to that area the same attention as we should give to other areas.  It is of the utmost importance that we here should be seen to be promoting those very people who are the minority in such cases.  I refer to the industrial and provident societies.  I accept that the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1978, the historical background to which has been given comprehensively by the Minister, was a determined and an effective attempt to deal with the matter given the circumstances of that time.  It dealt unequivocally with what was regarded as a loophole in the Finance Acts which enabled small financial institutions to grow at a rate and to a level that was not in their best long-term interest.  The Minister gave figures of the breakdown of the 16 societies.  I am not sure if the institutions mentioned as subject to court procedures or to liquidation can be attributed directly to levels of operations outside their scope, levels that were never envisaged as feasible or practical for institutions in their category, but I suspect there is a direct correlation. If I am correct, it proves we must keep a close eye on the operations of financial organisations irrespective of size.  We heard that four institutions went into liquidation, that one is in receivership and one is under scrutiny.  It is sad that the history of the 16 institutions is not a good one and if we can say that from the point of view of legislators, then certainly it is not a happy one for the many thousands of depositors throughout the country and outside the country.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one of those institutions that recently was in some difficulty, namely, the PMPS.  While I would not presume at this stage to go into great detail as to what could or should have been done for unsecured creditors, <Col N="2540" /> nevertheless, I must explore this area to some extent and do so against the background of the Insurance Bill, 1983, that was introduced by the Minister's predecessor on 19 October 1983.  I wish to refer to a principle enshrined in that Bill that we have a duty to look at and see if it has application in any other area.</P>
    <P>The banks as financial institutions are subject to strict controls and on-going scrutiny by the Central Bank.  By and large they have performed effectively and well.  However, we must look at the growth of other institutions such as the one that came to grief recently and see how they have expanded to levels outside the framework set up to enable them to operate legally.  The Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1978, was brought in with specific functions to control the level of such institutions and it gave them three options.</P>
    <P>The first option was not successfully followed and, by and large, the third option was the one that had to apply. However, we find there was extreme difficulty in the application of that Act and this was for a number of reasons.  Perhaps one of the reasons was that the level of operations was so great in the case of some of these institutions that it was not possible for them on the best advice available to wind down within the moratorium. I am not suggesting that they should not have wound down: on the contrary, I concur unequivocally with the view that having been given the moratorium of five years they should have complied with it.  It is regrettable that despite the best publicity at the time and the public warnings that were given depositors were caught.  To put it in layman's terms, their fingers were badly burnt. That was very sad.</P>
    <P>I have listened to an outline of the position from some of those depositors and I have been sympathetic.  It is very easy for us and for the financial analyst to say that a depositor sniffs out the best deal but when one comes across people who have invested their life savings in an institution and who find themselves on the eve of retirement almost penniless it is not easy or simple to say to them that <Col N="2541" /> they made their choice and they must take their chance.  We have to look a little deeper.</P>
    <P>I am not for a moment suggesting that we look to the public purse.  In the light of our financial and economic circumstances I would be one of the last to recommend that the public should pick up the tab.  I do not agree that should be the case, particularly given the type of operation we are dealing with and its relative insignificance in terms of the overall financial scene.  Nevertheless, there is a need to look at the legislative framework that is being reactivated with regard to other institutions and see if there is any scope for us to bring in amendments to give some kind of security to unsecured depositors in financial institutions.  This is particularly so in the case of financial institutions that do not fall within the scope of a definite and specific banking Act.</P>
    <P>I concede that when the 1978 Act was introduced it was to deal with operations that were banking operations to all intents and purposes but were not acting legally as banking institutions.  They did not have the mandate by way of legislation to operate as banking institutions but their level of operations put them into that category.  The 1978 Act was an effective measure to put right those problems but because of certain factors, some of which I have referred to, it was not successful in all cases.  The best of Acts need to be revised and updated with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>I wish to look at a principle inherent in the Insurance Bill, 1983, and to tease out some of the implications therein.  I wish to quote from a speech made by the then Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Cluskey, when moving Second Stage of the Bill on 19 October 1983.  He stated:</P>
    <P>The House will recall at the time of the Equitable episode the view was accepted that, while arrangements should be made to compensate people who had claims for injuries or damage to property, those who had simply paid premiums and were going to be out of pocket only in respect of the unexpired <Col N="2542" /> period covered by the premium, could be left to fend for themselves.  With the greatly increased cost of insurance, I feel that a different view ought now to prevail on this question and that people who have paid premiums should, in the case of a company being wound up, be entitled to present claims in respect of the unexpired period of their policies just the same as other claimants on the Compensation Fund.  That principle is now enshrined in this Bill.</P>
    <P>That principle is that unsecured creditors in insurance companies are getting a degree of cover not out of the public purse but by way of reactivation of legislative machinery and amendment. Rather than putting a freeze on the operations of a company for a fortnight or a month to enable people getting insurance cover to transfer to other companies &mdash; with the inherent difficulties, inconvenience and reluctance of other insurance companies to accept them &mdash; the principle is that they continue to receive cover for their vehicles until the expiry date. That practice will continue on an indefinite basis under an administrator.  Part of that principle is to ensure that those who could be left to fend for themselves in terms of the unexpired period covered by their premium would now be covered, in other words, there would be no financial loss accruing to those people.  I realise the second part of my deliberations could be challenged as an over-simplification, but nevertheless it is one of the implications in that principle.</P>
    <P>When we take numerous categories of people affected by, for example the PMPS, or four of those societies which went into liquidation, or six companies which are subject to court proceedings and another under scrutiny, and when we take the instability that seems to pertain to that sector of financial institutions, it can be realised that we have a duty to look into the legislative structures to see if we can put forward amendments that will give some degree of security to unsecured creditors.  As I said, I am not aware if this machinery is in existence or how easy or difficult it would be to enact this legislative machinery, but I am putting it <Col N="2543" /> to the Minister that we need to look urgently at the potential for enactment in the absence of machinery, or at the potential for amendment if there is machinery there which needs updating and amending.</P>
    <P>There is a question of equity involved here and the Minister should accept that. I accept what he said about the problems for the public purse, but there is a guarantee for unsecured creditors in one sector by virtue of legislation and I suggest that the Minister look at the possibility of a guarantee for other sectors, and the sector we are dealing with this evening warrants attention from him.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with warnings to the public of challenges to various Acts and techniques and methods legislators use to make the public more aware. It is easy for us to theorise or postulate as to what could, should or might be and what we as legislators have done to warn people or advise them.  We are dealing with human beings, and irrespective of the quality or size of their investment we have to do everything to promote prudence on their part.  If they are imprudent we have to ask ourselves if we have fallen down in some area.  In the case of the PMPS, many people were reaching retirement age and had invested their funds, transferred funds in some cases, to this wholly-owned Irish institution. They may have been inspired by a sense of patriotism because many of these people are anxious to promote anything that is wholly Irish owned.  There are many people who, fired by a spirit of patriotism or nationalism, would like to promote or assist in the development of wholly-owned Irish institutions.  From speaking with a number of people I am convinced that those who decided to transfer funds from more stable and reputable institutions to the PMPS were motivated by this spirit of nationalism. We cannot be seen to be discouraging this in any way.  On the contrary, we need to give encouragement to that very commendable attitude.  We need to ask ourselves if all our public pronouncements, ministerial statements, which are essential, and our laws, are sometimes passing <Col N="2544" /> over the heads of the ordinary punter.</P>
    <P>There is another dimension to this.  I understand a substantial number of the 9,000 depositors in the PMPS lived outside this country, some as far away as Australia, New Zealand, the United States, South America and Europe. Although these people might have received advice from home from time to time, they may not have been <i>au fait</i> with the ministerial directives, Acts of the Oireachtas and public warnings regarding the viability or otherwise of financial institutions and investing in them.  Many of these people invested in this institution and I have evidence of three people who invested all their funds with the intention of retiring to Ireland in the next two or three years.  Their dreams have been shattered.  That is very sad.  We have a duty to provide a degree of security for such investors which does not at present exist.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the way in which provident societies are administered.  I do not want to be seen as casting aspersions on the Registrar of Friendly Societies. Due to the complexities that have grown into the system, perhaps he did a reasonably good and effective job, but when one considers that his visits to that company were as regular as quarterly &mdash; I think he is obliged to make quarterly visits of inspection to these provident societies &mdash; one comes to the conclusion that his powers were not great enough. Perhaps there was some machinery inhibiting him from carrying out his job as effectively as he might or should have done.  In itself perhaps that contributed to this unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>I would request the Minister to examine this whole area of control or power vested in the Registrar of Friendly Societies ensuring that, if necessary, it is updated with the greatest possible speed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the principle inherent in Deputy O'Kennedy's motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of raising this question in the House, the appropriate place to do so, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for having allowed me.</P>
      <P>To the extent that we can undo the damage done to the Nenagh area, the prospects for employment in that and in the north Tipperary region in general, that is my sole purpose in raising this issue here.  Most of what I have to say will relate to the actions to be taken to recompense Nenagh and north Tipperary for the unfortunate circumstances which gave rise to the cancellation of the Elfab Electronics Components Industry which, by decision, was to have been located in Nenagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give the background to the situation in that area.  For some time with the prospective closure of Mogul Mines, which has since closed, it was the preoccupation of all of us from Nenagh &mdash; the town in which I was born and reared and one that has been very kind to me in my 19 years in public life &mdash; that the closure of Mogul Mines would give rise to major redundancies and that a number of skilled and semi-skilled people would come on the market.  We are talking of the order of 500 people.  For that reason it was always promoted as an area of priority for industrial development in order to accommodate those who would become redundant in that event and who have since become redundant.  I might say that during my term as chairman of the urban council, in conjunction with the development authority for north Tipperary, the county development team, we made proposals.  I am glad to say that the two major estates, the one in question here, Lisboney Estate, and the Gortland Roe Industrial Estate, which is located right behind my own house, were planned and developed by us at that time. As chairman of the urban council I took the view that if we were to attract industry to Nenagh always we should match our <Col N="2546" /> words with actions and that an industrial estate should perhaps be located in one of the most attractive areas.  Both of these estates were regarded as attractive. Despite whatever criticism I have to make of statutory bodies the industrial estates, particularly that at Gortland Roe has, if anything, enhanced the residential character of the area.  Without sounding holier than thou I might commend that approach to all public representatives. The fact is that industrial estates properly planned, with proper amenity facilities, can add to the attractiveness of an area.</P>
    <P>I might make one other preliminary point.  Over the last few days since I first became aware of this situation &mdash; I suppose it is understandable that, as a member of the Opposition I did not become aware of it as soon as the Minister or other Government Deputies, but last Thursday I did become aware of it &mdash; I issued what I hoped was a responsible statement to various newspapers.  In the event the statement I issued did not appear in any newspaper, though a statement of my townsman here appeared at great length in one of the newspapers to whom I have given a considerable statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question might well be posed: did I not have the concern for my own place, the place I was born and reared, that my colleague and townsman had?  I want to put on the record that indeed I had but I couched my remarks in terms that were concerned more with the future than the past. Despite the fact that RTE could see fit to give me only 30 seconds this morning when this issue was being discussed, I shall try to arrange to allow my townsman here, Deputy Ryan and, if possible, Deputy Molony who represents north Tipperary as well, a little more than the 30 seconds RTE saw fit to make available to me this morning.  This is a matter that concerns all of us and this is the appropriate place to raise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I talk about attracting other industry to Nenagh or north Tipperary may I stress that nothing I say here should <Col N="2547" /> take from the impact of the native, indigenous industry in that place.  The contribution of native industry &mdash; and I do not propose to mention them by name: they would not expect it &mdash; is the greatest guarantee any of us has that we will have secure and permanent employment there.  In talking about attracting foreign investment to our country I want to make it clear, particularly in so far as Nenagh and north Tipperary are concerned, it is the indigenous industry that must be respected as making the most secure contribution to the employment prospects of the place, and that is certainly true of my own town.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to make is that in relation to this town particularly, we have a work force second to none.  Nenagh has a fine industrial relations record and the educated, skilled and trained work force available is among the best available anywhere in the country. It is for that reason that this unfortunate event has been of particular concern in that, in so far as a decision was taken, I am quite sure it was taken on the basis of locating in Nenagh originally, on the strength of the skills of the people in the place, the work force and educational facilities available there, also the social and recreational amenities in and around the area from the Shannon to the hills.  I recall in particular when we were opening some of the factories there taking their promoters on a tour of the region when they suggested that I had been, if anything, a little too modest in selling the place because it was much more attractive than they had ever expected.  That is the place that has been seriously damaged by the unfortunate circumstances that developed in the last few weeks but which came to light last week only.</P>
    <P>In order to undo the damage &mdash; and it can be undone &mdash; two or three things are required.  First of all there should be an independent investigation &mdash; and I understand the SFADCo intend doing this &mdash; into the circumstances which gave rise to the cancellation of the location of this industry.  Secondly, there should be an independent investigation into the responsibility for the events that occurred <Col N="2548" /> giving rise to the cancellation.  It appears that SFADCo had responsibility for the construction, maintenance and supervision of factory plants in the area, as agents of the IDA, in particular for this factory plant located at Lisboney, Nenagh, where there is already an existing rural industry.  I might modestly say that the industries that have been attracted to Nenagh happened to come within the term of office of the Fianna Fáil administration, something of which we are rather modestly proud.  That is why it is regrettable that the other one that was coming to this area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do the best I can within that time.  SFADCo have responsibility for physical planning, construction and supervision.  The first question which must be asked, and I am sure the Minister would like to deal with the matter, is how it happened that a factory which was built at considerable cost on a site which had been developed also at considerable cost should be flooded on a crucial occasion, that of the visit of the promoters of the factory.  I should have thought that responsibility for inspecting public property, if no more, would have required regular supervision, which would oblige the authorities of the State to ensure constant inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time that it has been flooded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but it happened to be flooded, unless I am <Col N="2549" /> told something different by the Minister, on a rather crucial date when the promoter or his representatives were going into the factory.  Action might have been taken to ensure that whatever short-term remedial action was required would be taken to guarantee against the loss of the factory to Nenagh.  Secondly, in so far as remedial work is required, there is another matter.  This industry is located on the Lisbunny estate on the Dublin side of the town, adjacent to the river.  There is an embankment between it and the river.  I think there were two recent occasions on which it was flooded &mdash; the Minister would probably be aware of that.  It was also flooded once before, as Deputy Ryan is hinting.  In the Shannon Industrial Estate which is below the level of the Shannon river, an adequate embankment has been provided and adequate pumping facilities, the technological sophistication of which I do not know. However, I know that it has been such as to guarantee against flooding of that site, which has never been flooded.  It should have been possible, indeed it is essential, that the planning and construction of the Nenagh site could guarantee likewise.  In so far as it has not so guaranteed at the moment, it is essential now that the necessary works be undertaken to ensure that, with the shortest possible delay, this industrial estate which in every other respect is a very attractive location adjacent to a main arterial road will be made waterproof in every sense of the word, foolproof against unfortunate events of the kind which has just occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of absolute urgency to undo the damage which has been done to Nenagh and the area, but I am quite sure that the damage can be undone.  Any promoter coming to any part of North Tipperary would be attracted by the circumstances which I have mentioned, the work force and the excellent industrial relations record which is second to none. There is no point in crying over spilt milk. The promoter has gone to Limerick.  His intention was to purchase the Nenagh factory as a measure of his real, permanent interest in the area.  There is no point in begrudging Raheen estate in Limerick their good fortune because of <Col N="2550" /> what has happened in these unfortunate circumstances, but the work force of Nenagh deserve better.  The young people there, many of whom were being interviewed for employment in this very factory, deserve better and the taxpayers deserve better in that public property which has been funded by them should be adequately supervised and protected.</P>
    <P>The Minister present in the House and his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan, from Limerick, announced perhaps two weeks ago the location of the factory in Limerick.  In making that announcement they made no reference, as far as I can read, to the circumstances which brought about the transfer of the location from Nenagh to Limerick.  I believe that they should have done so.  There was no point at that stage in trying to gloss over what had happened, or conceal the facts.  It should have been indicated that in view of the circumstances it was necessary to transfer what was proposed and definitely decided for this estate in Nenagh to Raheen Industrial Estate.  However, that is probably not a matter of great consequence.</P>
    <P>I am going to allow my colleagues a little more time than RTE allowed me this morning.  It is now a matter of urgency with the Minister, the IDA and SFADCo to ensure that this industrial estate, Nenagh in particular and North Tipperary in general &mdash; Thurles, Roscrea and Templemore &mdash; be given top priority. I regret that if this factory could not be located in Nenagh it was not transferred to one of these places.  I am quite sure that my colleagues will join with me in this.</P>
    <P>We are speaking about one of the most attractive locations for investment in the country, with one of the best work forces and with educational and social facilities second to none.  It is regrettable that it has become, to a certain extent, a matter almost of amazement in the public mind that this could have happened and that Nenagh might be regarded in their minds as a place which somehow or other is not suitable.  It is most suitable.  I hope that very soon the Minister will be able to announce something at least as effective <Col N="2551" /> to replace this lost industry.  I yield to my two friends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  As Deputy O'Kennedy, my fellow townsman, has indicated, I put my case fairly substantially to the media and indicated my shock and that of the people in Nenagh and its environs at the decision of the American firm of Elfab not to locate their industry at the Lisbunny Industrial Estate.  I must compliment our county development team for the work which they have put in during the last 12 months.  I wish to impress on the Minister the urgency of a replacement industry to compensate for the substantial loss of 600 jobs which occurred when the Mogul mines closed in June 1982.  The county development team, the IDA and SFADCo have all been working together as a team to ensure that every effort is made to have a sizeable industry located there, to offset this terrible loss of jobs and of something in the nature of £5 million per year to the economy of the general Nenagh area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in contact already with the Minister's office.  We had a special meeting last night of the urban council which <Col N="2552" /> was held in a very responsible manner, with no recriminations against anybody. We appreciate that what has been has been.  In an effort to offset the tremendous loss to the Nenagh area we are asking, firstly, that the Minister carry out a full-scale inquiry into the reasons for this event.  I am only a layman and I have seen the site but I shall give no indication of what I think about it.  Let the consultants who have the knowledge inspect the area and report back to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister now for an even greater commitment but I compliment him on the efforts he has made.  I have made many representations to him in the last 12 months and I acknowledge his interest in promoting industry in the Nenagh area.  I ask him to ensure that everything possible is done in the immediate future and that a deputation from the Nenagh Urban Council and the county development team be invited to meet him as soon as possible, with a view to erasing this blemish which has unfortunately been put on our town.</P>
    <P>This happened through no fault of anybody.  It was a unique occurrence. The American representative saw the situation and walked away, but that is the right of any entrepreneur.  We did the best we could to try to convince him, but unfortunately he left Nenagh.  We are saddened by this loss but look forward to the Minister doing all that he can to assist us.</P>

      <P>I wish to express regret over this unfortunate event.  I also regret some of the publicity which this matter has received.  I believe that some of the publicity has done more to damage the prospects of getting industry into this estate in Nenagh than the incident which <Col N="2553" /> occurred.  It seems apparent, from initial inquiries and investigations, that this flood was essentially a freak and that it was most unlikely it could have been anticipated at any stage in the design of the plant.  That being the case, there is every danger that the sort of publicity we have seen will have the effect of blackening that factory and I regret that that has happened.</P>

I am quite satisfied that the Minister will carry out whatever investigations are necessary to confirm what happened and, if there was a question of negligence, it can be dealt with.  We know that the IDA and the county development team of which I am proud to be a member have worked very hard to get an industry like this to Nenagh.  They did manage to attract it, so it is quite clear what the interests of the IDA are and those of the county development team.  I want to stress that everything that can be said has been said decently by the townspeople of Nenagh. It is a most attractive location for this type of industry.  We should stress that, forget about what has happened and let a proper inquiry take place.  I understand from contacts I have had with SFADCo and the IDA that plans are already in train to put in the extra embankment needed to give a guarantee to any new industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned at the circumstances which led to this decision by the Elfab Corporation.  Immediately I learned of the flooding I ordered that an inquiry should be carried out by my Department and all the agencies concerned.  I can well appreciate the disappointment felt by the people of Nenagh as expressed by their three Dáil representatives, particularly against the background of the substantial job losses which occurred recently with the closure of Mogul Mines.</P>
      <P>I intend to meet the chairman of SFADCo on Friday to convey my concern about the matter and also my concern that everything should be done to attract an alternative industry to Nenagh. However, I am pleased that it was possible, notwithstanding these unfortunate circumstances, to keep this industry in Ireland.  It could easily have gone to another country and we were very fortunate to find another suitable site within the same general region although not as near to Nenagh as I am sure its representatives would wish.</P>
      <P>I should like to outline some of the facts regarding the situation.  The site in question for an advance factory was originally identified as being on a suitable industrial site by officials of Tipperary (North Riding) County Council and Shannon Development.  On receipt from its consultants of a satisfactory report on the suitability of the site for industrial development, SFADCo purchased the 69-acre site for £149,000 in 1976.  They engaged architects and consultant engineers for the construction of a 24,000 foot square factory which was commissioned by the IDA as part of their advance factory programme.  As has been indicated, there are already a number of other factories on this site and they were not affected by the flooding.  Plans and specifications for the factory were drawn up by the consultants in accordance with normal practices having taken into account all available information from both public and private sources on the water levels of the small river which runs along one side of the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The factory was completed in September <Col N="2555" /> 1983 at a cost of £23.54 per square foot, a total cost of £564,000.  The Elfab project was subsequently secured by the IDA which had vigorously promoted the factory.  On 30 January 1984 there was flooding at the factory because of a day of heavy rain and thawing snow and ice on the surrounding hills which improved the environment from one point of view but also led to flash flooding.  The flood was discovered by Elfab's architects and engineering consultants who were carrying out a survey in the factory.  They informed the IDA who, in turn, informed SFADCo.  Elfab had intended visiting the factory site the following week.  In the meantime, the IDA devised a temporary drainage system designed to ensure that the factory was in order before representatives of the company visited it as planned.  However, even with the promise of a permanent solution to the flooding problem, which would have taken until about June to complete, the company felt that they could not continue with their intention to locate at that factory. In addition, they had fears in regard to the availability of the site for effluent treatment in view of what had happened.</P>
    <P>Strenuous efforts were made to get the company to remain in Nenagh.  SFADCo offered to build them another factory on higher ground in the estate and to give them existing factory space, rent free, awaiting that event.  This was not acceptable as it would have involved a delay in production start of 18 months.  The IDA arranged for representatives of the company to visit other available factories in north Tipperary, including Thurles and Roscrea.  These sites were not considered suitable by the company because the Irish premises were to be their European <Col N="2556" /> headquarters and they would have been too small.  The only alternative was a 32,000 sq. foot SFADCo factory at the Raheen Industrial Estate in Limerick.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate my regret and that of the Government at the loss of this valuable and much needed industry.  I concur with what Deputy Molony said about publicity and that is the answer to Deputy O'Kennedy's point about the announcement of the factory in Limerick.  I do not believe that publicity is necessarily of assistance in this matter although I acknowledge the need for an inquiry.  In fact, I had initiated an inquiry long before there was any publicity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making was that it would have been better if it had come from the Minister rather than being leaked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an arguable point.  I am concerned that this is not the first time this site was flooded and I intend to ensure that this is taken into account in the detailed inquiries which I have set in train.  I acknowledge the interest shown by all the public representatives in the area in securing an industry for the site.  I hope we will be successful in securing alternative industry for Nenagh in the reasonably near future but we must recognise that we are working in a very difficult industrial environment and it is not easy to take projects off the shelf. That makes this event all the more regrettable.  However, as I have said, I am initiating an inquiry and it would be wrong to draw any conclusions until it is completed.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 February 1984.</P>

      <P>The estimated total cost to the Exchequer of public service pensions increases effective in 1983 was £5,429,000.  Of this sum, £1,950,000 was the approximate cost of the special concession under which the first phase increase of the 1983 public service pay agreement was, in general, to be applied with effect from 1 September 1983 to pensions in course of payment on that date.  Given the administrative procedures in operation at the time and, in addition, delay by certain groups in accepting the terms of the public service pay agreement, it was not possible to effect payment of the £1,950,000 before the end of 1983.  This amount excludes the payment due to former Department of Posts and Telegraphs pensioners whose liability is being met by the new boards.</P>

      <P>(a) Civil servants are not permitted to stand for election to either House of the Oireachtas, or to the European Parliament. This restriction applies to all categories of staff.</P>
      <P>(b)  Civil servants in the industrial categories and in manipulative, subclerical and manual grades are free to engage in political activity, subject to the general restriction in relation to parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>(c) Members of the clerical classes in the civil service, and civil servants in non-manipulative grades with salary maxima equal to or below the clerical officer maximum, may apply for permission to engage in politics on the same basis as the staff referred to at (b), but officers employed on particular types of work may have their applications refused.</P>
      <P>(d) All civil servants above the clerical level are totally debarred from engaging in politics.</P>
      <P>Any relaxation or extension of the rules in respect of higher grades would have inevitable repercussions at policy formation levels, which would lead to an erosion of public confidence in the political impartiality of the service generally.

The interest paid on the bank loan has been vouched and an amended certificate of tax-free allowances to take account of this interest will be issued shortly.  Any tax overdeducted since 6 April last would be refundable by the employer on operation of this certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interest paid on the county council <Col N="2404" /> loan has not been certified and a deduction for this interest could not, therefore, be allowed.  The inspector has asked the taxpayer for a certificate on a number of occasions but the taxpayer has not yet responded.  The inspector is again writing to the taxpayer in the matter.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that on the basis of the information provided, underpayments of tax have come to light for the years 1979-80 and 1982-83.  The underpayments will be collected by restricting the tax-free allowances for the year 1984-85.</P>
      <P>An amended certificate of tax-free allowances will shortly be issued for the current year, 1983-84, to provide additional medical insurance relief.  Any tax overdeducted since 6 April last will be refunded by the employer on operation of this certificate.  There may be a further increase due in the tax-free allowances for this year on foot of life assurance premiums and the inspector of taxes will shortly be writing to the taxpayer's agents in the matter.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes has had no communication from the taxpayer since November 1979.  A certificate of tax-free allowances was not issued because, on the basis of the information available to the inspector, the taxpayer was self-employed and assessments to income tax were raised on him on this basis for a number of years. In the circumstances, it is considered that the taxpayer's affairs could best be dealt with by calling to the tax office and the inspector will now contact him to arrange a meeting.</P>

      <P>Drainage works on that part of the Ulster (Monaghan) Blackwater catchment situated entirely in Northern Ireland are expected by the Northern Ireland authorities to commence this summer.  It is the intention of those authorities to undertake the works by way of contract and I am not in a position, therefore, to give information on the employment content. It is expected that the outfall works in Northern Ireland will have advanced to the stage which would allow the Commissioners of Public Works to commence operations in County Monaghan in 1985.  The commissioners expect to employ 120 workers at the peak level of activity.</P>

      <P>The attached tabular statement sets out the number of public health nurses in the community care areas of the health <Col N="2408" /> boards.  Assignments are to community care areas rather than counties.</P>
      <P>Sanction to the filling of posts of senior public health nurse was given to the North-Eastern Health Board, in conjunction with other health boards in April 1982.  Because of the constraints in the appointment of additional staff in the public service, introduction of the new grade was to be by substitution for existing posts.  In February 1983 sanction was given to the North-Eastern Health Board to suppress two posts of trainee public health nurse and one post of public health nurse in favour of a senior post in each community care area.  However, the board have not found it possible to proceed with the making of the appointment in Louth.</P>

      <P>Under existing arrangements no charge is levied on consultants in respect of the use of public hospital equipment, materials and staff in the treatment of their private patients.  These arrangements have existed since 1979.  Since then, the common contract for medical consultants has been negotiated.  While account has been taken of the private practice opportunties available to consultants in public hospitals, no adjustment has been incorporated in the contract to take account of the substantial benefit which accrues to <Col N="2413" /> medical consultants by virtue of the use, without charge, of expensive staff and facilities in treating private patients.</P>
      <P>The question of changing these arrangements is being examined and I hope to be able to make a statement on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 22 November 1982 and was paid to 23 November 1983.  Payment ceased temporarily at that date as according to the Department's records he had less than 156 contributions paid on his behalf since his entry into insurance and was only entitled to benefit for 52 weeks.  Subsequent inquiries established that the claimant had the necessary contributions to entitle him to continuous payment of benefit while he remains incapable of work.  Arrears of benefit for the period 24 November 1983 to 31 December 1983 amounting to £262.68 were issued on 3 February 1984.

      <P>Income in cash is one of the items which must be taken into account in assessing the means of any applicant for unemployment assistance.  The income to be taken into account is the income which the person may reasonably expect to receive in the year succeeding his claim.  This applies to both employees and the self-employed.  However, unemployment for an employee involves the complete cessation of earnings and the level of his previous earnings cannot therefore give any indication of his likely income in the future.</P>
      <P>In the case of self-employed people, however, where there is no other way of ascertaining his likely cash income, the income actually received by him in the previous year may be taken into account. Where this is done, regard is had to all the circumstances and in particular to the availability or otherwise of opportunities for self-employment in the case.  If an applicant is assessed with income in excess of what he actually earns it is open to him to apply for a review of his means assessment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that the Dublin Gas Company are at present recruiting 70 fitters-welders from abroad to work on the replacement of the gas line from the supply base to city areas; and if, in view of the present serious high unemployment and of the State's involvement in Dublin Gas, he will introduce emergency legislation that will give priority of employment to local qualified tradespersons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Dublin Gas Company that they have no proposals to recruit fitters-welders from abroad.  I might add that AnCO provide facilities as required for fitters-welders to update their skills to qualify them for employment on gas lines.</P>
      <P>It must be appreciated however, that the recruitment of fitters-welders for Dublin Gas Company pipelaying operations is a matter for the company and for any individual contractors employed by them to carry out such work subject to existing legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with the Treaty of Rome, EEC nationals are entitled to seek employment in any of the member states of the European Community and I am satisfied that present arrangements whereby persons from non-EEC countries take up employment here must be covered by a work permit from my Department adequately safeguard the interests of Irish workers.</P>
