    <Title>First Report of the Committee on Small Businesses: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the First Report of the Committee on Small Businesses: Manufacturing Industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee were established about a year ago.  Their establishment was a recognition of the fact that 90 per cent of all businesses are small.  Nearly all small firms are indigenous, meaning that they have no potential to repatriate their profits abroad.  Therefore the net benefit to the economy and to the Exchequer <Col N="2204" /> is far greater than from other forms of mobile international investment.  In the past year the committee have been a focal point for the representatives of small businesses.  I hope we will discharge our responsibility as a parliamentary policy committee on an all time basis.</P>
    <P>In our initial programme of work we decided to produce four sectoral reports, the first on manufacturing industry, now before the House, the second on retail distribution, the third on tourism and the catering industry and finally, construction. The report we are discussing today was published in May, the second in October and we hope to publish the third in January or February.  At the outset I thank the clerk of the committee, Mr. Shane McAuley, for his valuable help and work.  I also thank all those who made submissions and the members of the committee for their non-partisan approach and all others who assisted us with advice and guidance.  The committee have no consultancy resources.  Therefore, everything they produce is at minimal cost, all our own work.</P>
    <P>I should like to make two other points before going into the report in detail.  As with other Oireachtas committees, there is a problem about staff and I hope that when the Minister contributes to the debate he will make some point in relation to follow-up facilities.  I suggest we would have one meeting with the appropriate Minister or Ministers so that this matter can be clarified.  I realise we do not have an executive function.  I hope the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism will tell us that all the recommendations can be dealt with by the different Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>The report has more than 80 recommendations. Already there has been a debate on it in the Seanad.  I have read the reply of the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, in detail.  A White Paper was published a matter of weeks after our publication and we are in broad agreement with it &mdash; I will stress the areas of disagreement.  The second report we hope to publish will be widely at variance with the White Paper.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2205" /> Since the establishment of the committee the Government have taken initiatives in a number of areas, such as the White Paper, linkage programmes, the regionalisation of the IDA and many others which I will deal with later.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to our specific recommendations and the degree of general difference between them and the White Paper.  I will make some criticisms of the White Paper.  It seems to suggest that there is a limitation on the cash resources available to aid small industry.  That does not take account, of the enormous dynamic potential of the rate of return on any such investment.  The White Paper does not make any clear deliniation between the problems of small firms and industrial policy and strategy in general. I am not talking about small firms which employ 41 people or 53 people but of companies that have a very tight management structure in which the owner, the manager, the managing director, the personnel manager and the financial controller is the one person.  That is the practice in many small firms and it is their problem.</P>
    <P>The principal recommendation in the report is in the vital area of finance and this, of course, concerns the IDA principally. I do not believe there is sufficient flexibility in the existing IDA grant package for small firms.  At the moment it is 45 per cent of fixed assets and 50 per cent for feasibility, etc.  Our principal recommendation in this regard was made because we came across many firms that had full order books or great proposals for improvements but never got going or went out of business because of day to day cash flow or lack of finance.  We recommended an extension of the enterprise development programme so that the grant aid could be reduced from 45 per cent to 30 per cent to be substituted by an 80 per cent guarantee of the loan fund.  We went into specific detail and suggested that £15 million would be made available in a three year period.  Part of that £15 million would be premium to offset insurance in case anybody defaulted on the guarantee.  This is very important and could be done by reducing <Col N="2206" /> the grant aid from 45 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation in relation to the IDA package was the question of secondhand machinery.  A receiver or liquidator cannot get rid of the plant and equipment of a company because secondhand machinery is not grant aided.  This is a shame.  Many small businesses can get perfectly good and viable equipment at half the cost if they buy secondhand. The State's money would go further and it would help small businesses to a great extent if this was done.</P>
    <P>For labour-intensive industries we recommended that there should be an option between grants for employees and grants for fixed assets.  There are many labour-intensive companies in the textile and clothing areas.  In relation to the area of long term financing of small businesses there should be an option between getting capital grant aid on day one and getting the equivalent interest subsidy on a fixed interest rate long term loan over 15 or 20 years.  This would spread the IDA's risk.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to detail all the recommendations we made in relation to the banks, ICC, the European Investment Bank and the Stock Exchange.  I hope the Minister, in discussions with these institutions, will take up the various matters raised.</P>
    <P>We found that given the same tax problems and financial problems some companies were very successful and some were struggling.  The difference between success and failure was always good management. I have often said that an improvement in management efficiency and capacity would do more for the economy than a major oil discovery.  The Government should place greater emphasis on management performance and capacity.  There should be a White Paper on this subject.  I know there is to be one on manpower policy and I hope it will be included in that.  We made 13 recommendations in the management area but the most specific one was that there should be a co-ordinated management policy initiative to include the IMI, IPC and AnCO whereby they would do <Col N="2207" /> a three year in-company management training programme.  There would be the classroom environment activities of the IMI, AnCO teaching people to work machines and the IPC doing a management consultancy job.  The three should be combined.  A company could then be taken and a development plan drawn up for it.  Targets could be set and monitored. A proper management structure could be set up within the company to ensure that it achieved the highest levels of efficiency in order to get the ultimate in, what they call in the trade, the hands on approach.</P>
    <P>As regards State agencies, it has been long recognised that there is a multiplicity of services being provided by the various Departments, State bodies and institutions giving assistance to small industries. There are 27 of them in all.  We looked at studies from AnCO and the small firms association which stated the clear dissatisfaction of the people who were the recipients of these services.  They felt that they were not localised but were in centrally heated south side Dublin offices.  It was felt that they were too remote from the problems.  It was also felt that there was not the maximum interaction between the various State agencies.  What we are seeking is a totally integrated business approach to the various problems of small businesses.  This should be done on a localised consultancy basis.  It would involve the key functions of finance, management, marketing, quality control, research and development.  To date, we have county development teams, the hot line and the IDA regional development programme.  This is insufficient.  In one satellite town in Dublin or one county there should be a small business centre redeploying the personnel from existing agencies.  We were thinking of something equivalent to the ACOT localised consultancy service.  Small businesses would be able to get IDA approval for grant aid there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would pilot it in one county to see what the demand was for it.  In the Telesis report it was stated that a development effort aimed at new indigenous industry must be reorganised to emphasise the building of structurally strong Irish companies rather than strong agencies to build weak companies.  That is the fundamental point.  I understand from the grapevine that the IDA are opposed to it.  I strongly resist the general thrust of the IDA control over policy in the industrial development area while I have the highest respect for their personnel.</P>
      <P>Marketing was considered very important.  The difference between marketing and sales is that sales is selling what you have and marketing is selling what people want to buy.  For a successful business approach one must take a market led approach.  We split this into three: import substitution in the domestic market, the export market and potential and State purchasing within the indigenous market.  In the Minister of State's reply to the Seanad I note that the general revamping of the Irish Goods Council was rejected.  I accept that Mr. Murray and others in the Irish Goods Council have done a good job but there cannot be complacency when in 1983 total imports were £7.4 billion.  Of that consumer products were £2 billion.  One in four of everything we buy is imported.  The Irish Goods Council's resources are limited and they cannot provide the service that is required.</P>
      <P>There must be an improvement in the area of developing an Irish standard in terms of quality control.  The Irish Goods Council should play an effective role in the area of linkages.  There should be indigenous marketing plans for companies. There should be the kind of consultancy service in terms of advice on products and research that there is in other countries, especially so now that the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign is being conducted by the Confederation of Irish Industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the State purchasing side, total non-salary expenditure in the State area was £3½ billion last year.  Despite our best <Col N="2209" /> efforts by way of parliamentary question and otherwise, we could not get any figures about what proportion of this was Irish purchases.  Either the information was not available or was not given to us. This is totally inadequate.  We recommend, as is in line with the EC Directive, that 30 per cent of all purchases should be confined to small firms and where they are sole Irish manufacturers, they should be given field trials for trial purchases. We also recommend that the Government contract committee be revamped and that there be a data bank to provide information to small businesses on the opportunities in the State purchasing area.  I know the Minister held a conference in relation to State purchasing.  I should like to see far more extensive activity in this area.</P>
    <P>As regards export promotion, I am pleased to see that in the White Paper the proposals made by CTT have been taken up in full in relation to the market entry and development scheme.  The Minister of State in the Seanad pointed out that our recommendation in relation to the provision of a sales agency service in our foreign markets, the provision of extensive warehousing in our foreign markets and grants for trading companies which are trying to locate these markets would be a duplication of the activities of CTT.  Economically we either live or die by our exports.  We are only scratching the surface of the iceberg as regards our potential in this area.</P>
    <P>Exports <i>per capita</i> to the UK in 1983 were £46 per head.  Exports to the Netherlands were £29 per head and £11 per head in West Germany but every extra £1 per head of population which we sell to West Germany is worth £62 million.  If we sell as much to the West Germans as we do to the Dutch we would solve our balance of payments deficit by creating £11,016 million in extra exports. I do not accept that there is duplication. Anyone who tries to get more business for Irish manufacturers is worth supporting and I hope that CTT's open attitude will prevail in this area and that the Department will encourage people to act <Col N="2210" /> as middlemen in markets and provide warehousing facilities for small businesses. I hope our recommendations in that area will receive further consideration.</P>
    <P>The area of taxation is vital because it also concerns investment and there is a direct ratio between taxation penalties and the incentive risk/return for the investor.  The jobs tax credit scheme is innovative and imaginative.  Whatever case there is for tax reductions for small businesses, there is an indisputable argument for employment-related tax relief. We suggested that this should be based on company tax relief amounting to £400 in the first year and £250 in the second year for things like net VAT payments, employers' PRSI and corporation tax and that they should get recognition for taking on new staff.  The employers' share of PRSI is crippling labour-intensive companies.  There should be an option between the standard rate of manufacturing corporation tax and low PRSI or, alternatively, they should not pay PRSI but pay the higher rate of corporation tax which applies to non-manufacturing industries.  This would give non-profit-making companies an option of reducing their overheads under levels of employment.</P>
    <P>There are six rates of VAT and this is very cumbersome for small businesses. The rates should be rationalised to at least three bands.  There should be a £500 credit which applied when turnover tax was in operation compensating for the unpaid paper and administrative work which is forced on small businesses in relation to VAT.  In our second report we went further and adopted the Belgian position in relation to an equalisation tax whereby you raised the levels of tax which basically meant that VAT became wholesale tax and that the retailers' margin would not be liable to VAT.  The margin would be increased so that there would not be less revenue to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>VAT at the point of entry is a problem and we recognise that its abolition would cost about £190 million.  We suggest that the element of guarantee should be taken out, that companies would only have to <Col N="2211" /> meet the two monthly repayments instead of having a continuous drain on their overdraft accommodation.</P>
    <P>I was at a conference on Tuesday morning in relation to the electronics industry and I learned of the huge brain drain from the country.  There are highly educated engineers who are moving to the United States because every £1 they earn here over £12,686 is taxed at the rate of 73½ pence in the pound.  People with these qualifications will seize their opportunities in other countries and we are the losers.  We should follow Sweden's example where only 70 per cent of income is taxable.  Marketing personnel who spend more than 30 days out of the country should get tax rebates for that period.</P>
    <P>In the area of legal and administrative environment &mdash; this does not concern the Minister's Department &mdash; we recommended a simple change in line with the practice in Northern Ireland regarding the area of debt collection.  Many small businesses fail because of the detrimental effect on cash flow and they cannot collect the money owed to trade creditors. There is a small claims court system in Northern Ireland set up under the Arbitration Act, 1937, whereby in regard to sums under £1,000 companies can go to the county court with no legal expenses, no delays and can collect their money through arbitration.  The system operating here is that if you have 20 trade creditors, you pick out the biggest and hope to make an example of them.  There are huge legal expenses involved, long delays and the system is totally unsatisfactory. It also brings an immoral aspect into Irish business.</P>
    <P>In relation to planning law, there are costly delays and there should be a three months limit to An Bord Pleanála decisions on any appeal.  There should be partial refunds for refusals of planning applications because, as it is based on square footage, it can be very expensive. I understand that the Government are bringing in a new Bill to revise the 1963 Companies Act.  Small firms are being butchered at present by the domino effect <Col N="2212" /> of liquidations and receiverships by virtue of the fact that they are all secured creditors. The law is not on their side; they are the last on the list and invariably they get nothing.  Banks circumvent their position by getting personal guarantees. The Revenue Commissioners circumvent their position by being preferential creditors. Others look after their own interests. People who are legitimately owed money are those who produce goods or a service and are left with nothing under present law.  There must be a change in relation to that aspect of trade creditors and limited liability.</P>
    <P>We also recognise the problem of delinquent directors.  We recommended that the Government should talk to the financial institutions and advise them that in the area of personal guarantees, where the investor is significantly involved already, personal guarantees should not be required up to £20,000.  When small businesses are owed substantial amounts of money as trade creditors, they should have the right to appoint an administrator so that he would have power to collect the money.  There should be a crack down on deliquent directors and where it can be proved that they deliberately manipulated assets they should be debarred from managing companies for ten years.  I am not talking about legitimate people who try but fail through no fault of their own. I am talking about people who are well known in Irish business and who have a track record of manipulating the limited liability loopholes.</P>
    <P>There is vast potential in the whole area of small business development and it is worth backing.  It has been proved that these small businesses and enterprises are durable and can weather the recession better than their international counterparts.  They cannot pull out of Ireland even if they wanted to.  Our report clearly states the need for a national policy on small businesses.  Not only have we set out the need for such a policy but we have also set out the basis for that policy which is centred on a package of incentives that are selective and geared to improving management performance. <Col N="2213" /> You can selectively give incentives in a sophisticated package provided they are linked to improved performance based on a clear delineation between the problems of small firms and industrial policy generally.</P>
    <P>I make three requests to the Minister. He should make himself available, as should the IDA, for a follow up meeting on our report and full discussion.  We do not have an executive function or an overall monitoring role but we want a once off meeting so that we can thrash out all the points fully.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I ask that the Minister would place this report before the management committee which he chairs.  This is a management committee combining the State agencies and he should ask for a report from them on the matter.  Thirdly, the White Paper specifies that there would be a three year review of industrial policy.  In any such review the essential ingredients of our national policy for small business development should be taken on board in view of the special needs of small businesses with their unique management structure and narrow base.</P>
    <P>I hope we have assisted many small businesses who feel frustrated in lobbying Government and I hope we have responded to their needs.  We have made more than 80 recommendations and I do not think we can be accused of neglect. We scrutinised exhaustively all elements of their problems and we have come up with recommendations that are not academic or macro-economic but that are practical and decisive.  The ball is now firmly in the Government's court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to recommend this report on manufacturing industry to the Dáil, to the Minister and to the Minister of State.  The report has gained status in being placed before the Dáil and the fact that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, are present to listen to the deliberations of Deputies is an indication of the importance they place on the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies and Senators have been involved in compiling the report.  As <Col N="2214" /> the chairman of the committee, Deputy Yates, has stated, it is basically the practical deliberations of people who have had some involvement in small businesses during the years and the committee worked without the assistance of any support group or advisers.  I should like to pay a special tribute to the chairman, Deputy Yates, for his dogged determination in preparing the report in the time it took and also to the former vice-chairman, the late Deputy Cowen.  He played a very important part in compiling the report.  We much regret his early passing. I should also like to compliment Shane McAuley, the secretary of the committee. He is a very determined man and he ensured that as many Deputies and Senators as was possible attended the committee regularly.  It is a major difficulty for Oireachtas Members to get the necessary time from their constituency work and other commitments to attend meetings. However, the overall attendance and participation in the committee's work has been high.</P>
    <P>This is an agreed, non-contentious report so far as the recommendations are concerned.  We went into the committee in a fair and open way in the best interests of small businesses.  We have achieved our objective by the presentation of the report and also the report on the retail distribution trade which has already been approved.  I recommend this report to the Department, to the Ministers concerned and also to all State agencies who have an involvement in this area.  I hope every State agency will be supplied with a copy of the report and that it will be debated and analysed within the organisations concerned.  Where possible the recommendations should be accepted and adopted.  I do not wish to see the report gathering dust on the shelves of the civil servants.  It should be acted upon because it is relevant for today.  However, it may not be relevant in three or four years' time.  The committee should meet with the Minister and the Minister of State in the very near future to discuss the recommendations, to see where the Government and the IDA can go along with them or where they will reject them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2215" /> We were disappointed that quite a number of the recommendations were not included in the document <i>Building on Reality</i>.  After our deliberations and involvement we felt recognition should have been given to the fact that the report existed.</P>
    <P>I will deal only generally with the report because I think it a pointless exercise for Deputies who have participated in compiling the report to go through it in detail.  However, there are a few items which relate to my constituency and which are relevant.  The Minister will be pleased at the economical way we prepared and compiled the report.  The first press conference was hosted by the chairman of the committee, Deputy Yates, and the second press conference was paid for by the members.  The Minister will see that we adopted very stringent measures in the way we operated, to such an extent that the Deputies and Senators paid towards the presentation of the press conference.  This is an indication of how we went about our business.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Roscommon-East Galway in the past few years we have had serious difficulties.  There have been closures of firms in Roscommon, Castlerea and Boyle.  A small firm who manufactured aluminium ladders and trolleys in Roscommon closed down because the management decided to move to Dún Laoghaire.  I do not intend to name the individual but, as a reward for his endeavours on behalf of small businesses in my constituency, the same gentleman was made chairman of the small businesses section of the CII.  It makes me wonder when I see such people pronouncing on industry because when it was the case of a viable industry in their own neck of the woods the result was closure of the firm concerned.  When that business closed down within a few weeks the workforce were laid off with the minimum statutory redundancy payment, no more and no less.  The building is falling into disrepair and is becoming a target for vandals and itinerants are camping beside it.  It is regrettable to see a viable small business closing without any regard <Col N="2216" /> for the workforce of the area.  The best efforts of the IDA and the local development team were in vain as far as that project was concerned.</P>
    <P>There is great need for small businesses because of the massive increase in unemployment in the past few years.  In my county more than 2,090 people are unemployed and 571 of them are under 25 years.  There are 290 people in short-term employment, in AnCO and in youth employment schemes.  There is great need for the creation of long term jobs and small businesses have the best potential because of the security of small firms. In addition, there is not the same traumatic effect on an area when a small business has to close as is the case with the closure of large firms.  Of course there is always a need for larger firms because in some cases they assist the small industries to survive.  Surrounding large businesses there are the support industries, whether it be the machine shop or the shop preparing commodities for the larger firms.  I take this opportunity to ask the Minister to visit my constituency to see the devastating effect of unemployment and the number of firms that have gone out of business in the recent past.</P>
    <P>I give another example of a constituent who endeavoured to set up a small business and at every step of the way his efforts have been frustrated.  It is a typical case history of lack of support from the State agencies for a young person who is prepared to set up his own firm.  He is under 30 years of age and he is seeking to set up a firm to rewind motors.  This may not be a manufacturing business in the strict sense but I believe it is an import substitution business.  Furthermore, the fact that a person of that age would commit himself to buying a site near the town of Roscommon and in the process of the development of that site received no co-operation whatever from the local authorities as regards either planning permission or development is deplorable.  It was an effort for the young man to obtain planning permission, and the initial cost of the planning fee was a major disincentive. The person has bought a site and has now commenced the development <Col N="2217" /> but the organisations of State seem unable or unwilling to help.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured over the last few weeks to obtain information regarding the product.  I have advised my constituent where possible to liaise with the manufacturing business in this type of motor trade.  I thought the IDA had a computerised list of items imported into this country detailing the country, cost and specification of the item involved. When I was Minister of State I worked in an active capacity with the IDA on European promotion in Antwerp, Brussels and Amsterdam.  I thought that the IDA would have in their possession a full breakdown list of all manufactured items imported into this country and that a full specification should be made available from the IDA of any item of manufacture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought so, but I rang the IDA and they told me that the only place where I could get that information was in Customs and Excise.  I was looking for an armature for a motor, a simple manufacturing item which I felt this constituent could prepare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into that. The IDA have data banks both in Dublin and in the rest of their offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt confident in saying to my constituent that I would be in touch with the IDA during the week.  I rang their office, not their head office but one of their subsidiaries in Dublin, and I was informed clearly that they had not got a data bank, that they were not computerised and they could not give me information as to whether an item like a motor armature, a very expensive item which is used for reconditioning engines of tractors, cars etc. and which is a relatively simple, straightforward manufactured item could be made by small industry.  I hope the Minister will take this up and have it clarified because in my investigations <Col N="2218" /> I have been informed by officials within the IDA that they have not got this kind of information available.  I have the details of the date on which I rang.  If they have not got that information the Minister should set about&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They might not have it in the detail that the Deputy's constituent wanted.  It might be very rough information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not even aware that this item existed or of the number of items imported.  The only information they could give me was that I should contact Customs and Excise.  I do not know whether Customs and Excise have a role in relation to job creation or job promotion.  We have now reached the computer age and I would have thought that every branch and sub-branch of the IDA, if a young manufacturing spirited person arrives there, would be able to give him the information he wants as to whether an item is imported and the quantities and costs involved.  That would be a logical approach in relation to our import substitution programme.  If the case is as I am stating, that the IDA have not got the information, they should set about having that information.  If we want to provide jobs for young people it is essential that we substitute the majority of imported items as far as is practicable, particularly parts of machinery that could be ground and prepared here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of people unemployed is so high and also the amount of imports is so large that we must try to cut down our imports and substitute the items here. We have the capacity and the ability to do that.  My constituent is still looking for this information in relation to the armature for these motors and also he is trying to obtain a grant from the local development team on a start-off basis to give him some help or assistance to set up his own business and provide jobs for himself and perhaps three or four others. It is an interesting case history of lack of general encouragement.  He said to me <Col N="2219" /> that if he had known the lack of support and assistance he would not have proceeded with the purchase of the site.</P>
    <P>In relation to industry in general the IDA have a good track record.  I recognise their role.  I know of the efforts they have made and the difficulties under which they operate.  Nevertheless, I feel that certain regions are not being given the treatment they deserve at present by the IDA.  I take this opportunity, because I do not get too many opportunities in the Dáil, to promote my constituency.  I appeal to the Minister where possible to give special attention to an area which has been practically decimated as far as employment is concerned.  The State also have a role in relation to the promotion of jobs.  I am disappointed that the Government are not proceeding with the import substitution programme initiated under our last Government.  In my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Transport and at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I initiated import substitution seminars which took place in Cavan, Roscommon, Dún Laoghaire and elsewhere.  They were of great assistance because the number of items at present being imported by Bord Telecom Éireann, An Post, CIE, the ESB and other State agencies is quite amazing.  I recall one item alone, the steps for the P &amp; T poles, galvanised and simply manufactured, which were being imported at that time. I understand that now they are being manufactured here and that is how it should be.  Quite a number of other items are now being manufactured here as a result of the import substitution programme initiated by us at that time.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to use all the power he has as Minister in that Department to regenerate interest in this regard. Discussions and seminars should be held in all major towns on a national programme on import substitution. Young enterprising industrialists exist but they must be encouraged and shown the potential in the different areas. Instead of embarking on the expensive system of transporting heavy display <Col N="2220" /> units, our import substitution programme should be based on films, slides, and lectures. Officials of the IDA, the local development teams, CTT, and other State agencies, should be encouraged to get involved.  Those who become interested in a project should be given all information available.  The report deals with the one-stop-shop for information but we should embark on a major industrial promotion at local level with the assistance of all State agencies.  Our people should be informed of the many items at present being imported that could be manufactured here.  I have no doubt that such a promotion would result in a number of small and sound industries being set up.  I accept that the IDA are doing tremendous work in Europe, America and elsewhere to encourage industrialists to Ireland but with our own resources we can establish many small industries to manufacture import substitutes. There is unlimited potential as far as the creation of jobs is concerned in that area.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot rely totally on the private sector to provide the necessary jobs.  For example, many jobs could be provided if the Government gave the go ahead for the Ballyforan briquette factory.  I have no doubt that up to 100 permanent jobs could be created there.  I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who was responsible for postponing the decision, and to the Minister for Energy, not to close the Derryfada project but to turn the area into an oasis for job creation. The bogs are available and the infrastructure exists to provide a lot of employment in that region.  While that matter is not dealt with in the report I am pleased to be able to avail of the opportunity to appeal to the Minister to press at Cabinet level for a go ahead of this project.  A deadline of May 1985 has been set for a final decision.  The redundancies announced there were unnecessary, particularly when a final decision has not been reached.  The Minister has the power to reverse a bad decision taken to postpone the project. It is a national scandal that more than £12 million has been invested in the infrastructural <Col N="2221" /> works there.  Some of the plant for the factory is located in the country but I am not sure where it is hidden.  I am aware that a boiler which cost £1 million is hanging around somewhere.  It appears that it is lost although its location may be known to Bord na Móna officials. It is a national scandal to spend £1 million on some plant that may never be used as a result of Government inactivity.  The postponement of that project is the responsibility of the Government.</P>
    <P>Local development teams have a major role to play in establishing small businesses.  I support the concept of local development teams but I suggest, on a non-party political basis, that Deputies and Senators resident in a county should be given the opportunity of participating on a regular basis at meetings of county development teams.  I am not suggesting that they should be entitled to attend all meetings or those where a special project is under discussion but there should be more liaison between the development teams and elected representatives.  Our role is not simply one of constituency representation.  We have also a role to play in regard to job creation, a task I have been aware of since first elected.  I have made every effort to assist enterprising people to create jobs.</P>
    <P>County development teams, with the county manager as chairman, are well constituted.  All agencies in the counties are represented on them but there should be a greater openness between the teams and Oireachtas Members.  I must add that I have found the teams to be very co-operative. The development officer in my constituency, Mr. Lynch, and his assistant, Mr. Kelly, are very co-operative and responsive to representations.  However, in a semi-formal manner there should be more discussions between Oireachtas Members and members of the county development teams.  A former chairman of our county development team set about establishing a small industry in Elphin, County Roscommon.  He provided funds by way of the proceeds of the sale of lands and other legitimate dealings but, unfortunately, to date, although the <Col N="2222" /> infrastructure exists, we do not have an industry there.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of appealing to the Minister and his Minister of State to assist in helping the provision of a small industry at that location.  The development team at the time felt that the advance factory programme initiated by the IDA, which was extremely successful, which brought about tremendous potential and created quite a number of jobs, could not cope with every area. The local authority themselves took that responsibility.  That is something the Minister should encourage and assist where possible.</P>
    <P>In addition, the IDA's Small Industries Division set up a very successful project in Strokestown, County Roscommon, involving a totally new concept in craft industry, which constitutes one of the most interesting and successful developments in the constituency.  The work of the Slieve Bawn Industries and others in that area have established a new concept in development, creating much needed employment.  I might mention that the well known toy or puppet &ldquo;Bosco&rdquo; is produced in that area, which was done with the assistance of RTE and small local industry, constituting an interesting connection with the broadcasting media, because of a programme on television which made that toy very popular and which toy is now being manufactured in the county creating jobs throughout the year.</P>
    <P>There are other interesting developments taking place in the constituency. There is, of course, the Hanley bacon factory in Roosky, an example of one of the finest bacon factories in the world.  On account of the quality of their personnel, and with assistance from the State over the years, they now represent a fine example of the full utilisation of available raw materials.  We should recognise successful projects and not always highlight those less successful.</P>
    <P>In recommending this report to the House I am confident that quite an amount of the recommendations will be accepted.  It should be remembered that much work went into its production.  It is <Col N="2223" /> encouraging to note that it crossed party divides.  We did not engage in the work of that committee to score any points or to adopt any party political approach in relation to the production of this report. Rather we endeavoured to prepare a report which would be of assistance to small industry, and I feel we have succeeded. It may not be a perfect report &mdash; there is no such thing &mdash; but it is a fair and honest one.  We even traversed ideological bounds through the participation of all the parties represented in this House.  We may have had differences at various junctures but we had resolved to produce what might be described as an agreed report which should be more acceptable to the Government and the IDA.</P>
    <P>I would recommend that this report be circulated to all local development teams and also to all the State agencies.  If the funds are not available to the committee to provide for such distribution I would recommend that the Minister ensure that this report arrive on the desks of all our semi-State organisations and that we now obtain their views thereon.</P>
    <P>We would welcome a meeting with the Minister or his Minister of State to discuss the progress being made regarding its recommendations from the date of its production.  As a team we should work in an endeavour to create a better climate for small industry, resulting in much needed employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the committee on their production of a very thorough report within a very short time.  Indeed the fact that they have produced yet another report since this one clearly indicates that the work rate of this committee is very high indeed.  I should like to compliment everybody involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairman of the committee put three requests to me.  The first was that I should have a meeting with the committee to discuss in detail my reaction and that of the Government to the report, and I do intend to have such a meeting. <Col N="2224" /> meetings with the various agencies, which was his second request.  I am responsible to this House for all of those agencies and it is better that communications be channelled through the relevant Minister.  However, I will, of course, arrange to have a full range of officials, with the necessary expertise, present with me at this meeting to ensure that any questions raised by the committee are capable of being answered there and then.</P>
    <P>Also, as was requested by the chairman of the committee, I will put the report before the Management Committee on Industrial Policy, ensuring that his third request, namely, that the recommendations of the report be included in the review of industrial policy which will take place in approximately two years' time will also be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say in two years' time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a three year cycle of reports.  We are already into the first year.  There is provision in the relevant White Paper for a review every three years.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I may make a few comments about the report.  The committee chairman said that his view was &mdash; and I presume this reflects the committee's view as well &mdash; that there had been too much in our industrial policy in the past of strong agencies assisting weak companies, that agencies' influence was all pervasive, thereby creating a situation in which companies perhaps did not accept sufficient responsibility for their own destinies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the proposals of the report fall precisely into the trap that the chairman of the committee himself said we should endeavour to avoid.  For example, I have in mind in particular the recommendation about specialists input to the management training programme, which will more or less get involved in practically everything a company is doing, their present performance, current management deficiencies, preparation and However, I do not intend to arrange for <Col N="2225" /> implementation of in-company action plans, installation of proper company management systems, monthly monitoring of management development progress, the utilisation of technical and other specialist assistance available at either regional or national level.  This was to be done by AnCO, the IMI and the Irish Productivity Centre.  If this was to be done on any kind of a wide scale for a large number of companies the personnel costs would be very substantial indeed and we do not have those types of resources available.</P>
    <P>I think also it is not at all healthy that there should be that degree of involvement by Government agencies, paid for by the taxpayer, in the internal management of companies.  There has to be some area in which companies themselves are responsible for their own future.  The role of the State is to make available a level of general business environment, first of all, which is conducive to enterprise and then to provide individual incentives.  But the trouble is that the more one becomes involved in the provision of incentives and services the more one's taxation rises and the worse becomes the business environment.  The danger is that if we endeavour to do too much, to spend too much on services for industry, the level of taxation and the costs, within the general environmental framework for industry, will become adverse.  In my view that approach goes too far.  I know that it has some parallels with the company development approach in which the IDA are engaging, although that would not be as ambitious as is this recommendation of the committee.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper I sought especially to put clear limits on what the IDA may do in terms of becoming involved in individual company development.  It is not the responsibility of State agencies to manage companies.  Those companies are owned by private individuals.  They should manage their companies, carrying the costs, risks and responsibility relevant to their ownership.</P>
    <P>When I meet the committee I would like to discuss the cost of all these recommendations, because some of them will <Col N="2226" /> cost quite a considerable amount.  Many recommendations would involve very little cost, such as the one-stop-shop idea, the regionalisation of the industrial services of the IDA, and the introduction of a quality control programme in firms which get State aid.  These are some of the recommendations I have adopted, but where I did not adopt the committee's recommendations it was generally because I felt they would cost more than was available.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Yates when he says it is not right that there should be a limit on the amount of funds available for industrial development.  That would be a very desirable condition in which to live, but it is not the condition in which this country finds itself at present.  It is clear from the Government's plan that there will be cash limits in respect of all the Government's activities over the next three years.  I believe that is in the long term interests of industry because, hopefully, it will lead to conditions being created in which the overall tax burden can be reduced.  It would not be wise to exempt any area of activity from these cash limits because that would establish a precedent which could undermine the system of having cash limits.  What business needs most is an improvement in the tax environment and that will only be achieved by stringent control over public expenditure.  That point was made quite eloquently by Deputy Yates in respect of his recent meeting with the Federation of Electronics Industries.  The example cited indicates that our tax system is a problem and we have to be careful when spending money if we want to reduce the tax burden.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden referred to import substitution. The Government have continued the import substitution programme.  The Minister of State, Deputy E. Collins, met all the State companies under the Department of Industry and Energy, as it was then, to encourage them assist Irish companies when meeting the purchasing needs of their own companies.  What was needed was to give them small amounts of work to build up their confidence so that they could <Col N="2227" /> become full suppliers after a while.  Those discussions were very successful.</P>
    <P>I have undertaken a series of meetings with the major supermarket groups to get them to buy more Irish goods.  Those meetings have already yielded substantial results.  The Irish Goods Council are working with the major retailers at present to develop long term relationships with Irish suppliers where previously imports were meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden referred to a problem experienced by one of his constituents &mdash; he could not get information about import statistics for a particular product. I understand the IDA have a data bank but there are only details in regard to electronics.  They have more general information in regard to other categories of imports and these are broken down by category in the Central Statistics Office publications, which are not always exactly what the businessman wants to know.  The IDA offer feasibility grants to people to work out prospects for a particular industry, an important part of which would be the market and the extent of imports.  Assistance is available to help people to research a project from the point of view of imports.  I do not think there is a great problem there but I will ask my officials to contact Deputy Leyden to get more information about this particular case.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to his efforts in the area of telecommunications.  He went around the country seeking Irish suppliers.  He is probably aware that telecommunications is exceptional because it is not controlled by EC rules so far as nationalistic preference is concerned. One can do things in the telecommunications area that one cannot do elsewhere. In my view it is not the good thing that there should be discriminatory nationalistic purchasing in the telecommunications area.  It does not suit Ireland because we have reached the point where our telecommunications investment programme has peaked and it is now on the way down.  On the other hand, we have a number of suppliers and if they <Col N="2228" /> are to survive they have to get into the export market.  If British Telecom, the French ITT or the German company are to buy only their own products, the Irish suppliers will not have a chance to penetrate the market.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that one of the achievements of my presidency of the Industry Ministers Council has been to get agreement that we will open up the European telecommunications market to suppliers from other countries.  This will suit Ireland because we have to export to survive, and it will also suit Europe.  Instead of having one or two huge American companies able to supply a market of 200 million people, and therefore get tremendous economies, Europe is broken into ten separate markets and no company can get big enough to compete on a world stage.  We should be moving away from discriminatory purchasing practices and towards throwing the European markets open.  As I said, I am glad we have made a major step forward in that area during our Irish presidency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates spoke about the lack of a clear delineation of the problem of small industry in Government activity.  The IDA have a separate small industries programme and the regionalisation of the offices is specifically designed to enable small industry decisions to be taken in the region, not in every county because that would cost too much.  That could not be done with the existing staff.  It would be impossible to provide a comprehensive staff in every county and suburb because we do not have the staff.</P>
    <P>The enterprise development programme is designed specifically to help people involved in high technology to set up their own businesses.  However, there is a problem in defining small industries which would make me reluctant to go along with the committee's suggestions that there should be higher grants for small proposals.  The problem is this: what is a small industry?  Is this decided simply by the number of employees?  If there is a sufficiently segmented market, a very small company with approximately 25 employees could be the dominant supplier for Britain and Ireland of some new <Col N="2229" /> product, because there was so little of the product, because it was such a specialised product, they controlled the market with a small number of employees.  In a real sense they are as dominant as another segment of industry, a multinational.</P>
    <P>Given that they are dominant, to give them all sorts of discriminatory help which you would be justified in giving to a company with the same number of employees, but in a very large competitive market, is not the same thing.  In defining what a small industry is, what is crucial is whether, to use the economic jargon, this company is in a state of perfect competition or is in an oligopolistic market.  If it is in an oligopolistic or a monopolistic market where it has the possibility of making an economic arrangement in addition to its basic profits because of its control, no matter what size it is, it is not a small industry.  If on the other hand, it is in perfect competition where it has not control over the price it receives for its goods, there is a case perhaps for giving it some extra help.  If we were going to do anything along the lines suggested by the committee, we would need to redefine the definition of what a small industry is.</P>
    <P>A number of suggestions were made in the report about company law.  As the House is aware, we are promoting legislation in this area to stamp out abuse and to provide for the publication of the accounts of private companies so that people lending them money will have some chance of knowing whether they are in a healthy state and are a good credit risk.  There is always the danger that, if we make the legislation too stringent, people will close down viable companies because they are afraid that, if they did not close them down, they would end up in jail, or have all their assets taken from them.  There is the real risk that, if you go too far in penalising the delinquents, people will play safe and liquidate the company before it needs to be liquidated.  I have been looking at the legislation and trying to balance the inherently conflicting but desirable objectives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2230" /> There is a lack in our law of something equivalent to the Chapter 11 procedures they have in the United States.  A company can be put into a form of receivership which is designed to reconstruct it and float it off again, not necessarily with the same ownership.  They can keep it going rather than break it up and sell it off to suit the creditors.  I would like to run in parallel with legislation penalising delinquent directors which could possibly lead to somewhat earlier closure of some companies because of the fears of the directors that they would be on the wrong side of the law if they carried on in a dodgy credit situation, something which would reform the law in regard to receiverships and give receivers a slightly more constructive perspective so that businesses which are inherently viable but are carrying an unsustainable load of debt could be started off again, without the debt, but with their inherent viability intact.  That is being examined at the moment in the Department.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the recommendations in detail at this stage.  I am meeting the committee and it will probably be better to treat recommendations individually in that forum.  I want to repeat what I said at the outset.  I greatly welcome this report.  Members did a great deal of good work.  While I have had some critical things to say about some aspects of the report, they were not meant in any sense as a reflection on the work of the people concerned.  It is important to hear the other side of the case.  As I said, I do not mean any reflection on the work of the committee.</P>
    <P>I have to apologise to the House.  I cannot stay here for the rest of the debate.  I have to go to a Government meeting.  I hope Deputies will understand that I do not mean any disrespect to Deputy Fahey or Deputy Doyle in not being here to hear their contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will wait to hear some of my contribution. We put a great deal of work into this committee.  I compliment the Minister on setting up the committee.  We feel we have done a very good job.  I compliment <Col N="2231" /> the chairman, the secretary and members of the committee on the work they put into it.  Having received 87 very practicable and implementable proposals from us, it is important that the Minister should put those proposals into effect as quickly as possible.  I do not agree that many of the proposals will cost massive amounts of money.  I am quite satisfied that many of the proposals will be self-financing and that there will be a high return on the investment made.  I am disappointed that a number of those proposals were not included in the national economic plan. We want the Minister to tell us where, when and how many of those proposals will be implemented.  Will it be in the next budget, next year, or never?</P>
      <P>Small business is crying out for the creation of a climate conducive to proper and adequate rewards for efforts made. If these proposals are not implemented the small businesses we have left will find it difficult to survive, and people hoping to get into business will be discouraged from doing so.  Recently a businessman said to me that the only way to make money at the moment is to get out of this country.  We must all advert to that.  The climate in small business at the moment is conducive to making people get out of the place or get into the black market. That is probably the most serious problem facing small business at the moment.</P>
      <P>I am deeply disappointed that the Minister cannot stay in the House for this debate.  I feel like walking out myself. We put six months work into this, and we are having a three hour debate.  If the Minister cannot partake in the debate for those three hours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not playing politics. I complimented the Minister on setting up this committee.  He knows my commitment to Dáil reform and my anxiety to make this House relevant.  This is a bad example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with those three sections of the report which concern finance, management <Col N="2233" /> and marketing.  On the question of finance, there are a number of proposals regarding taxation which would not involve hugh amounts of money to the Exchequer.  They would involve mainly a redeployment of the means by which we collect taxation from small businesses. The Minister is well aware that ours is a fiddler's economy.  Most people in business must compete with people who are operating on the black market.  This is putting many people out of business.  The whole black market situation is due to the very high levels of taxation on every front.  A businessman said to me recently that if he did not dabble in the black market he would not be able to continue in business.  Unfortunately, our friends in industry must engage in black market practices if they are to survive.  That is something that the House should recognise as a first step to solving the problem. We must reduce the level of taxation both in personal terms and as it applies to industry.  I am not saying that it is merely a question of collecting less tax.  It would be foolish to say that.  While reducing the levels of taxation we should collect the enormous amounts of tax that are not being collected now because of the high levels of taxation and because of the magnitude of the black market.</P>
    <P>There are two very good proposals from the committee in respect of finance. The first is for the setting up of a scheme whereby personal savings could be channelled into small business loans with the payment of tax free interest to investors. The committee proposed that such loans could be made available at lower rates of interest and that the scheme could be administered by the associated banks with the agreement of the Department of Finance.  This is a novel proposal.  It represents a method by which countless millions of pounds could be channelled into small industry.  In this way we might succeed in having huge amounts of money taken from under beds or brought back from the Isle of Man.  A similar scheme has been tried in France and has proved tremendously successful.  It is not something that would cost the Exchequer money so I trust the Minister will respond <Col N="2234" /> positively to it.  There is also the question of equity finance.  Because of the serious need in this area, the committee's proposal should be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>On the question of management I should like to deal first with the Minister's point regarding our proposal outlining the necessity to set up a specialist in-company management training programme. The Minister is incorrect in his conclusion as to the effect of this approach because the present system of in-company training is far from satisfactory. Taking the present rate of progress of AnCO in this regard, 20 years will elapse before the last company is reached.  The vast majority of small firms are in need of specialist in-company managment training.  I disagree totally with the Minister when he says that such a programme will cost huge amounts of money.  Our proposal is to organise the system on a regional basis so that the agencies can come together and become more effective by using the resources in the regions for the proper implementation of the programme.  The main resource is education and in that sense the main bodies are the regional technical colleges and the universities.  A programme of the type we envisage would provide a very good return on the investment involved.  Initially, a certain amount of money would be required but those small companies are prepared to pay for the service.  What is more important is that the benefit that would accrue to them would more than adequately compensate them for their outlay.  It is impossible for a couple of people running a small company to be experts in accountancy, research, marketing, management and so on.  That is why these companies must be given assistance.</P>
    <P>We will be pressing very hard for the introduction of this scheme even on a pilot basis.  Another reason why it should not prove expensive is that there is a good deal of talent in the regions.  For instance, there are many retired executives who would be only too glad to work on a consultancy and part time basis.  There <Col N="2235" /> are many determined and highly motivated young graduates who are not employed and who, too, would be willing to work for small remuneration.  There is a lot of potential in the involvement of the third level institutions.  The present system whereby the managers of small companies are expected to come up to the IMI in Dublin for a number of days is not satisfactory.  The levels of assistance and training are totally inadequate for industry.  The benefit that accrues under the present system of training to small firms is negligible.  It must be changed and significant change is required if we are to provide for small industry the basic service they deserve.</P>
    <P>The question of management generally has been neglected.  I submit that the attitude adopted by the committee in this regard should be adopted by the Government, that is, that good management must be regarded by Government as a good investment and that a significant increase should be brought about in both expenditure and effort on management training.  We say that Government should restate the fundamental need for more management skills in small industry and make a clear policy statement on the responsibility of the various State agencies involved.  The reason we say that is that in the past couple of years &mdash; and I am not being in any way political in this &mdash; finance for the area of management has been reducing in real terms.  The Government must make up their minds that investment in good management brings about a good return and that the extra money spent will result in an increase in revenue to the Exchequer. For that reason the reduction in the amounts being allocated to such bodies as the IMI must be arrested.  There must be a new approach.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the area of marketing. This area, together with the areas of finance and management are the ones I consider to be the most important for small businesses because they are the areas in which small businesses are falling down.  We have totally neglected the whole concept of marketing.  We have <Col N="2236" /> endeavoured to produce good quality articles, we have put money into the setting up of industry and have been successful, but we have failed miserably to create markets.  At home we are being beaten all over the place by imports and we are failing to make an impact on foreign markets despite the fine efforts of CTT.</P>
    <P>In the matter of buying Irish, I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State on the two efforts they have made in regard to supermarkets and State agencies. However, this is only scratching the surface.  The Minister's insistence on a policy of opening up markets is shortsighted because though European countries may express similar ideals they do not put them into practice.  That is clear from the position in Britain, Germany and France, in particular.  Britain has a very strong campaign to encourage the purchase of British food.  In France we have seen evidence of what amounts to blackmail on firms who do not support French products.  In Germany we have examples of very strong pressure on industry and on the people to support home industry.  The Minister told us that he cannot put on such pressure here because he is prevented from doing so by a decision of the European Court.</P>
    <P>I accept that prevents him from taking direct action, but unless it comes from this House and unless we as politicians provide the proper climate for our people to support Irish industry we will continue our economic lunacy of buying foreign products.  I have spoken about this in the House on a number of occasions, because it is clear to me that we as politicians have failed Irish industry through our inability to put clearly to the people the lunacy of continuing to support foreign products at the expense of the Irish equivalent.  I am sure we can make a massive change in people's attitudes if we go the right way about it.</P>
    <P>We have dealt with this in a small way in this report, but we have dealt with it more widely in our more recent report on retail distribution.  I will refer to two proposals in that report which are relevant <Col N="2237" /> to this debate.  One recommends a nationwide campaign, a consumer campaign, for people committed to the purchase of Irish products who would be proud to say so and would be proud to use such slogans as &ldquo;I am for Ireland&rdquo; or &ldquo;I support Irish&rdquo;.  They would display those slogans and in so doing would indicate immediately to shop assistants that they want Irish products.  I suggest we should have a young Ireland movement to put forward this campaign so that we would get it across to all our people that by supporting Irish products they would be supporting Irish industry and, in the last analysis, themselves.</P>
    <P>I am not saying for a moment that we should ask anybody to buy an Irish product inferior in quality or price.  I am suggesting that we ask the people simply to look for Irish products and give them a chance.  If they do not match up we can leave them where they are.  Many industries have much work to do to ensure that they will be capable of competing with imported products.  Many of them cannot do so at the moment.  If they cannot match up at home how can we expect them to compete in outside markets?</P>
    <P>The report has a number of recommendations on marketing, and I should like to refer to two or three of them.  The chairman of the committee referred to recommendation No. 4, the establishment of a sales agency service in our main export markets, involving the deployment of first class marketing executives, mainly in Europe, in Britain and the US, backed up by a proper network of warehouse facilities across Europe and America.  Small businesses cannot afford to get into the export business because of the whole range of difficulties involved. With the establishment of the marketing system we have recommended, to be operated by CTT, there is massive potential for export growth for small firms. Indeed a number of such firms who got into business in the US in the recent past have shown the results that can be achieved through a proper marketing system.</P>
    <P>The opposite has occurred because of <Col N="2238" /> the limitations of CTT in regard to putting marketing executives into the field. They have been limited in resources to provide warehousing facilities in foreign parts.  I urge the Minister to adopt the two proposals I referred to, as a matter of urgency.  I am satisfied that the extra money spent would more than pay for itself in extra returns for Irish industries.</P>
    <P>I will refer to proposal No. 5 in which we suggest that grant assisted new marketing or trading companies be set up, the grants would cover office accommodation, equipment, transport and working capital.  Such companies would take over marketing arrangements for small manufacturing firms.  They would do market research, sales promotion, distribution and give advice on new product development. This proposal would give assistance to many small firms who do not have either the capability to carry out their own marketing or the financial ability to involve themselves in sales promotion. The small amount of money that would have to be invested to grant assist young marketing graduates to set up such marketing or trading companies abroad would bring a good return on the investment. Many small firms are manufacturing first class products but they do not have a proper marketing structure.</P>
    <P>We have a recommendation in regard to the involvement of third level education institutions.  We have been making the disastrous mistake of trying to keep education separate from the world of work.  This has been a grave disadvantage to education and to industry.  In recent years we have seen the folly of it and we have consequently begun to open up our third level institutions.  There is vast potential in third level education to give assistance to industry on all fronts.</P>
    <P>University College, Galway in my constitutuency has provided a great example. Due to the efforts of the president, the university has decided to become involved in the world of work.  An industrial liaison has been established and industry has benefited greatly.  The wealth, talent and expertise of those institutions should be made available to every industrial <Col N="2239" /> discipline and they should be financed in order to do so.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about a huge amount of finance.  I am satisfied that two of the proposals which we have made would involve very small amounts of money, but they would have a great reward for both the colleges and the industry.  The first is the provision of awards in science and technology to support post-graduate students in co-operative research projects between third level institutions and companies or organisations either in the public or private sector.  For that we are looking for £40,000 to fund 10 awards. The second proposal, the sixth on our list, is that funds should be made available to bring student ideas to a stage where they could be considered under the feasibility grant scheme.  We are looking for £5,000 per university college on a pilot basis so that students could be encouraged to seriously consider the possibility of setting up their own business as an alternative to seeking employment in the traditional fashion.  I am convinced that putting money into those areas will have an undoubted benefit both for the students and industry.</P>
    <P>In the commerce faculty of University College, Galway, one of the most important aspects of getting a commerce degree is the project which students must do in putting together proposals for their own small business or industry.  That is a welcome departure from the type of education which existed in third level institutions in my time.  It should be encouraged and supported.  When I see the work of a young marketing professor in Galway, Jim Ward, and the great assistance he is giving to small industry in the west without any resources I wonder what his potential would be if he was given a small amount of financial assistance.</P>
    <P>There are a number of recommendations in this area which do not involve very large amounts of money and which could only benefit small industries.  For the Minister to ignore or fail to implement them would be the best example of him turning his back on small industry. <Col N="2240" /> Up to now, this House did little to assist small industry.  When this committee was set up I believed it was the most important of all the Oireachtas committees.  I am now satisfied since it produced this report that it is the most important one. We were assisted in our work by small industry.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the meeting with the Minister and to him indicating how many of the proposals he will implement.  If he cannot give good reasons for not implementing the proposals I do not see much point in the committee studying other areas.  I appeal to the Minister to implement as many of the proposals as possible in this first report on manufacturing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the general overriding principle of government must be to gear the country to a position in which economic activity will have a natural momentum.  I have no doubt that the encouragement of a climate in which a strong indigenous small business sector will flourish will go a long way to solve our great problem of unemployment.  There must be incentive to work, just reward for the risk taker and profit no longer a dirty word.  Success must be applauded and rewarded. Approximately 90 per cent of small manufacturing firms are Irish owned. Small firms, under the terms of reference of the committee, are those which employ up to 100 people.  I take the Minister's point but I do not think we need to worry about it unduly.  Most of the firms which employ from zero to 100 people look to the Government and to the committee for help, advice and aid generally. In 5,000 of these small companies the owner and manager are usually one and the same person.  He or she must also cope with the marketing end of things, production, industrial relations and administration.  One person usually deals with all the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are deficiencies in our history, culture and education when it comes to the business field.  The complexity of an industrial civilisation requires an early grounding in finance, administration, <Col N="2241" /> political and computer skills.  Computer literacy is essential for all school-leavers. When one considers this fine report in conjunction with the White Paper on Industrial Policy and the Minister for Education's &ldquo;Programme for Action in Education&rdquo; we should be assured that the issues have been diagnosed correctly, that the solution has been prescribed and that we must now wait, hopefully not for too long, for evidence of a remarkable recovery.</P>
    <P>I referred to our deficiencies in education and to the Minister's plan.  It is heartening to see the co-operation between the different Departments that appears to exist in this field, particularly as it pertains to small businesses.  As regards the primary school area and curriculum, the Minister for Education is endeavouring to establish pilot projects for the teaching of science and the use of computers in a selected number of national schools.  It was stated in that document that it was intended to supply micro-computer facilities to post primary schools which had not yet benefited under the scheme.  She stated that as far as possible all students should have the opportunity of becoming familiar with the role of computers in modern society. In reference to third level education &mdash; an area which is of prime interest to manufacturing industry &mdash; the Minister stated that priority in financial support from the Department of Education would be given to those academic developments which are geared to developments in modern society and which would ensure that our graduates are kept abreast of rapidly changing technology and can compete with graduates from other countries.  She also mentioned that a review was to be carried out regarding the extent to which regional technical colleges have succeeded in achieving the goals originally set for them in the report of the steering committee on technical education.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the links between higher education and industry would be intensified, and referred to the input of the NBST.  She stated that it had a major role to play in this area, and <Col N="2242" /> recently announced an expanded higher education industry link scheme to operate in conjunction with the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, this to meet the specialist needs of industry and give the support necessary to post-graduate studies in the industrial area.</P>
    <P>Continuing the theme of how important the role of education is in industry and how it impinges on the work of our committee, I refer to the Minister's speech on the Estimate for education this year.  The Minister said that, as is the case with second level education, there is a need for closer links between the third level institutions and the world of work. She said that a good deal had already been accomplished in this area and that links have been forged between the industrial and the commercial world with a number of our third level institutions. This link is mutually beneficial.  She gives a good example of the co-operation between higher education institutions and industry, especially industry which is sponsored by the NBST which has been very successfully developed by, for example, the dairy science faculty in UCC and County Cork co-operative in the processing of cheese for export.</P>
    <P>Another project quoted involved the NIHE in Limerick and the development there with funding from the NBST of an automatic power supply test system.  The success of this venture led to the formation of a new company to produce and market the product.  The company are now selling automatic power supply test systems here, the UK and in the US. Perhaps there is not a general awareness of how our education system is linked to industry.  This is a very important and growing feature of the higher education system.  The National Micro-Electronics Centre attached to UCC is a good example. It has twin objectives of educating engineers to work in the micro-electronics industry and serving as a centralised research and development laboratory where co-operative university and industry projects can be carried out.  This centre has been a determining factor in <Col N="2243" /> attracting major electronic firms to Ireland. I give these examples to indicate the need for ongoing co-operation between the Department of Education at all levels of education, primary, secondary and tertiary and those of us who are interested in small industries.</P>
    <P>We must also refer to the role of career guidance in secondary schools.  I have got the impression for some time and I am still of the opinion that some career guidance teachers feel that there is something less than respectable in encouraging young people into the business arena when they leave school.  There is still an emphasis on the safe, secure, pensionable job in the bank, the professions or the public service.  Far too little emphasis is laid on encouraging an entreprenurial spirit among our young people and identifying to them the possibilities of a safe and secure future in the business arena.</P>
    <P>In mentioning the entrepreneur and technocrat there is a very sad aspect at present, that there is not sufficient reward for these people because of the tax climate in this country and we are exporting the best brains in this field.  It is a tragedy in the long term as well as in the short term because we were hoping to look to these people for recovery in this area to a large extent.  I hope this can be redressed and that the situation will be rectified so that it will be worth these people's while to stay at home and invest their talent here.</P>
    <P>Turning briefly to some aspects of the report under the recommendations of finance, there is a major problem in regard to the debt equity ratio in most small companies in the country.  Many firms were under capitalised when they were set up.  Increasing venture capital loan availability is very welcome, and I refer to the business expansion scheme announced in the budget, but it is not the answer in itself.  Additional equity will not necessarily increase capitalisation. Apparently in this country we would rather be 100 per cent owners of unsuccessful companies rather than 40 per cent owners of successful companies.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are crippling our competitiveness. <Col N="2244" /> When we take inflation into account, real interest rates are very serious in regard to our ability to sell what we manufacture at a competitive price. Our competitors in the market have lower interest rates, lower rates of inflation and lower energy costs to industry generally.  Much has been said in recent days about the price of energy to industry generally.  This morning we are concerned with the price of energy to the small manufacturing business sector. Our track record in this area is lamentable to say the least.  In comparison to our competitors abroad our rates are very high.  A lot has been said about this, and I am not aware of how we are going to act.  I know there is a report on the Minister's desk and I await with interest the outcome of how we can resolve the problem of the crippling rates of electricity to industry generally.  It must be resolved without increasing the burden on the consumer.  It is a very difficult equation, but I await with interest the outcome of the Minister's deliberations, and the whole business world also awaits the outcome.</P>
    <P>The chapter on management generally has received a poor response from those that the committee had hoped would relate to us.  The Minister said some things about management this morning. He indicated very forcefully that it was not the State's business to manage companies and interpreted some of our recommendations as pointing in this direction.  I can state categorically that this is not so.  I have already mentioned the importance of an educational system geared towards the business environment, which could relieve the State agencies of an awful lot of investment and aid to the manager when he is involved in a company.  If that investment was made through the Department of Education, through the educational system, there would be need only for a very small top up by the State agencies when it comes to the business arena.  We must remember when we talk of State aid and investment that we are not just referring to State agencies.  The Department of Education is a State agency of a kind in that it <Col N="2245" /> educates our children for the future, and an awful lot of money is channelled through that Department to our children. It is up to all of us to ensure that they are getting the education that fits them best for this country in which I hope they will all be able to earn their living some day.</P>
    <P>The State agencies must accept some responsibility in developing management programmes and skills and in co-ordinating their policies.  Marketing in general has been a Cinderella area of business for far too long.  We have a small, open and highly competitive economy, and it is sobering to realise that much of our 1983 imports bill of £7,400 million comprised raw materials and other goods that could not be manufactured in this country.  We have ample evidence for the scope of import substitution in this fact and figure alone, and evidence for the necessity of product identification in this field, particularly in the area of consumer goods.</P>
    <P>The whole area of State procurement should be closely scrutinised.  We must demand that the public sector is loyal to small manufacturing industry.  We also recognise that we demand of the public sector that they balance their books. Here we come back to the whole area of competitiveness in the manufacturing field in Ireland.  It is a tragedy that we cannot produce goods that our public sector needs more cheaply than our competitors abroad, notwithstanding the fact that transport and import costs have to be added to the product.  They are still more expensive to produce in this country. A sum of £3,500 million of the non-salary expenditure of the public service was spent in purchasing items from the manufacturing sector.  We had a good example recently of the tragedy that the lack of competitiveness of this country means to employment.  Springs Limited in Wexford were the only company in Ireland who produced a certain type of spring needed by CIE for their buses. They also produced items which were needed by Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company and many other semi-State bodies.  They employed 40 people for several generations in Wexford town.  Those products can now be bought more <Col N="2246" /> cheaply abroad by the public sector because of the difference in price.  That is an example of the overriding tragedy for the small industries sector here.  Even our public sector cannot be serviced by our industries because of the huge difference in the price and because we are not competitive.  Our inflation rates are too high, our interest rates have been consistently too high, our energy prices have been too high and because of the tax climate here we are on a hiding to nothing. I commend the recommendations in this area and I hope the Minister will take them on board, together with some of the fine proposals in his own White Paper on Industrial Policy.  No amount of State aid or State crutches will take away from the reality that until the tax climate here is right we will not be able to generate the economic activity that will have a natural momentum and allow successful development of industry and companies generally.</P>
    <P>We must also assist small firms in overcoming technical barriers.  This matter has been mentioned by other speakers. We must not shy away from technical barriers if they result in demanding the same standards from others as we expect from ourselves.  Here I can give an example of the only company in Ireland producing solid fuel cookers.  Recently the IIRS recommended to the Minister certain regulations with regard to the interests of the consumers as regards solid fuel cookers.  Yet, the IIRS told the Minister that the regulations should not be made mandatory.  I ask why.  Have we not a duty to the consumer to expect the same from importers as we demand from our own manufacturers?  There is only one company in Ireland producing solid fuel cookers.  They have approximately 40 per cent of the market here and they produce a high quality item that is in great demand here but yet we cannot look to technical trade barriers of the most positive kind to demand that imported products are up to the quality of those produced here. We must ask the IIRS why they did not recommend that the recommendations be mandatory.  Perhaps there was too <Col N="2247" /> strong a lobby from vested interests outside this country?  Perhaps the lobby in respect of Irish interests was not strong enough?  What does it take to get positive protection, to get the technical barriers that operate in every other country, barriers that only demand quality?</P>
    <P>The impact of technology generally on product development cannot be over-stressed. We look to the third level institutions to obtain and disseminate information in this area.  Their expertise and facilities must be made fully available for the benefit of industry.  Quality control is another essential ingredient for success.  Without that we will not be in a position to demand premium prices for our goods.  I have a feeling we will never be very successful as a country in the mass production of items.  It is in the quality product we can shine and where we should lead the way in many areas.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to State agencies and I have touched on that matter very briefly.  Generally they are perceived to need co-ordination and rationalisation in respect of State support to industry.  The Minister mentioned, and our report recommends, one-stop-shops for aid and advice to industry.  In the White Paper on Industrial Policy the Minister suggests one per region but we suggested one per county.  I stand over our recommendations on this matter.  I urge the Minister to look at the matter again and to accept our recommendations. The south east region would be one of the first areas where the one-stop-shops will be set up.  I understand it will open in Waterford in January 1985.  These shops will be glorified advice centres.  Perhaps it is not practical to expect every State agency to be represented by a person in these one-stop-shops.  I understand there will be qualified people there who will give advice on what is available from all the agencies in the various fields of industry.  I ask the Minister and the House to look at the matter and compare what is suggested now with the work the county development teams have been doing during the years in each county and <Col N="2248" /> not at regional level.  I think the advice, direction and support of county development teams and their officers have gone unrecognised for far too long.  What we are now doing could be adding an extra tier of advice and direction, advice and direction that are already available on a more accountable basis in each county for those who are interested in having their questions answered.</P>
    <P>The one-stop-shop per region will not add a lot to what is available on a county basis.  I should prefer to see extra support given to the concept of county development teams, where all help and advice is easily accessible to an individual.  I wonder if people will travel from the more remote parts of Wexford to Waterford for advice regarding the feasibility of products they have in mind to manufacture? Will they find it any easier to speak to a person in an office in Waterford than they would to a county development officer in Wexford with whom they are probably on first name terms?  I do not think we will achieve any more than has already been achieved by the county development teams.  If money is to be invested in this area, if services are to be increased and if advice and aid is to be available on a more accountable basis, let us have it on a county basis.</P>
    <P>The national linkage programme between the IDA and the IIRS as announced in November 1983 is to be commended and we look to it for great results in the near future.  When talking about State agencies I caution against over-dependence on the State generally when it comes to industry.  Let us look at what has happened in New Ross in recent times.  The people there, faced with a huge unemployment problem, have set up a self-help programme.  They have set up their own industrial development team and recently they appointed their own industrial development officer, financed by local industry.  This is a tremendous example of the people doing something for themselves rather than depending too much on the State.  I commend this approach to many other areas.</P>
    <P>The IIRS have given a tremendous service in various areas of research and <Col N="2249" /> development in product testing.  There is one issue with which I have been concerned for some months and I was delighted the committee took it up.  The IIRS run a dye-house service for small textile companies.  There are more than 2,000 people employed in 60 small textile companies.  These people were finding it impossible to get small lots of yarn dyed and tested and the IIRS were providing this service in name at least.  They were under tremendous pressure when the only other people in the field, Smith Hayward, closed down in the past 12 months. Our committee used their role and their interest in small businesses to ensure that this service will be continued by the IIRS, at least until someone in the commercial field takes up the service and relieves the supplier of the responsibility.  Without this ongoing service by State agencies 2,000 jobs will be at stake and the future of 60 small textile companies will be in serious question.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem in the area of taxation in small industries generally. The major call is for a general improvement in the tax climate so that the natural momentum of economic activity can be generated.  Business people in general and industrialists complain about being unpaid tax collectors.  They have to deal with reams of paperwork when it comes to PRSI, PAYE and VAT returns.  The bookwork involved is tremendous.  I hope that the Minister for Finance will be able to take on board our recommendation of £500 credit against a VAT bill for those companies who are not in a position to employ an accountant.  This we have suggested for some time, and it would be a tremendous incentive for those companies who are doing what they consider to be Government business, in effect collecting taxes.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about our multitier system of VAT rates.  Ideally one VAT rate is what we should aim at for the future but it is not practicable at the moment and would not get political acceptability.  However, we could reduce the six rates of VAT down to two or three <Col N="2250" /> with perhaps not much difficulty and certainly no loss of revenue.  I opposed VAT at point of entry strenuously at the time it was proposed.  Now I realise that it is not possible to dismantle this without a tremendous effect on the balance of payments in any one year.  However, I urge that the VAT guarantee system at the point of entry should drop as soon as possible because it is causing a serious cash flow crisis amongst our small industries in particular.  Those with a good record of repayments in this area could surely be allowed to drop this guarantee scheme.  It is very easy to implement it if there are defaulters.  I urge that our recommendation in this be taken on.</P>
    <P>In regard to our legal recommendations, I would like to mention the protection of Employment Act, 1977.  Like many other members of the committee, I am coming increasingly to the conclusion that this is acting as a disincentive to full time employment.  It has little effect on part time employment.  While there may be a case to be made for increasing even statutory redundancy payments, some system must evolve whereby the company themselves do not feel that they will be blackmailed in a redundancy situation. The result of all this is that many companies who have sections which are not viable now cannot afford to streamline or cut out those sections because of their worry about redundancy commitments over and above the statutory redundancy situation.  In many cases the entire industry is in danger of being pulled under by action not being taken when necessary.  We can all give examples of this happening throughout Ireland. Because of loyalty to employees or fear of what the redundancy situation might be, companies go on from hand to mouth month in and month out and eventually the whole thing goes under because the problems were not faced and tackled in time.  The net loser in all of this is the employee because jobs are being lost as a result.  As we look to the small manufacturing industry generally to create employment which is badly needed we must recognise that an adequate reward for the risk taker is paramount.  No <Col N="2251" /> amount of State support will ever substitute for adequate reward for the risk taker.</P>
    <P>This is an agreed report.  I urge the Minister to take on board all our recommendations. I thank our chairman, my colleague Deputy Ivan Yates, and Shane McAuley, clerk of the committee, for their tremendous work and personal commitment to the outcome of our committee. The only recipe for economic activity is to generate a natural momentum and have a tax climate suitable for business to flourish in.  I appeal to the Minister not to let the dust gather on this report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I compliment the members of the committee on the excellent report which they have submitted. Most of us will agree with most of the recommendations in that report. There are one or two things with which I disagree.  I mention the views of the committee in relation to legislation on maternity leave which they consider may have been counter-productive.  I do not agree with their views in that regard.  That is one of the minor differences that I would have with the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot at this time divorce the problems of small industry from the problems of industry generally, and this has been mentioned on more than one occasion.  High energy costs, transportation costs, isolation of industry in various regions, difficulty with communications and so on all present problems.  One aspect we tend to forget in relation to small industry is the impact of closures of bigger industries on small associated industries.  Very often far more consideration would be given to the major industries and far more attention would be paid to them if those in authority understood fully the total impact that a closure could have on a whole range of small associated businesses which are running alongside the major industry and which are totally devastated and upset at the closure of a <Col N="2252" /> large firm.  I speak today in particular about the impact that the closure of the Burlington industry in Clonlara, County Clare, a £30 million industry in the textile business, will have.  The losses will be severe.  The 250 people employed in that industry will lose their jobs, but the associated small industries running alongside that providing services and bits and pieces for that industry to enable it to operate successfully will be devastated by the closure of an operation such as the Burlington plant.  Here we see an industry which has been undergoing difficulties in production ranges for the last year or two.  It should have been apparent to Government agencies that problems would arise unless massive investment, restructuring and re-equipment and other development took place there.  It will be essential for the development agencies and for the Government to ensure that action is taken at this stage before the plant closes to alleviate the difficulties for the 200 to 300 people directly involved there but above all to ensure that there is some prospect of salvaging some of the jobs and providing some hope for the small industries attached to, dependent on and surviving alongside Burlington.</P>
    <P>Out of all the development agencies we have at present I do not believe that there is in the whole structure a person with either the responsibility or authority to walk into any industry in any region and say to the management there &mdash; not to take over his management but to motivate that management &mdash;&ldquo;I am from a development agency of the State.  My function here is to see how I can assist you to double your workforce here, increase your range of products, help you in your marketing structure whatever it is.  I have money available to me to help you to do that&rdquo;.  This is a basic weakness in the whole development agency structure that we have established and developed here over the years since the foundation of the State.  I support the view of the one-stop-shop, provided you turn it the other way round and that the one-stop-shop man is given the responsibility and function to go into small industry in particular and motivate it in a way that will allow us to say to him, &ldquo;I can assist you.  I have so <Col N="2253" /> much funds available and I can arrange whatever other funding is necessary for you.  You can double your output and your workforce.  I am here to help you and this is how we propose to do it&rdquo;.  In recent times in particular there has been a move away from attention at regional and local levels to more centralisation of the activities of the development agencies. The IDA in particular seem to be developing within their organisation an attitude that from here on all decision making and all activities relating to particular industries in regions should be dealt with in a centralised way, going over the heads of local and regional management, going over the heads of the field workers in an area.  We need to strengthen regional decision making. One of the basic weaknesses at present relates to the new trend that is developing in the IDA to centralise all activities in Dublin and, if possible, take away from the regional offices the decision making. That is a retrograde step and must be rectified soon.  I believe in regionalisation and in strengthening the role of regional offices.  They must be given the authority to make decisions in regard to local industries. Local officials are better acquainted with the area than those centralised in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention some of the small industries success stories in my region.  One relates to the small industrial estate of Smithstown at Shannon.  There we have a unique example of how local industries can work alongside a major industrial estate.  Through the aegis of SFADCo it has been possible to identify a whole range of products which can be produced for major industries in the area. Those products are produced by small industries in the Smithstown estate. Component parts which in the past have had to be imported are manufactured there.  That estate has been a remarkable success.  The GAC bus plant employs almost 350 people in the Shannon Industrial Estate while in the Smithstown Industrial Estate a small industry employs in the region of 200 people producing parts for those buses.  That is a first class example of import substitution. That should be developed in other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2254" /> I support most of the views expressed by the committee.  If industrialists can identify a good product, get the price structure right and deliver it on time they will succeed.  However, there is a need for more investment in education and we should concentrate on directing young people into the industrial area.  That can be done if there is closer co-operation between the schools and industries.  That should be done at second level.  I can recall as Minister of State at the Department of Labour launching a school-industry linked scheme in Drogheda. That example has been followed in other areas.  We are aware that the transition from school to work is one of the biggest problems our young people face.  More attention should be paid to that area. While the report is useful there must be more Government action to deal with the problems being faced by all industrialists.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Taoiseach, and the Minister, on establishing the Committee on Small <Col N="2256" /> Businesses which consists of 16 Members of the three main parties in the House. The Members have a thorough knowledge of the problems that confront manufacturing industry.  It is important that we have sound manufacturing industries run by people who have pride in their products and are competitive on the home and export markets.  It is vital for manufacturing industries that all avenues are explored to capture home and export markets.  Our industries should be in a position to compete with the best of opposition.</P>
      <P>The need for small industries is greater now than at any time in the past.  We should aim to promote the establishment of small businesses in all towns and villages. I dislike the policies that operated down the years with huge sums of money being allocated to foreigners who did not have any stake in the country.  They came to reap the harvest of IDA grants but, having received the maximum amount, took the first plane back to Europe and forgot about the Irish people.  It is well known that many enterprising Irish people who approached the IDA for State aid were refused and those with an address at Dusseldorf, Paris or Amsterdam were facilitated in every way.  We must change that attitude and give our Irish entrepreneurs all the backing needed to get started.</P>
      <P>We should concentrate on industries that derive raw materials from within the State.  Why is it that we import £40 million worth of chipped potatoes when we have the finest climate in the world to grow potatoes?  All our supermarkets sell frozen chips imported from Holland, Belgium and Canada.  Our fishing industry could employ ten times more workers if properly operated.  We are only skimming the surface as far as that industry is concerned.  We must do something about smoking, marinating and canning.  We are falling down in our commitment to the fishing industry.  The Dutch and Norwegians are cashing in on that valuable industry while we stand idly by.</P>

      <P>It will be as well for me to get into top gear as quickly as I can bearing in mind the time available to me.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is very bad to commence any debate with an element of criticism. My criticism is this, that the time allocated to such an important item as this report, as ordered by the Government, is to me, in one word, &ldquo;deplorable&rdquo;.  The whole country at this time is turning its attention to the setting up of small industries as a means of redressing the massive unemployment obtaining.  I compliment the people who sat for many hours in an endeavour to present this report.</P>
      <P>I had a number of matters in the report underlined on which I had wanted to comment but time will not allow me. Under the heading of industrial costs the report had this to say:</P>
      <P>Although State policy towards small industry is one of support there are contradictions including, on the one hand, a variety of support services through various agencies and, on the other, excessively high charges for such State provided commercial services as electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here I want to emphasise the costs of electricity in view of the debate we had earlier this week as yet unfinished.  One of the most severe cost factors <i>vis-à-vis</i> our lack of competitiveness in small industries, indeed in large industries, has been highlighted in the report of this committee. I hope that when we resume the debate on the proposed costs of electricity to small industries the people who came into the House this morning, who waxed so eloquently, some of them for 35 minutes, will show, by marching up those steps, where they will go <i>vis-à-vis</i> small industries &mdash; rather than coming <Col N="2258" /> into this House taking up the time of Members who did not serve on that committee and who would have liked to contribute to this debate, pontificating, telling us what she or others could tell the relevant Minister of State.  I condemn that attitude.  I hope that the cost factor of electricity to small firms will be decided at the top of those steps by the people who are so concerned and who pontificated here this morning to us.  I recommend, as does this report, that there should be a third tier of electricity charges for small industries.  Import substitution is not being developed to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I could continue for much longer.  I must say that the legal aspect of small businesses constitutes a very serious problem for all firms but particularly for small ones which are labour-intensive and who may be unable to avail of the advantages of new technology.</P>
    <P>I see I am running out of time already.</P>

    <P>I shall conclude by saying that my message to the Government for small industries, indeed for all industry, is to create <Col N="2259" /> an incentive, to encourage development, to ease taxation, providing the kind of funds which will stimulate our stifled economy, giving back our people the incentive to work and to create work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret also, like other Deputies, that there was not sufficient time to debate this report.  As the time available to me is brief also, I should like to thank all members of the committee and of the House who spoke.  We shall study the Official Report and take up any of the points they have made.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal principally with the Minister's response to this report because I suppose in all respects, in relation to the implementation of this report, that is the most crucial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made three or four points.  First, he wanted to know what was a small firm, where is the line drawn? He said also that it was not altogether desirable that the Government should interfere in the management of private firms and said there would have to be strict cash limits, in terms of the implementation of industrial policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> State agencies, because we needed to create the right tax environment.  The reason I did not go into any of this &mdash; which is basically a justification for our over 80 recommendations &mdash; is that I should have thought such a fundamental point would already have been taken on board by the Minister.  Obviously his advisers are not at that level of understanding. Therefore, I should like now to justify it.  The criterion for assessing what is a small firm is both quantitative and qualitative.  There are assessments used both in Europe and in the United States with established criteria for so doing.  For example, in the United States and EC it is 1-500; in AnCO it is 1-80; in the IDA 1-50, in the Small Firms Association it is 1-100 and so on.  In relation to the qualitative criterion &mdash; which represents the level of output, of fixed assets and the level of employment &mdash; if there is any difficulty encountered in endeavouring to get statistics to justify a case for small <Col N="2260" /> firms, it is simply that the CSO are so out of date with regard to figures.  But, just on the figures they do have and those I have from the IDA annual employment returns, one can prove, first of all, that 93 per cent of all small firms are indigenous and do not have the potential to repatriate profits.  Therefore, any economic development there is purely for the good of this country.  Second, between the years 1973 and 1980 employment doubled in small firms.  The latest figures available to me say that, in 1982 &mdash; which figure subsequently increased &mdash; there were in excess of 99,750 people employed in small firms and small firms also represent 90 per cent of manufacturing firms. It needs to be pointed out also that 66 per cent of all exports belong to small firms.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if one views the picture in terms of employment, wealth creation and balance of trade, there is no doubt that if one is not prepared to zone in and assist small firms, then it must be said that one's industrial policy is unsoundly based.  Most people in the IDA will tell one that the level of mobility of industrial investment &mdash; take the high technology area of electronics &mdash; is extremely vulnerable, so that one must remember that as quickly as they came in they can pull out. There is the genuine fear felt &mdash; if one looks at the 500 per cent growth over the last ten years, the growth in the electronics &mdash; that the Scottish Development Agency, the Welsh Development Agency and the EC generally are now giving the types of incentives, in terms of grants, research and development and of corporation tax levels that Ireland was giving.  This means that the incentives we have are now being copied.  But we will not be able to keep pace with, say, Taiwan or Hong Kong <i>vis-à-vis</i> wages. Therefore, the future appears very vulnerable indeed.  It must be remembered that, unless one builds up one's base of small firm development, if one depends on multinationals who may be operating in 22 countries simultaneously, then one could find that, within a period of months, there would be a rapid loss of investment to the detrimental effect of our economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2261" /> The Minister spoke about interference in private companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that what we were getting at there, first of all, was a pilot scheme to assess whether the IPC, the IMI or AnCO could do a better job purely on the basis of redeployment, as was said by Deputy F. Fahey and others. The point we are making here is that very few people scrutinise our existing State agencies.  For example I did not hear the Minister this morning say that three years ago of the IDA personnel, 60 per cent were engaged in field work and 40 per cent in administration.  Now the position is that those figures have been turned around, with 60 per cent in the centrally-heated offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the type of accountability about which I am speaking, and which we must have.  Surely it is the primary role of politicians, in terms of policy, to monitor the State agencies that are advising the Minister and dictating the pace of policy.  Of course, they are on the inter-face of industrial development and, of course, their opinion must be taken into account.  Therefore, somebody must scrutinise them.  If we say that the interaction of small firms <i>vis-à-vis</i> State agencies is not adequate, is not localised, does not constitute the best type of consultancy service, that is a sufficient criterion for a change of direction.</P>
      <P>In those few words I have endeavoured to justify the need for a national policy for development of small firms in this sector.  Of course, I take the Minister's point about the tax environment.  The whole of our report on retail distribution says that that sector is being seen as a revenue earner, therefore, we say, get the State off their backs.  This sector is different.  There is here great potential for development, this is not a service sector, there is growth and employment potential here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2262" /> I thank the Minister for having acceded to our three requests in relation to the management committee, the three-yearly review and an early meeting with him.  All of our input by way of aiding industrial policy is there and available and I am glad that he has acceded to that point.  However, I should like the Minister to re-examine his position fundamentally in the context of the importance of small firms.  I hope that this debate will prove to be the first step in the implementation of our 80 plus recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Second Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism: The role of officers of Customs and Excise in controlling the supply of illegal drugs.</P>
      <P>We would be very foolish if we did not recognise that the problem of drug abuse in Ireland could become much worse if the necessary steps to prevent the import and distribution of illegal drugs are not taken in time.  Those who make huge financial gains from trafficking in drugs will take every opportunity to increase the number of drug abusers.  They do not discriminate between areas or social groups.  We in this House must make it clear that we will take any measure and provide any resources necessary to defeat them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are examining the whole area of drug-related crime and the controls which are needed to prevent the import and distribution of illicit drugs.  One of the areas which is considered to be vital is the control which operates to prevent illegal drugs from entering the country. This report relates to the important part played by customs officers.  It highlights <Col N="2263" /> the need for an interdepartmental co-ordinated approach to the drugs problem. Our report, of necessity, has to deal with areas of health, justice and finance. We welcome the presence of the Minister for Finance here today.</P>
    <P>I move this motion on behalf of the members of the Select Committee.  We have been working for nearly a year now and have, to date, produced five reports and hope to present two further reports to the Dáil in the near future.  Apart from the reports on neighbourhood watch and vagrancy, which have already been debated in this House, our other two reports deal with controls on the private security industry and a recent visit by myself and Deputies Mitchell and Wallace to Scotland Yard.  I hope that we will have an opportunity in the near future to consider these two reports.</P>
    <P>The members expressed serious concern about the problem of drugs and drug-related crime and a sub-committee was established to consider how best to tackle this topic.  The sub-committee members were of the opinion that the question of controls by officers of Customs and Excise at the points of importation of illegal drugs could be considered as a separate topic and a report produced.  Other areas will be the subject of a further report, for example: Garda surveillance on movement and dealing in drugs both within and outside the country and Garda community relations.  Matters relating to the prosecution of drug offenders including the leglislation under which drug pushers and abusers are prosecuted. The question of imprisonment for drug dealers and abusers and the provision of treatment facilities and alternatives to imprisonment for drug addicts. The need for increasing awareness of the dangers of addiction.  The committee had a meeting with representatives of the Irish Customs and Excise Union which had made a submission to us on the role that customs officers could play in the efforts to come to grips with illegal trafficking in drugs.  We subsequently had a meeting with representatives of the Revenue Commissioners.  Both of these meetings proved very useful and informative <Col N="2264" /> and afforded us an opportunity to see the problem from both perspectives and to form a balanced view of the existing difficulties.</P>
    <P>We were anxious to have discussions with the Garda Commissioner or his representatives prior to finalising this report. The difficulties which we experienced with that request and which are outlined in our report, have, as I am sure the Members of this House are by now aware, been satisfactorily resolved.  At a meeting with the Commissioner on 26 July, he agreed that he and his representatives will attend at meetings of the committee to discuss any of the matters which are under consideration.  He will supply information on the practice and experience of the Garda Síochána but will not contribute to any policy recommendations. All members of the committee were very satisfied that this matter was resolved.  At no stage did we want the Commissioner to get involved in policy matters &mdash; this is clearly a matter for the committee members.  However, the Garda Síochána input into the committee's deliberations is essential if the committee is to have a balanced view of the various crime problems before making policy recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1984, under consideration in the House and the committee decided to produce this report as quickly as possible in order that those recommendations requiring legislative effect could be implemented immediately. This Bill provided an ideal opportunity for making the changes which we thought were necessary.  It also served to show the relevance of the committee system, if it is given an opportunity to develop and is taken seriously by the Government.  I will deal in more detail with our recommendations at a later stage, but before doing so I wish to outline the position in relation to the problem of drug smuggling and the role of customs officers.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of confusion up to about a year or two ago as to the true extent of the drug problem in Ireland. On the one hand we were being advised by some authorities that the problem of drugs was very minor while, as politicians, <Col N="2265" /> we were being told an entirely different story.  It was only when the Medico-Social Research Board undertook a survey of the misuse of drugs in one inner city area in Dublin in 1982 that a definite and reliable picture emerged in its report presented early in 1983.</P>
    <P>That study confirmed what many persons close to the problem had been saying for a number of years, namely, that there is a serious problem of drug abuse in certain areas and that it is particularly prevalent in the 15-24 age group.  This study found that the prevalence of heroin abuse in that age group was 10 per cent; but in those aged 15-19 it was 12 per cent and among females aged 15-19 it was 13 per cent.  These figures were in some respects a great deal worse than the equivalent 1970 figures for New York black ghettos especially where females were concerned.  This report confirmed that the findings of an earlier preliminary investigation, undertaken in July 1982, were not only realistic but, in fact, somewhat understated the scale of the problem.</P>
    <P>While the smuggling of drugs is, in itself, a criminal offence, the abuse of drugs has unfortunately led to a considerable amount of other crime in the community. This arises where addicts resort to crime in order to obtain the finances necessary to feed their habit.  The committee are convinced that this drug-related crime has been a big contributing factor in the rise in the level of recorded offences over the past few years.  The Garda Commissioner's Report on Crime for 1983 shows a total of about 102,300 indictable offences as compared with 64,000 in 1979, giving an overall increase of 59 per cent.  While there are varying estimates of the cost to feed an addict's habits, the committee was informed that it could cost anything between £100 and £300 for a heroin addict to feed his habit for one day.  This is, however, probably on the higher side of the scale and probably does not represent the picture for all addicts.  The need to finance this habit has led to a substantial rise in handbag snatching, larcenies and burglaries to which addicts resort in order to have the money to purchase illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2266" /> The committee consider that greater efforts must be made to tackle this crime problem and its source and this report has that objective, namely, tackle the basis of the problem and by reducing the supply of drugs reduce the consequential drug-related criminal activity.</P>
    <P>This country's first line of defence to the problem, namely, the barriers at the point of entry, must be geared to tackle the sources and prevent these commodities reaching the streets.  Such action, assuming that it were to be successful, would reduce the demands for expensive follow-up activity as well as reducing the unquantifiable social cost of drug addiction in a young person.</P>
    <P>We were informed by the Customs Union representatives that the present trend among drug smugglers is toward concealment on or in the body.  These persons are referred to as &ldquo;swallowers&rdquo; or &ldquo;stuffers&rdquo; and have created, and continue to create, serious problems for the Customs and Excise service.  We were advised that it can take from five to seven days for such concealed substances to pass through the body.  There have been instances where it has taken considerably longer &mdash; in one case in fact up to 15 days. Members should be aware that there is considerable danger for the person concealing such substances in such a manner. Cases are recorded where death has occurred following the accidental release of drugs within the body when the package ruptured.  This indicates the lengths to which some people will go to smuggle drugs and the obvious financial rewards to be gained by successfully bringing drugs through customs.</P>
    <P>The customs service operate, in so far as their role in drug smuggling is concerned, under the provisions of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, and the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934, which restrict the importation of certain controlled drugs, and customs officers are concerned with detecting offences involving the movement of such drugs across the customs frontier.</P>
    <P>Ireland, being an island, should be better placed than other countries to combat the drug problem at source, namely, the original supply into the country. <Col N="2267" /> It is at these points of entry that the customs service have a major role to play, and we support any steps taken to improve the level of service available for this purpose.  It must, at the same time, be realised that it is physically impossible to search every person coming into the country, and it is here that good intelligence work comes into operation.  It is essential that there be good liaison between the Garda and the customs service, and this aspect of the fight against drugs cannot be over-emphasised.  There may be a natural tendency for each organisation to maximise its own individual efforts to tackle the problem.  This could result in immediate short-term gains, but not tackle the root of the problem. For example, if a person coming into the country is carrying a sizeable quantity of drugs, it may be more beneficial not to detain him at customs but rather by alerting the Garda to have him put under surveillance.  This could result in having some of the people behind the deal arrested and charged with crimes relating to trafficking in illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>During the course of a recent visit to Scotland Yard by Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Wallace and myself, we had discussions with senior police officers in the Central Drugs Intelligence Unit.  We were advised that there is a Steering Committee consisting of representatives of the Home Office, the police and the customs service overseeing the efforts to tackle the drug problem.  They consider that this level of co-operation is essential if the authorities are to have a real chance of making inroads on the illegal trafficking in drugs.</P>
    <P>Within the customs service there are two grades of officers appointed to the outdoor service, namely, assistant officer &mdash; 383 persons &mdash; and officer &mdash; 312 persons &mdash; who are mainly concerned with the detection and prevention of smuggling at the ports, airports and along the land frontier.</P>
    <P>The customs procedures for dealing with drug smuggling were discussed with the representatives of both the Customs Union and the Revenue Commissioners. Officers of Customs and Excise are <Col N="2268" /> responsible for efforts to combat drug smuggling at the point of import only, or its immediate vicinity, while the illicit supply or use of drugs in all other areas of the country is a matter for the Garda. There is a very close working relationship between the Garda and the customs officers, and this spirit of co-operation must be continued and every effort and opportunity should be made or utilised to build on this.  The Revenue Commissioners, the customs officers and the Garda level of co-operation was quite striking, and also their co-operation with the committee was very welcome and heart warming.</P>
    <P>The committee were informed that when a customs officer seizes a quantity of dangerous drugs from an arriving passenger/or crew member, it is the practice to contact the Garda Drugs Squad. The time lapse between detection of the drugs and the arrival of the Garda Drugs Squad results in a &ldquo;limbo&rdquo; period during which the offender, as far as Customs and Excise are concerned, is, technically at least, free to continue his or her journey. The Customs Union representatives contended that, quite apart from the often embarrassing situations which can arise during such periods, it is very wasteful of the valuable time of both the Garda Drugs Squad and their members to have this duplication built into the system.</P>
    <P>While officers of Customs and Excise have statutory powers of arrest under the Customs (Consolidation) Act, 1876, there is an administrative prohibition by the Revenue Commissioners on the exercise of this power.  It appears that this prohibition was introduced because of the low level of penalties prescribed in the 1876 Act.  It is preferable to await the arrival of the Garda and have proceedings, if any, taken under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  The committee considered this to be a major problem and one which should be remedied immediately.</P>
    <P>The committee consider that immediate steps should be taken to enable officers of Customs and Excise to play a more effective part in the fight against the supply of illegal drugs, and we make recommendations in our report, which I <Col N="2269" /> will summarise now and elaborate on later.  Our recommendations are that:&mdash; 1.  The provisions of sections 23, 26, 27 (1) and (3), 28 and 29 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, should be extended to officers of Customs and Excise by way of amendments to Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1984; 2.  A small customs drugs unit should be established within the customs service; 3.  Once the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, are extended to officers of Customs and Excise, they should be free to immediately arrest and charge a person found to be smuggling drugs at a point of entry to the country. However, in this regard it is essential to ensure continued close co-operation and liaison with the Garda Drugs Squad; 4.  Adequate resources must be provided to the customs service to enable them to examine and search vehicles and persons at points of import or export; 5.  Urgent attention must be given and guidelines issued in connection with the procedures to be followed where there is suspected concealment on or in the body by persons generally referred to as &ldquo;stuffers&rdquo; or &ldquo;swallowers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will now outline some of the reasoning behind these recommendations.  The 1977 Act gives powers to the Garda to assist them in their efforts to tackle the drug problem but no mention is made of the customs service or of their requirements in this area.  They are the first in line to tackle the supply problem, and they should have similar powers to those of the Garda if they are to have a realistic chance of trying to deal with the problems of drug smuggling.  The committee consider that the following provisions in the Misuse of Drugs Act need to be extended to officers of Customs and Excise, namely, sections 23, 26, 27 (1) and (3), 28 and 29.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the 1977 Act provides specific powers for the Garda Síochána to search persons where a member with reasonable cause suspects that a person is illegally in possession of drugs.  Officers of Customs and Excise do not have authority to search a person who has not landed from a ship or aircraft.  This can be very important where an officer suspects the passing of drugs from an <Col N="2270" /> arriving passenger to a &ldquo;meeter&rdquo; or &ldquo;greeter&rdquo;, which we were advised is a common phenomenon.  The extension of the provisions of section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, to officers of Customs and Excise would overcome this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the 1977 Act provides for the issuing of search warrants to a named member of the Garda Síochána where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a drug offence has been committed. A customs officer may not legally attend or assist, in his capacity as an officer of Customs and Excise, at a search under such a warrant.  In order to do so, a second warrant, to be issued under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, would be required.  This creates unnecessary duplication especially where the attendance of such an officer is necessary to assist in the search.  It may, for instance, be advisable to have a customs officer present to examine import documentation. The provisions of section 26 should be extended to authorise customs officers to assist the Garda at searches where this is considered to be necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>The existing penalties for drug smuggling, where the offence is prosecuted by customs officers, are generally totally inadequate to meet present needs, and they should be the same as where similar offences are prosecuted by the Garda. The committee can see no good reason why widely differing penalties apply as between prosecutions brought by the customs and the Garda, two bodies having a responsibility for tackling the supply and movement of drugs.  This anomaly, which would necessitate an extension of the provisions of section 27 (1) and 27 (3) of the 1977 Act, should be rectified immediately.</P>
    <P>Courts have power, under section 28 of the 1977 Act, to remand persons convicted under certain sections of that Act, to obtain a report and in certain cases to arrange for the medical treatment or for the care of such persons.  Again this provision only applies where the offence is prosecuted by the Garda and the committee feel that a similar provision should apply where customs officials prosecute drug offences.  The committee are satisfied <Col N="2271" /> that the Revenue Commissioners are very conscious of their role in controlling the supply of illegal drugs and that the senior staff are fully committed to efforts to deal with this problem.  However, it appears that no officers are assigned fulltime to this very important task.  The committee consider the setting-up of a small drugs unit within the customs service as an immediate and essential requirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ten minutes at the end to reply.  Could I take five minutes now and five at the end of the debate? Thank you.  It is envisaged that this drugs unit would be small in number, perhaps three or four persons, who would be specially selected for membership of this unit.  We are not in a position to definitively quantify the numbers or grading of the necessary staff.  These are clearly matters for the Revenue Commissioners, as is the question as to whether this unit could be established through the redeployment of existing staff.  While we are not a position to quantify the cost of this proposal, we consider that it would be relatively modest, even in present financial circumstances, and especially in comparison with the scale of the drug problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This unit would be responsible for providing the necessary back-up services for customs officers around the country.  It would make arrangements for specialised training for all staff and for ensuring that there was an on-going programme of training and refresher training.  The committee understand that about 70 per cent of all officers have received training in this area and acknowledge the input made to date.  It appears from the huge increases in the level of drug seizures by customs officers that this training is having a significant impact on the effectiveness of the customs service.  The committee are of the view that if more emphasis can be given to this aspect of the work of Customs and Excise further substantial improvements in the level of <Col N="2272" /> seizures may take place.  The aim of this unit should be the eventual reduction in the supply of illegal drugs and any funds invested in such activities will reap substantial real savings in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Customs drug unit should liaise closely with the Garda drugs squad and be in a position to exchange information which may prove invaluable in the apprehension of drug smugglers and/or their accomplices.</P>
    <P>In 1981 the Revenue Commissioners introduced an American manufactured kit called the Nik Porta-pac testing kit for use at all customs posts to assist in the identification of drugs.  All officers received a half day's instruction in the use of these kits, which are very easy to use and which have proved to be very reliable.  Ireland was the first country in Europe to use these kits and since their introduction here they have been brought into use in the rest of Europe.  Section 186 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, authorises officers of Customs and Excise to arrest and charge persons suspected of customs offences.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have issued a direction prohibiting the exercise of this power without their prior consent.  The committee were advised this was done because the penalties which are prescribed in the 1876 Act and which would be applied in the event of a successful conviction, are very low in comparison with those set out in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>We are of the view that the penalties prescribed for customs offences related to drug smuggling should be increased to bring them into line with those in the 1977 Act and following this officers of Customs and Excise should have authority to use their powers of arrest.</P>
    <P>If the customs service is to have a realistic chance of successfully tackling the drug smuggling problem then not alone must the necessary legislative changes be introduced but adequate resources must be provided.</P>
    <P>The provision of sniffer dogs would considerably assist customs officers in detecting drugs.  The members realise that there are obvious limitations to their use as, for instance, where drugs are <Col N="2273" /> enclosed in certain protective materials which make it impossible for dogs to detect the drugs.  I understand that one dog is now being trained for this type of work.  The committee consider that this training should proceed and that further dogs should be provided as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the provision of adequate physical resources to enable the customs officers to effectively discharge their functions in the examination of vehicles and persons.  The committee are not in a position to comment on the level of such resources but we are advised that they are not adequate.  We have also been advised that there is a need for the provision of covered examination bays with pits, ramps and hoists to enable vehicles to be examined.  The Revenue Commissioners should examine the level of such facilities and consider if an improvement is necessary.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that X-ray and other specialised equipment be made available to the customs service.  While the committee favour the provision of any resources which may assist in the efforts to reduce the supply of illegal drugs, the members understand that there may be health and substantial financial problems in relation to certain x-ray equipment.  However, these possibilities should be considered by the Revenue Commissioners as, indeed, should the feasibility of using mobile units.</P>
    <P>We have had developments since the report and we are very glad to say that there have been a number of amendments in the House which brought the penalties for drug offences into line with those for offences prosecuted by the Garda, which empowered the courts to remand persons along the lines we requested earlier.  The provisions in the 1977 Act relating to defence proceedings have been extended to Customs and Excise and it has been provided that an officer of Customs and Excise could be named on a search warrant issued by a member of the Garda Síochána.  We are very happy that these steps have been taken and it can be seen that the purpose of the recommendations is to give the customs service the same legislative <Col N="2274" /> action as the Garda.  One recommendation was not acted upon, however, under section 23.</P>
    <P>Customs and Excise officers have an important part to play in the fight against the smuggling of illegal drugs.  They are very keen to help and their record, both in seizures of drugs and in their co-operation with the Garda, is excellent.  An indication of their success is the fact that in 1983 the customs service uncovered 427 kilograms of drugs out of a total of less than 550 kilograms seized by all agencies nationally.</P>
    <P>We presented this report in a very constructive spirit and I trust that it will be accepted in that spirit.  So far, it certainly has been.</P>

      <P>Could I begin by thanking my colleagues in the House, particularly Deputy Doyle, for giving me the opportunity of making a few comments on this report at this point in the debate.  I am sure that I am at one with all Members of the House in thanking the committee and their chairman for the way in which they have done their work and particularly for the way in which this report focuses attention on the principal issues which have to be addressed here.</P>
      <P>We are all of the same mind on this issue.  The kind of discussion that, we will have on this report will I hope, identify the priorities so that we can use the resources that we have and deploy them to the best effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prevention and detection of drug smuggling are the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners and officers of the Customs and Excise at points of entry into the State have the job of exercising their normal, proper vigilance in order to detect such smuggling.  We all appreciate that their task is a difficult one.  Even minute quantities of drugs can have very high street values.  Small quantities can easily be concealed on persons and in vehicles.  Comprehensive checking of persons and vehicles at points of entry would seriously impede the movement of passengers and cargoes.  Nevertheless, customs officers have to strike a balance between effective control and the needs <Col N="2275" /> of the legitimate travellers and traders. Drug smugglers, of course, are keenly aware of the difficulties in detecting drugs and are very quick to exploit opportunities and to invent new methods of concealment when the need arises.</P>
    <P>In this country we do not receive significant importations direct from countries which are known generally to be source countries for controlled drugs &mdash; for example, Pakistan, Thailand, Lebanon, Syria, India and parts of South America. From that point of view, consignments of goods from those countries would first come under customs control in another country before delivery here.  There is thus already the possibility of detection in that country in which they first come under customs control, which tends to be of assistance to us and to reduce the scale of a problem with which we would otherwise have to deal.</P>
    <P>The report mentions the international information exchange co-operation which already exists between the customs services in many countries and to which this country contributes.  I would also point out that the Garda have formalised communication procedures with other countries within the framework of Interpol. As Deputy Woods has already pointed out, customs officers maintain a very close liaison with the Garda Síochána in all matters relating to possible illegal importation of drugs.  The affects of this co-operation here, both at national and international level, are more extensive than is perhaps realised.  They have proved to be invaluable in the apprehension of smugglers and the interception of drugs.</P>
    <P>I do not in any way wish to suggest, or have my remarks taken to mean, that the position cannot be improved.  It is clear that we need to improve the situation as rapidly and as much as we can.  The Revenue Commissioners in order to do that have taken a number of steps to which I shall refer shortly.  All the measures currently deployed to detect smuggling are kept under review, including the deployment of customs staff.  While we would obviously wish to cut off completely the importation of illegal drugs, realistically <Col N="2276" /> we must accept that we will probably never be in a position to bring that about, even with a very substantial increase in customs staff.  The conclusion I draw from that is that we must concentrate in the most efficient manner possible those resources that we can make available.</P>
    <P>The special task force set up by the Government to consider all aspects of the drugs problem recommended that the penalties in the Misuse of Drugs Acts and the Customs Acts be aligned.  This has been done already in the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1984.  The task force recommended also the use of sniffer dogs, X-ray and other modern detector equipment.  As Deputy Woods has said, a sniffer dog for the customs is undergoing training.  A panel of prospective dog hunters has been established and the usefulness of this aspect of detection will be reviewed in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>In regard to modern detector equipment, our customs have been using sucessfully the most modern equipment available.  They are keeping abreast of developments in other countries and consideration will be given to the introduction of any worth while improvement that may be effected in the light of what might be its applicability here.  In regard to X-ray equipment there are certain considerations that must be taken into account, for example, the health risks that might be involved in respect of the staff operating the equipment and, I am obliged to say, also the cost involves.  The Revenue Commissioners are considering the possible effectiveness of other technical equipment.  Specialised equipment is in operation already on an experimental basis for the checking of container traffic.</P>
    <P>The Report has drawn attention to the lack of powers for customs officers in certain aspects of drug prevention and detection.  The lack of powers to accompany gardaí in the search of premises, under warrant, has been remedied in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals by the Revenue Commissioners for legislation to confer additional powers on customs officers <Col N="2277" /> similar to those conferred on the Garda under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, are being studied.</P>
    <P>These proposals relate to powers of detention and search of persons, vehicles, vessels or aircraft suspected of being concerned in the illegal importation or exportation of controlled drugs and to the search of premises or lands and the examination of suspect books, records or other documents.</P>
    <P>While there is no specific drugs squad within the customs service, the Customs Investigation Branch play a leading role in this area.  They co-operate with local staff as required and with the Garda. Many of the larger seizures in this country in recent years resulted from combined action by local staff, investigation branch and the Garda.  A higher officer and an officer attached to the investigation branch have direct responsibility for maintaining liaison with the Garda and with enforcement agencies in other countries and for the gathering and use of intelligence concerning dangerous drugs. These officers spend practically all of their official time on this work.</P>
    <P>Special operations are mounted from time to time at import points to ensure more effective control of the smuggling of illicit drugs from known sensitive areas.</P>
    <P>Customs officers have power to arrest and charge persons.  Such action is usually done with the prior authority of the Revenue Commissioners, but a collector of customs and excise can authorise and arrest or if he cannot be contacted, a surveyor or higher officer may give permission.</P>
    <P>The Report mentions the problem of obtaining valuation of drugs for the purposes of legal proceedings under section 186 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.  This problem has been overcome and the penalties in the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, which do not relate to value, now apply.</P>
    <P>In regard to the physical resources to assist customs officers in the effective examination of vehicles I am informed that existing fixed facilities are adequate at most points of entry.  Where special examination is deemed necessary and specialised facilities are required, goods <Col N="2278" /> and vehicles can be removed to places where such facilities are available.</P>
    <P>The committee and the chairman just now concentrated on the problems of drugs swallowers and stuffers.  This problem deserves a great deal of attention from a number of different points of view, for example, from the point of view of the illegal importation of drugs and also, as Deputy Woods said, from the point of view of the damage the people involved can do to themselves.  It is a problem of which the Revenue Commissioners are keenly aware and I am glad that we have the committee's reflections to add to the work of the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Regarding the manpower resources that are available, some 400 customs officers of varying rank are employed in preventive controls at airports, ports and land frontier stations.  These officials, as part of their duties, deal with smuggling by individuals as well as with the search of ships, aircraft and vehicles for contraband. They are trained in the identification and detection of drugs and they examine baggage and question selected passengers specifically as to possession of drugs, having regard in their selection to where the passengers originated and the transit points through which passage was made.</P>
    <P>As part of normal control of imports, commercial cargoes are also physically examined on a selective basis by customs officials other than those specifically engaged on preventive duties.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the committee have been able to give so much attention to this problem.  We can say fairly that a number of the areas of concern raised by the committee have been the subject of action in the meantime and along the lines recommended by them.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the work of the committee has been extremely useful.  It has focused attention on the more pressing issues that need to be dealt with.  That is something that properly is part of the work of committees of that kind.  To the extent that in any of their future work the committee may wish to return to any of these problems, I assure them that there will be forthcoming from the Revenue Commissioners the same level of co-operation as <Col N="2279" /> we were happy to be able to give on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very timely debate on the very serious problem of drugs.  The onus rests very much now on us as legislators to do something about that problem.</P>
      <P>In the past couple of years there have been a number of notable seizures by customs and excise officers at various points of entry.  Their continuing co-operation with the Garda is acknowledged by the Commissioner in the Garda report for 1983.  However, it is not sufficient for the Commissioner to say that the co-operation is beneficial, because such a statement would appear to reduce to a low profile, if not eliminate, the roll of the customs officers.  Co-operation between customs officers and the Garda is also very important because the role customs officers play in the fight against drug imports could be helped considerably by the presence of the Garda to facilitate a quick drugs seizure.</P>
      <P>The work of the committee has been going on at a satisfactory level, but unless their recommendations are acknowledged by the Government and the Minister I am afraid the committee are wasting their time producing excellent reports of this kind.  I am glad that the Minister for Finance confirmed that the views expressed in the report are acceptable to the Government.  The matter of finance comes into this, but if the required action is to be taken and if it is successful hundreds of millions of pounds could be saved to the Exchequer which now is being lost in various ways because of the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of crime throughout the country, and in Dublin in particular, has increased to frightening proportions. There is evidence that a large percentage of crime is carried out purely because of the urgent need for cash to finance the purchase of drugs.  There was a general feeling some years ago that breaking into chemists' shops provided the hard drugs necessary to sustain the habit, but during recent years this has been controlled to a great extent.  However, the problem has <Col N="2280" /> increased and is growing worse daily. Successful raids have been carried out by the Garda to beat the drug smugglers, but drug smuggling is at an intolerably high level, and unless some positive action is taken not only to curb smuggling but to eliminate it I am afraid the country will lose the fight for law and order.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, our younger people are exposed to every possible risk.  The sale of drugs has become a huge commercial business for the unscrupulous godfathers of the industry.  A large number of them well known to the Garda, are living lives of luxury at the expense of the unfortunate ones caught up, perhaps through no fault of their own, through inexperience, in this terrible business.</P>
    <P>Though the smuggling of drugs is in itself a serious problem, the abuse of drugs has led to a considerable amount of other crimes throughout the community. Addicts, apparently, must involve themselves in crime in order to finance their habit.  The committee found that it costs anything between £100 and £300 to finance the daily drug needs of addicts. This has led to an enormous increase in crime, largely burglaries.</P>
    <P>I hope the report of the committee will be a first step towards easing this awful problem.  Customs and excise officers are in an ideal position to control imports and smuggling of drugs, but if they are to be successful a number of changes must be made.  They must be given new powers and facilities and there must be provision for additional training for recruits.  Under present law if an officer observes possible possession of drugs, valuable time is wasted while he makes contact with the Garda.  During that time an offender may get away.  This is very serious and it must be sorted out very soon.</P>
    <P>Of travellers passing through our ports only about 20 per cent are called aside for examination, and very often those called aside are innocent travellers, perhaps carrying an additional bottle or some extra cigarettes.  Our customs officials are very courteous and as far as I know it is very rare to find one of them discourteous to anybody.  However, the hard fact remains that travellers can walk <Col N="2281" /> through our ports freely and they could be carrying quantities of drugs on their persons.</P>
    <P>I have been told that for a good number of years the customs people have been expressing their concern at the lack of response from the Revenue Commissioners. Frequent representations have been made to the Revenue Commissioners indicating that the responsibility rests with them regarding the control of importation of illegal drugs, but this is very far down in their list of priorities. Unfortunately, hardly any part of the country is now unaffected in some way or another by drugs but of course the urban areas, the bigger cities particularly, are the worst affected.  Dublin, with its huge population, has a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>In recent times a number of deaths have occurred either directly or indirectly associated with drug abuse.  Some commentators and medical people have indicated that many other deaths, from accidents on the roads or at home, have been caused indirectly by drug taking. Some parts of Dublin are worse than other parts.  The inner city, as we all know, has a major drugs problem but suburban areas are also badly affected.</P>
    <P>One of the most dreadful problems we have at the moment is the presence of pushers outside schools trying to persuade young people to take sweets containing drugs, some with very hard drugs. Those pushers are not particularly concerned whether their victims are old or young.  I do not think the authorities are fully alive to this danger.  The problem would not be so great, of course, if there was full control at the points of importation. Some months ago there was a heroin haul, worth £8 million, in Birmingham. At that time the Garda indicated that it was intended for Ireland.  Though I do not wish to take away from the work of the Garda and the customs officers, I am quite sure that this haul would not have been detected coming through Irish ports.  When one considers that this may have been just a normal transaction scheduled to come through in the normal way, through normal channels, it is frightening to think of the consequences <Col N="2282" /> for our community of that type of smuggling. Our present setup is highly undesirable. There is no proper control at the ports.</P>
    <P>This report has been compiled in a very serious and concerned way.  The committee heard many submissions from different groups all of whom are doing excellent work in their own way, but they are hampered particularly by the lack of proper legislation.  I hope that in the short term the report will make it clear to all responsible, particularly the Government, that irrespective of cost the steps proposed in the report must be taken.  No matter what the cost may be, in the final analysis it will benefit the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate on a report dealing with the role customs officers play in controlling the supply of illegal drugs.  Prevention is better than cure.  It was with this maxim in mind that I and other members of the committee considered the role of the customs officers as fundamental in any effort to stop or reduce the supply of drugs.  Their role in this matter should be emphasised. If customs officers can succeed in reducing the quantity of drugs being smuggled into this country then the subsequent cost of drug addiction will be significantly reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are about 600 customs officers placed at strategic points at airports and seaports.  They are required to provide a service on a 24 hour basis.  When one realises the traffic and number of people they have to contend with the number of officers seems small.  Despite their numbers and the extent to which their role in preventing and detecting drug smuggling has been overlooked, these officers have been very successful in their seizures of illegal drugs.  It is extremely difficult to detect drug smuggling and the extent to which smugglers can smuggle and hide drugs.  The street value of even a small quantity of drugs is very high and the rewards compare favourably to the risks involved.  There was a case of a young girl having heroin with a street value of £276,000 in the pocket of her jeans.  She <Col N="2283" /> was caught but many others get through. When one considers the number of juggernauts and heavy vehicles coming through our ports everyday, not to mention private cars, the task seems impossible. I have heard that private cars have been deliberately dented and then filled with heroin and painted over.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods spoke about the new phenomenon of smuggling drugs by swallowing. This is a serious problem.  I was glad to hear the Minister say he would provide facilities at points of import and export to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>In the annual report for 1983 the Garda Commissioner stated that many seizures of drugs were made by officers of the customs service at various points of entry to the State.  Their co-operation is beneficial as almost all drugs abused here are brought into the country.  In 1981 1,620 kilogrammes of cannabis out of a total of 1,735 kilogrammes seized was as a result of joint customs and Garda operations. If we can improve the efficiency of the customs services there will be a significant increase in the level of drug seizures at the point of import.  This would lessen the problem and avoid the other serious consequences of drug smuggling.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that society pays for drug addiction.  This payment can be made in the form of handbag snatching, petty larcenies and burglaries.  People have to pay for health care services through taxation.  Drug related crime is committed to feed an addict's habit while the health services are called upon to treat the effects of drug addiction.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the committee welcomed the changes in legislation which have been implemented in the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1984.  I do not propose to dwell on that aspect except to say that I was very pleased to see the speed with which the Minister for Health responded positively to the report by making amendments to that Bill.</P>
    <P>At our meeting with representatives of the Customs and Excise Union they complained that the lack of personnel and training facilities hampered their efforts in preventing drug smuggling. They reminded us of the commitment <Col N="2284" /> given by the Minister for Finance in the 1983 Budget.  I am glad the Minister listened to the debate and that he was gracious in his comments about the work of the committee.  I was glad to hear that the Revenue Commissioners will give all necessary aid to the customs officers in their work.</P>
    <P>Drug smuggling is a major issue.  I understand very little has been done to date to establish a small drug unit in the customs service.  That is essential.  We are unanimous in the report that there should be a full time drug unit with trained staff. They should provide the necessary back up services for officers in the field and thus help to tackle the problem.  I hope the Revenue Commissioners will consider the situation where customs officers cannot arrest and charge a person for drug offences.  There is clear need for a change of policy in this regard and the introduction of comprehensive guidelines outlining a simplified but effective procedure for dealing with such cases.  Customs and excise officers are responsible for combatting drug smuggling at the point of import only or in the immediate vicinity while the illicit supply or use of drugs in other areas is a matter for the gardaí. There is a close working relationship between the gardaí and the customs officers.  That spirit of co-operation must be continued.  Every effort should be made to build on this solid basis.</P>
    <P>In the different committees of which I am a member we have from time to time received numerous deputations.  I was most impressed with the deputation we received from the customs officers' association.  They are most dedicated and conscientious in their efforts to eradicate the drug problem.  There is a grave responsibility on the State to support in every possible way this excellent group of people in their efforts to curtail the drug problem which now affects so many parts of the country.</P>

      <P>I refer to my reply yesterday to Question No. 5 by Deputy Molloy in relation to postal voting at local elections. In my reply I stated that postal voting at local elections is governed by the Local Elections (Postal Voting) Regulations 1974 and in addition to gardaí and members of the Defence Forces these regulations entitle a wider category of electors to apply for a postal vote at local elections. That is correct.</P>
      <P>In the second part of my reply I referred to the fact that postal voting proposals had been referred last June to the Joint Committee on Legislation.  I indicated that the position in relation to postal voting for the 1985 local elections would be considered in the light of the relevant report of the Joint Committee when the report became available.  Unfortunately I was not aware at the time that the report was already available.  I apologise to the House and in particular to Deputy Molloy for the confusion which this gave rise to yesterday.</P>
      <P>I might mention that there is a heavy programme of work in hand in the franchise area of my Department.  This includes the preparation of legislation on voting rights for UK citizens and work on postal voting and on electoral dimensions and local government reorganisation. These circumstances and the very large volume of questions to my Department, some 175 for oral reply and 250 for written reply to date in the present session, contributed to a situation in which the reply to this particular question, which was prepared before the Joint Committee report became available to me on November 7, was not updated and should have been.  I repeat that I regret this occurred.  The existing provisions are now being reviewed as a matter of urgency in the light of the report of the joint committee.

      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is difficult to understand the Government's timetable in regard to implementing reforms in local authorities? They have been in office for two years and we have not seen their proposals although the Minister and the Taoiseach have stated that it is proposed to have all these changes implemented so that the local authority election in June 1985 will be held on the basis of the new structures.  Can the Minister explain how he expects that time scale to be implemented when he has not even entered into discussions with one section which is going to be very seriously affected by these changes?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2289" /> To examine and make recommendations on the system of financing local authorities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the context of the terms of reference the report should consider, <i>inter alia:</i> (i) the current resources of and financial demands upon local authorities, with a view to defining their areas of financial responsibility and their relationship with central Government; (ii) the implications for autonomy of centrally determined national objectives.  In examining the possibilities for reform of the system, due regard should be paid to the case for local financial autonomy.  It is understood that the consultant's report has been completed and will be considered by the Council of NESC, at their meeting on 16 November with a view to its publication.</P>
    <P>The examination of local financing is being carried out on the basis of work being done in my Department, taking account of relevant studies.  The decision to introduce a farm tax as a source of local revenue is part of the restructuring decided on by the Government.

      <P>It is necessary for me as spokesman for my party to bring pressure to bear on the Minister to recognise that this problem exists and to encourage him to take some steps to alleviate the problem. Is the Minister aware that when a deputation came from Galway County Council to his Minister of State last year, that Minister told the county manager that he was getting more money in 1984 than in 1983, despite the fact that the manager pointed out otherwise?  Is he aware that special meetings were arranged in the Department subsequently and that the manager's claim that he was getting less was substantiated, that the Galway County Council got less money from the Department in 1984 than they got in 1983?  Juggling around with the figures and trying to confuse the issue is not helpful.  A problem exists and the Minister should stand up to it and recognise it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he accepts that there has been a rapid deterioration in the surface condition of main and country roads due to a reduction in real terms in block grant allocations by his Department; and the action, if any, he proposes to take to deal with this serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the contention made in the question.</P>
      <P>Regarding main roads, I consider that the standard of maintenance of national roads is generally satisfactory.  The standard of maintenance of other main roads is some what less than satisfactory in some areas.</P>
      <P>The maintenance of county roads is entirely a matter for county councils acting as road authorities.</P>
      <P>Regarding the financing of roads, the cost of maintenance of national roads is virtually financed in full by the Exchequer. Between 1979 and 1983, Exchequer expenditure under this heading increased by 14 per cent in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The block grant allows local authorities a wide discretion in the determination of their annual programme of works.  The block grant is a supplement to the provision made from the local authorities' own resources &mdash; including the rate support grant &mdash; for the improvement, maintenance and management of non-national main roads, for improvement works on county roads, and for traffic management measures on national roads.  In recent years, in addition to the block grant, special grants have been provided for strengthening works on non-national main roads.  Between 1979 and 1983, total expenditure by local authorities on the maintenance of non-national main roads decreased by 3 per cent in real terms.  Of this expenditure, the portion financed directly by the State by way of <Col N="2301" /> block grant or special grant increased by 11 per cent, while the portion financed by local authorities from their own resources &mdash; including the rate support grant &mdash; decreased by 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>State road grants were never payable in respect of the maintenance of county roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware, as asked in the question, of the deterioration in the surface condition of these roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I gave my opinion under the headings of both main and county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that due to the inadequate funding being made available from the central authority who now provide 80 per cent of the moneys available to local authorities in this area, very substantial numbers of road workers have had to be made redundant by local road authorities because they had not sufficient funds to continue to employ the road workers and that in County Galway the figure exceeds 100? In previous years these people were working away busily keeping and improving roads.  That can no longer be done and the consequential effect is the roads are falling into disrepair and breaking up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I can give the Deputy details of the money spent on roads since 1976 if he wishes, and I can demonstrate the increase that has occurred in the block grants over those years. The Deputy cannot really believe what he is saying when he says that moneys have not been provided when in each year there has been an increase and in some years a considerable increase over the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister also take into account the effect of increases in labour costs and material costs?  Is he aware that the county roads reconstruction costs in 1971 were £1,500 per mile and in 1982 they have been estimated by Galway County Council to be £30,000 per <Col N="2302" /> mile?  Is the Minister aware that surface dressing costs in 1971 were £400 per mile and in 1982 were £7,200 per mile?  Is the Minister aware of these massive increases in costs and that his allocations are not keeping up with them with the result that the whole system is breaking up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy the State provided an 18 per cent increase while contributions from local authorities reduced by 30 per cent between 1979 and 1983.  That is the reason why roads are in such a bad condition and are deteriorating.  Local authorities are not providing the money out of their own funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, irrespective of the figures he has read out for each county council, that the moneys allocated to the councils given the rate of inflation, wage increases and the increase in the cost of surface dressing, are not sufficient with the result that the maintenance programme is falling down?  County councils are just employment agencies.  The whole network is breaking down.  County roads need to be put in a proper state of repair rather than money being wasted by sending county council workers out to throw a few loads of clay here and there.  That is a waste of money and resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that the priorities in regard to expenditure on roads are determined in his Department?  Is the Minister aware that in the recently published programme for capital expenditure the cost of some of those works is listed indicating the Minister's priorities?  Will he agree that the indications are that his priority in the next few years is the allocation of £51 million to build a bridge across the Shannon? Nobody will be left on the other side of the Shannon and there will be no need for the bridge if the Government do not set about repairing the road network in the west.  It is the priorities in the Minister's mind that are causing the problem. He is allocating all the resources to major capital works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

I should, however, mention that my Department are not a party to contracts between group trustees and contractors and I have no function in relation to payments by the groups to the contractors for work done by them on behalf of the group trustees.</P>
      <P>In so far as the payment of State grants to the groups is concerned, instalments up to 90 per cent of the total amount of grants allocated are normally paid by my Department within three weeks of certification of expenditure by the local inspector.  The final instalment of grants due can be paid of course when the scheme has been completed satisfactorily and domestic water supplies provided to individual members in respect of whom the grants are claimed.</P>

The additional cost as a result of the relocation of the pumping station and the building of a causeway is estimated at £1.75 million.  That factor must be carefully considered.  The estimated cost of the pumping station at South Park is £2.85 million and the estimated cost of a pumping station located at Mutton Island is £4.6 million.  Under this new proposal a number of additional points must be examined before it can be decided upon. The building of the causeway could interfere with the existing tidal flows and have implications for the shipping channel, or the causeway could be designed to minimise any adverse effect.  Hydrographic and sediment transportation studies will be necessary and this will take six months or more.  A foreshore licence will be required for the construction of the cause-way and the original mechanical and electrical plant which has been constructed may be of minimal use and could end up being totally unsuitable.  I am sure <Col N="2307" /> the Deputy will understand that these are major questions that must be considered.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister tell the House whether he is going to allow the sewage from the Galway city greater area to be discharged into Galway Bay without being treated prior to discharge? Galway city is a tourist resort and there are many beaches in the vicinity which attract many visitors.  Tourism is a big revenue earner for the community and gives a great deal of employment.  This could constitute a serious threat to the quality of the water in inner Galway Bay, which is shallow, which has a circular tidal motion and which does not scour itself except once in every 40 or 50 days. Because of all of the factors which have already been brought to light the public in Galway are expecting the Minister to insist that this new sewerage scheme will be modern, efficient and guarantee a continuation of the excellent, clean qualities of Galway Bay for future generations which can be done only through the inclusion of adequate treatment of this massive quantity of sewage which is discharged at one point into the bay.</P>

      <P>There is no evidence available regarding the effect of public opinion polls on how the electorate vote in elections.  If the Deputy has some information on that, I should like to have it.  If there is some professional advice available in that regard, I am not aware of it.  I do know that in France it is forbidden to publish opinion polls for one week before the first ballot of their double ballot majority electoral system.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>While recognising what the Minister says &mdash; perhaps he has no evidence to suggest that the electorate are affected &mdash; nevertheless it should be recognised that it has now reached the stage in this country that every political party is affected by every opinion poll published and it would appear that the country seems to be run by opinion polls. But, leaving that aside, would the Minister not agree that their publication may influence the electorate on how they cast their votes?  Since elections should reflect <Col N="2312" /> the people's opinions at any given time, being seen to be fully democratic, would the Minister not consider the introduction of some regulation or at least have the matter discussed within his Department?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary responsibility for the housing needs of travellers in County Dublin as in other areas, rests with the local authority concerned.  A survey carried out by the local authority early in 1984 indicates that out of a total of 332 families on the roadside in the County Dublin area, 128 expressed a preference for houses, 176 wanted halting sites provided and 28 had no interest in any accommodation.  As indicated in the statement of Government policy in relation to the travelling people, issued on 20 July, the Government have accepted the recommendation of the Travelling People Review Body that primary responsibility for the accommodation needs of travellers should remain with local authorities but that this responsibility should be more clearly defined and provision made to ensure that it is carried out.</P>
      <P>A circular letter issued to local authorities on 13 September drew their attention to the terms of the Government statement; stressed the need for local authorities to adopt a systematic approach to the housing needs of travellers, as an integral part of their ordinary housing operations; asked that local authorities should review their letting schemes to ensure that they are not prejudicial to the housing prospects of travellers; and drew their attention to a number of specific suggestions about the housing of travellers and the provision of halting sites which had been made by the review body and requested that these suggestions should be incorporated into the on-going procedures of individual authorities.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that responsibility rests with the local authority concerned, but have the Government made a decision that the responsibility shall lie with the county manager and that the role of the elected councillor has been changed in some way?  The impression has gone abroad from a statement which issued that no longer would elected councillors be involved <Col N="2315" /> in the decision to provide facilities for travellers but that it should be solely a managerial function.  That would be very detrimental to local democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

      <P>Could it not be that the manager is falling down on his responsibilities when making decisions on the <Col N="2317" /> allocation of new tenancies?  As this question deals with Dublin, how many local authority houses have been allocated to travelling families by the Dublin authorities in the last year or two?  Has that number been increased in recent years?</P>

      <P>I will give the figures I have available.  Following a meeting with the Minister of State and the city manager on 25 June a document on housing travelling families in Dublin was presented by the manager.  A summary of this document shows that by June 1984, 210 families in the corporation and council areas had been accommodated in chalets, bungalows or halting sites; 123 families had been offered standard housing in the county council area; 15 families had refused the offer; 26 families had vacated their houses; 18 families were awaiting keys to houses.  A total of 367 families, 332 in the county area and 35 in the city area, were still on the roadside.  That is the information I have up to 1984.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the number of houses being constructed by Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council runs into many thousands each year?  The number he has given me is over a period greater than one year.  The Minister did not say how many years the figure covers.  One would take it that it was from the foundation of the State from the way the Minister worded his reply.  The number seems to be very small, under 200, whereas in actual fact thousands of houses are being built each year.  It is clear from that that the county managers have not been diligent in fulfilling their obligations to the travellers who are applicants for houses like any other section of the community. Very few of them have been granted <Col N="2318" /> houses by the county managers in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>Since the Government policy statement on 20 July of this year in regard to accommodation for travellers, three group housing schemes for travelling families in the Dublin area have been approved.  These schemes comprise ten, eight and 12 houses in Dunsink Lane, Deansrath and Fortunestown, respectively. In addition Dublin County Council approved a programme of 17 halting sites, five in 1982 and 12 in April 1984. The only site proposal actually submitted to the Department for approval at Bally-coolin has been approved by my Department. Plans for a further six halting sites are awaited by the council.  That is the up to date position.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Second Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism: The role of Officers of Customs and Excise in controlling the supply of illegal drugs.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Woods.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the report and I congratulate the chairman, Deputy Woods, and the members of the committee on their dedication and commitment in tackling the very serious drug problem which must be regarded as one of the greatest social evils of our time.  A few years ago this problem was associated with urban areas only.  Now far too often it manifests itself in rural towns and schools.</P>
      <P>It is a problem which is not easily eliminated or contained once outlets of distribution have been established.  It is even less easy to safeguard the lives of young people who have been exposed to the drugs scene and who have become even slightly addicted to and dependent on the various forms of drugs which are available. It has often been said that it took us too long to recognise the fact that we had a drug problem.  If this is so, it was a very costly mistake and makes our task all the more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we face up to the reality and recognise the extent of the problem and that we make adequate resources available to deal with it.  We must recognise that this nation of ours has been identified by the international demons &mdash; and one cannot think of a stronger word to describe those in the murky underworld of drug trafficking and pushing &mdash; as easy prey.  They recognise that the social conditions which exist here with high unemployment provide <Col N="2339" /> the ideal climate for them to peddle their wares.  They recognise that a country with a population as young as ours is a very lucrative market for this illicit trade.  I do not know how you can measure the economic cost to the nation and the psychological damage to the community from social evils such as drug addiction. The cost is great.  It is a factor which the Minister should take into consideration and try to measure before embarking on purely monetarist decisions and totally ignoring the social issues, as is happening daily in terms of job losses.</P>
    <P>It is very likely that the long term cost to the nation could far outweigh the short term economic gain which she is trying to achieve apart altogether from the damage to the individual.  This must be our first consideration.  The economic drain on the nation's resources in dealing with the problem is great.  I urge the Minister to bring more social balance into the economic policies which she proposes to introduce in the future.  We must recognise that the Garda and other people upon whom we depend to deal with this problem have to deal with the most professional, dangerous and successful of established criminals around the world whose priority is to establish successful distribution channels for drugs.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a special tribute to the dedication and commitment of the members of the Garda Drugs Squad. Under difficult conditions they have done an extremely good job and we owe them a great debt of gratitude.  I make a special plea for greater resources for this important section of our Garda force.  Let us give them the manpower and the other resources necessary to enable them to perform their duties professionally and successfully.  Let us also give a commitment to implementing the recommendations of this very excellent report.</P>
    <P>The success of the Drugs Squad in closing off the internal sources of supply has, unfortunately, only led to an escalation in the import of drugs.  The increase in the level of addiction is an indication of the extent and volume of these imports. Therefore, the view contained in the <Col N="2340" /> report that officers of Customs and Excise should have an important role to play is valid and should be acted upon.'</P>
    <P>The report is correct in identifying and stressing the need to tackle the problem at source.  If we can contain and, it is hoped, eliminate the trafficking in and movement of drugs, then we are bound to reduce the incidence of exposure of our young people to the drug scene.</P>
    <P>Our geographic position as an island is a help.  I do not want to sound a pessimistic note at this stage, but I heard recently of drugs being imported in the hollow frames of agricultural machinery.  If that practice were widespread it would be impossible to detect or prevent the importation of very large amounts of drugs.</P>
    <P>There is a need to bring the penalties following customs detection into line with those imposed as a result of Garda investigation. I was very pleased to hear the Minister say today that this is an aspect of the drug scene which is being dealt with by him at this time.</P>
    <P>I support also the view that a small specialised unit within Customs and Excise should be established for the purpose of drug detection.  Again, I was pleased to hear the Minister say that this is being considered and that liaison between the Garda Drugs Squad and the people in Customs and Excise responsible for drug detection would be strengthened and improved.</P>
    <P>A matter raised by Deputy Woods and the other members of his committee was the relevance of sniffer dogs for drug detection.  It was encouraging to hear the Minister, on a positive note, saying that at present a dog was being trained for this specific purpose.  It is true to say that all Members of this House would have a unified approach and a unified commitment to tackling this great social evil which unfortunately is on the increase.</P>
    <P>I am sure my dedicated and committed colleague, Deputy Woods, will forgive me if I differ slightly from his views and those of the committee in relation to the emphasis in the report.  I agree fully that the implementation of measures against imports is a very vital part of any campaign to deal with the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2341" /> However, no matter what measures are taken in that regard it is going to be extremely difficult to eliminate totally drug importation.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we became successful in reducing the demand for drugs, through a proper educational process, the market would automatically decline and trafficking in drugs would be substantially reduced.  We are not doing sufficient in the educational field to bring to the notice of young people, particularly those attending post primary schools, the great danger and threat facing them with regard to exposure to the drug scene on leaving school or, indeed, tragically, even while they are still at school.</P>
    <P>More resources should be made available to the health boards.  I know that it is part of the normal health board programme to try to provide some kind of education and advice in relation to drugs.  They have not got adequate resources at present to embark on a full scale, impressive educational programme which would bring home effectively to young people the dangers they are facing.</P>
    <P>I recently watched, in the House, a television programme depicting, perhaps crudely, the effects of drug trafficking and drug addiction.  For weeks afterwards people throughout the country were still reacting to that programme.  They were appalled at what they had seen and it was a very effective programme.  Human nature being what it is, you need a concentrated and continuous educational programme to bring the drugs problem to the notice of the people.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consider seriously, at Government level, the channelling of an allocation to health boards specifically for the purpose of educating people about the present drugs problem.  The success of that type of operation has been demonstrated in relation to the no smoking campaign. It is reasonably true to say that as a result of that campaign there are definitely fewer young people smoking cigarettes now than there were ten years ago.  It is a practical example of how successful a consistent educational programme can be in achieving its objective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2342" /> I regret that I have not more time to deal with the problem but I know that the Minister of State will convey to the Minister the views which I have expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be as brief as I can and I may not take my full time because I put most of my views in detail to the committee.  We have gone through many different reports and like the chairman of that committee, I have taken a particular interest in the various elements of the work of the committee.  This report is very important to the committee, the House and the general public.  On a recent visit to Scotland Yard, I found that the people there confirmed Garda intelligence that the main source of the drugs that are abused most in this country is Pakistan and to some extent South America.  There is a meeting in progress in Dublin today of Foreign Ministers, some from Asia and some from Europe. That sort of meeting would have provided us with the opportunity of taking up the matter on the diplomatic front with those countries who allow the drugs to be grown on their soil in the first place and then to be exported to a country such as this where the livers, sight and lives of the users are being threatened.  In many cases the users are hooked deliberately by people who supply heroin in the first instance free of charge so as to bring about the addiction and subsequent pushing. Unless we are prepared to take on this crime at every level, at diplomatic, courts and supply level, we will not combat the problem.</P>
      <P>From our experience in London we learned also that, despite the size of the problem here, it is not nearly as big as is the problem in other European capitals. That is not very much consolation to us. We do not want any drug problem but it is an indication of the massive export of misery from these foreign countries to western European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem between us and the UK in the sense that there is two way trafficking.  People who traditionally make their money by way of bank robberies and other crimes are now channelling their funds into drug smuggling.  They <Col N="2343" /> have so many routes both into and out of the UK and Ireland that detection is difficult.  There is both an import and export problem, so to speak.  We must pool intelligence and other resources with those of the UK in order to ensure that this element of the problem is tackled. The peddlers can change their routes to operate through the UK into Ireland or through Ireland into the UK.</P>
    <P>Another bottleneck area in this context lies within the Judiciary.  The task force consisting of Ministers of State recommended to the Government, and the Government agreed, that within the Circuit Court and the District Court there should be appointed a judge to deal with drug offences specifically.  However, the proposal has not been adopted so far.  It is not my intention to be in any way critical of the Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court but I would be failing in my duty if I were not to emphasise the need to put pressure on these distinguished gentlemen in this matter.  I would go so far as to say that the House may have to exercise a constitutional role in coming to terms with judges who are not fulfilling their role in this regard &mdash; in other words, to remove them from office.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in respect of the consistency of sentencing.  Within the past few days a man who was found guilty of providing drugs to 12 and 14 year olds was sentenced to five years.  Another judge might have sentenced him to two years while yet another might have sentenced him to eight years.  There is an urgent need for a judge who will deal specifically with drug cases, who will be fully versed in the law relating to importation and who will know the difference between the various drugs.  Some judges do not appear to know the difference between cannabis and heroin.  If we are to tackle the problem across the board we must eliminate all bottlenecks and that may mean our exercising our responsibility as legislators and saying to these learned gentlemen of the Judiciary that we have lost patience with them, that if they do not implement the proposal we <Col N="2344" /> will have to legislate for it.</P>
    <P>I had thought that it was not possible for us to do that but I am informed now by senior Garda sources that it may be possible for us to legislate for a judge in either court to deal specifically with drug offences.  I appeal to the House to support the recommendation of the task force in this regard.  I trust that in the not too distant future we will be in a position to report to the House on other aspects of the law relating to drugs.  This, of course, would involve very much the Department of Finance.  The Finance Act, 1982, provided for the taxation of income from illegal sources but there is no provision for the confiscation of assets of persons involved in drug trafficking.  The committee may be in a position to report to the House shortly in that connection.</P>
    <P>I commend the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what Deputy Mitchell says. However, it is all very well to talk about taking diplomatic action against the countries of origin of illegal drugs but, if we are not prepared to take the most basic steps at home to deal as effectively as possible with the problem, there is not much point in talking about action on the diplomatic front.</P>
      <P>I shall be dealing later with some of the issues that have been raised and which relate specifically to the roles of customs officers, but first I should like to express agreement with those speakers who have said that unless we accept the basic problem as being one of social inequity in the major areas of poverty and of disadvantage we will not make much progress.  It is in the areas of the greatest poverty that there is most abuse of heroin.  Having said that, it is necessary to be realistic and to deal with the circumstances as we find them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the introductory remarks of Deputy Woods.  He said that there had been a great deal of confusion up to about a year or two ago about the extent of the drug problem in Ireland.  I am a little concerned, reading the newspapers in the last few days, that there is still a great <Col N="2345" /> deal of confusion over the extent of the drug problem.  I will refer specifically to <i>The Irish Times</i> of yesterday which carried a report of a statement by the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. John Paul McMahon.  I thought he would have known better.  He stated that the level of drug abuse is on the decline.  He seemed to base this point of view on the downward trend in drug seizures.  Representing an area where there is no shortage of heroin, I can assure the Deputy Commissioner that heroin is on open supply by known individuals.  In saying that I do not in any way criticise the Garda Drugs Squad.  I have said repeatedly that the number of men and the resources available to the Garda Drugs Squad in contrast to the extent of the problem they are trying to deal with do not allow them any great scope to follow up a great deal of the heroin pushing in Dublin, never mind other areas.  To say that the level of drug abuse is on the decline seems to indicate that the Deputy Commissioner is out of touch with those who are trying to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>A few years ago a delegation from the inner city area of Dublin went to Deputy Woods as Minister for Health to tell him about the serious problem in the inner city.  At that time that was denied totally by the Department of Health.  Then the Medical Social Research Group carried out a survey and showed the enormity of the problem.  Today it is not a matter of the inner city area alone.  Every major working class area, like Ballymun, Bally-fermot and others, has an alarming increasing heroin problem which is known to the Drugs Squad.  The prime suppliers in those areas are known but because of difficulties in catching them in possession many of them are not being apprehended.</P>
    <P>Last weekend we had the tragic case in my constituency of a youth of 17 dying from a heroin overdose.  That teenager had been an addict since the age of 14 years.  More than a year ago we had a report which said that of particular concern to the ministerial task force were young drug abusers in the 12 to 16 age group in the inner city areas for <Col N="2346" /> whom no treatment or accommodation was currently available.  More than a year later there are still no treatment facilities available and some of them are now dying from heroin abuse.</P>
    <P>Referring again to the Deputy Commissioner's statement, it is important that those in authority charged with dealing with the problem should reflect accurately the extent of the problem and should not be making misleading statements, whether it be to the Irish Security Industry Association or to any other body, about the extent of the problem. Statements like that are counter-productive and I am extremely surprised that somebody in such a responsible position would make a statement like that.</P>
    <P>He welcomed the establishment of the concerned community groups but he criticised unscrupulous individuals who were infiltrating those groups.  The Deputy Commissioner should remember that elsewhere anti-drug workers have been murdered for their pains and that people working in these community groups are putting themselves at risk.  I should like to refer to the specific role of customs officers and the facilities available to them.  Today the Minister for Finance made a number of statements which are not accurate.  I am sure he made them in good faith based on information from the Revenue Commissioners. He said that specialised equipment for the searching of container traffic was now in operation.  I would be interested to hear where that is in operation.  I was in touch with customs officers today and they are not aware of it.</P>
    <P>The basic request for a customs drug group to liaise with the Garda Drugs Squad in matters of surveillance and the gathering of information has been refused or has not been acted on. Although two customs officers have been assigned to deal with drugs in particular, even they are not employed on a full time basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to the fact that fixed facilities for the search of vehicles are adequate at most points of entry.  They may be adequate in the <Col N="2347" /> eyes of the Revenue Commissioners but there is a major question mark, in the views of customs officers themselves, in regard to the definition of &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;. Although there are fixed facilities at Dundalk and Monaghan and at major ports like Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Rosslare and Dún Laoghaire, major ports of entry do not have fixed facilities for the search and examination of vehicles.</P>
    <P>There is a major contradiction between my statement and that of the Minister for Finance which requires clarification.  I regret that I have been denied membership of this or other committees but I should like to raise that matter with the committee.  I would ask them to examine the statements made earlier today about the facilities, the modern, supposedly specialised equipment for the search of containers, the fixed facilities of hoists for lifting trucks for the proper searching of containers.  There is a whole range of areas I would like to refer to in relation to the heroin problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report of the committee, as I would welcome any report which highlights the problem.  If the report is to be worthwhile it must deal with the basic improvements which have to be made to facilitate customs officers in dealing with the problem.  Having listened to the customs officers make their case and to the Minister, there seems to be a serious contradiction between the information given by the Minister and the views of the customs officers.  I refer specifically to the areas I have mentioned: the availability of specialised equipment for search and examination, fixed facilities where containers can be examined, manpower and the need for a special drug unit to be set up within the customs service. There is no point in the Government saying they are serious about dealing with the drug problem if they are not prepared to implement those basic measures.</P>
    <P>Some speakers referred to the Judiciary. I am on record as criticising the Judiciary in this regard.  I find it difficult to speak on the subject without referring again to the apparent inability of some members of the Judiciary to accept the <Col N="2348" /> seriousness of the heroin problem.  There does not seem to be any consistency in their sentences.  They seem to be out of touch as regards the difference between, as Deputy Mitchell said, cannabis and heroin.  That undermines the confidence of the community in the Judiciary and has serious implications.</P>
    <P>I attempted to put a question to the Minister for Finance in March 1983.  My question was if he would instruct the Revenue Commissioners to investigate the ability of known criminals who have no apparent income from any legitimate source and specifically the ability of certain individuals known by the Garda Drugs Squad to be controlling heroin traffic to buy expensive homes and property. At the time I raised the question it was to see if there was any way in which legislation could be introduced to confiscate the property and possessions of persons convicted of major drug offences.  I am glad to say that will be the next item on the committee's agenda.  I am aware that in Britain they have begun the process of introducing legislation to do that.</P>
    <P>I do not share the view that the most effective way of dealing with the heroin problem is at the point of entry of heroin into the country.  While it is necessary to do everything possible to stop heroin entering the country, it is unrealistic to believe that it can be done to any major degree.  The place to deal with heroin is on the streets of Dublin.  We and the Government must realise that and give priority to it.  I do not call having a drug squad with 35 members giving priority to this matter.  Until the Government accept the seriousness of the problem and give that priority to the Garda we will not be able to deal effectively with the heroin problem in this city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be associated with the production of this report and I recommend it to the House. In 1980 the extent of drug abuse in Ireland was very little.  What there was was confined mainly to cannabis.  It is interesting to note that in 1966 only one person was charged with drug offences.  By 1979 that number had risen to 594 and 1,800 people were charged with offences under <Col N="2349" /> the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>Drug abuse is an increasing problem. The increase in the abuse of heroin in Dublin has reached crisis proportions. To compare the position here with other European capitals does not mean anything. We have to deal with the problem that we have.  The abuse of heroin escalated rapidly following the Iranian revolution. At that time a large amount of heroin flooded the world markets and a certain amount of it came into Ireland. Suggestions were made that the movement of criminals into the drug scene was largely responsible for the sudden upsurge in drug abuse.  That is an oversimplification as there had to be a ready market in existence before it could have taken off at such a pace.</P>
      <P>In this connection we must consider the extent to which the general attitude of the community influences drug taking. In Ireland alcohol is the drug of addiction which is socially acceptable.  When a person goes out socially he determines how good the night has been by the amount of alcohol he consumed.  The night itself is not important but rather the number of pints and half-ones that he put away.  For generations alcohol abuse has caused untold misery and economic deprivation. The cost to the State in terms of accidents is enormous.  Drug taking exists and has done so for some time in our society.</P>
      <P>Deputies may wonder why I referred to alcohol.  It is closely linked to the problem of drug taking in the community.  It was no surprise that the Medico Social Research Board's survey on drug abuse in Ireland in 1982-83 pointed out how, very often, drug abusers came from families where drink was a problem even though the abusers were not into alcohol. Cigarette smoking invariably was the rule in those families.  That is the information given by the Medico Social Research Board.  I congratulate Deputy Woods who asked for this survey to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug problem needs to be tackled urgently.  It must be contained and eliminated. People say it cannot be eliminated and that it is with us whether or not we <Col N="2350" /> like it.  That is a defeatist attitude.  The support of the community is needed for those involved in trying to stamp out the problem.  This will involve the provision of necessary resources to those who are involved in the prevention of smuggling.</P>
    <P>There are now people who are drug addicts and will be so for the rest of their lives.  We do not have the facilities to help those people.  It was with the intention of reducing the supply of illegal drugs that we concentrated on the role of the customs officers as they are the first line of defence in tackling the supply of drugs. Deputy Gregory said that if we think it starts and finishes there we are wrong. Nevertheless we are an island, hard drugs come into the country and we must use all our resources at air and sea ports to ensure that drugs are kept to a minimum and, if possible, eliminated.  I am not underestimating the problem but it is important to emphasise that point.</P>
    <P>I was happy to see that action was taken by the Minister for Health by amending the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, which was under consideration in the House when this report was produced. These legislative amendments bring the custom service into line with the Garda Síochána, which is as it should be.  Deputy Woods dealt with these matters in great detail and I merely want to say that the action of the Minister shows the relevance and usefulness of the committee system.</P>
    <P>I consider the provision of a drugs unit within the customs service to be an essential step which must be taken by the Revenue Commissioners.  I am not suggesting that it should be a large unit; it should consist of a small organisation with a number of people who can co-ordinate their efforts regarding the problem.</P>
    <P>When we went to London we found out that the police, the customs officials and the Home Office have set up a committee which is the overall co-ordinating body to combine the approach to dealing with drugs.  Something on those lines should be considered by the Minister to ensure that there is no overlap in this area.  These members would be involved in full time, drug related activities and <Col N="2351" /> they could liaise with the Garda Drugs Squad and international bodies.  They would need special training and advice because there is no doubt that the job of tackling the drug problem will fall on the outdoor staff.  The committee does very important work but it is the official at the port of entry who will be in a position to tell us whether the approach is successful. Therefore, a much closer link between all concerned is needed to ensure that success.</P>
    <P>There is very good co-operation between customs officers and the Garda Síochána which the Garda Commissioner acknowledged in the annual report for 1983.  This co-operation is evident by the extent to which the customs staff seized drugs during 1983.  Out of a total of 550 kilograms, the customs uncovered 426 kilograms.  Despite this, I wonder if this co-operation could be improved on by familiarising relations between the Garda and the customs officers.  We were told today that a sniffer dog is being trained. While we welcome this, it is not enough. We have a huge problem which we can tackle if we are determined enough.  I know costs are involved but the cost to the community at large by stopping hard drugs coming in is worthwhile.  I am disappointed that there is only one dog being trained for the sniffing of drugs.  We have a problem in Dublin, Cork and many other places and it is shortsighted to be training only one animal for this purpose. I appeal to the Minister to give this special consideration because everyone is concerned about the effects of drugs on the community.  We all wonder where our children are at night and whether they might be in contact with drugs.  Members of the House have an opportunity to take action and we must close the loopholes in this area.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on Drug Abuse made several recommendations in relation to illegal importation of drugs.  I commend the report to the House.  We are all committed to its findings but we must show our commitment by example.  The Minister has an opportunity to give the committee every support by accepting the <Col N="2352" /> report and to ensure that the proposals and recommendations are acted on without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to participate in the recommendation of this first report in the area of drugs and drug related offences.  We realised very early on at the committee meetings that they were the areas which we wished to tackle and it was as a result of statements which had been made by members of the committee about the assault on crime that I was approached by a member of the Customs and Excise union.  I suggested that they should make a submission to the committee and I am glad that the invitation was taken up.</P>
      <P>The report is only an introduction to the horrific area of crime and it is not the last word on it.  The committee will be doing much more work to eliminate as far as possible this menace from society. The report can be studied by anyone and I just want to concentrate on a few points. Drugs affect nearly all areas of crime, because in order to feed the habit of drugs addicts commit crime and terrorise most of the community.  As public representatives we have had different experiences of the extent of the problem throughout the community, of the age groups affected and the attempts to tackle the problem.  We know about the investigations and the convictions that take place. As Deputy Gregory and Deputy Mitchell have said, it is true that the Judiciary have a lot of work to do.  They will have to come in from the cold, from their isolated positions and find out more of what is going on.  They will have to come into closer contact with reality.  If they paid an occasional visit to our prisons they would see the effects of this scourge on society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not long ago I went to court as a witness in a drugs case.  It was not really a case of pushing but where a number of very young people were involved.  They had been introduced to drugs when they were under 14 years and at school and as a group they continued to take them. They did not take heroin but they took cannabis.  One of them collected the <Col N="2353" /> money and bought their supplies.  One of the group was apprehended and gave the name of another person to the Garda. When the person who was entrusted to buy the drugs was approached by the Garda he co-operated fully and told the Garda what they were doing and the amount of drugs they bought and smoked.  As a result of this co-operation he was charged with being a pusher.  I held a watching brief in that case and I was horrified when this person got a sentence in excess of ten years for his offence.</P>
    <P>I visited Mountjoy Prison on a few occasions.  I am not making a plea for anyone involved in drugs but I am making a point which I wish to elaborate.  I was amazed that such a long sentence had been given.  From where I was sitting I happened to be able to read upside down the report of the medical officer.  That report recommended that this person should be put away for a long time as he had a very serious problem.  I asked him when I visited him if he had been examined by the medical officer when he went to Mountjoy.  I was told the examination consisted of the door opening, of a man saying, &ldquo;Are you so-and-so?&rdquo;, of the person in prison replying, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and of the door closing again.  On that basis a recommendation was made to the judge that this was a dangerous individual and that he should be put away for a long time.  That was a travesty of justice.</P>
    <P>We have been given the frightening stastistic of 13 per cent of females in the 15 to 19 age group addicted to heroin and a figure of 10 per cent in the 15 to 24 age group.  It is obvious that many people will be in a similar situation to the case I mentioned.  If we can get people to admit they have a problem, to co-operate and to ask for help we should not hold over them the threat of putting them away for life if they need treatment.  As has been pointed out by professional therapists, every drug addict is also a drug pusher. When addicts get their &ldquo;fix&rdquo; they split it: they keep one for themselves and they sell the other.  We have to consider the situation with regard to our prisons.  I do not think the Judiciary are aware of what <Col N="2354" /> is going on inside our prisons and they do not know the extent to which the system has broken down.  It is in a state of collapse and that matter has to be considered.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The union here has behaved very responsibly.  It shows that when one seeks the goodwill and co-operation of the community that is forthcoming.  These members of the customs union volunteered to come before the committee and they offered their help.  We should take up their offer with thanks.</P>
      <P>About a year ago I asked the Minister of Justice a question in relation to the problem of drugs and young people. Research has shown that many drugs are given to school children.  As a member of a parent-teacher group I have attended many talks in schools and I have listened to the school authorities say they cannot guarantee that children of 12 years and more will not be offered drugs.  I asked the Minister if there could be some kind of surveillance on schools because people lie in wait and give drugs to children in the form of sweets until they become addicted.  The answer the Minister gave was that we must protect school children because they cannot protect themselves. However, I do not think anything special has been done in this matter.  It is the young people they are going after.  We have got to protect schools throughout the country.  Every secondary school should have some form of surveillance immediately.  If the people in a new organisation called PUAC in the south Dublin area want to help and do something really useful they could ask their members to patrol the schools in their communities and watch out for drug pushers who are trying to peddle death on our young people.  If we can protect young people from becoming hooked on drugs the pushers will have to go to the adult population and there is a totally different method of working with adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2355" /> There is no doubt that our crime figures have increased greatly as a result of the drug problem.</P>
    <P>As I have said in this House on many occasions and I will continue to do so until we start reacting properly, we do not seem to respond to any issue until the system breaks down.  It does not matter whether it is a tax office in Dublin which has been going on for 20 years, Irish Shipping or anything else &mdash; the system has to break down.  The Road Traffic Act breaks down, the crime problem breaks out and we start to do something about it when it is too late.  It is now that we should do something about the drug problem.</P>
    <P>What happens to the youth after school when they get jobs?  If they start to drink very young they go to drinking houses, pubs and lounges and they congregate there and there is another nest for the starting of the drug habit.  I have questioned young people continually about what they do with their spare time and I am horrified to discover that many people who earn good money and work hard go off at week-ends and drink their money away.  They spend Friday night and most of Saturday and Sunday drinking and they drive from one pub to another for the purpose of drinking.  With the measure of boredom that creeps into their lives, eventually they are easy prey to drugs.</P>
    <P>We must increase tenfold if necessary the membership of the drug unit and the numbers of gardaí engaged on surveillance and detection of drugs.  We must challenge the gangs, the godfathers, the criminals and break them.  We must isolate them, boycott them, ostracise them and let it be known that their families, friends, neighbours, clubs and associations will boycott them also.  I appreciate that concerned parents are trying to get rid of drug pushers and have them on the run, but all they are doing is pushing them from one area into another so they are not solving the problem.  People should co-operate more with the Garda and help them in tracking down these drug pushers and finally reduce this traffic <Col N="2356" /> in death.  Many of us whom it does not affect take the attitude that you forget all about it, sweep it under the carpet, as with so many other things.</P>
    <P>The offer of the Customs and Excise union to the committee should not go unnoticed.  It should be acted upon, not forgotten about and just put into the report.  We need doers in this society in every department to ensure that when something good comes along it will not be just put on a shelf, that it will be put into effect and that someone will get to work on it.  How can you count the cost of putting more people into the drug unit who are dedicated to eliminating this terrible problem?  It may be a few million pounds or a mere few hundred thousand pounds, such as the union are seeking here.  I appeal to the Minister and the House that we respond to this offer and that we tackle this probem of crime section by section.  When the committee come into the House with reports those reports must be acted upon so that we do not come back here two or three years from now to hear it said that such a report was presented to the House three or four years ago and nothing done about it.</P>
    <P>If we can seize large quantities of drugs at the ports of entry, that is fine; but if you close one window another window will be opened.  The problem is very difficult what with roll-on roll-off containers and criminals who are happy to work on percentages and exploit unsuspecting people and use blackmail, deceit and violence in order to get their drugs.  However, it is a start.  Let us take it up and we will follow through with more reports to the House and we will appeal again in the House for resources from the Minister to tackle the problem.</P>

      <P>As the most recent addition to this Joint Committee I have had to read up in a short period reports which they have issued to which I was not a party, but in my professional capacity as a solicitor I know the problem and I have <Col N="2357" /> dealt with it in my constituency in the rural midlands.  Only once or twice have I come up against this very serious problem before the courts which has opened my eyes to the horror of heroin addiction and what it does to people.  While this report deals with only a limited aspect of the whole area of detection and how we can properly rid ourselves of this disease which is attacking our culture and our whole way of life, it is a job well done and I commend the members of the Joint Committee on its publication.</P>
      <P>I agree that customs officers have a greater role to play in this in terms of training and being allowed to implement their obvious desire to help in this area. The fact that they came before the committee voluntarily offering to help was a good sign from the union members.</P>
      <P>What the report regards as an elementary step, that is the setting up of a special drug unit within the Customs and Excise operation, should be undertaken immediately. Such a unit can liaise with the Garda Drugs Squad, as has been said here. Although we increase the efficiency with which we try to detect the import of illicit drugs, no matter how efficient we are we all accept that it is very difficult to stop the traffic absolutely in the modern world.  The basic problem, then, is how we attack it on the streets.  If the Minister is really committed to tackling this problem, if he is not prepared to accept glib smugness in his Department, I tell him that the task force recommendations have not been implemented.  When I was only a few short weeks in this House Deputy Gregory-Independent in a contribution here listed point after point of those recommendations on which no action had been taken.  At that time the Minister for Health and Social Welfare was preoccupied with attacking groups who were, he said, subversive and so forth, which was not very helpful to the drug addicts on the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, let me mention the retirement from the drug squad of Superintendent Mullins.  We wish him well.  That drug squad was born out of his commitment. I understand that he and a couple of other people started it in their spare <Col N="2358" /> time.  They had an interest in the problem and understood it, and they attempted to contain it despite their limited resources. This is an example of what can happen if committed people are given an opportunity to have a say in policy-making decisions rather than people who have careers in the Department of Justice.  Whatever resources have to be made available to that committed group of people should be made available to them.  There is no reason why resources should not be allocated to meet the recommendations of the task force, otherwise the task force can justifiably be called a cosmetic exercise. Unfortunately, in this parlimentary democracy we have too many examples of task forces and the like being set up which have proved to be cosmetic exercises. As a councillor and a public representative I have noticed the sheer brilliance with which administrators try to fob you off with the excuse that they cannot allocate resources and, even if they are short in their own Department, it is impossible to allocate resources from other Departments which are not required in those Departments to those areas most in need of resources.  This is an area of Irish life which requires an immediate allocation of resources in order to get dedicated men and women out to tackle this problem daily rather than a few people pontificating intermittently on the horror of the problem.  If that is done we will get somewhere with the unfortunate people who are destroying their lives by their addiction.</P>
    <P>The allocation of resources is the major problem here.  It is extraordinary how Government officials can explain the impossibility of allocating resources to areas where they are required.  The whole system of Estimates is archaic.  The Government would serve the people well if they got over these administrative bottlenecks which seem to pop up any time one tries to do something to tackle a problem as serious as this.  It is necessary that certain resources be allocated to Customs and Excise to ensure that their officials can counteract the sophisticated methods now used by drug peddlers in the importation of drugs.  A co-ordinated <Col N="2359" /> approach is required between the Departments of Health, Justice and Education to ensure that the thousands of young people who leave our educational system annually and face the prospect of unemployment for many years are prepared for life rather than being prepared for the debs ball which seems to be the main preoccupation of most educators at present.  People are leaving our education system so naive and uneducated in the ways of the world &mdash; they may get their As and Bs in their academic subjects &mdash; that we have a responsibility to make them aware that the world they are entering is not a very nice place, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>We should allocate the necessary resources to educate our young people about the sheer danger and horror of drugs.  We should arrange that groups are brought to courts to see these dishevelled unfortunates who may not have had a fix because they did not succeed in their bail application.  Young people should be permitted to see what is involved in trying to defend such young people and the disaster that surrounds a courtroom when such a person appears.  That would not involve the expenditure of much money but it would make young people realise that what they need is not a quick fix or a quick high.  They would realise that drugs potentially mean the destruction of life.  The committee is helping to highlight the seriousness of this problem.  I strongly recommend their report to the House.  I am not yet cynical about the workings of Government and I am hopeful something will be done about this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank members of the committee for their contribution to the report and to the Members who contributed to the debate.  I should like to thank the Revenue Commissioners whom we found to be very forthright and forthcoming.  Our meetings with them were workmanlike and valuable.  I do not mean to convey the impression that we agreed with them all the time but we welcomed their professional approach.  We welcomed the approach also of the Customs and Excise <Col N="2360" /> union.  I should like to praise their keenness to give whatever they had to try to combat this problem.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention one case which exemplified their approach.  The case, which was well reported, occurred last week.  Two persons were stopped by customs officers and had their baggage checked.  During the search one officer found coconuts and was alerted when he recognised the strong smell of cannabis. After being questioned the two people were handed over the the Garda.  That matter is before the courts.  Their alertness, training and the fact that they recognised the smell of cannabis exemplified more than anything else the interest such officials have been taking in this area.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for Finance for his comments today.  The Minister for Health since we issued our report has implemented several of our proposals.  We had our report published before the Bill which was being debated here had passed Committee Stage.  The result was that some of our provisions were taken into consideration.  One recommendation that is still outstanding relates to section 23 of the 1977 Act. We are seeking an amendment to enable officers of Customs and Excise to search a person who has not landed but remains on board a ship or aircraft and who is suspected of passing drugs to a &ldquo;meeter&rdquo; or &ldquo;greeter.&rdquo;  We hope further consideration will be given to that recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the drugs unit, several Members expressed the wish that we should have a good drugs unit within the Customs and Excise framework.  The Minister told us that two people were working almost full time on drugs but we are anxious to see a unit of three or four people established.  We are leaving it to the Revenue Commissioners to decide what that should be, but we were disappointed that we did not get a commitment from the Minister to set up such a unit.  It is obvious from what the Minister said that it would not take much to create such a unit.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that matter because of the impact such a unit could have on the <Col N="2361" /> drugs area.  Perhaps the Minister will inform the committee of his decision in due course.</P>
    <P>Legislation has been changed but as yet customs officers are not authorised to arrest without consulting a very senior officer.  The Minister should issue guidelines on this to the staff.  I accept that the legislation was passed only recently but I appeal to the Minister to move expeditiously to try to overcome any problems.  I am glad the Minister has agreed to consider issuing regulations to deal with stuffers and swallowers along the lines suggested in our report.  We look forward to hearing from the Minister in regard to that.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister give us a commitment to the experimental checking of container traffic.  He told us that he has made arrangements for this but we are not aware that any equipment has been provided for examining container traffic.  We would be interested to hear from the Minister in regard to that. Deputy Gregory, who referred to that, was confused because he could not identify the equipment anywhere.  It may be that it is about to go into operation.  We are aware that if customs officials wish to examine a container at Dublin port they have to virtually beg for the use of a warehouse to do this work.  Facilities should be provided for such examinations.</P>
    <P>Generally, we found that co-ordination was good but we should be careful not to become complacent.  The fact that co-ordination so far has been good does not mean that we should not make arrangements to ensure that it is better.</P>
    <P>Basically, we are satisfied that the report was regarded as relevant, timely and that many of its recommendations have been implemented so quickly.  Of course our customs constitute one aspect only of the whole problem of drugs and we clearly recognised that fact.  We do call for support, by way of resources and action, for our recommendations and for the work being done by the customs people in this area.</P>
    <P>The committee system is one that <Col N="2362" /> allows for frank, open discussion.  We want our report to be constructive and beneficial, ensuring that action is taken. We have seen action with regard to the neighbourhood watch report and we look forward to further action being taken in that area.  We have seen action also in relation to the customs and excise aspect of drugs, which we are glad to note.</P>
    <P>We are very happy to present this report to the House.  We thank Members for having contributed so eloquently to the debate.  We thank also the Minister and his officials who have been involved in the course of the day.</P>
    <P>I might put just one point on the record, that is that the Medico-Social Research Board report was one I commissioned at the time I was Minister specifically because we did not have information available to us in that area. That report established once and for all that there did exist a major and serious problem.  It is one that everybody recognises warrants settlement.  In other words, this is where the work of committees can be so useful in establishing factual positions.</P>

      <P>I have given permission for the following matter to be raised on the Adjournment &mdash; the State's investment in Storage Technology Products, Finglas, and the finding of a replacement industry therefor.  I received requests from Deputies Tunney, Flaherty and De Rossa.  Parts of all three were in order.  Deputy Tunney was in order, so was Deputy Flaherty and part of Deputy De Rossa's request.  I understand that the Deputies have agreed to share the time between them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for having given me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I suppose I should ask you also to accept our apologies for having <Col N="2363" /> found it so difficult to put ourselves in order in raising this matter.  In passing I must say that the need that exists for whatever committee of the House to deal with it should not be the case.  We have here the extraordinary position in which &mdash; from the research I have conducted in the last hour or two &mdash; the State had an investment of £3,750,000 of taxpayers' money originally in a company calling itself Documation, an American company, the one that piloted this industry in the Finglas area, which was taken over in 1980 by Storage Technology Products, a company that now, apparently &mdash; as far as its 363 workers are concerned &mdash; sent in a receiver on ten minutes notice.  I think the House should ponder on a situation that so permits.  I have had an interest in Irish entrepreneurs and have accompanied some to the IDA hoping that it would be possible &mdash; here I have one specific case in mind in the Finglas area &mdash; that grants would be given to an Irishman who was prepared to invest £500,000 in developing an industrial site. We were told by the IDA that they could not give him a penny.</P>
      <P>Leaving that aside for the moment, the present unfortunate situation is that a capital investment of £2,500,000, together with a training investment of £886,000 has yielded the appalling dividend that in Finglas there are 363 people who at this time last week thought they were in full, safe, comfortable employment &mdash; as a result of an investment by the State, on behalf of the taxpayers of Ireland &mdash; and now find themselves bewildered and, regrettably, forced to sit in until they can discover what their employment position is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole situation is such that it warrants not merely an expression of concern by my colleagues, Deputies Flaherty, De Rossa &mdash; and I am speaking for Deputy Michael Barrett as well &mdash; and myself, but one to which we must apply ourselves asking how this can happen.  Then, it having happened, we, elected Members who are expected ordinarily to represent the investment and the people affected, must walk this tightrope so that we can <Col N="2364" /> gain permission to give the matter expression in this House.</P>
    <P>I know that everybody here shares our feelings for the workers in question.  They have been driven to the point at which their only redress is one that is not ordinarily recommended, that of sitting in, endeavouring to hold the fort until they can discover what is to be their fortune, misfortune or, we hope, good fortune.  I know from inquiries I have made at the Department, the Minister and his Minister of State were unaware of this shock announcement.  Since then I have been given a copy of a cablegram.  It is rather brief, typical of the manner in which employees are treated in America.  In a short statement, affecting the employees in Finglas, part of that cablegram said:</P>
    <P>The company also said that it has placed its Dublin, Ireland subsidiary, Storage Technology Products, B.V., into receivership.  This subsidiary, which was acquired in 1980 with the acquisition of Documation, Inc., had 363 employees and was engaged in the manufacture of products for the European marketplace.  The company said that in the future these products would be supplied by Storage Technology's Puerto Rico and US facilities.</P>
    <P>Not one word of sympathy or consideration being expressed for the staff employed in Finglas, again reflecting the horrible situation obtaining in these large corporations and their lack of sensitivity for their employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>And then Deputies Flaherty and De Rossa can share the remainder. Because of the limitations on us we all feel frustrated and annoyed.  Nevertheless <Col N="2365" /> we have been given an opportunity of raising this matter.  We look forward to hearing from the Minister of State, to hearing some good news we might bring back to these workers that all is not lost, that alternative arrangements are being made so that they may continue to enjoy good employment.</P>
      <P>The final thought I would leave with the House is that we must all ponder on what else could have been done with that £3,750,000.  Surely it does not require any great economist or entrepreneur to discover alternative investment sources for that £3,750,000 so that we would not now be here endeavouring to ascertain where that money went &mdash; because it did not all go into the pockets of the employees &mdash; and how better it could have been deployed.</P>
      <P>Let us take whatever are the appropriate safeguards so that a similar situation will not recur.  More immediately and finally I hope the Minister of State will be able to assure us that we can take back to these workers the news that their future is relatively safe in his hands, that he has news for us that alternative arrangements have been made so that their employment can be secured.</P>

      <P>I would like to share the sense of relief with Deputy Tunney that at last we have managed to raise this matter in this House.  It is a pity that it is so difficult to raise a matter which is of major concern to a particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of Storage Technology Products has been a devastating blow to the community in Finglas.  Parts of Finglas have a very high level of unemployment. We have lost a number of older industries in the past but Storage Technology was one of the bright new hopes for the future and its loss hits the area very hard.  Its workforce is young, recently recruited and well trained.  The closure of this plant raises very serious questions about IDA investments and the monitoring of those investments.  Only last year I welcomed in this House and in my constituency the allocation of EC and IDA funds of over £3 million to these premises, but today my major concern is <Col N="2366" /> that the Minister will do all he can to ensure that Storage Technology will be maintained as a going concern.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell me what the relationship with the parent company is now.  Is there any hope of a reorganisation of that company in the United States or are the links permanently broken?  Is there any hope in that direction?  Is there any hope of finding an interested party who would take over this business as a going concern?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister look at the undoubted assets and attractions of this plant.  As I mentioned, the workforce is young and specially trained.  This firm is very important for the families in the locality.  Over 80 per cent of the staff come from Finglas.  The closure of this plant is another blow to this area which has already been badly hit by unemployment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney said a section of the workforce are in occupation of the premises. This is due to the disgraceful treatment meted out to the employees by the management and the fact that they did not make any announcement about the closure.  There has always been an excellent industrial relations history at this plant.  This makes it all the more unacceptable that a workforce which co-operated at all times with management should be treated in this way.  When selling this plant the Minister can sell that fact. Despite the occupation of the plant by certain sections of the workforce, there is a goodwill among the workers and they treat the plant with the utmost respect. Their occupation of the factory is a reaction to the treatment meted out to them by management.</P>

      <P>This is a modern IDA plant of the highest standard.  It has had an investment by way of equipment of the order of £3 million from the IDA and the EC.  It would be a scandalous waste of taxpayers' money if we were to write <Col N="2367" /> that money off without the most energetic fight.  I urge the Minister to spare no effort to find an interested party who will take over this plant as a going concern.</P>

      <P>It goes without saying that if Storage Technology Products closes with a loss of 363 jobs that would be a very severe body blow to an area with an unemployment rate far above the national average.  There is 50 per cent unemployment among the people between 15 and 25 years in the Finglas area.  There are a number of worrying aspects relating to this case, one of which is the 24 hours' notice given to the staff that the Irish subsidiary was going into liquidation.  It is extraordinary that management should decide to put the Irish subsidiary into liquidation and not into receivership which would have left a receiver with a much freer hand to find an alternative project for that factory.</P>
      <P>However, we must recognise that the electronics industry is changing, and is in the process of very fast change, and that failures are bound to occur.  I believe some kind of early warning system should be in existence which would include bodies like the IDA and the Department monitoring what is happening in the world of electronics and monitoring what is happening to the parent companies of the Irish subsidiaries.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the parent company attempted to diversify and failed, resulting in massive losses.  They are trying to cut those losses now and, in effect, they have cut off the Irish arm of their operations. However, we should not go off with the idea that electronics is not the area to be in.  It is the only area which is providing growth in employment in this country and we should not be advocating the transfer of funds by the IDA from the electronics industry to other areas, particularly traditional areas which are in decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the worrying aspect that some of our electronics industry is subject to being &ldquo;knocked out&rdquo; overnight.  I would <Col N="2368" /> like to see the Minister taking steps to ensure that we have far more indigenously based industries and that we are not entirely dependent on large conglomerates and multinationals which can shut at a moment's notice.</P>
    <P>The point has already been made that the IDA have invested £2.8 million in capital grants in this company.  I would like the Minister to say if he sees any prospect of that money, and the jobs being saved.  I understand the liquidator told the staff at a meeting yesterday that he has an interested party who wants to look at the factory but he requires that they give up occupation of the factory before he will introduce that interested party to the plant.  I would like the Minister to confirm that there is an alternative project avaialble, or that somebody is interested in setting up an alternative project there, so that the 363 workers can be assured that this is not a ruse simply to get them out of the factory to enable it to be closed down and auctioned off.  It is important that the Minister confirms if that is true.  I should like to echo the point made by the other speakers about the difficulty in getting an issue like this raised.  I know it is not the fault of the Ceann Comhairle or his staff but is due to the operation of the rules as they exist. Perhaps proposals could be made to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to have the matter dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of the Deputies who have spoken with regard to the future of the company and the maintenance of the jobs of the workers there.  I want to point out very clearly that a provisional liquidator has been appointed.  Therefore, it is essentially a holding operation.  Only when the liquidator completes his assessment of the company's position will it be possible to see what the future holds and what possibilities there are for the preservation of the existing operations or the substitution for them of new operations.  In all of this our primary concern will have to be the preservation of the existing jobs or as <Col N="2369" /> many of them as possible.  In the present situation I sympathise very much with the workers.  However, until the liquidator has assessed the situation it would be premature to speculate as to what might happen.  Such speculation could indeed be unhelpful in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>On the background to recent events of the company it is important, first, to understand that this situation is due to causes external to this company.  Storage Technology Corporation of Louisville, Colorado, its United States parent, is experiencing difficulties.  Press reports in recent times have indicated that its trading position deteriorated to the point where it has been obliged to secure the protection of the United States' courts under chapter 11 of the United States bankruptcy code.  This basically means that it is protected from the legal actions of creditors while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts and reorganise its business.</P>
      <P>The parent firm's difficulties arose from the two main causes, first, a delay in getting a major new product developed and on the market; and, secondly, it had to drop plans for a new computer after it had spent heavily on its development.  Its tape-drive products which are produced at the Finglas plant mainly for the European markets were unable on their own to maintain the firm's position.  Its overall problems, therefore, have been affecting the performance of the Finglas plant.</P>
      <P>The decision to appoint a provisional liquidator on 9 November did not, therefore, come as a total surprise.  As I have explained, there had been difficulties.  I should also point out that the plant at Finglas suffered substantial losses last year and is likely to have suffered continuous losses this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the workforce, 363 people were employed by the company in Finglas on 9 November.  Over 90 had opted for voluntary redundancy terms offered by the firm over recent months.  The fact of a provisional liquidator's appointment does not necessarily mean that any or all of these jobs will be lost.  Any conclusions on that score must await the provisional liquidator's assessment.  I must say quite <Col N="2370" /> clearly &mdash; and this point was raised specifically by Deputy De Rossa &mdash; that the sit-in over recent days is not helpful in present circumstances.  I understand that following the provisional liquidator's meeting with the trade unions yesterday evening the workers were today voting on whether or not to allow the liquidator limited access to the Finglas plant.  I hope they decide to do so because otherwise he will be unable to conclude his vital assessment of the situation.  Preventing him from doing his work serves only to prolong uncertainty about the future of the company and does not improve the prospects for finding a way forward such as allowing visitations to the plant by possible take-over companies.  It would be premature at this point to make any prognostications in that regard.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I can only assure Deputies and the House that the seriousness of the situation is fully appreciated and that the IDA and my Department will continue to keep in close touch with the situation.  Depending on the course of action decided on as a result of the provisional liquidator's assessment the IDA, in the interest of protecting their existing investment in the firm and in the interests of the workforce, will seek either to secure the existing operation by whatever courses of action are open to them or else to provide an alternative project.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa discussed the position of the multinationals.  It is far too early to say what conclusions, if any, we can draw from this case about the nature of multinational firms.  We must remember that firms the world over, whether small or large, get into difficulties.  Sometimes these are resolved and sometimes they are not.  Size is no protection against getting into difficulties.  Furthermore, simply being in an industry like electronics or computers is no guarantee of success, as we have seen on a number of occasions.  These are extremely competitive industries.  They are subject to rapidly changing technology.  There is very little margin for error in bringing forward the right new products at the right time.  Firms which falter have to <Col N="2371" /> take prompt corrective action on a variety of fronts.</P>
    <P>The recent White Paper on Industrial Policy made it quite clear that for the forseeable future we must continue to attract overseas firms to meet our employment and other growth targets. It is inevitable that there will be some difficulties, and even closures, from among those firms.  That is the nature of our development policies.  The challenge here in the electronics area is to increase the level of domestic linkages and to ensure that overseas firms locate their key business functions here.  The White Paper emphasises the need for both.  It is only by doing so that we will be successful in achieving a transfer of technology into this country which will be of help to the growth of indigenous firms in these high tech industries.  We cannot hope to grasp the changing advanced technology on our own.  For the most part we must rely on a transfer of technology into the country. That is a vital and essential element of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney referred to the substantial investment of £3,750,000 as a grant aid to the company and asked what else could have been done with that £3,750,000.  I suggest that at the time the investment of the taxpayers' money in the Finglas plant was welcomed by all concerned.  The firm was seen as a high-flyer in the electronics industry.  We cannot have our bread buttered on both sides.  We cannot welcome the firm one day and more or less abuse it the next day.  That is not facing up to reality.  The IDA will exercise their legal authority over whatever grant moneys are due to be repaid to them.  If that is necessary it will be done.  Hopefully, there will be a more favourable outcome.  I cannot say at the moment what the outcome will be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty sought clarification on the relationship of the Irish company to the United States parent.  The position is maintained.  The parent company has filed under chapter 11.  That does not mean there has been a break in the link between the parent company and its <Col N="2372" /> subsidiary here in Ireland.  It is still one group.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware of the hurt and frustration this has caused to the workers of the area.  They have our full sympathy. I offer the goodwill of the State, and particularly of the IDA, in an effort to resolve the problem.  Hopefully, the parent company will resolve its financial difficulties under chapter 11 in the United States legal system.  It is a good chapter and it has ensured a favourable outcome for many companies in similar situations. Hopefully, that will be the position here. It would be slightly premature for us to say much more about the matter at this point.  We have to see what happens under chapter 11 and we have to see the decision of the provisional liquidator in regard to the future of this company.</P>

I can say quite definitely that the sit-in is militating <Col N="2374" /> against the better interests of the workers.</P>

      <P>There is no record in my Department of the receipt of an application for a mortgage subsidy or of a statement of intent to marry from the person named.  However, I understand that he was informed verbally of his ineligibility for the subsidy because, as a single person, he had the foundations of his house poured and the mortgage executed during the period 23 July 1981 to 25 March 1982 when subsidy was restricted to married persons and persons about to marry who got married within 12 months of the date of execution of the mortgage.  The person referred to did not satisfy the latter requirement since he had his mortgage executed on 8 March 1982 and got married in September 1983.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2328" /> With a view to improving the level of tax compliance at earlier stages in the collection process, thereby reducing the burden on the collection mechanisms available through Sheriffs and County Registrars certain measures were introduced in the Finance Act, 1983.  More stringent provisions were brought in to counteract delays in the disposal of appeals against assessments and estimates. These provisions appear likely ultimately to reduce the number of certificates to be executed by Sheriffs and County Registrars.  Other measures in the 1983 Act aimed at helping to secure earlier compliance with tax demands without resort to Sheriffs and County Registrars included provisions for (i) imprisonment for certain revenue offences, (ii) disclosure by financial institutions in defined circumstances of information about accounts held by certain individuals, (iii) obtaining a comprehensive return of property owned by a person whose return of income was unsatisfactory, (iv) obtaining information as to the identity of the beneficial owners of stocks and shares held by nominees and (v) the publication by the Revenue Commissioners of the names and addresses of persons convicted of tax offences or involved in back duty settlements.  It would not be possible, until much more experience has been gained of the operation of the provisions mentioned, to attempt any realistic assessment of their impact on the tax collection work of Sheriffs and County Registrars.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer ceased employment on 30 July 1984 and submitted a claim to repayment of tax to the inspector of taxes on 7 August 1984. However, the inspector has not been able to process the claim because he did not receive the employer's copy of the cessation certificate (which is required under PAYE Regulations) confirming the amounts of pay and tax deducted during the taxpayer's period of employment. The inspector wrote to the taxpayer's former employer on 12 September 1984 for the necessary details but a reply has not been received.  In the circumstances, he has now contacted the employer directly by telephone and has been given an undertaking that the required information will be submitted without further delay.  On receipt of this information any refund of tax found due will be made as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded an old age pension with effect from 20 February 1983.  He is currently receiving a pension of £32.05 a week, which is the rate appropriate to the latest assessment of his means consisting of half the weekly value of a holding.</P>
      <P>The pensioner applied for an increase in pension on the grounds that his circumstances had disimproved.  Following an investigation of his circumstances it was decided that his means did not warrant any increase in his pension.  The pensioner appealed against this decision and his appeal has been submitted to an appeals officer for determination.  The appeal will be decided as soon as possible and the pensioner will be notified of the outcome without delay.</P>

      <P>According to the records of the Department the person concerned is qualified for optical benefit.  There is no record of a claim having been received from him during the current year.  A claim form has now been issued to enable him to nominate the optician from whom he wishes to obtain the treatment.  On receipt of this information his claim will be approved and a letter of authorisation issued to him.  Under the optical benefit scheme a sight test and glasses of a particular type are available free of charge to qualified insured persons.  If the claimant chooses a more expensive type of glasses he is liable for the balance of the cost.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was assessed with means of £14.40 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging on his fathers holding.  Self-employment was not a factor in the assessment of means.  He is at present in receipt of unemployment assistance at £17.35 weekly the appropriate rate £31.75 less means £14.40.  He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer reduced his means to £14 weekly effective from 22 August 1984.  He is accordingly entitled to £17.75 weekly £31.75 less means £14.  All arrears due to him will be paid next week and payments of £17.75 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Deputy is aware <Col N="2337" /> that the original scheme for the provision of a new building at Lady Lane for St. Martin's School, Waterford, had to be abandoned when in the course of preliminary site works features of important archaeological interest were uncovered. Following that it was necessary for the school authorities to acquire a new site and to start afresh on the design of a school with reference to that site.  My Department is at present considering a report from the Commissioners of Public Works regarding the costings of the proposed new building which are now satisfactory and expects in the near future to issue formal grant sanction, together with authorisation for the preparation of contract documentation.</P>

      <P>On 26 September 1984, my Department received applications for payment of redundancy lump sums from the Redundancy Fund in respect of 78 employees of Corcoran &amp; Co. Ltd., which had gone into receivership.</P>
      <P>I understand that the receiver has sold the business and that the new owner has re-employed, or continued the employment of, a considerable number of the workforce.  If there was continuity of employment under the Redundancy Acts in regard to the workers who were taken on by the new owner, these workers might not be entitled to payment of redundancy lump sums.  There is a complex legal issue involved here which is under consideration, in consultation with the Attorney General's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is arranging to pay redundancy lump sums to eligible employees of the company who were not taken on by the new owner.  Inquiries are being made to identify these employees and payments will be made from the <Col N="2338" /> Redundancy Fund without delay as soon as this has been done.</P>
