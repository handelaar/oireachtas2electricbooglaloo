    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had referred last evening to the contribution by the Minister for Labour in relation to the enterprise allowance scheme and his proposal to introduce legislation in relation to equality, with particular emphasis on equality for women.  I also spoke about the enterprise allowance scheme with regard to getting people into productive employment &mdash; in other words, paying them for working rather than being on the dole doing nothing.  Certainly the enterprise allowance scheme will make a great contribution in this regard.  I also made the point that on this occasion, as against this time last year, Labour Party Ministers had made a substantially greater contribution to at least moving toward what I would see as being Labour Party policy and I congratulate them on having done so.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the decision of the Government not to apply VAT to footwear in view of the fact that that industry is one of the largest in my constituency, indeed one of our most important native industries. Not being too happy with the application of VAT to clothing I made a very strong point in this regard to my colleagues in Government.  Its application, as announced in the budget, will not be very practical.  I do not think it will succeed. I think it will create more problems than it will resolve.  It may resolve some financial problems, but the system, as outlined in the budget, will create major problems of administration, manufacturing, retail and wholesale level.  If it was necessary to apply VAT on clothing it would, as the lesser of two evils, have been better to apply it uniformly on all clothing.  I do not think that excluding one section of the industry will benefit employment, the consumer or the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a trade unionist, I want to refer to unemployment.  We are all aware of the <Col N="1399" /> problem and all parties are united in agreeing that unemployment is the greatest issue facing us today.  I do not see any major strides being made towards relieving that situation in the budget, but there are some concessions which will obviously be of help.  With regard to my own Border constituency, on a number of occasions I made a strong case to the Minister for Finance and other Ministers who have responsibility in financial areas, and I am glad that Deputy Moynihan is here this morning because he must be aware of the problems in the tourist industry as he comes from a major tourist area.</P>
    <P>We were pleased last year when VAT in the hotel industry was reduced from 23 per cent to 18 per cent.  However, even that does not really help in the Border areas because of the price differential. There is still too great an incentive for people to flock across the Border in their thousands.  It is estimated that about £40 million was lost to the Republic in the Newry area in a six month period last year.  This is a frightening figure, although I appreciate that our brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland had to cope with the same situation when the position was reversed.  Our policy should be designed in such a way that the differential will not be as great as it is now. There is no point in saying that we will improve surveillance on the Border and provide more customs and excise officers. That will not work, because it is well known that you cannot physically stem the tide of people crossing in their thousands, especially at weekends. Whilst the price increases on a number of items have been much smaller than in previous budgets, they do very little, if anything, to solve the problems.  Therefore, the Border area must be singled out for special consideration, because there is a difference between the competitiveness of Cork and Kerry, Newry and Dundalk or Clones and its neighbouring towns on the other side of the Border.  A Cheann Comhairle, as a Deputy in a Border area you will appreciate what is happening there.  We will be faced with mass unemployment growing on a daily basis <Col N="1400" /> in garages, supermarkets, shops and all the service industries that provide employment in Dundalk, Drogheda, Ardee and Carrickmacross.</P>
    <P>If we cannot get concessions in the budget what should we get?  I have already spoken to the Minister for the Environment in relation to the natural gas pipeline, which I hope will go ahead without further delay so that we will be able to utilise this very valuable natural resource to attract alternative employment in Border areas.  It took quite a lengthy period to resolve the differences and to reach agreement on prices with Northern Ireland.  I hope it will not take as long for An Bord Gáis to proceed with this pipeline through County Louth, via Drogheda and Dundalk, which are the two major industrial towns in the Border area, and that the natural gas pipeline will have links which will service towns like Ardee, Carrickmacross, Cavan and Monaghan.  This is the only opportunity we have to attract alternative employment, but it will only come if it is given to us at the best possible competitive price.  There is no point in giving us natural gas as simply an alternative energy, as this will be no incentive to industries which are already operating there.  All the large companies, Premier Periclase, Carroll's and the breweries, use a considerable amount of energy.  Dundalk is still operating on town gas and would benefit greatly from the new gas if it is supplied at the right price and not in competition with Dublin Gas.  Premier Periclase are one of the biggest users of energy in the State.  They extract magnesium from sea water and would benefit more than most from natural gas.  I am satisfied from the discussions which I had with the Minister for the Environment that he will use his influence and decision making function with An Bord Gáis to have this natural resource supplied to County Louth and the Border areas.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Irish industry is suffering greatly from the cost of energy. If the Government wished to develop employment, the key to doing so is in the cost of energy.  It has been clearly established that we have the most expensive energy costs in Western Europe.  I cannot <Col N="1401" /> understand why successive Governments have not been able to see that a cheap energy policy with regard to industry would substantially increase our job potential, secure existing jobs and attract foreign and home industry.  Everybody agrees with this policy but no one does anything about it.</P>
    <P>The IDA have given the State very good service.  It was easy to attract jobs when we were offering a package on a competitive basis which was unequalled in European terms.  The Americans, Japanese and the British were flocking here to avail of the package we had to offer, especially companies located outside the EEC who wanted to get a foothold in the EEC market and inside the trade barriers. That no longer exists, and, therefore, it is necessary for the IDA to substantially change their direction.  They have done that to some degree in relation to the development of small industries. We now agree that small is beautiful and that large companies, even multi-nationals, are in jeopardy.  We have to concentrate on building up national industries. We have a clear example in Japan where over 85 per cent of industry is small and locally based.  That policy has to be developed, but that can only be done successfully if the regional offices of the IDA operate on a more co-ordinated basis.</P>
    <P>Very often a young man who has been made redundant asks local representatives for advice on setting up a new industry. We tell him that the IDA, AnCO, the county development officers, YEA and so on can help him.  We tell him where to go to get planning permission, to arrange water and sewage facilities and so on.  It should not be necessary for elected representatives to do this.  The IDA regional offices should be structured in such a way that all these services are brought under the one umbrella at regional level.  If someone has an idea and a few pounds redundancy pay to start a new business, and all the necessary expertise, he should be able to get all the necessary help at local level because every town and village should have small ready-made industrial units to attract these young entrepreneurs.  If the IDA examine the amount of imported goods <Col N="1402" /> in the engineering, industrial or commercial fields, they will find there are thousands of opportunities for young and not so young people to set up their own businesses, but they are discouraged from doing so because of the web of problems they find at every level.  I came across such a case very recently where a young man had a very good idea to set up a new industry, which would employ three or four people, to produce an article which would replace an imported article.  He spent six months putting all the pieces together after consulting with the IDA, AnCO, the county development officer, the local authority and so on.  The structure of the IDA should be looked at: it should relate more to our natural resources, there should be more local offices and there should be more co-ordination locally.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the building industry.  There are about 60,000 people unemployed in this industry.  Small incentives were given to this industry in the budget, but not enough to justify a revival of the industry at national level.  Co-ordination between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of the Environment on the following basis might be very helpful.  The Labour Party are committed to setting up a national pay-related pension scheme.  I was disappointed that this was not referred to in the budget but hopefully the Minister for Social Welfare will take that as a priority in the very near future.  The funds from a national pay-related pension scheme could be invested in house building and the industrial building sector.  In the same way as the new loan system under the housing finance scheme is attracting money from private sources, I believe a national pay-related pension scheme would generate millions of pounds which could be channelled into the building industry by way of house loans, incentives to builders, loans to State organisations &mdash; such as the IDA for the purpose of providing factory buildings &mdash; loans for badly needed school buildings, civil engineering works, sewage and water facilities and so on.  New areas for seeking finance have to be found, and here is an area where money paid by <Col N="1403" /> workers could be channelled into productive work to create employment.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the source of our present economic problems.  The State has to carry too high a percentage of our non-working population.  At present one-quarter of our total working population are drawing from State funds, whether by unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit, old age pensions, widows and orphans allowances and so on.  The social welfare burden has grown enormously because of unemployment.  If we solve our unemployment problems we will not have the type of budget or balance of payments we had over the past two years. Unemployment is the source of all our problems.  If the Government cannot see that they are not doing their job and if they are to do their job, they must resolve this problem immediately.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see that there has been some relief of VAT on concrete products and stock relief.  I hope this will help to stabilise the building and supply industry. I want to refer to the problems my colleagues and I have at local authority level and the disaster we had in County Louth trying to apply a £26 charge for services. Many of us forecast that this would not succeed, and we were proved right.  It has not been possible to collect that money. If local authorities are to be reorganised, and if they are to charge for services, this will have to be done in an effective way.</P>
    <P>The rates relief grant from the Department of the Environment to local authorities is such that almost all local authorities will have to introduce new charges or increase existing ones.  Last year it was not necessary to apply charges in Drogheda corporation and Dundalk Urban District Council because of good housekeeping by both authorities but, as mayor of Drogheda, I am not sure if that will be possible this year.  I will have more to say about this when we discuss the estimates shortly.  It appears that there will be a net deficit in relation to the amount of money applied to local authorities this year as against last year.  We all accept that our problems were caused by the elimination of rates.  We no longer <Col N="1404" /> have the money to run local authorities.</P>
    <P>Talking about unemployment, it is a shame that, while we are knocking off men right across the board at local authority level, in the craft sector, in the general sector and even in the professional sector, putting them onto unemployment benefit and paying them for doing nothing, at the same time we have not got enough men to repair potholes, or to repair windows, doors and roofs for old ladies.  In some cases we pay people the same amount of money for doing nothing. This is degrading and nobody wants it.  We have fully qualified, skilled men who could be employed by the local authorities, but they are queueing up to collect the dole on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>There is no logic in that.  It appears to those of us charged with the responsibility to run our local affairs that there is no co-ordination between Government Departments.  The Department of Social Welfare have their allocation and do their own thing.  The Department of the Environment have their allocation and do their own thing.  There does not seem to be any attempt to transfer money from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of the Environment to take people off the dole and get them into productive employment in the building industry or wherever it may be.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the system. I do not know whether it is that Ministers cannot agree or civil servants cannot agree.  There must be some disagreement at departmental level when millions of pounds are being spent on social welfare benefits while employees of local authorities are being knocked off and put on social welfare.  On a businesslike basis the Government and most of the Departments would be out of business long ago.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to people who are fortunate enough to be at work.  Last year I had to vote against the Social Welfare Bill.  I am glad we have nothing like that this year.  Hopefully nobody will get a brain storm and introduce that type of legislation.  It did not succeed in resolving any of our problems or in correcting any of the abuses.  This time last year we had <Col N="1405" /> 13,000 people working a three day week and being paid for three days.  Now we have approximately 2,000 people on a three day week.  Rather than carrying people on a three day week employers have disemployed them, made them redundant, and put them on full-time unemployment.  While they are on full-time unemployment they are making no contribution to the Exchequer.  They are not paying PRSI.  They are not paying unemployment benefit.  They are not paying anything apart from the normal VAT and so on.  At the same time the Department of Social Welfare are paying them for doing nothing.</P>
    <P>I warned that this would happen, and it has happened.  It is unfortunate that Ministers are not getting the right advice. Those of us in industry could see what would happen, and it has happened.  We now have 10,000 more people on the unemployment heap, drawing full-time social welfare and paying nothing into the system.  Workers who are employed are paying more and more into the Exchequer from their earnings, to a degree where the incentive has been taken out of the workplace.  I see nothing in the budget to restore that incentive. Naturally as a trade unionist I welcome the fact that 15,000 people will be taken out of the tax net.  Last year I was shouted at by a number of people when I said old age pensioners with miserable pittances were paying tax while millionaires were getting away with substantial sums of money.</P>
    <P>Last night I heard the case of a man who lives in Drogheda.  I will not mention his name.  His retirement pension from the building industry is £13.12 after working for over 30 years in the building industry. Believe it or not his tax was £8.53. His net take home pension was £4.59. This should be noted by those of us who are fortunate enough to have pensions, including those in the public service who operate the system.  Last year people said what I was saying was untrue, but there is the proof of it.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is happening in this country of ours.  This man contributed all his life to the system.  He worked his guts out in all sorts of weather and conditions <Col N="1406" /> in the building industry.  He gets a pension of £13 after 30 years.  Why?  Because most of the employers he worked for did not pay any contribution.  Even though he paid his contribution it was not returned to the Exchequer.  There is no machinery in the State to ensure that those contributions are returned.  He has no State pension.  He has no guaranteed pension.  He has no pension given to him by the Oireachtas.  He has to depend on his own miserable old age pension, plus £13.</P>
    <P>I spoke about this in the first contribution I made to the Dáil, and nothing has changed since.  I want to send a clear message to my colleague, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  He should introduce a national pay-related pension which will bring people working in the building industry and the factories into line with those sections of the community who are privileged, those people who have guaranteed pensions of two-thirds of their salary for administering the affairs of the State.  What is the difference between those of us who are in a privileged position and those who have to earn the money to pay for the pensions of people with guaranteed State pensions of two-thirds of their pay?</P>
    <P>The public servants within the Departments should get off their backsides and put that case to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach.  That would be doing a good job for the working classes.  If we call ourselves socialists, or if we have a social conscience, we must realise where the maximum poverty arises: with old people and widows who have to exist on miserable pensions.  We would not need a committee on poverty if every man and woman who retired from employment had a decent take home pension after working for a lifetime.  You will excuse me, a Cheann Comhairle, but that is a subject which really gets me going.  As long as I am here I will make this contribution at every available opportunity.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer very briefly to a number of areas where there is employment potential.  Clogherhead is a fishing village not far from the town of Drogheda.  They have a healthy and <Col N="1407" /> thriving industry there.  They have been waiting ten years for a pier.  They have been caught up in a web of bureaucracy between the Department of this, that and the other, Louth County Council, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Fisheries and all sorts of other red herrings.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is funny myself. This is an opportunity to develop an industry based on a natural resource. That village has existed for 100 years and the community has survived based on fishing at Clogherhead.  Boats are very expensive and it is an expensive operation having regard to the cost of fuel.  It is not possible to develop that industry unless the village is given a new harbour, a new pier.  For over ten years successive Ministers and successive Governments have spoken about it and nothing has been done.  At this moment a delegtion is meeting the Minister on the subject of Drogheda Harbour.  Two sections of the harbour wall are in the river.  This is one of the few ports employing over 400 people but we cannot get money.  The necessary work would cost a couple of million pounds but it would be put back into the economy very quickly by way of increased employment and increased business and would aid industrial development in north and south Louth.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about creating employment then we have ample opportunity in fishing and agriculture.  It is time that the trade unions and the farming organisations got together.  It is time that the farm leaders and the trade union leaders stopped having a go at one another and put the interests of the country before personal interests.  It is time for the formation of a national forum involving the farming organisations, the trade unions and the State and semi-State sectors so that there could be an exchange of views enabling co-ordinated action in the interests of the country.  If the agriculture-based industries are doing well the economy is doing well and industry and services will prosper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> I take this opportunity to pay tribute to AnCO of which I was a founder member. I have seen this organisation grow from five people to 5,000 people.  I have seen their contribution to the community. I feel that money which has been raised in various ways would be more productively used if channelled through that organisation.  They seem to be one of the most progressive semi-State organisations. I am particularly conscious of the work they have done in every town and village in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the AnCO redundant apprentices scheme.  Under this scheme young men have reconstructed derelict buildings which would never have been reconstructed by the local authority, and made them fit for human habitation.  This is the way we should be moving.  Here is a typical example of State money, together with EEC money, being used to take young apprentices off the dole to work for a local authority on the reconstruction of derelict buildings.  That example should be followed by the public service.  The YEA should certainly examine this project.</P>
    <P>The NBA have adopted a policy of expandable housing.  When I first saw that term I wondered what it meant, and I have now discovered that the NBA are building small private houses with one or two rooms designed in such a way that they can be added to as a family grows. A young married couple could obtain an SDA loan from the local authority to enable them to purchase the house from the NBA and at a later stage the house could be expanded if necessary.  This is a novel idea which should be taken up by the Minister for the Environment in the interests of activating the building industry.</P>
    <P>Another good idea was adopted recently by a clothing manufacturer who decided to use the profits from his business to build private houses instead of investing his money in the bank or outside the country.  That type of initiative should be encouraged both locally and at Government level.</P>

      <P>I cannot recall a previous occasion on which a budget could be so clearly identified as the direct outcome of a political situation, nor indeed has there been any occasion which I can recollect where the entire political background to the budget has been known in such detail by the general public.</P>
      <P>Before Christmas I gave it as my view that the budget would be decided on the basis of a political compromise formula, rather than on what the economy required.  This is exactly what has happened. The political battle began when the Taoiseach, Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, indicated in a radio interview that he would be looking for a cut of about £500 million in current expenditure.  The battle raged through an unending series of Government meetings until it finally became clear that nothing could be agreed.  This is why we have got a budget which has no identifiable strategy and no particular financial or economic objectives. This budget is in fact a political compromise.  It does not respond to the needs of our economic situation.  It is all that could be agreed.  The political reality is that no action can be taken to deal with our economic problems because we have a deeply divided coalition Government.</P>
      <P>The year 1983 was disastrous, one of the worst in the history of the State. Unemployment rose by 28,000.  Investment fell.  Building and construction practically ceased.  Consumer spending declined, and the endless procession of factory closures seriously undermined a large section of our industrial base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To some extent these catastrophic economic developments resulted from the worldwide economic recession.  The <Col N="1410" /> results of that recession, however, were greatly exacerbated in our case by the mistaken policies pursued by this Government in the 1983 budget.  These policies inflicted widespread hardship and deprivation throughout the community. That hardship and deprivation is real and persistent.  It has been especially severe on social welfare recipients and lower income families, but families were also affected for the first time who had never known deprivation of this kind before.  Most families were faced at every turn with increased taxes, higher prices, new costs, charges, fees and levies; some new attack on their living standards.  For all but a small privileged section of the community the struggle to make ends meet became a grim everyday reality.</P>
    <P>But all this unemployment and hardship were endured for nothing.  The whole bookkeeping exercise turned out to be one of the greatest mistakes in our economic history.  The fiscal targets have not been reached and have now been abandoned.  The current budget deficit is no nearer to being eliminated than it was at the beginning of the year.  The national debt increased by an all-time record of almost £3,000 million.  Foreign debt increased by about £100 million more than in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The full realisation by the Government of how wrong the strategy of the 1983 budget was and the extent of the damage done to the economy is clearly expressed in this one damning quotation from the Minister for Finance's speech:</P>
    <P>While inflation has come down significantly and the balance of payments problem has been greatly alleviated, consumption has declined, investment has fallen, unemployment has risen and growth has been stifled.</P>
    <P>There was only one thing left for any honourable Minister for Finance to say after that admission of total failure.  He should have gone on to say: &ldquo;And because I have been responsible for this dreadful damage to the economy I now intend to resign.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This whole question of the current budget deficit has been turned into something of a comedy.  This Coalition <Col N="1411" /> Government no longer retains any credibility in regard to it.  The first act in the comedy was the clearly stated objective in the programme for Government of this Coalition when it was formed, of eliminating the current budget deficit by 1987. In the run up to the 1983 budget the Fine Gael side of the Government indicated that a start would be made on this programme of elimination by fixing the current budget deficit for 1983 at £750 million.</P>
    <P>In the event, that became £897 million in the budget itself.  Subsequently, at a meeting in Barrettstown Castle in July, the £897 million was revised upward to £950 million.  When the figures were published at the end of the year it was clear that the actual deficit was certainly more than £1,000 million.</P>
    <P>The latest step in this fiscal farce was the setting in last Wednesday's budget of a current deficit for 1984 of £1,088 million. This was accompanied by statements from the Minister for Finance and others that the target of eliminating the deficit by 1987 had in effect been abandoned.</P>
    <P>Being the sort of Government they are, however, a Government which do not in fact formulate and implement policies but rather conduct public relations campaigns about policies, they were not prepared to come before the public and state openly and honestly that this objective about which they had preached at such great length was being abandoned.  Some pretence of fiscal rectitude had to be maintained.  Accordingly, they set the public relations machine to work to sell the idea that the amount of the current budget deficit was not what was important but what really mattered was the percentage of GNP that the current budget deficit represents.  We no longer hear about the actual amount of the current budget deficit from the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach or anyone else on the Government side.  Instead, we are now told that what is being reduced is the percentage of GNP that the deficit represents. This is, of course, totally misleading. The figure for GNP for any particular year is very difficult to calculate. <Col N="1412" /> Economists keep revising it long after the year has ended.  To claim that the current deficit of £1,088 million represents a particular percentage of the 1984 GNP, which is not yet known, and that this represents a reduction of 1 per cent on the 1983 percentage, is meaningless.</P>
    <P>Economic forecasting is a fairly hazardous business at any time, and it is impossible for anyone at this stage to state with any certainty what the figure for GNP in 1984 will be.  Different institutions have given different estimates of the projected rate of growth in the economy in 1984.  How then can the Government attempt to claim that the current budget deficit will, as a percentage of GNP, be down by 1 per cent?</P>
    <P>The possible margin of error in the measurement of the GNP itself for any year is more than 1 per cent.  This specious claim must be exposed as bogus.</P>
    <P>One figure totally dominates the scene into which this budget has been introduced, and that is the number of persons out of work &mdash; 208,000.  The central issue of our economic and social life is that frightening level of unemployment and the fact that it continues to rise.  The full extent of the economic and social damage that mass unemployment of this size causes can hardly be overestimated.  It brings hardship and deprivation to thousands of homes; it spreads frustration and unrest; it destroys human dignity and self-respect; it takes away from the young their hopes and ambitions for the future.</P>
    <P>Having 16 per cent of our labour force receiving unemployment benefit or assistance distorts the whole structure of the public finances and the normal level of taxation.  In regard to this key issue, however, this budget is largely irrelevant. It offers no prospects of any improvement, no hope is held out to those who are already enduring the misery of unemployment or those who will face it in the period immediately ahead.  There is no strategy designed to reverse the upward trend.  On the contrary, there is a defeatist acceptance of a further rise.  An average of 225,000 is projected for 1984.</P>
    <P>Developments which have taken place in the first month of 1984 offer no grounds for optimism.  The year has barely started <Col N="1413" /> and already 1,500 additional job losses have been announced.  These are the inevitable outcome of this Government's non-interventionist policy, a policy which is continued in this budget.  The contribution made to unemployment by factory closures and redundancies has become a major factor.  It grew to alarming proportions last year.  This Government clearly have a policy of standing back from the situation and letting matters take their course.  In fact, on a number of occasions, they have precipitated the close-down of particular enterprises by their own action.</P>
    <P>Because of the size of the avalanche of closures and business failures and their impact on employment a complete review of the present situation should be carried out urgently with a view to formulating a definite programme of action. Some particular firms may have to close; there may be no alternative because of technological or commercial development which make this inevitable.  But this is not always the case.  There have been some closures which need not have happened or which should not have been allowed to happen.  The Government's action in causing the closure of Scarriff Chipboard was very significant in that it disclosed the Government's attitude and approach.  Because of the widespread economic and social repercussions of the closure of Scarriff, a responsible government would have made exceptional efforts to keep that particular enterprise going.  It has, apparently, been demonstrated that the company was actually making a profit when it was closed.  If this is so, then the decision to withdraw support and cause the factory to close is inexcusable.  It should now be reversed.</P>
    <P>This particular decision opens up the whole question of the role of the Government in this type of situation.  People frequently ask why nothing can be done about the paying out of enormous sums in unemployment benefit, without any return to the community.  In effect, however, something of that kind is achieved when the Government, through one of the agencies, subsidises or supports a particular enterprise through a difficult period because people who are thereby <Col N="1414" /> kept at work producing goods or services would otherwise be paid unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government we established an early warning system so that firms which were heading for trouble could be looked at and timely action taken.  I do not know if that mechanism still functions.  It would not appear that it does.  In present circumstances, a wide ranging review of all firms should be carried out and their position for a reasonable period ahead assessed so that where action is required it can be taken in time and survival programmes worked out where these are shown to be necessary and possible.  Shock announcements of closures cannot be tolerated any longer. Proprietors and management have a duty to both their work force and to the community and the Government share this responsibility to act in time and to avoid sudden unexpected closures.</P>
    <P>When sudden unexpected closures are announced, it is only natural that an atmosphere develops which makes rescue action difficult and indeed which adversely affects the prospects of the particular area or region in so far as possible future development is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank shows that in the first half of 1983 employment in industry was running at 7 per cent below the level of 1982.  We know that total manufacturing employment declined by almost 10,000 in the first half of 1983, one-third of the total loss of 30,000 jobs in manufacturing since mid-1980.  The Government's capital programme provides for a real drop of 10 per cent in investment in industry.  The message now emanating from the IDA appears to be a very bleak one, suggesting that only 1,000 jobs a year will be created in manufacturing industry over the next decade.  The advice we received, when drawing up <i>&ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo;</i> only 15 months ago, was that up to 12,000 manufacturing jobs a year could be created towards the end of the decade.  The present reports represent a major downturn which can only reflect the fact that high prices and high taxation are driving a certain type of industry away.</P>
    <P>We must get from the Government a <Col N="1415" /> full explanation as to why estimates of manufacturing employment have been revised so drastically downwards and what implications this has for future planning.</P>
    <P>The years between 1977 and 1981 will increasingly be looked back to as golden years, when this country experienced a wave of industrialisation and when virtually every week a new project offering industrial employment could be announced.  Between 1977 and 1980 we created 80,000 new jobs, an achievement that in the circumstances of today must seem like a dream.</P>
    <P>The basis on which Fine Gael and Labour came together to form a Government when unemployment was 170,000 was the promise of &ldquo;firm and decisive action&rdquo; to deal with the unemployment situation.  No such action has been taken and, in fact, diametrically opposite policies have been deliberately pursued and are continued in this budget.</P>
    <P>The instruments set out in this Coalition's <i>Joint Programme for Government</i> have either been ineffectual or abandoned. The National Planning Board is a total fiasco, like its predecessor the Committee on Costs and Competitiveness. It has so far done nothing to justify its existence.  The performance of the Cabinet Employment Task Force can only be described as pathetic, with its one or two mouselike recommendations.</P>
    <P>Next we have this great stalking horse, the National Development Corporation. Token bookkeeping entries were provided in the last year's estimates, but were never used.  There is no legislation and no action in sight.  If the Government believes that State enterprise has a genuine role to play in the present crisis, why are they doing nothing about it?  Capital expenditure on building and construction was savagely cut back in 1983 and it is being cut by a further 10 per cent this year.  According to Government figures issued yesterday the fall in employment in the construction industry was 19.5 per cent in 1983 compared with 9.5 per cent in 1982.  Employment in the construction industry is 36,000 down since mid-summer 1981, that is over 40 per cent of the <Col N="1416" /> increased unemployment we have had in the last two-and-a-half years.  I think that figure shows just how important the construction industry is and how real progress could be made in reducing unemployment if some attention were paid to it.  Our plans for 1983 would have led to a slight rise in employment in the construction industry instead of the job losses of 14,000 that actually took place in 1983.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that the provisions made in this budget for local authorities, health boards and hospitals will result in further widespread job losses.  That is something of which we should all take note.  Those who are in a position to know tell us that the allocations made and the budget set for hospitals, health boards and local authorities will mean fairly massive unemployment during 1984.  I do not know if the Government have taken due note of this or have any plans to do anything about it, or are they again just prepared to stand back from the situation and watch major job shedding take place in those bodies.</P>
    <P>I found some parts of the Taoiseach's contribution to this budget debate last week very hard to take.  In particular, I found what he had to say about the social welfare provisions of this budget offensive. The families and individuals who have to rely on social welfare for their standard of living have been under very severe pressure during all of last year. The increase provided in the 1983 budget was inadequate and it did not come into operation until July.  In addition to that, however, this section of our community were faced with a whole series of extra costs and charges during the year.  It is undeniable that their standards of living and comfort were greatly reduced and many, many thousands suffered real hardship.</P>
    <P>This year's budget can only make their position very much worse.  The increase of 7 per cent is miserly and hopelessly inadequate.  It will not be paid until July. With inflation anticipated to be around 9 per cent the gap between their income and living costs for this section of the community is going to widen greatly. They face a hard year.  The Taoiseach, <Col N="1417" /> nevertheless, tried to claim some credit instead of apologising for that situation. He made an absurd comparison with other European countries, countries where the welfare systems are so comprehensive and at such a level that no basis for comparison with ours exists.  The Taoiseach in the past has spoken a great deal about poverty in our community.  He projected himself as one deeply concerned about it.  All those protestations can now be seen for what they were, hollow, empty, meaningless.  Actions speak louder than words.  In two budgets the Taoiseach and his Government have implemented a policy of deliberately lowering the standards of living of the poorest and weakest section of our community. He has added greatly to the level of poverty in our community.  His record is a shameful one and he should not even have the audacity to even come in here and talk about it.</P>
    <P>There is now fairly widespread agreement that this Government is no longer adhering to any coherent economic or financial strategy.  In particular, no financial targets have been set.  Financial rectitude is dead and the goal of eliminating the current budget deficit in the foreseeable future has now been abandoned.</P>
    <P>There are two statements in the budget speech of the Minister for Finance which occur on the same page which clearly need to be examined in relation to each other.  The first of these is: &ldquo;It is clear that the overall level of borrowing remains excessive&rdquo;.  We have then to relate that statement to the second, which is:</P>
    <P>I have indicated that overall policy requires a slower pace of contraction in the borrowing requirement than would result from a purely arithmetical approach to the elimination of the current budget deficit by 1987.</P>
    <P>What the Minister for Finance is saying is that the level of borrowing is too high but he is not prepared to reduce it by eliminating the current budget deficit at the rate to which he and this Government had committed themselves.  Despite this clear abdication of responsibility by the Minister in regard to the level of borrowing <Col N="1418" /> and the current budget deficit the Taoiseach spent five or six pages of his speech on Thursday last rambling on about restoring control over our own financial affairs, the threat posed to our financial stability by the enormous rise in borrowing and claiming, mark you, that the Government have succeeded in attaining some objective which can be regarded as no mean achievement and which he did not propose to undersell. Unfortunately for him the Minister for Finance has disclosed that there is no achievement either to sell or undersell.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance actually goes so far as admitting that in bringing in the sort of budget they have brought in the Government are gambling with the public finances.  He acknowledges in his budget speech that this policy of not proceeding with the elimination of the current budget deficit necessarily involves some element of risk.  In fact the Taoiseach towards the end of his speech admits that reducing the pace of progress towards the reduction in the current deficit and borrowing will have to be made up in the years ahead and may be painful indeed.  How can the Taoiseach in the teeth of these statements keep up the pretence that he is adhering to a policy of financial rectitude and responsible Government?  It is now obvious to everyone that there is no longer any pretence of eliminating the current budget deficit by 1987 and that this Government have failed, and have acknowledged that they have failed, in what was stated to be their primary financial objective.  All the amount of convoluted waffle by the Taoiseach cannot conceal that central inescapable reality.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach once more in what has now become a ritual diatribe has again attempted, in an effort to distract attention from the Government's budgetary failure, to distort recent economic and financial history.  I have on previous occasions outlined to this House the major part the Fine Gael and Labour Coalition of 1973-1977 played in creating the burden of foreign borrowing which we carry today.  The latest quarterly bulletin of the Central Bank confirms this when it states clearly:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> The need for adjustment in the public finances should be seen as the inevitable outcome of fiscal policy during the 1970's ...</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach was a leading economic voice in that 1973-77 Coalition Government, but he has so far failed to acknowledge his share of responsibility for creating the problems about which he now talks so much.  In each of the years 1974 to 1976 foreign debt rose by percentage levels of between 80 and 90 per cent levels unequalled in any year since. Budget deficits and borrowing soared for the first time in 1974 and 1975 to the sort of levels we have today.  All this happened with the full support of and positive encouragement from Deputy FitzGerald as a member of that Coalition Government.  In the budget debate on 4 April 1974 he stated:</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made that the budget in some way is irresponsible, that the size of the deficit cannot be justified and that it will create dangers of some kind for the country.  It is a criticism that needs to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>What we had to do this year was plan for a bigger deficit than we planned for last year.  Last year's planned deficit would be too small in the current year. It was necessary to go for something larger and that is what we did.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. FitzGerald returned to this theme later on 4 February 1975 during a year which saw the Exchequer borrowing requirement rise to 16 per cent of GNP and the budget deficit rise to 7 per cent of GNP.  He came into this House and argued that the current budget deficit and foreign borrowing were not high enough. He said, if anything we under did it.  We can and will if necessary produce many more quotations along these lines from speeches by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald to prove that in the seventies he was a vociferous advocate of budget deficit strategies financed by foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>I hope we will hear no more from the Taoiseach or any member of this Government <Col N="1420" /> about previous Fianna Fáil Governments being responsible for our present difficulties.</P>

      <P>It can be clearly established from the budget speech of the Minister for Finance that this Government have no specific economic or financial targets which they are seeking to achieve. They are, as one commentator has put it, in a state of paralysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sort of financial crisis that occurred on the Stock Exchange last week following the budget reflects very seriously on the competence of the Minister for Finance and his advisers.  The Taoiseach <Col N="1421" /> will recall boasting before Christmas about &ldquo;the new Government commanding greater confidence amongst those from whom the State borrows&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>No one objects to tax loop-holes being blocked-off, and the Minister for Finance of the day must decide in any situation where the best interest of the Exchequer lies.  That is his solemn duty.</P>
    <P>We hold no brief on this side of the House for financial institutions.  They are well able to look after themselves and their tax affairs.  But it is important that the Irish money market be constantly strengthened and developed on a basis of trust and confidence so that it will be available at all times to help in the implementation of Government fiscal policy, whether in the raising of investment funds or some other manner.  If as a result of what happened last week the Minister for Finance will have to resort to extra foreign borrowing this year or there will be an out-flow of funds from this country, then it will have to be acknowledged that a serious blunder was made which will cost the Irish taxpayer money rather than save it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stated in his interview in <i>The Sunday Press</i> that &ldquo;the reaction was bigger than expected&rdquo;. Despite the efforts of the Government public relations machine to create a smoke-screen of propaganda it is clear that the handling of the matter was incompetent. It is dishonest for the Government to try to convey the impression that the Minister for Finance is standing up bravely to big financiers who have been robbing the Exchequer and that the ordinary taxpayer will benefit.  The simple answer to that is that the Minister did not include in his budget one extra £ of tax to arise from this change.</P>

      <P>In the present state of the economy and in the wake of the failure of the Government to reach its targets in 1983 this sort of sensational development should have been avoided at all costs.</P>
      <P>The latest figures published by the Central Bank make it clear that the out-flow of money from this country in 1983 reached alarming proportions.  Dr. Antoin Murphy dealt with this phenomenon in a very interesting article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday.  In 1983 there were unrecorded out-flows of £837 million.  There are two possible explanations for this, both of which are likely to be true in some measure.  The first is that the balance-of-payments deficit is considerably higher than official figures would suggest.  If account is taken of cross-Border smuggling and other unrecorded transactions, then the balance of payments deficit last year is most certainly higher than the official figure, for which the Government like to take credit, and could be of the order of £500 million, £600 million, £700 million or more.  The other explanation, if most of the £837 million is on the capital side, is that investors do not have confidence in the way that the economy is being run by this Government.  If they did not have confidence last year they will have even less confidence after the Minister's budget and the &ldquo;bond-washing&rdquo; debacle.</P>
      <P>Whether we have a much larger balance of payments deficit than the Government have claimed or whether we have a loss of investor confidence, there is a situation that is a cause for concern and one which the Minister for Finance must deal with when he is replying to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made some very cryptic remarks in his budget speech about the taxation of petroleum development operations. He pointed out that the tax provisions <Col N="1423" /> were drawn up almost ten years ago and that they are being &ldquo;reviewed&rdquo;. The Minister must clarify these remarks and clearly state what he intends.</P>
    <P>Our position is that oil is a national resource that belongs to the Irish people and must be fully developed for their benefit.  We want to see all the oil landed and processed here and Irish industry involved to the greatest extent possible in the provision of onshore and offshore facilities and in any downstream industries. The terms worked out must ensure that this happens as well as securing the greatest possible benefit for the Irish taxpayer having regard to the desirability of encouraging further exploration of our natural resources.</P>
    <P>The budget has one extraordinary major policy gap, and that is in relation to agriculture.  This basic industry is dismissed in three short paragraphs.  The key sentence is the following one taken from the publication <i>The Economic Background to the Budget.</i></P>
    <P>Prospects for incomes in the agricultural sector in 1984 will depend largely on the outturn of the EEC price negotiations and on the outcome of the present review of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>This sentiment is repeated in the budget speech.  That can only be read as a decision by this Government to opt out of agricultural development and to leave the future of the industry entirely in the hands of the Commission in Brussels, and this at a time when powerful forces are lining up to undermine the entire agricultural support system of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Government support for agriculture has declined not merely in real terms but in nominal terms.  In 1982 Government spending on farm investment was £109 million.  This was cut to £85 million in 1983 and in 1984 to £77 million.  That is a cut of 30 per cent in nominal terms, and a cut of 42 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>EEC agricultural policy and domestic agricultural policy should be complementary and mutually supportive.  Under this Coalition they have been complementary only in depressing farm incomes.  EEC <Col N="1424" /> schemes require some financial input by the Governments of the member states. The EEC Commission has ruthlessly exploited this lack of commitment of the Irish Government to its own agricultural industry and used it to withdraw EEC support.  The Farm Modernisation Scheme was illegally suspended by the Government for most of last year.  When the Commission suspended the scheme the Government were left with no comeback because of their own conduct.  Similarly, when the Irish Government extended the delay in intervention payments to 90 days, the EEC promptly responded with a proposal to extend it to 120 days.</P>
    <P>Agriculture fared badly in the budget in other ways.  The disease levies raising £5 million, the cuts in small farmer's income supplement, the ending of the group fodder scheme, more than cancelled out the extension of the AI and the ground limestone scheme.</P>
    <P>Last year was a year in which the progress made in restoring farm incomes during 1982 faltered.  This year there is enormous uncertainty because of the stalled negotiations in Brussels.  The Government's policy is to let Irish farmers fend for themselves.  They have scrapped the recommendations of the Four-Year Plan for Agriculture, which was prepared by us as a definite programme for agricultural development and investment.  The Government are effectively ignoring the role which our major natural resource can play in securing economic growth and reducing unemployment. It is time we had from the Government a major statement on what they propose for Irish agriculture in 1984 because the present uncertainty emanating from Brussels and from Dublin is disastrous from the point of view of the individual farmer and entire sectors of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Last year, as each month's unemployment figures were published, the Government made statements stressing that competitiveness was the key to the solution of the unemployment problem.  The clear implication was that improvements in competitiveness are the responsibility of trade unions and management.  Yet all <Col N="1425" /> the evidence is that real wages have fallen sharply.  If the economy is not competitive today, it is because of the very high level of taxes and Government charges. This emerges with devastating clarity from the latest OECD Report on Ireland. It states:</P>
    <P>Competitiveness deteriorated despite a large drop in real earnings ... real after-tax earnings have fallen very sharply indeed, but higher taxes have meant that this drop in living standards has not been reflected in improved competitiveness.  Indeed, the contrary has occured.  Similarly, a large part of the deterioration in relative consumer prices reflects sharp increases in indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>In other words, it is the heavy taxation imposed in the 1983 budget that is responsible for our loss of competitiveness, not any action on inaction by trade unions, workers, management or anyone else.  The clear responsibility for loss of competitiveness in Irish industry is directly attributable to the taxation policies pursued by this Coalition Government in the 1983 budget.  That is not my statement or Fianna Fáil's statement: it is a clear statement of the position by the OECD.  We have now the highest level of indirect taxation in Europe.  In particular, a large gap has been allowed to emerge between prices here and prices in our nearest neighbour and competitor, Britain.</P>
    <P>The budget has done nothing whatever to ease the overall burden of taxation, either on the direct or indirect side.  On the indirect side there have been some increases in excise duties but the main addition is the imposition of 8 per cent VAT on clothing.  Two new rates of VAT, 8 per cent and 18 per cent, have been added to complicate the system still further, thus increasing the burden of administration.  VAT receipts are set to rise by 16 per cent this year, by nearly double the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>The Minister missed an opportunity to go for selective reduction which could have yielded him as much in revenue, either directly through increased consumption or indirectly through increased <Col N="1426" /> employment.  In his speech the Minister stated, &ldquo;We may be near the point of diminishing returns in some areas.&rdquo;  I would suggest we have actually gone past the point of diminishing returns and the Minister should have reversed this trend by reducing taxation in specially selected areas.  Before the budget I urged a drop in some specific excise duties.  I believe if tax on petrol had been left alone it would have yielded as much as is now anticipated. Some of the VAT levels that are most out of line with our competitors could surely have been reduced if only on an experimental basis.  The level of taxation is directly relevant to the level of employment and that fact should never be overlooked when additional taxes are being imposed.  In particular the Government were totally oblivious of the need to reduce unemployment when they proceeded to place this extra 8 per cent VAT on clothing.</P>
    <P>The income tax burden, including levies, will increase by 18½ per cent this year. Since there will be even fewer people employed, the burden for each taxpayer could even be in excess of this.  The lowest number of people in any recent year were taken temporarily out of the tax net.  The figures are 15,000 this year, 21,000 last year, 24,000 in 1982 and 37,000 in 1981. The nominal relief has been negligible. The real tax burden has increased substantially, with an extra £662 million being taken in taxes in one form or another.  Equity for the low paid can hardly have been improved by abolishing the 25 per cent income tax band no matter how that is sold and putting 56,000 extra lower paid workers into a higher tax band.  It is hard to see how this is consistent with concern for the welfare of the lower paid.</P>
    <P>What is the position of this Government on tax credits?  The Minister for Finance seems to have discovered that tax credits which have been a central item in Fine Gael's tax reform promises would in fact be inequitable, and would penalise middle income groups.  Is this the official Fine Gael Party position?  Does the Taoiseach agree with it?  It is important that the position in this regard be clarified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> However, the Minister promises even more taxation next year.  He states: &ldquo;It would be desirable in the coming years to set ourselves the objective of restoring the tax base by progressively reducing or abolishing allowances, reliefs and deductions&rdquo;. I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that his task over the coming years should first be directed towards reducing rather than increasing the overall burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>Two quotations from the speech of the Minister for Finance on budget day underline more clearly than anything I could say, the financial cul de sac into which this Government have steered themselves.  At one stage the Minister for Finance states &ldquo;However desirable it might be to reduce taxation, this cannot be done on a significant scale, if at all, until current expenditure is reduced and the current budget deficit eliminated&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere in the same speech he states &ldquo;progress so far on the financial front would suggest that another significant step should be taken this year in the reduction of the Exchequer borrowing and the elimination of the current budget deficit.  Pursuit of these goals must however be tempered with caution&rdquo;.  The implication of those two quotations put side by side is quite clear.  There will be no reduction in current taxation until the current budget deficit is eliminated and as of now we have postponed indefinitely the elimination of the current budget deficit. The Government, left in a cul de sac as far as taxation is concerned, offer no hope of any reduction in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not think the taxpayers of this country will stand for very much longer the ever-increasing burden of taxation, or will accept the Minister's implication that nothing at all can be done about it for the foreseeable future, as he, in effect, states in those two quotations which I have given.  Another point I should like to make is that perhaps the Minister will explain where he obtained £15 million for positive revenue buoyancy, which conveniently spared him the embarrassment of a current budget deficit of over £1,100 million?  Could he explain, please, what positive effect this <Col N="1428" /> budget is supposed to have on economic activity to justify his taking credit for an extra £15 million of revenue buoyancy?</P>

      <P>I have already indicated some specific changes we would have made in the budget to stimulate employment in the short term: increased capital expenditure on building and construction and selective cuts in taxes which were designed to be self-financing.  We would have endeavoured to frame a budget which would chart a clear course for future development.</P>
      <P>Our future in this country, in my view, lies in becoming a high technology economy.  We are ideally suited and equipped to move in this direction, but it will require our developing a new concept of national economic management.  We have a relatively small, well-educated adaptable young population and a good structure of educational and training services.  Already we have more than 250 companies in the micro-electronics field employing more than 22,000 people and there is continuing expansion in this area. The National Micro Electronics Research Centre in University College, Cork, are capable of carrying out fundamental research and there are some research facilities in the NIHE in Glasnevin, though our plans for a training laboratory and research centre there have been shelved by this Government.</P>
      <P>These are assets on which we can build, but a concerted national effort is needed if we are to succeed in our objective of becoming a high income, high technology economy.  This will require co-ordination of effort in all the relevant areas and the dovetailing of many different services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> We will have to go for the right high-technology growth industries, adapt our educational and training programmes to fit in with these industries, secure the full co-operation of the trade unions and invest heavily in research and development.</P>
    <P>Scientific and technological research are of fundamental importance in the modern world.  The countries which are forging ahead are investing vast resources in research and the research capacity of their universities is linked directly into industry.  We have a certain level of facilities and capabilities in our universities and in our colleges of technology and in industry itself, but there is not as yet any coherent direction of the work being done.  The National Board for Science and Technology, for instance, have been moved around from one department to another.  Recent sweeping changes in that board made by this Government which are bound to have harmed continuity must be deplored.</P>

      <P>The National Board for Science and Technology should be the key organisation in so far as science and technology are concerned, in so far as the vital question of applying research and development to Irish industry is concerned. I feel &mdash; and it cannot be contradicted &mdash; that to change completely, suddenly, the personnel of the National Board for Science and Technology and the lack of continuity that that implies cannot be beneficial and must be deplored.  We have excellent, well-qualified people in the technological and scientific fields.  They are brimming with ideas for the development of our technological base, our natural resources and in other areas.  We must provide them with an opportunity to develop their ideas and their skills.  Fianna Fáil intended that the National Enterprise Agency would do that.  The Trade Union Movement in particular were quite enthusiastic about that concept.  Unfortunately, like so many other things of a progressive nature, the National Enterprise Agency seems to have been abandoned by this Government.  As far as this whole area is concerned, the aspirations of our younger generation and their ambitions and their vision for their country are concerned, this budget is totally irrelevant.</P>
      <P>We believe that a new concept of national economic management is needed to give an entirely new thrust and line of development to our economy.  We must take clear decisions on where we want to go, what areas we are going to specialise in and then mobilise all our national resources to get there.  The present depressed economy, with high unemployment, falling standards of living, is not the natural order of things.  It represents only a temporary failure of political leadership and economic management. We in Fianna Fáil see clearly the way this country and this economy should develop.  We are ready to give the necessary leadership and direction whenever we get the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish economy is drifting downhill <Col N="1432" /> in neutral gear.  Unemployment will continue to rise in the months ahead.  This Government in their budget make no attempt to reverse this appalling depressing situation.  In effect they have abdicated their responsibilities as a Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget presented to the Dáil last week reflected the constraints which continue to limit the Government's policy options.  However, within those constraints, it was recognised that the budget should reflect certain key priorities of Government policy for 1984, for example, that any deflationary impact must be the least possible, that certain adjustments should favour enterprise and growth, and that the poor and less well-off sections of the community should be protected.</P>
      <P>It must always be remembered that financial targets in the budget should be considered as relevant only in so far as they are essential to ensuring over the medium term economic growth and development, the fair distribution of resources in society, and the achievement of major social policy objectives and in so far as they are required to ensure our creditworthiness abroad, and our flexibility in maintaining discretion over our own domestic policy-making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in national bookkeeping for the sake of &ldquo;bookkeeping&rdquo;. The &ldquo;books&rdquo;, however, in terms of the size of current deficit and the level of the Exchequer borrowing requirement, are in the conventional sense and, by comparison with other countries, rather daunting.  There is no merit in pretending otherwise and in running away from the facts of the short-term limitation on Government budgetary actions.  To retain our economic independence, it has been necessary to slow the rate of growth of foreign borrowing, conscious of the fact that up to 1983 budget targets were for many years exceeded, and always in the wrong direction.  Much foreign borrowing was essential at different times throughout the last decade, though with hindsight a significant proportion of the resultant expenditure may have been poorly directed or targeted.  Our purpose <Col N="1433" /> has been to get the rate of increase of Exchequer borrowing and the rate of growth of foreign borrowing down in 1983, and to make further adjustments in the overall borrowing requirement in 1984.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Balancing the books&rdquo; might be considered to mean the elimination of the current budget deficit with the Government borrowing only for essential capital purposes.  We are, of necessity, a long way from that situation &mdash; but it was never our intention to proceed to such a target in equal steps or without regard for the real economy, and for the effects on employment.  It was necessary in 1983 to take sharp action to reduce the current deficit and the borrowing requirement as a percentage of GNP compared with earlier years in order to maintain control over policy-making at home.  Now, in 1984, in view of the unemployment situation and our concern to protect the underprivileged in our society, it is necessary to maintain the highest sustainable level for the budget deficit and for the public capital programme that is possible in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>In 1983, for the first time for many years, the broad overall budgetary targets were reached.  Corrective action was taken in mid-year to prevent any major deviation.  In both 1983, and now again in this year, the Government have to pay due attention to certain key financial targets, because otherwise the level of correction that would ultimately be required would be such as to damage all prospects for growth and would involve the slashing of the public and social services and prove a threat to the democratic cohesion of the nation.  Careful &ldquo;bookkeeping&rdquo; is not a matter of choice; it is a question of necessity, which I think the Fianna Fáil Party came to believe in the second half of 1982.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in a debate in the House last year, the task facing the Government can be examined in two ways.  Firstly, there is the dimension of control which is necessary if we are going to be able to exercise choice at national level in the management of our economy, and to sustain and build on the social progress <Col N="1434" /> already achieved.  We have begun that task in 1983 and this year.  It has involved difficult choices which have had to be carefully evaluated and considered. Then, secondly, there is a need for a major innovative element in national policy aimed at creating the huge number of sustainable jobs that are required over the next decade.  As a nation, we have committed ourselves to an open trading environment as a member of the EEC. That membership is most unlikely to bring us any bonanza of increased transfers in the years ahead.  While I must stress that the continuation and indeed acceleration of the international recovery is of vital importance to this economy, a favourable environment at home and abroad will not be sufficient in itself.  We need to encourage genuine risk-taking and increased investment in worthwhile projects in both the public and private sectors, and, in the framework of any overall plan, find the will to readjust and to seek new ways of tackling the unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>The National Planning Board have been working on a draft medium-term plan.  This will shortly (April, 1984) provide a major input into the Government's social and economic planning for the medium term.  If we are to contain the unemployment problem in the years ahead, hard choices will have to be faced. It will not be just a question of adding one &ldquo;incentive&rdquo; here and reducing another &ldquo;incentive&rdquo; there, nor, as I have said, merely a matter of improving the economic environment.  The Oireachtas, the social partners and the community at large will need to be involved in the task of national development.  I would visualise a rejuvenated commercial state sector, and the impetus to be given by the National Development Corporation from later this year onwards to be an essential part of this process.  This will require, however, major attention to operating performance and the commercial realities in the market place.</P>
    <P>Investment decisions in the State sector should be carefully evaluated and the performance of boards and managements carefully monitored.  In recent years, the control system we have had has involved <Col N="1435" /> too many major funding and strategic problems emerging too late in the day, when if adverse trends had been identified early on, minor corrections would have sufficed.  It is important, on the other hand, to remember that the State sector should not be confined to purely developmental and long-term tasks, but should play an active part in extending the base of domestic industry in both new sectors and in the natural resources area on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds, criticised the budget on the ground that its contents could have been settled in a few meetings rather than by long hours of Cabinet deliberations. I am not sure how long the Fianna Fáil Administration took to compose the 1981 Estimates and budgetary arithmetic, but the targets were blown off course so quickly that one could be excused for believing that no meetings at all were held, but rather that the stars were consulted.</P>
    <P>The budget has been criticised on the basis that public expenditure has not been cut, and that income taxation has not been significantly reduced.  Deputy Haughey, in his contribution this morning said that the budget did nothing for deprivation in our society and yet he was looking for a larger elimination of deficit. It seems that Deputy Haughey cannot be satisfied.  He wants to have his cake and to eat it at the same time.  Unfortunately, that option is not available, and Deputy Haughey must be well aware of that fact.</P>
    <P>The facts certainly dictate the need for a careful and planned approach to public expenditure.  Unless, however, a major attack were to be made on the quality and quantity of public and social services, we find that inevitably the greater part of public expenditure in practice is committed in advance in any given year.  For example, interest payments must be made to service existing debt and a certain volume of new debt is in present circumstances inevitable, public sector pay levels are carried forward from one year to another, and transfers are necessary for social welfare and other areas.</P>
    <P>I do not accept what has in certain quarters become something of a catch <Col N="1436" /> cry, namely that a high level of public expenditure is of itself socially and economically undesirable.  Public expenditure is of major importance in securing certain key economic, social and redistributive objectives, and will remain so. What should be an issue is the efficient management of the various public spending programmes, the elimination of waste and the restriction of programmes that serve no necessary social or economic objective, but which are retained by inertia and tradition in our political system.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the Estimates and the budget the Government were concerned with the necessity for a balanced and sensitive approach to the current expenditure side.  On the capital side, it was necessary to be selective as overall resources were limited, and to maintain a balance between economic, infrastructural and social needs.  We have, indeed, passed the stage whereby our future problems can be solved by large and profligate increases in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>There were a variety of options in deciding on the overall expenditure-taxation pattern for 1984, inside the framework of the overall constraints of the size of the deficit and the borrowing requirement. For example, it can be argued reasonably that the £97 million spent on food subsidies could be targeted more selectively, especially as the subsidies benefit the well-off as well as those on low incomes and those in receipt of social welfare entitlements.  However, those on low incomes spend more as a proportion of total income on the subsidised items than the better off, and in present circumstances, the Government decided that the existing level of subsidy should be retained.  On this criterion, it was more justifiable to re-impose VAT on clothing at 8 per cent (with the exception of clothing in certain children's sizes) as the higher income groups spend more on clothing items as a proportion of total income than lower income groups.  In addition, competition in the trade may well limit price rises, and in fact some 70 per cent of clothing is imported.</P>
    <P>The imposition of VAT on clothing has extended the VAT base, which, in recent <Col N="1437" /> years, with over 40 per cent of consumer expenditure exempt, has been extremely limited by comparison with other countries in Europe.  Any move to rationalise the basis of the VAT system with a narrower spread of rates would have to take account of the incidence on different categories of consumers and of any parallel changes in the tax system, as well as the likely effect on domestic output and on imports and on the overall revenue yield expected.  As is known, it has been possible, however, to reduce VAT from 23 per cent to 5 per cent on theatres and other live performances, to make adjustments in the rate of VAT on the short-term hire of cars, caravans and boats to 18 per cent from next month on, and also to adjust the rate on concrete.  In addition, there will be a scheme to allow the refund of VAT on goods bought in Ireland at retail level by visitors and exported in their personal baggage, which should help the tourist industry.</P>

      <P>Give us time.  The Estimates contained an increase of some £88 million in expenditure on social welfare, arising mainly from the necessity to allow for a full year's provision from the increased rates of payment last year and to provide for estimated increases in employment.  The increases outlined in the budget were for an 8 per cent increase in July in unemployment assistance rates with a 7 per cent increase generally for other recipients.  It should be noted that these increases are likely to match the expected rate of price increase from mid-1984 to mid-1985.  The 10 per cent increase for short-term weekly rates of benefit last June with 12 per cent for other recipients followed by 5 per cent for the long-term unemployed in October will be most likely to more than compensate for inflation between mid-1983 and mid-1984.  In fact, last year's increase followed a 25 per cent rise in 1982, as originally sponsored by Deputy Eileen Desmond at that time.  All in all, long-term benefit rates between 1978 and 1983 have increased, in real terms, by 40 per cent more than average industrial disposable <Col N="1438" /> earnings.  This year, falling inflation, the retention of food subsidies and by comparison with recent years the low rate of increase of under 1 per cent in consumer prices generated by the budget, will help to protect the real value of benefits.</P>
      <P>In addition, the rate of payment of children's allowances will be increased by 7 per cent in August.  Provision in the budget for new expenditure in 1984 on social welfare exceeds £70 million.</P>
      <P>In planning current expenditure for 1984, the Government have sought to achieve greater efficiency in the management of the overall system while protecting the framework of our social, educational, health and public services generally.  Tighter budgets will mean that managers in the public sector must seek to provide the best level of service possible with the available resources.</P>
      <P>On the taxation side, with limited VAT and excise increases, the rate of price inflation caused by the budget will be comparatively low, and should not generate by itself any demand for increased incomes in 1984.</P>
      <P>It has been possible to grant limited income tax reliefs for all taxpayers with a small reduction in the projected income tax yield in 1984.  Low income persons will be exempt from the income levy from April onwards, the PRSI allowance of £286 has been retained, the age exemption limits will be raised from £2,500 to £2,800 for persons aged 65 years and over and from £3,000 to £3,300 for persons aged 75 years and over, and the general exemption limit raised by £100 for single and widowed persons and by £200 for married couples.  In addition, the age threshold for income tax relief for rent paid in respect of private tenancies has been reduced from 65 years to 60.</P>
      <P>It is now widely felt, especially by those on the PAYE system, that the burden of taxation is excessive.  However, at present it is possible to give significant PAYE relief only on the basis of unacceptable reductions in public expenditure or by increases in indirect taxation or capital taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, to us in the Labour Party, reform in the taxation system is not just merely a question of reducing the tax <Col N="1439" /> burden.  Rather it is our belief that real equity in our taxation system can come about only through a broadening of the tax base, including capital taxation.  Progress was made in the 1983 Finance Act, which contained numerous provisions aimed at stamping out evasion and closing off avoidance loopholes.  While the yield from the residential property tax was disappointing in 1983, it should be remembered that new capital taxes very often take some years to achieve their full yield potential, as liabilities become firmly established and the revenue authorities gain experience and know how in administering the tax.</P>
    <P>This year it is planned to broaden the base of capital taxations by limited action on the capital gains tax front, by changes in the capital acquisitions tax code, by levying a once-off charge on certain categories of discretionary trusts and by various changes in stamp duties.  In a related area, the bank levy is being retained and restrictions placed on tax-based financing schemes will yield some £7 million this year.</P>
    <P>In 1984, collection procedures will be improved, which should improve the equity of the system as tax evaders are brought into the net.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the outcry which followed the announcement of the Minister for Finance last week to counter the practice known as &ldquo;bond-washing&rdquo; to which the Leader of the Opposition referred.  This represents a legitimate objective of the Government to counter tax avoidance.  What is of interest, apart from reactions from those who feel affected by the proposed change, is the stance of some people in Fianna Fáil who are crying out on their behalf.  Have Fianna Fáil any interest in tax equity, or in closing tax avoidance loopholes?  Not on their record of abolishing the 1975 wealth tax, or in their general stance in relation to taxation reform.</P>
    <P>Last week we saw on the Stock Exchange an over-reaction which was more stimulated by a champagne breakfast on Thursday morning than by constructive comment and analysis of the budget announcement the previous day. <Col N="1440" /> I do not understand the reaction of the Fianna Fáil Party to closing a loophole in our tax system to bring justifiable money into the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I would not drink it myself; a pint of plain.  The level of unemployment has been and will be the great problem that confronts those in Government and indeed politicians on all sides of the House.  Indeed, it is now the major problem facing the industrialised noncommunist world.</P>
      <P>I want, however, to lay some stress on the nature of the recent recession and the long-term problems it poses for the Irish economy with our rapidly growing young labour force.  From the second world war till 1973, the western world experienced strong growth with minor cyclical movements &mdash; from 1973 we have had two major recessions and one major recovery in the 1976-79 period &mdash; with the most recent recession developing into a slow recovery.  We chose, as a people, and especially by the referendum choice in 1972 to join the EEC, to be part of that international trading economy.  Therefore, our performance is linked to it and it must be remembered that there can be no long-term answer by every OECD country, for example, seeking continually to be more competitive with one another by current realignments or any other means.</P>
      <P>We will need, of course, to urge expansionist policies in the EEC and elsewhere. We have to be prepared to take maximum advantage of any recovery and hope that it continues into the future, but we also have to be prepared for the possibility that world economic growth on the pattern of the sixties may not return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1983, while unemployment continued to rise, certain other economic indicators moved favourably for us.  Inflation fell sharply and will continue to fall this year, the balance of payments deficit has been reduced to a manageable level, manufacturing exports increased by 14 per cent in volume, and output recovered.  We have obtained a little <Col N="1441" /> more room to manoeuvre than existed a year or two ago, and against this background the Government will this year develop a medium-term plan for the economy.</P>
    <P>Even with this, conventional solutions may not be sufficient.  We have to look, I believe, at the whole social pattern of work and rewards for work, in the context of the new technologies.  We have to be conscious of the gap between rich and poor countries, of the scandal that society can be organised in a fashion whereby huge social needs for housing, education and basic services exist side by side with massive unemployment.  We must be in the forefront of seeking answers to these issues particularly in the European context.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the context of the formulation of budgetary strategy, it is important to remember that both parties in Government have their own political philosophies, policies and perspectives.  Our agreed set of common objectives does not mean that we, any more than Fine Gael, have abandoned our long-term aspirations.  We have agreed to try to reach consensus on the broad range of issues that face the nation in the next few years, and this includes budgetary strategy.</P>
    <P>In such a situation neither party can impose a dominant philosophical approach on the other.  At different times on specific measures the views of one or other party may be perceived to prevail but the broad orientation of Government policy must be seen to represent the spirit of the agreement entered into following the election.  This is a real basis for stable and effective Government.</P>
    <P>This Government is a two-party one, based on an agreed programme for a four to five-year term.  Labour and Fine Gael must be expected to differ on policy and philosophy as separate parties.  We have however the resolution and determination to resolve problems and policy in the framework of Government.  That is the task before us and our aim over the next four years is to steer the economy steadily to recovery and to make this country a fair and better society to live in.  I believe we have the will and the resolve to accomplish <Col N="1442" /> that task and the people will appreciate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start by commenting on the statement made by the Minister for Labour in his contribution yesterday.  To say as he did, that 1983 was a year of significant economic achievement would be laughable were the reality and the consequences not so serious.  How can any person say that the addition of 30,000 people to the unemployed list is a significant achievement?  I can assure the Minister that the workers of Dunlops, Fords, Lunhams, Youghal Carpets, Blackwater Yarns, Mitchelstown Co-op, people who are on or facing the dole queues, would not agree with him.  It is a sad state of affairs that the Minister for Labour who is responsible for workers should make such an irresponsible contribution to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time the Government and the Minister for Labour stopped trying to pull the wool over the people's eyes by spitting out meaningless statistics in their efforts to distort the facts.  I can assure the Government they are not succeeding because the public we represent are aware of the performance of this Government since they came into office in November 1982.  I will give the Minister some real facts and figures.  This year actual current expenditure will increase by £720 million; the actual current budget deficit, not the codology we have been getting from Government speakers, will increase; and actual Exchequer borrowings will increase by £21 million.  These are the figures this Government include in their &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; budget.  They are trying to make a virtue out of these figures. These are the figures for which they want to be praised.  They may be trying to reduce the budget deficit but look how they are going about it.  Instead of reducing current expenditure they are to take an extra £288 million in income tax in 1934; they will collect an extra £188 million VAT in 1984; and the income levy will bring in an extra £34 million in 1984. On his own admission, the Minister is managing to take more tax from fewer people.  This year 30,000 fewer people are employed and in 1984 a further 30,000 <Col N="1443" /> will become unemployed.  This means the burden on all taxpayers will be increased. This is very clear from the figures I have given and they cannot be disputed no matter how many Government speakers try to distort that fact.</P>

      <P>Last week's budget was nothing more than an non-event, the greatest non-event and non-entity for many years.  The Government continuously extol their own virtues, but there is no virtue or merit in any group procrastinating for so long to produce so little as this Coalition Government have done.  No one has analysed our problems so much or done so little about them as the present Government.  Where is the direction? Where is the control?  Where is the commitment to tackle any of our major problems? Where is the reform?  Where is the leadership?  I will tell the House where &mdash; nowhere.  There is no control or commitment because we do not have any leadership.  We are witnessing the greatest paralysis of Government for a long time.  What we witnessed last Wednesday was nothing more or less than lack of commitment, lack of will, indecision, ambiguity, evasion and, most of all, downright failure to lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government of moral indignation laud themselves in producing a neutral budget.  This is the problem.  They have done nothing to deal with the problems facing this country.  Let us take a quick look at these problems, what this Government promised to do about them and what they are actually doing.  The commitment to reduce the number of unemployed is gone.  Instead of trying to alleviate the problem, this Government willingly accept that the number of unemployed <Col N="1444" /> will increase by 25,000 to 30,000 in the coming year.  They have made provision in the budget for that.  Is it not a sad state of affairs that the Government who have been given responsibility to deal with the problems on behalf of young people should give this response: to provide more money to create more unemployment?</P>
    <P>Public expenditure grows and grows aimlessly.  It is now out of control.  What do the Government do?  They allow for an increase of 11.4 per cent on current Government expenditure in 1984 as against 1983.  No doubt they will trot out their perennial lie that this is due to the burden of servicing our national debt. That is not so.  Even removing debt service costs, current Government spending will increase by 10.4 per cent this year.  Even the Minister recognises that.  In his budget speech he said:</P>
    <P>Because we have to borrow to meet our maturing debt obligations, as well as to secure new funds for the Exchequer each year, we are, in effect, paying off no net debt.  Instead, we are continuing to add massive amounts to our outstanding debt each year.  The only way we can effectively moderate the rapid growth in debt service costs is to reduce our appetite for new funds each year by controlling the Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech last week the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In the time that has been available to this Government since we took office, we have had to concentrate on making the decisions required to restrain the built-in pressure for further growth in expenditure rather than getting down to the fundamental readjustments which will be necessary.</P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>The main impact of today's budget on the current budget deficit will be largely through tax changes, but our intention is that expenditure adjustments will be the primary focus of Government attention during the coming year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> The Government promised to control borrowing.  They have now presided over a period during which borrowings have increased by £3,727 million.  The commitment to reduce and alleviate the burden of taxation is gone.  Indeed, the opposite can be said to be true.  Before the budget was introduced it had been estimated that the take from income taxation would increase by approximately 22 per cent in 1984 if the Minister changed nothing.  To provide cover for inflation effects, only around 10 per cent would have necessitated reliefs costing £90 million.  Yet the Minister provided only £40 million relief.  Thus the take from income tax will increase by approximately 16 per cent in 1984.</P>
    <P>To highlight the problems regarding our current excessive levels of income taxation, in 1973-74 8,000 people, or 1.1 per cent of our total income taxpayers, paid tax in excess of 35 per cent.  In 1983-84 this has increased to 363,000 people or 40.1 per cent of total income taxpayers.  For pay-related social insurance the total amount is 20.6 per cent between employers and employees, 8½ per cent for the employees and 12.1 per cent for the employers.  This can be seen as nothing more than a direct tax on the creation of employment.  It is totally unjust in that it is levied on the same income as PAYE, and this constitutes one of the worst forms of double taxation.</P>
    <P>I have met employers who were giving consideration to taking on extra workers even though times were hard, but because of the red tape and the constraints on them they decided not to do so.  We are responsible for that because of the levies and taxes we have imposed on employers.  We did not encourage them to take on people.  They have said that to me, and it is very clear that other Deputies are also aware of it.  Employers now prefer to give overtime to their existing staff rather than take on new workers.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the levy imposed on the banks by the Minister last year.  I am glad he has retained it this year.  I have already spoken publicly about this.  The banks must be criticised for the manner <Col N="1446" /> in which they are dealing with this levy. They have passed it on to their customers in one form or another.  Last July the Minister expresed dissatisfaction at the fact that the banks intended to bring bank truncation into their system.  This would be detrimental to all their customers.  It would make the system inside the banks very effective, but the people outside the counter would not benefit.  There has been a wide range of increases in bank charges since the levy was introduced last year.  I am open to correction, but as far as I know one bank official indicated that they would be passing on the levy to the customers.  They have done this in all sorts of ways.  They have increased the charge for bank cards and there are charges if there are errors in your account.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about cheque retention.  Last July the Minister indicated his concern at the fact that the banks intended to introduce cheque retention without consultation with the Department and the Minister for Finance.  This has huge implications for all concerned, and particularly business people.  If you write a cheque the bank will retain it and you will have no way of knowing whether the cheque was altered or whether somebody fiddled with it.  If a person applies to the IDA for a grant he must produce a cheque to show that he has paid for his equipment.  This is a very serious area for the whole economy. We have taken it too lightly.  I have spoken about it on a number of occasions. The banks have not responded to me in any way.  I expected they would not, because they know damn well they are wrong.</P>
    <P>The IFA, the accountants' association and other associations are very concerned and dissatisfied about it.  I am surprised the Minister has not come out more strongly against it and put the banks in their places.  They are the one sector of the community who are in a healthy position and they are not playing their part.  We heard a good deal about people playing their part in a time of recession, but the banks are not playing their part. I hope the Minister will take a serious <Col N="1447" /> look at this and see what he can do about it.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the whole direction of our taxation system has gone wrong.  The burden has got to be reduced and an incentive has got to be provided. Instead, we find that, through the Minister's actions, current levels of taxation are so high that they have killed initiative, stifled economic growth and act as a direct deterrent in the reduction of the numbers unemployed.</P>
    <P>On social welfare, the concern for the poor and needy of any Government who presided over a budget which provides such a miserly increase as 7 per cent, which will not even match inflation, has got to be questioned seriously.  The Labour Party claim that they represent the workers and the less well off in the community.  Yet they subscribe to a budget which provides for an increase of 7 per cent.  We all know there are people on the dole living in terrible conditions. They do not have enough to eat, and we must be realistic about that.  There has been much criticism of people claiming dole who are not entitled to it, but there are many living on the dole who cannot feed themselves properly, and this is an indictment of everybody in this House. The Government have given them an increase of 7 per cent while we have taken 19 per cent for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Rates of VAT have risen enormously in the past few years.  In 1980 they were 10 per cent and 25 per cent and they now stand at 23 per cent and 35 per cent. Current rates are so high that it would appear they equate to an average rate of 17 per cent on all items.  Our present VAT system, combined with excise duties, openly encourages evasion, smuggling and unfair trading, as well as having enormous detrimental effects on many businesses such as tourism, the retail trade and the drink industry.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that VAT and excise duties on certain items have already reached the point of diminishing marginal returns.  Thus the returns to the Exchequer are decreasing at the same time as the detrimental effects on business are increasing.  Brendan Dowling, a <Col N="1448" /> leading economist, has recently pointed out that export sales of whiskey in Northern Ireland have increased by almost 300 per cent in the year to August 1983 as compared with the year to August 1979.  As export sales to mainland Britain rose by only 23 per cent in the same period, it is reasonable to infer that over half of the sales in Northern Ireland are for unauthorised re-export to the Republic.</P>
    <P>If the trend in whiskey smuggling is indicative of total spirits activity, then 5 million litres of spirits may be evading excise duty and VAT.  The excise duty on such illicit trade would amount to almost £46 million.  In addition, a further £15 million in VAT revenue is foregone.  The existence of exceptionally high taxes on spirits in the Republic, combined with the inability to enforce excise laws across the Border, has resulted in a net gain to the UK Exchequer from consumers in the Republic of up to £36 million sterling. That represents the potential loss in one single commodity which is highly taxed. Overall, at present tax rates, the loss of revenue from domestic consumption diverted to Northern Ireland could exceed £100 million.  Mr. Dowling concludes that a 17 per cent reduction in excise duties would generate the same revenue as the present tax rates.  The Minister must look seriously at this problem, because our taxes are driving people to break the law and the State is losing out.</P>
    <P>In the light of these facts, what has the Minister done?  He has put 8 per cent VAT on clothing, excluding those under ten years of age.  What fun we will have in implementing this system.  I am sure the Government have not forgotten the response to their proposed imposition of VAT on footwear, but they appear not to have learned their lesson.  Time will tell whether this measure works out.  Getting away from the ridiculous side, let us look at the implications of this new tax. Where is the consideration for a family with school-going children?  Where is the consideration of the family whose children are about to be confirmed?  Where is the investment in our future?  The fathers of many of these children are on the <Col N="1449" /> dole.  At last this Government have found something to do for our young population &mdash; they have taxed them.  They were not satisfied to learn their lesson regarding VAT on footwear.  What could we expect from a Government led by a Taoiseach who has a phobia about women with small feet?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance appeared last night on television and said that the services sector should be looked at as being a developing sector.  What has the Minister done in this budget for the services sector?  Absolutely nothing.  It is easy for a Minister to go on television and pontificate about what should be done, but he and the Government have the responsibility for taking the necessary measures and have done nothing.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to act immediately regarding decentralisation of Government Departments.  The proposed re-location of An Foras Forbartha to Cork would have created many much-needed jobs in the ailing construction industry, yet the Government have failed to proceed with this project, thus adding to an already chronic unemployment situation in Cork.  The provision of money for the deep-water berth at Ringaskiddy only gives back to Cork what the Fianna Fáil Government had provided for in the Estimates last year.  There has been much ballyhoo about the £2 million being provided in this budget, but it is a pity that the Minister did not leave the amount provided last year.  In spite of that, I thank him for this year's allocation. There have been innumerable trips from Cork to Dublin by the Cork Harbour Commissioners and many other organisations trying to convince the Minister that the project would provide many jobs in the area and enable the IDA to encourage industry to locate there.  We had to bring half the people of Cork to speak to the Minister on the matter.</P>
    <P>The construction industry has been one of the hardest hit.  The Government claim that jobs cannot be created by infrastructural development.  I do not know where they got this notion.  The whole community is affected by the construction industry, and it is good for everybody if jobs are created in this sector.  We cannot get <Col N="1450" /> that message across to the Government although they claim to be concerned about unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that the Minister and the Government have no commitment to solving our problems and would prefer to sit back, throwing leadership to the winds and waiting for the American economy to pick up and solve our problems. The insincerity of the Government has been clearly brought home to us in this budget by the callous manner in which they have disregarded its effects on the community at large.  The collusion of the Labour Party will forever be a millstone around their necks.  State finances of almost £8 billion are under the control of the Government, but they are not using this money in the best interests of the country.  The harsh and difficult measures were taken by the Government last year when we were told they were necessary for recovery.  This year we are worse off than ever.  The difficulties the people experienced achieved nothing, contrary to what the Tánaiste said.  There are 30,000 more people unemployed and there is provision for another 30,000 this year.  We listened to the Tánaiste trying to hoodwink the people.  The people know how the Government have performed and they have learned their lesson.  If the Government go to the country next week or in three years' time the public will not forget their performance.</P>
    <P>We have higher unemployment, low standards of living, no confidence in the community and the Government making provision for an extra 30,000 people unemployed.  Where is the effort to tackle unemployment?  What confidence can young people have in the Government? The Labour Party claim to represent the working classes.  The pseudo-socialism of Fine Gael has been clearly demonstrated in last year's and this year's budget.</P>
    <P>There was a parliamentary meeting held by the Labour Party last Friday.  One of their members said that the budget was not bad enough to bring down the Government.  It must be very easy to please the Labour Party.  It is a pity that the people they claim to represent do not <Col N="1451" /> see it in the same light.  It shows where the Labour Party have been swallowed up by Fine Gael and have lost sight of their responsibilities to the public.  After all the punishment the people had to endure we are worse off today than we were last year.  If the Government call this achievement all I can say is God spare us from their failures in the future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wallace raised some interesting points.  One of them I fully support.  It is the question of the banks proposing to retain cheques and not return them to the account holder.  That would be a regressive step, and the House should express its concern. I hope the Departmental officials will communicate the concern of Deputy Wallace and others to the Minister in the hope that he will raise this question with the banks to ensure that they do not pursue a policy of retaining such cheques. It will present difficulties for many people, particularly in the area of revenue returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition spoke about the Fine Gael objective of having the current budget deficit at £750 million. He went on to say we had watered this objective down to £950 million.  It is extraordinary that the Fianna Fáil proposal was for a current budget deficit of £700 million, which means Deputy Haughey would have taken a further £350 million out of the economy.  This presumably would have been from PAYE workers, since he showed no ability in the past to tax the wealthy or the new found aristocracy which he is used to mixing with.  It is not possible to criticise the Government for having cutbacks in expenditure and reduced numbers in the public service and then criticise them for not taking enough out of the economy and out of the PAYE taxpayers' pocket. It is this kind of contradictory nonsense which has us in the mess we are in.  The Leader of the Opposition has attacked us, and that is part of his function.  We do not know what the Opposition proposals are even now.  There is no vigour or fire coming from them.  There are no suggestions but only attacks.  They have a right to attack, but surely we should get <Col N="1452" /> some suggestions from them instead of hearing how we should increase employment in the public service, cut the current budget deficit and reduce the borrowing requirement.  It is impossible to do that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey has given support to the bond-washers.  It is extraordinary.  Only a few weeks ago people were marching because of PAYE and today Deputy Haughey took the side of the bond-washers against the PAYE worker.  One cannot have it three or four ways at the same time.  Deputy Haughey is an able man.  He has his faults like the rest of us.  He will be Leader of the Opposition for another four years, if he is not removed, and he should use his ability to stimulate discussion and promote ideas in the House which would help to deal with the hopeless position many people are in.  Deputy Haughey will be pleased that the Government reduced VAT on theatre tickets, and it should be of great interest to some of the actors he has about him.</P>
      <P>In a publication by the NESC &mdash;<i>Economic and Social Policy 1983: Aims and Recommendations</i>&mdash; chapter one stated:</P>
      <P>There are signs that a world economic upturn is under way.  The current recession, which began in late 1979 and lasted longer than any recession since the Second World War, appears to have bottomed out in late 1982.  Clear signs that the recovery is under way in the US emerged in the first half of 1983 with economic growth reaching an annual rate of almost 10 per cent in the second quarter and indications of continuing strong growth in the third quarter.  It is time to stop all the talk of doom and gloom.  While the 10 per cent growth rate for the second quarter in the US economy could not be expected on an annual basis we can still expect there will be significant growth in that economy. Hopefully that will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank has forecast a growth <Col N="1453" /> rate of 2¾ per cent.  That is very important, and we should stress it.  We must be responsible when we are speaking, without going too far and telling the people we are going for boom and bloom.  Once that fails the credibility of the people who utter it also fails.  We must be hopeful and positive without being unrealistic.  It is realistic to say there are positive signs that growth is on the way.</P>
    <P>In the last quarter of last year &mdash; economic commentators bear this out &mdash; the purchase of capital equipment by industry has been significant, which would indicate that employment opportunities will start to improve towards the end of the year.  Regrettably we have not yet seen the end of unemployment.  Given the growth rate anticipated and the level of investment in the first quarter, it is likely that employment will increase.  There will be many young people coming onto the employment market, and although it is expected that there will be significant growth, particularly in the manufacturing industry, they will presumably take those jobs or will replace people on the unemployment register who will take those jobs, so that the unemployment situation itself will remain serious unless something quite different is done.  I shall develop that point later on.</P>
    <P>The background to the problems we face &mdash; problems we started to face up to in the last 12 months &mdash; began in the period 1977 to 1981.  In that period we borrowed more than we did in the previous 25 years, doubling our external debt from something like £5,000 million to £10,000 million.  In the same period we abolished rates, almost abolished capital gains tax and wealth tax, did away with car tax and led the people to believe no one had to pay for anything because the Government would somehow provide. That sort of reckless thinking, that creation of wrong attitudes, that mismanagement, is the background to the problems with which we are confronted today. Whoever is responsible, that is the background. Having borrowed so much the interest on that borrowing is now an enormous burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the rate of <Col N="1454" /> inflation has now been halved and is expected to continue improving.  The balance of payments deficit on current account has declined from 13.5 per cent GNP in 1981 to 2.5 per cent in 1983.  That is a very significant figure.  The Government's objectives in the fiscal area are on target for the first time in almost a decade. Those achievements have not been gained, of course, without some sacrifice. They have not been gained without some tight control and tight management on the part of the Government, and I believe that even tighter control and tighter management would be in the interests of the public.</P>
    <P>I want to quote now from the NESC Report of 1983 which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The council recommends that having regard to overall economic and social objectives there should be a significant reduction in the EBR as a proportion of GNP in 1984.  It believes that the present levels of borrowing are unsustainable.  The failure to reduce borrowing would jeopardise any hopes of sustained growth in output and employment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we are hoping for sustained growth in output and employment then we have to be able to borrow externally.  That does not necessarily mean that we have to continue to raise taxes on people in the PAYE sector because, as far as I am concerned, further reliefs for that sector will not come quickly enough.  There are people in the bond washing sector, in the capital sector, who could contribute more, and they should be made to contribute more and, in that regard what the Taoiseach said yesterday was very significant.</P>
    <P>There is also need to cut out wasteful expenditure in the public sector.  Of all the committees recently appointed that on public expenditure has a very serious responsibility to pursue wasteful expenditure. Again, there is need for the State to cut out subsidies given to people who are well off.  I shall give examples of that later on.  There are many people who are three times better off than the average citizen who are being subsidised more than the average citizen and taxpayers <Col N="1455" /> are mulcted in order to subsidise such people.  The Central Bank report of 1983 had this to say:</P>
    <P>In the last ten years total central government expenditure expressed as a proportion of GNP rose from 35 per cent to 66 per cent, the corresponding figures for current spending being 28 per cent and 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>That rise is absolutely incredible.  Imagine spending 66 per cent of GNP.  It meant Government control of the lives of almost everybody, leaving nothing to local authorities or to individuals.  That sort of intrusion and that sort of central control only results in people being tied up in bureaucracy which is very hard to control, very expensive and not in the interests of the common man.  It is time we cut back on all this bureaucracy and left people with more money in their own hands to decide what they will do with it, to dispose of it as they see fit and, if they want to provide certain local services, they should be in a position to do that without having to go through the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit was referred to this morning and the question of the Government's elimination of that deficit over a fixed period was raised.  The Central Bank in 1982 had this to say:</P>
    <P>The fulcrum of a plan for economic recovery would be the elimination of the current budget deficit over a fixed four-year period.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank give good advice based on economic and financial information available to them, and so do people like the NESC.  Indeed, very often they say the same thing.  The NESC for many years has been calling for a four-year elimination.  They were looking for it in 1976, in 1977, in 1978, in 1979 and they are still looking for it.  A Government have to take into consideration the social consequences of any action designed to do this, and now that there is a sign of economic growth the Government are doing the right thing.  Instead of eliminating the actual figure they are going for elimination as a percentage of GNP, and at the end of the year we will have a <Col N="1456" /> current budget deficit which in percentage terms will be a lower percentage of GNP than in 1977 or 1978.  That is a very significant step forward without actually putting the boot in on people who need a few bob.  There is no interference with existing growth and there is a bit of encouragement at the same time designed to raise the economy out of the apathy it has suffered in recent years.  I support that.  I think the Government are right to reduce the current budget deficit as a percentage of GNP, and they are also right in not trying to take too much out of the economy this year.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the State is spending money in areas where it need not necessarily spend money.  In times of economic stringency we should be looking very carefully at waste.  Take, for instance, the reference in the NESC report to bed occupancy in hospitals.  We have the highest bed occupancy rate of any country in western Europe.  It is a regular trick &mdash; I use that word advisedly &mdash; to bring people into hospital on Friday and carry out tests on them on the following Monday.  Presumably this is related to the fact that certain people in the medical services are paid an extra fee in respect of people who are hospitalised for three days rather than for one day.  If there were to be no more of this trickery, we might not need the sort of increases in VHI contributions as the one imposed recently.  This is the sort of carry on that is taking the State for a walk.  People who present themselves at hospitals for the purpose of having tests carried out could in many instances be dealt with in a matter of hours, instead of which they are admitted on a Friday, fed and left occupying beds for the whole week-end, when they would prefer to be at home anyway, then attended to on the Monday and discharged.  This is the sort of nonsense that is being indulged in at a time when the State is on its uppers in terms of financial expenditure.  The practice will have to be discontinued.</P>
    <P>Regarding other areas of public waste I wish to read into the record a further reference.  I quote from page 25, paragraph 2.11 of the NESC Report:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> Rents are low in local authority dwellings for several reasons: firstly, under the 1983 differential rents scheme, the maximum rent chargeable is 5.25 per cent of the original all-in cost (up dated by the CPI).  This would put the maximum rent for a new house at just over £35 per week.</P>
    <P>That is dear enough.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>Secondly, very few tenants would earn enough to be liable for such maximum rents.  A male earner with wife and three children would have to have a net income of £200 per week (close to £300 per week gross) to be liable for £35 maximum rent.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, rents can be increased only by a maximum of £4 per week in respect of each subsidiary earner, with the result that multiple income households may pay proportionately less of income in rent than single income householders.</P>
    <P>The report continues at paragraph 2.12:</P>
    <P>An examination of local authority rents in relation to income levels (Table 2.3) shows that the differential rent scheme did not, in 1980, operate in a way which related rents systematically to ability to pay.  Rents accounted for an average of under 6 per cent of disposable income of local authority tenants but the highest income group paid less than 2 per cent of their incomes in rent.</P>
    <P>In other words, the more money one earns, the better the subsidy.  The higher earners are paying 2 per cent of their incomes while for those in the lower-income brackets, the figure is 6 per cent. That is nonsense.  It represents the sort of hidden subsidy of which people with incomes of £500 or £600 per week are availing.  I support fully subsidising people who are in need but we should not subsidise those on vast incomes.  The NESC who are representative of business, of Government and of the trade unions have drawn attention to this <Col N="1458" /> absurdity time and again and are asking that something be done to rectify it.</P>
    <P>I represent a constituency which is very mixed but in which there is a huge number of local authority houses.  The vast majority of those people would not wish that people who are quite wealthy be subsidised.  We must be prepared to tell people that they must pay according to their ability to pay.  Those people who, because of their enormous incomes, are paying only 2 per cent in rent, should have to pay the same proportionately as any other local authority tenant pays. The stage has been reached where there are people applying for local authority houses but who are quite wealthy.  Therefore, we have a situation in which those who are well able to provide for themselves but who are either too lazy to do so or who are determined to live off the State are displacing people who are in need of local authority housing.  There are 6,000 applicants on the housing list of Dublin Corporation alone.  If we were to remove from that list those people who are well able to house themselves, we would be in a position to house the poorer families and people who are living in overcrowded conditions.  Our job is to help those who are in need.  Another Member of the House related a story to me recently of representations he had had from a teacher, who happens to be married to an officer of the State, regarding the possibility of their getting a local authority house.</P>
    <P>Regarding income to the Exchequer from housing rents, if we were to consider extending 100 per cent loans to people to purchase houses, we would be doing a service to the public.  It is argued sometimes that to provide a 100 per cent loan is to bring about a situation in which people will take on mortgages they cannot afford to repay, but that is not a very good argument so far as the Housing Finance Agency are concerned, since one's ability to pay in respect of loans from that agency is related to one's income.  In addition, there is the factor that we remove people from the housing list, provide them with a house at a small rent without asking about their ability to pay.  There are many people on the housing <Col N="1459" /> list who would be happy to purchase houses if they could get a 100-per cent loan through the Housing Finance Agency and if they could repay at a fixed rate based on a percentage of their income similar to the situation of those who have already qualified for loans under the Housing Finance Agency Scheme.</P>
    <P>That is something to which we should give consideration.  The percentage of income that would be involved would be much more significant than is the 2 per cent of income which some people with large incomes are paying.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 2.47 on page 37 of the NESC Report, there is the following observation:</P>
    <P>There has been little change in housing policies over the last year despite increasing evidence of the undersirable regressive distributional effects of many policies.  The Council considers that there is a need for a fundamental review of housing policies and their effectiveness in relation to social and economic objectives.  The Council believes it would be appropriate for the Government to publish a comprehensive policy statement on housing policies.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will do that and that the economic and financial commitment of the State will be outlined and justified and that we will make more clear our thinking in this area.</P>
    <P>This NESC Report has the unanimous support of the various representative groups in the community, including the trade unions.  When we talk of people sponging on the State there is a tendency to think only in terms of social welfare recipients.  But there are businessmen who are fiddling in respect of income tax, while there are farmers who are receiving benefits that are unrelated either to their income or to their needs.  There are pillars of society who sit in judgment on others but who are availing of large travelling allowances or some other hidden income and who have the audacity to talk about people sponging in terms of the social welfare system.  There are many spongers in our community but not all of <Col N="1460" /> them are in receipt of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I have here a document that is being circulated to members of the crime committee by The Irish Federation of Self Employed.  It is advocated in this document that for those already engaged in crime a more rigid form of punishment is called for than that which obtains in our prisons now.  The federation say that it should be a penalty to be sent to prison for a felony, that imprisonment should involve the loss of all privileges available normally at home, for example, television, choice of food, tobacco or cigarettes and that there should be strict discipline and few visits allowed.  The group say also that where certain serious crimes are involved convicts should be liable to varying numbers of strokes of the &ldquo;cat&rdquo; possibly in public.  I wonder how many strokes of the &ldquo;cat&rdquo; some of our tax-avoiding businessmen would like to be given for some of their activities within the economy.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> The available information is that derived from the farm structures sample survey taken in June 1980.  The average size of farm holdings with at least one hectare of crops and pasture, including rough grazing, being farmed was 55.8 statute acres.  A farm holding was defined as the area actually farmed and comprised area owned less area let to others plus area taken.</P>

      <P>D'eisigh mé ráiteas ar an 20 Eanáir agus cuirfear cóip de timpeall sa Tuairisc Oifigiúil.</P>
      <P>Seo a leanas an ráiteas:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Tuairisc ó na Gardaí ar Chomhlachtaí áirithe Gaeltachta</P>
      <P>Tá tuairisc faighte ag an Uasal Pádraig Ó Tuathail TD, Aire na Gaeltachta, ar fhiosrúcháin a bhí ar siúl ag an Garda maidir le comhlachtaí áirithe ina raibh scaireanna ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus a bhfuil a bhformhór imithe as gnó.  Sa chuid is mó de na cásanna ba léir ó réamhfhiosrúcháin nach raibh aon bhunús ar a bhféadfaí eolas a chur le chéile lena chur ar aghaidh chuig an Stiúrthóir Ionchúiseamh Poiblí (DPP). Sa chuid eile cuireadh torthaí na bhfiosrúchán faoi bhráid an Stiúrthóra agus thug seisean treoir nach raibh aon ionchúiseamh le déanamh seachas i gcás amháin a bhain le fostaí de chuid comhlachta ar leith.</P>
      <P>Is cúis sásaimh don Aire a fhógairt go poiblí gurb amhlaidh nach raibh aon fhianaise gur tharla caimiléireacht ó thaobh an Udaráis ná ó thaobh lucht bainistíochta na gcomhlachtaí sin.  Tá dóchas aige go gcabhróidh an toradh sásúil seo chun deireadh a chur le drochphoiblíocht i gcaoi gur fearr a bheidh ar chumas an Údaráis brú ar aghaidh leis an obair mhór atá le déanamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht.</P>

      <P>The fact remains that anyone interested in this case was well aware long before the Minister made that statement in the Dáil that the fraud squad investigation had not produced any evidence that would have justified any case being brought.  Will the Minister state if the investigation established the background to the letter written by a former employee, since deceased, of Údarás na Gaeltachta?  Did the investigation establish to whom that letter was handed by the deceased employee and what that person did with the letter?  Is the Minister aware that the deceased employee stated he wrote the letter on the understanding that it was to be handed by Mr. Seán O Foghlú to the Minister for the Gaeltacht for Government information and that he was asked to write the letter at the request of the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Government?  Did the inquiry establish if that was factual?</P>

Níor cuireadh aon sonraí ar fáil domsa faoi na mion phointí maidir leis an scrúdú a rinne an Garda ar an gceist sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister stating he does not know any more than that the Garda have reported that as there was no fraud, no case would be brought and that no further details of this matter have been brought to his notice?  Mr. Ó Foghlú claims he made the request on behalf of the Minister, and I ask the Minister if he is substantiating that.  Would the Minister care to inform the House about Deputy Begley's part in this ugly affair?</P>

      <P>Nil aon bhaint agamsa le haon rud a dúirt an tUasal Ó Foghlú.  Má bhí sé ag labhairt ar mo shonsa ní raibh sé de cheart aige é sin a dhéanamh agus, mar a deirim, níl aon smacht agamsa céard a dúirt nó céard ná dúirt an fear sin.  An méid eolais ata agamsa ná go bhfuil scrúdú déanta ag an Garda, go bhfuil siad san sásta nach bhfuil aon chás acu rud ar bith a chur i leith na ndaoine ná na gcomhlachtaí a ainmníodh agus chomh fada agus a bhaineann liomsa go mbeidh mé sásta glacadh le focail an Gharda maidir leis sin agus sin deireadh an scéil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister is aware of these documents which were written by a deceased former employee of An tÚdarás.  These are in his Department and confirm that this Mr. Ó Foghlú made this request on his behalf.  Is the Minister not concerned that a Deputy of his party would have participated in such underhand work as Mr. Ó Foghlú and Deputy Begley were engaged in on this occasion which, unfortunately, has brought great discredit to the only industrial promoting authority in the Gaeltacht areas, Údarás na Gaeltachta?</P>

Bhí £500 breise le híoc agus níor híocadh é sin toisc nár cuireadh ar fáil teideal sásúil.  I rith na bliana 1983 íocadh deontas feabhsúcháin de £700 leis an iarratasóir agus deontas £500 chun seomra folctha a chur ar fáil.  I mí Mheithimh 1983 diúltaíodh iarratas uaidh ar dheontas chun teach nua a thógáil toisc go raibh teach maith aige cheana féin.

I mbliana sna Meastacháin tá an figiúr sin laghdaithe go dtí £25,000.

Fiú amháin i mo dháilcheantar féin tá bóthar amháin agus chosnódh sé an méid sin chun é a dheisiú.  Níl an ceart san iomlán ag an Aire a bheith ag rá nach bhfuil ann ach laghdú ar an méid airgid.

Is é an fhadhb a bhí ann go dtí seo go raibh siad ag tabhairt chúil ar airgead a chur ar fáil do cheantair Ghaeltachta agus go raibh siad ag leagan béim ar cheantair Ghalltachta toisc gur cheap siad go mba cheart gur Roinn na Gaeltachta a chuirfeadh an t-airgead seo ar fáil.  Sin ceann de na deacrachtaí.  Is ceist airgid é.  Níl an t-airgead againn.

      <P>Evidence to date suggests that the main interest in the service centres on the UK-Ireland market and in this regard a forthcoming meeting between officials of my Department and the UK Department of Transport will endeavour to agree a mutually acceptable framework for the operation of express low weight services between the two countries.</P>

A provision of £2 million is being made in 1984 and work on the project will commence in the near future.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the project, which was strongly supported by the IDA, will take about two years to complete at a total estimated cost of about £9.4 million at today's prices.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts no mechanically propelled vessel may proceed to sea or on any voyage or excursion with more than 12 passengers on board, unless there is in force in respect of the vessel a valid passenger certificate issued by me in accordance with those Acts.</P>
      <P>This certificate must be displayed on the boat for all to see.  It sets out the maximum number of passengers permitted to be carried, the limits beyond which the vessel is not to ply, the life-saving and fire-fighting equipment which must be kept on board, the name of the vessel and its owner, the period of validity of the certificate and any special conditions applying to the operation of the vessel. A passenger certificate is valid for a maximum of one year.</P>
      <P>Enforcement of the law relating to passenger certificates is a matter for the Garda, who are notified of the issue of every certificate and of the plying limits, number of passengers and the expiry date of the certificate.  Apart from this, Garda authorities responsible for coastal areas are aware of the statutory provisions and of the necessity to keep the operations of passenger-carrying boats under observation. It is, of course, open to any member of the public to report to the Garda or to my Department any suspected breach of the Acts in relation to passenger certificates.</P>
      <P>The Merchant Shipping Act, 1981, provided for increased penalties in cases where the requirements in relation to passenger certificates are not complied with.  The master or owner of a vessel found in breach of the law is liable on summary conviction to a fine of £100 for each passenger carried subject to a maximum fine of £600.  The Garda were also given power under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1981, to detain any vessel attempting to go to sea with more than 12 passengers until a valid passenger certificate is produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" /> Boats plying for hire which do not come within the scope of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts relating to passenger certificates may be made the subject of bye-laws or licensing by the appropriate local authority under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, or the Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1907, respectively.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am seriously concerned about breaches of the law in this area.  Officials of my Department have recently had discussions with representatives of maritime local authorities and the Garda Síochána with a view to stricter enforcement of the law.  Arising from those discussions I am having the need for amending legislation examined.</P>
    <P>In 1983, 17 cases of alleged illegal carriage of passengers by sea, six of which were in respect of boats plying to the Aran Islands, were referred to the Chief State Solicitor for prosecution.  The Chief State Solicitor did not proceed with two of the cases for lack of adequate evidence. There were three successful prosecutions; two prosecutions were unsuccessful. The remaining ten cases are still pending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate what amending legislation he has in mind?  Is he aware that apparently Clare County Council have decided not to issue any licences in 1984 to the operators who have been on the Aran Islands route up to now as they believe that craft being used are capable of carrying more than 12 passengers?  They have had very many complaints about the fact that these boats are regularly carrying more than 12 passengers particularly during the July-August peak season.  In view of this and the fact that Shannonside Tourism are totally frustrated in their efforts to try to have the law enforced, would the Minister take action which would ensure that at least this year when we come to the July-August peak season&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has done a public duty by raising this question. There is a very serious problem about which I am seriously concerned.  The enforcement of the law is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  The local authorities have power to make by-laws and see they are upheld.  I am not satisfied that the law is being upheld sufficiently and, in view of that, I arranged for a meeting to take place between officials from my Department, western sea board county councils and the Garda Síochána to discuss the problem.  I hope that, arising from those discussions, a more active interest will be taken in upholding the law and seeing to it that the law is upheld.  The Deputy is correct.

Admittedly, the committee were only being set up at that time and this was the first Bill referred to them.  Inevitably there were some teething problems.  I am anxious that the committee should complete their consideration of the Bill during this month and we would need a further two months or so to give full consideration to the submissions made to the committee as well as the views of the committee.  I am very hopeful that legislation will be introduced before Easter and enacted before the summer.  I am very concerned about the pirate stations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking earlier about the question of spongers.  We have been brainwashed into believing that all these spongers come from within the social welfare group.  I would condemn those within that group who are abusing the system &mdash; and there are some &mdash; but there are people in other areas who are sponging from the community.  Before lunch I started to read onto the record a letter from the Federation of the Self-Employed who suggested that people who go to prison should not be properly fed and should not have television or radio.  They also suggested that people should be caned.  Should they also be caned who cheat on their VAT returns, who do not send in their PAYE returns or only a portion of what they have deducted?  Should people who cheat on their tax returns be caned?  There is a feeling abroad that the only people who are sponging are social welfare recipients but such people are on the bottom rung of society and are entitled to receive payments. There are, of course, elements <Col N="1538" /> who are not.  I resent this smear on a section of our community by people who are well-heeled and capable of looking after their own interests.  They have a double standard, expecting all the ills in our society to be corrected by getting those on the lowest rung of the ladder to take the blame and carry more of the burden.  We should tell these people that they are having it good and that we expect some responsible participation by them in society.  If they were to look into their own hearts and see their contribution to society, then we would see where the true spongers are.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly about the employment problem.  It is likely that unemployment figures will rise even higher before they begin to bottom out towards the end of the year.  It is not possible for the Government or for the Legislature to correct all the ills with regard to unemployment. We cannot legislate unemployment away but there is a lot we could do and I do not believe that everything possible is being done.  I know that the attention of the Government has been taken up with the serious financial situation which they inherited and they have dealt with that in a very sound way to date, although there is still a lot of work to do.  The question of unemployment remains very serious.  Even with the improvement in industrial employment towards the end of the year we will not be able to produce sufficient jobs to reduce the unemployment figure or to meet the needs of young people coming on to the labour market.  It is time to take special action in this regard.</P>
      <P>In the UK there is a Privy Council arrangement where behind the Chair, so to speak, items of special importance, usually security matters, are discussed. Unemployment is such a serious problem that the Taoiseach and members of the Government together with the Opposition should have such a privy council type arrangement where, far from the petty bickering which takes place on the floor of the House, matters relating to unemployment should be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem has implications for the whole social fabric of society.  It is a national problem and requires statesmanship <Col N="1539" /> and action to deal with it.  If we stopped bickering about it and did something positive we could cut out the vested interests, employers and trade unions, and get people back to work.  We could give hope to the community.</P>
    <P>The Government have a responsibility to govern.  It is not our job just to manage the affairs of the country and stop at that. We must decide where the future of the country lies.  Much more could be done about the unemployment problem.  I implore the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition to consider setting up such a privy council to deal with matters such as the serious problem of unemployment which is threatening the community. I intend raising this formally in the House again.</P>
    <P>Businessmen who threaten to take their money and run give free enterprise a bad name.  By their callousness they are turning people towards what they say they are opposed to and that is State control.  They will soon run out of places to transfer their funds to because, like it or not, we will not always have a liberal democracy.  We are already under pressure to have dictatorships.  The people who say they are opposed to that kind of government are lending support to the argument for it by their irresponsible actions.  We are one of about 15 liberal democracies in the world.  We are under threat and if we do not deal with our problems in a responsible way &mdash; that requires responsible action on the part of the people who control capital as well as labour &mdash; the world will soon be one liberal democracy less.  It is time to get our act together.  These people should put something back into the society which made them wealthy men.</P>
    <P>As regards wastefulness in the public service, one of the problems we have is that there is very little incentive for people employed in the public service. There is little feeling of responsibility or of belonging to an organisation.  In some of the larger local authorities and, perhaps, to some extent in central Government, engineers come in one door and shop floor workers come in a different door.  They rarely meet unless they are <Col N="1540" /> taking instructions and so on.  That type of situation does not encourage full participation by everyone.  If people in a Government Department do not spend all the money voted to them they should be given a bonus as is done in the private sector.  If we do not give people some incentive they will receive a budget of £X this year and will look for £X + 1 next year and so on whereas a budget of £X - 1 might suffice and would help us to save money for the PAYE sector.  We should encourage good relations in general and not just good industrial relations in local authorities and the public service between management and employers. That would contribute towards eliminating waste.</P>
    <P>One of our biggest problems is the public service pay bill.  I understand that the Minister is not providing for an increase in the public service pay bill over and above what was negotiated.  As a member of a VEC and a local authority I have spoken to people who have seen their colleagues retire and not be replaced.  They argue they would prefer to see the same numbers employed at the same cost to the Exchequer.  In other words, for the miserable saving we make on the one in three policy, which must be done, we could keep people at work if people in the public service were a little more moderate in their demands.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the 19 per cent pay increase Deputies received.  If one takes into account the back money we did not receive it comes down to 14 per cent.  Everyone in the public service received that 19 per cent, although not everyone got the back money.  It is time to ask the people in the public service if they would prefer to keep the same numbers at work with the same pay bill or get an increase and let some people go.  That is what it boils down to.  Many people would be prepared to keep their colleagues at work because they would realise that it could be them or their son or daughter who would be let go.  If there was moderation a substantial number of people could be employed.</P>
    <P>In these difficult times people in the public service do not just have the wage agreement to which they are entitled but <Col N="1541" /> they have the added attraction, with some notable exceptions, of security of tenure, payment while they are ill and promotional prospects which people in outside employment do not have.  It is incumbent on the public service to give the lead in these difficult times.  It is all very fine to scream, &ldquo;We must get this rise and that rise to keep pace with inflation&rdquo;. That will mean people in the public service will continue to become unemployed, will go on to the dole queue and compete in an already overcrowded jobs market.  That will not do anybody any good.  There must be a rational approach towards controlling the public service employees.  That could be a cornerstone in economic recovery.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing a number of imaginative items.  It is a good thing to take some of the people in the lower income group out of the tax net.  It is a good thing to reduce VAT on theatre tickets.  It is a good thing to reduce VAT on cement.  While these are not enormous steps they will give encouragement to certain sections of the community and it is a good thing to see such items included in the budget.  The Minister has acted on sound and reasonable lines within the objectives he set himself. By the end of the year I hope we will find ourselves out of the dark tunnel in which we have been travelling for some time past, out of the dark tunnel into the light of economic recovery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget has been described in various terms from &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; to &ldquo;as-you-were&rdquo;.  It is a budget that has not performed as we on this side of the House would have hoped.  It has not dealt with the major ills especially from the point of view of unemployment.  It is a budget that can be amply described as just kicking-to-touch without any gain in ground.  When one examines it it would appear to be a step backwards.  It is clear evidence of a Government who have lost their nerve.  When engaged in sports, as I was a few years ago, one was always afraid that at the vital time youngsters would lose their nerve.  I think the Government now have lost their nerve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to waste time reading <Col N="1542" /> extracts from promises made by various members of the Government in the last election and since in the by-election.  We are all too well aware of the contents and when one now finds this wishy-washy budget put before us it makes one wonder. I believe, however, that those earlier statements by members of the Government should be compulsory reading for people to show what they proposed then and what they came up with when they had the opportunity.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have talked about the budget as a neutral budget, as if this neutrality had some special merits.  To me, a budget should not be just a book keeping operation.  It should not be mere accountability of money taken in by way of taxation.  It should have a direction and a purpose.  It should direct how the economy should develop.  While the budget of itself cannot get the economy going it should endeavour to create the conditions which can revitalise the economy.  The Taoiseach appears to accept the standstill effect of the budget. He seems to be content to resume progress at another time and in another budget.  The last speaker said that in the past three years we have more than doubled the EEC average where unemployment is concerned.  Recently I came across figures in my own constituency.  We spoke here last June on the effect of the 1983 budget on the Border regions because of the tax impositions and the damage they were doing.  At that time we had 1,800 unemployed in a small county, with a small population of 51,000.  We thought we were at rockbottom then, at an all-time low.  We now have an average of about 100 per month and that continues.</P>
    <P>What is needed is the creation of confidence in people in their own ability.  If the Government do not show initiative it is very difficult to generate confidence. We have reached a point now where the private sector must step in to generate confidence.  The volume of imports makes depressing reading.  Most of those imports could be produced here quite easily.  If entrepreneurs in the private sector will come together that is the only way in which we can develop our <Col N="1543" /> resources.  Recently in a CII publication I noticed that employment in the labour intensive industries over the last four years had dropped by 20,100 people and the total engaged in manufacturing has dropped by 33.5 per cent.  That gives an indication of the serious situation in which we are.  There was a time when we were very adept at manufacturing footwear. Last year for the period January to October our imports of footwear reached a figure of 67.3 million.  We must put greater emphasis on buying Irish and supporting home production.  If we do not do that we shall reach an intolerable situation.  Since 1947 competing imports have increased their share of our market from those years when we were in our infancy from the point of view of manufacturing from 40 to 70 per cent in clothing, from 50 to 70 per cent in textiles and from 18 to 30 per cent in foodstuffs.  That last figure occurs at a time when the production and manufacture of processed foodstuffs have improved considerably, when there is great expertise and very competent young people coming in at management level.  It is incredible, in the light of that, that processed foodstuffs should have increased by such a volume. Unfortunately that situation is continuing.</P>
    <P>We import materials for the construction industry to the value of £400 million. Surely that figure could be reduced.  Such massive importation would be considered unsatisfactory at any time but it is disastrous at a time of such high unemployment and very difficult economic conditions.  I am not saying that the situation can be changed over night but such Government agencies as the IDA, Foras Forbartha, the IIRS, the educational establishments and the local authorities will have to come together to examine the question of how imports can be reduced.  Up to 75 per cent of the construction materials imported are being directed to buildings that are financed either wholly or partly by the State. There will have to be some control in regard to the materials used in those buildings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> The budget highlights once again the fact that the Border area is the forgotten region, the never-never land.  Much lip service is paid to the problem of under developed areas while nothing positive is being done to alleviate the situation.  The wide divergence in prices as between each side of the Border is causing grave problems for traders on the Twenty-Six County side.  Many of them have been forced to go out of business because of this situation.  The established trading practices of that region have been destroyed.  While the big differences in prices may be the subject of jokes in some places, the situation is leading to the bankruptcy of many business in the area with the consequent loss of many jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister chose to increase the price of petrol by 6p per gallon.  I do not know whether that is inclusive of VAT. It may not be.  In any case, the increase keeps us at the top of the league to the extent that petrol prices here are the highest of any of the EEC contries.  There had been expectations on all sides that the Minister would make amends for what he did last year in this respect because in the meantime he has had a clear indication of the fall-off in revenue that resulted from his action and of the damage that resulted to traders in the Border region.  I am talking of an area which is regarded as being severely handicapped not only in the national context but in EEC terms, a situation that was reaffirmed by the social affairs committee who visited us last summer.  It is not the nature of a northerner to indulge in whinging but the people concerned are only trying to ensure that they get fair play.</P>
    <P>Six months after the 1983 budget a delegation of traders from Counties Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth met the Minister for Finance on a number of occasions.  I have here photostats of the submissions put by the group to the Minister.  They pointed to alternatives in the system of the collection of VAT and they told the Minister that in Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth there was a decline, within six months of the budget, of 52 per cent in <Col N="1545" /> trading while in Donegal the decline was of the order of 60 per cent.  These people, with the help of a team of accountants, estimated that the annual loss to the Exchequer in duty and VAT on spirits alone would amount to £14 million.  They were proved to have been correct in their estimation.  They gave the Minister a break-down of the various items.  The variations in prices were 90 per cent in respect of lagers, 42 per cent in respect of wines, 47 per cent in respect of whiskey and 27 per cent in so far as petrol was concerned.  We had hoped that in this year's budget the Minister would redress the imbalance but apparently he does not recognise the difficulties that are involved for people concerned.</P>
    <P>In regard to the milk super-levy, the approach of the Government and of the Minister for Agriculture was marked by indecision and by a changing of positions. The super-levy negotiations left much to be desired and indicated a lack of recognition of our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> our partners in the EEC.  This lack of recognition was particularly obvious so far as the British were concerned.  The levy would create a very serious problem for the western counties in particular where farmers had changed over in previous years to milk production in the belief that it was their only hope for survival.  This whole matter of a super-levy will have to be examined very carefully.  We must ensure that our agricultural industry is not damaged.  Of our total exports, 38 per cent relate to agriculture and of that amount 32 per cent relates to dairy products.  In terms of the other EEC countries, our agricultural industry is six-and-a-half times more important to our economy than is the agricultural industry of any other member state to its economy.  These figures give an idea of the necessity for the Minister to use as much muscle as possible in relation to this whole question.</P>
    <P>At a time when so much difficulty is being experienced in manufacturing industry in terms of markets and so on, our agricultural industry, if properly developed, has the capacity to pick up the slack that pertains in many other areas.  Admittedly, there is provision for <Col N="1546" /> £100,000 for a potato co-operative.  That is welcome and one hopes that this is only a beginning in terms of our coming to grips with the question of import substitution. In reply to a question today we were told that for a period of some months in 1983 we imported vegetables worth £49 million.  In these circumstances one looks forward eagerly to the establishment of food co-operatives and so on because they are the answer to our problems. There are many excellent small industries, but if agriculture is to reach its full potential we must establish food co-operatives and have regard to the market weaknesses that have caused so many problems up to now.  We must ensure that our produce is of the highest standard, because if the standard is right and if our prices are competitive we should not have any problem.  We must concentrate to a large extent on value-added products.  It is ridiculous that so much of our produce leaves the country before being processed while the value-added content is used in other countries.</P>
    <P>We have not been recognised sufficiently by the EEC.  I read recently that a mining town in England with a population of 55,000 was given aid to the extent of £50 million to help counteract the winds of recession.  We had a guarantee that subsidies for ground limestone and AI services would be continued.  This is very important if we wish to upgrade the quality of our herds.  In a time of recession farmers may be inclined to cut costs, such as not using the necessary application of lime and this could have serious consequences in years to come. The Farm Modernisation Scheme was withdrawn in the budget last year in order to save £10 million or £12 million and a modified version of the scheme was reintroduced in January this year.  We were fighting to ensure a continuation of the market for our products and we were fighting against the super-levy but, at the same time, the Government here were withdrawing necessary development aids.</P>
    <P>The revised scheme will apply only to development farmers and they comprise one-fifth of the farmers in my county.  We have a high proportion of development <Col N="1547" /> farmers and we have a 99 per cent record for completions under the Western Drainage Scheme and land improvement schemes.  In Monaghan there are more than 900 development farmers and there are 4,200 farmers in the other categories. When the Farm Modernisation Scheme was introduced in 1974 a farmer had six years before he was placed in the development category.  If he fulfilled the criteria regarding acreage and the income per labour unit he could move into the development category or he alternatively could move into one of the other categories.</P>
    <P>What has happened is that after six years the Government will not give recognition to the other categories and grant aid is not available to them.  The 4,200 farmers affected will not get one penny for building the structures that are badly needed.  Half of the cattle in the country are out on pasture during winter when they should be housed, but the farmers will not get any help in carrying out the necessary building works.  When the Minister was asked about this matter he said that the farmers could avail of measures available to the west of Ireland.  At the end of the year I put down a question to find out the amount of grant aid paid for farm buildings in the 12 western counties since the withdrawal of the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  I found the total amount paid was £70,000, which would not build much more than a two-storey house.  Under the terms of the measures available to the west of Ireland, a person in milk production is debarred from availing of the Farm Modernisation Scheme.</P>
    <P>Bovine TB and brucellosis are the cause of much concern in my area.  Cavan was completely clear of disease and in reply to a question last year I was told the incidence of the disease in Monaghan was 0.20 per cent.  However, bovine TB has been recurring with very serious consequences. In my area many farmers are losing 20 or 30 cattle and this will cause them serious hardship.</P>
    <P>According to official returns a sum of £34 million has been spent on eradicating bovine TB.  We were told that administrative staff and veterinary officers <Col N="1548" /> received 25.3 per cent of that amount, veterinary fees accounted for 34 per cent, travelling expenses, laboratory fees and vaccines accounted for 14 per cent and the reactor compensation, which most people thought was the most severe burden, amounted to 25 per cent.  When the scheme for the eradication of brucellosis was set up there was a staff increase of 50 per cent.  At present the figure is about 1,000 and 800 veterinary officers.  They deal with approximately 6,000 TB infected herds and 1,300 herds that are affected with brucellosis.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil successive Ministers have been asked questions regarding the diseases. It has been suggested that badgers were responsible for the spread of the disease, that cattle in adjoining herds were a factor and even streams were mentioned in the debate.  However, the Department have never stated definitely what is responsible for the spread of the disease.  The matter is very important and every effort must be taken to remedy it.</P>
    <P>Health is an area that costs a lot of money.  We were told the budget was a neutral budget but that is not so when existing services are cut.  The Minister has reduced by £1.9 million the amount allocated in the case of the health board of which I am a member.  Prior to this allocation, he sent to all health boards a tongue in cheek letter asking that major economies be made but saying that services should be maintained.  He knows that cannot be achieved without affecting the quality and cover of the services and for a number of years there have been restrictions in the health services.  This arises at a time when so many posts in the health services at all levels have been left vacant and for some time.  It is utter nonsense to cut the health service allocation by £1.9 million and ask a health board to ensure that the services are maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said:</P>
    <P>In general, it will be my aim to continue the process of diverting an increasing share of the available resources into the low profile areas of priority needs within the services, particularly in the community area.  It is my intention to set aside a disparate <Col N="1549" /> allocation annually within the lifetime of the medium-term capital programme to enable health boards to provide compact basic community care facilities.</P>
    <P>He is talking about the capital programme, but we in the health boards were faced on Monday of this week with a reduced allocation to meet the needs under the various headings of community care and institutional care.  There is a limit to reduction of running expenses of institutions.  The community care area was neglected because we were not able to provide any additional money for home helps or for transport.  The home helps get, I think, 60p an hour and we were able to give them only a miserly 10p per hour increase in this budget.</P>
    <P>The area of health care has suffered very seriously under the Coalition administrations. Deputy Corish, when Tánaiste, put forward proposals in the early seventies to downgrade a hospital in my county.  That was in December 1975 and almost ten years later, there was a proposal last June from the present Minister of Health to close this hospital. By those threats and proposals he has caused deep anxiety among the people of that area.  He also discontinued a complete maternity service in one county.</P>
    <P>This is a real, fundamental issue.  When the boards were set up under the 1970 Health Act they were to provide and administer the health services in their particular regions.  I have been a member of a health board since 1974 and feel that the North-Eastern Health Board have acted very responsibly and worked within their financial allocation.  They have continued at all times to try to improve the cover and level of services in their region. The Minister is trying to take over the responsibilities of the health care of that region.  For about two years &mdash; and I am a member of the committee for general hospitals &mdash; we have had meetings to examine maternity policy.  In February a maternity policy was drawn up to cover the entire region.  Included in that were five centres, one of them being a hospital which was not under the direct control of the North-Eastern Health Board.  Our <Col N="1550" /> programme was approved by the board and sent to the Department of Health. Subsequently, the Minister saw fit to disregard that programme and replace it with one for three centres administering the maternity services.  He also reduced the number of beds from 182 to 165.  At health board level we were told that this was done without any health board input into it and without their being contacted on it.  We had later a meeting with the Department officials and were told that the health board officials had an input into this.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to come along over the heads of the health board, who drew up a policy giving facts and figures in conjunction with consultants and senior medical staff of each of the hospitals within the four county region, and disregard the views and work put into the programme, it raises a question of the future of a duly elected member of a health board serving on such a board. This is a serious blow with regard to the administration of the health services.  I do not feel that we can be responsible, as a health board, for the administration of health services within a region if that is the attitude.  The responsibility must remain with the health board.  The people in my county felt so strongly about this that they collected money to ensure continuance of the services in the region.  No Minister, irrespective of what party he comes from or what Government he represents, can disregard the wishes of the mass of the people.  It would be wrong if that could happen and it is wrong that any Minister should attempt to do it.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil have a definite, clear policy regarding health services within the region and I am satisfied that when that party return to Government that serious situation will be put right.  A needless conflict has been created over the building of a hospital in another county, which hospital is urgently needed.  This was because the matter was <i>sub judice</i> until the Minister himself spoke here about it.  This was a conflict not generated by the health board but rather by a Minister who sought to impose his will on a board and an area containing upwards of 300,000 people. <Col N="1551" /> The Minister should take a very close look at his meddlesome attitude in that regard and not be caught out in the future.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters in the health field I might mention.  One causing great concern is the amount of drugs and their cost generally within the general medical services.  In October 1982 we discussed this matter with our health board.  Following that discussion I received letters from various chemical companies.  In one such letter they told me that there was a regional hospital with an annual medicine bill of £960,000 and probably this year it would amount to well over £1 million.  They said they could supply approximately one-third of that hospital's requirements at a lower cost than at present obtains.  In the past six months they said they had received orders to the value of £200.  They said that when they inquired why they were not receiving orders they were not given a direct answer.  They were told the quality of their products was satisfactory and they went on to say that they were aware that their present price was well below current costs.  I know the Minister has been applying his attention to this area but he would need to do so more strenuously to ensure that Irish companies who produce on a par with imports are given the orders.  If we are genuine about a reversion to genetic drugs it is time the premiums and extra moneys paid for trade names were terminated so that we can effect the type of price reduction indicated in that letter.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the present Government in the last couple of budgets have a hang-up about shoes and clothing particularly when one remembers that a few years ago the Taoiseach became very involved in the size of children's feet. Last week, after the budget announcement of VAT on clothing, tags were produced of sizes of children's clothing.  The amount of money to be derived from that imposition, I believe, will be like many of the other hare-brained ideas: It will hardly justify its administrative problems and expenditure.  There was talk about ten years and ten years and a bit.  Seemingly <Col N="1552" /> there has been no definition of size. Parents shopping will find that it will continue to create serious problems for them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that there was need for us to apply ourselves to exploiting to the full our native resources.  In this connection I might mention a booklet issued recently entitled <i>Ireland's Forestry Review</i> which has been produced by foresters and personnel of the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants. In that booklet it is said that there has been no significant change effected in our policy of afforestation since 1978. Our commitment then to 10,000 hectares a year of new forests was reduced last year to something like 6,000.  Indeed, there is immediate danger of redundancy among forestry workers, a running down of the afforestation services generally, which is a particular pity because it is a service that has the manpower, knowhow and equipment required.  Naturally, there will be a reduction in the motivation of workers when they see earlier targets not being achieved or the money not being provided to ensure their achievement.</P>
    <P>I saw a recent survey of land qualities in which it was contended that the drumlin soils were very suitable for afforestation. There is much marginal land available at present, a lot of it at reasonable prices &mdash; indeed, a lot cheaper than some land purchased by the Forestry Division some years ago.  Apparently the Department are not in a position to purchase that land and proceed with their policy of afforestation.  I have seen various surveys showing that we should be self-sufficient in softwood by 1984, but last year we still imported something like £80 million to £100 million worth of timber.  The Government should be examining those areas because they have enormous potential for growth and development.</P>
    <P>We had yesterday the announcement by the Minister for the Environment regarding an increase in the qualifying limits for SDA loans, admittedly by £1,000 only, and also a raising of the loan amount by £2,000, which I welcome. That Department must carry out a thorough re-examination of our housing <Col N="1553" /> needs, of the provision of houses and their quality to ensure a longer life for our housing stock.  In the mid-1970s there was a directive given at local authority level that less money be spent on maintenance.  This has meant that much tenanted local authority housing stock has deteriorated greatly.  Indeed, some such housing schemes, if not maintained and done quickly, will fall into complete disrepair which will necessitate the erection of new houses.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Department should insist on local authorities carrying out a closer examination of all aspects of these loans.  For example, a figure of £16,000 is completely inadequate in current circumstances for the building of a house.  Local authorities should go into the business of providing serviced sites.  In many cases the provision of services, water sewerage and so on, costs half the amount of loan an applicant may receive.  Indeed, from statistics it appears that it cost the Exchequer £116 million last year in rent subsidies.  We shall have to ascertain how those people who wish to build their own houses can be facilitated in the future. Over many decades now the construction industry has been recognised not alone as a good barometer of the health of our economy but also as a prime mover in getting the economy going.  If there was greater input into the construction industry at present it would get our economy moving.  It is absolutely essential that that industry receive some impetus.</P>
    <P>This year also we will be faced with the serious problem of lack of funds within local authorities for the maintenance of services within their respective areas. Indeed, we are not putting up the money necessary to implement the 1980 Roads Development Plan.  When we discussed that plan at local authority level in 1980 there was a projection of the funds that would be made available for that purpose. There is no doubt but that we shall experience serious problems with the implementation of that plan even on a scaled down basis, this year.</P>
    <P>A number of people have experienced great difficulty in paying the charges imposed for services last year in respect of which a considerable amount of time <Col N="1554" /> has been spent at local authority level examining applications for remissions and so on.</P>
    <P>In June last year we had a debate on the Border regions.  I said to the Minister for Finance that, if we wanted to make any headway with the money being made available from the Regional Fund and the Border Counties Fund, we would have to have an administrative presence on the ground to ensure that the moneys would be used to the best advantage.  He claimed that the various Government agencies and local authorities were capable of handling the matter.  However, on 14 January I noticed an announcement of the appointment of a Mr. Fanning who would have responsibility for the southern region and that he had been made a full-time EEC representative by the Commission.  They have made this appointment in Munster and have continually ignored our request for an administrator-co-ordinator in the Border regions which would ensure that the money would be channelled properly. Perhaps the Minister would reconsider our request.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years we have introduced the Programme for Western Development.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of this as it covers his county. Deputy MacSharry introduced it in April 1981 and, if the scheme was properly implemented and supervised, it would change the face of the 12 western counties. They have been declared severely handicapped, but after three years we have made very little progress and in some areas no progress at all.  This is because of the terms of the income qualifying limit and also because if a person in the west was a milk producer he was debarred from qualifying for many aids under this scheme.  The Government also reduced the qualifying limit for headage from over £5,000 to about £3,000.  In the first year of the operation of the scheme where £30 million was available only £6.3 million was used and in 1982 there was an expenditure of £17.6 million.  This is penny wise, pound foolish, because practically all the schemes &mdash; water supply, roads, electrification, land improvement, agricultural production, calf to beef <Col N="1555" /> scheme and private afforestation &mdash; were all entitled to substantial grants.  Perhaps these schemes were not sufficiently advertised but they were not availed of and the money has not been used.  Some 50 per cent of the money was being provided by the EEC and I am sure that in the years to come there will not be such a substantial allocation.  The Government must ensure that the money, pound for pound, is matched and that the schemes will make a more meaningful and substantial contribution to that region.</P>
    <P>The budget has not created the confidence required to ensure that the economy moves again.  There is a crying need for employment.  There are about 2,000 people unemployed every month and the policies which the Government are pursuing will do nothing to halt that trend.  We must closely examine our own resources and see how they can be fully utilised.  We must ensure that import substitution is tackled meaningfully and vigorously. It is no good setting up review bodies who will not report for a couple of years.  There are empty factories all over the place.  We have young people and, while the country owes nobody a living, it certainly owes them an opportunity. The Government owes the young people an opportunity to ensure that they have a chance of employment.  People who are selling goods and those who purchase them all have a responsibility to ensure that they are doing all they can to provide work in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to look at the disadvantaged regions which he ensured were more seriously disadvantaged by his impositions in 1983 and by the continuation of the Government's lunatic policies in 1984.  Many of the jobs which disappeared in those areas should have been retained, which would have meant more revenue for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of welcoming the budget which is a very good one, given the present financial climate.  I believe that the budget will ensure the continued fall in the rate of inflation and will reduce <Col N="1556" /> the budget deficit percentage on the gross national product.  I am sure, a Leas Cheann Comhairle, you can appreciate the overall importance of the economic future of the country in achieving these points.  At the same time, the budget gives recognition to the plight of the PAYE sector who are shouldering a very substantial amount of the tax bill.</P>
      <P>We are now in the fourth day of the budget debate and I have looked to the Opposition to make some positive contribution. However, all we have heard is a continuous tirade of negative contributions. I wonder if the Opposition are seriously interested in our economic plight.  If they were, they would make constructive contributions which would be of assistance to the Government.  To date we have not heard one such contribution. When the Leader of the Opposition made his speech this morning I expected to hear very positive and constructive suggestions, but I was very disappointed when I heard what he had to say.</P>
      <P>I believe this budget is going in the right direction.  The Minister said there were clear indications of an economic recovery in Europe and the United States and that it was opportune for us to prepare ourselves to take advantage of that recovery.  In the past successive Governments looked to the boat to solve our economic problems and over the years we exported some of our finest people.  I still believe the boat is the solution to our economic problems but in a different way.  We could export the finest quality goods if we put our minds to it.  There is a necessity to re-educate the attitude and mentality of many of our people towards their work and the quality goods they produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best solution to our present economic problems is the world market, which is very competitive.  but if we can produce a quality, cost-competitive product, the opportunity to substantially improve our balance of trade are enormous. Taxation is very high but, given the reality of the state of the public finances, that is something we must live with.  However, this should not mean that we as a people cannot face the problem. <Col N="1557" /> We need to translate our pride of being Irishmen and women into our work.  That means that those of us who are fortunate enough to have jobs should work every hour we are supposed to.  It does not mean extended sick leave or tea breaks. It means treating the raw materials we have with the utmost respect and striving to produce quality goods.  We should not direct our frustration and agitation at our public representatives and the Government but at our real competitors on the world market.  We will be able to compete by producing a better quality product and so avoid importing goods which we could very ably produce here.</P>
    <P>There is another group of people who must be referred to, that is, the wealthy group of tax evaders.  It is not acceptable that a group of people can evade tax and literally sit down in their drawingrooms studying the Stock Exchange and working out how they can make profits quickly.  That is an unacceptable situation, especially when it is at the expense of the taxpayers.  I would like to congratulate the Minister and the Government on trying to close that loophole.  It is essential that we continue to pursue tax evaders because we have to be seen to be equitable.  It is unfair to ask a certain sector to make a substantial contribution while a wealthier group are allowed to evade tax.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the public sector and the numbers employed in that sector.  It is generally accepted that a real increase in the numbers employed in the public sector took place in the last ten years.  I am sure these people will acknowledge that they are in a very privileged position because they have permanent and pensionable employment and that they will show their appreciation in our present economic circumstances by making fewer demands for pay increases.  This is the least that should be expected of them.  I ask them to recognise their privileged position and to be moderate in their pay demands.</P>
    <P>Many people said the poor and the lower income sector have not been adequately taken care of.  How does one define &ldquo;adequately taken care of&rdquo;?  Given the present circumstances, the Minister <Col N="1558" /> has done a great deal to improve the lot of the poorer section of the community and the lower income group.  A 7 per cent increase in social welfare has been granted and he allocated £13 million towards the family income supplement fund.</P>
    <P>I was delighted that the Minister for the Environment announced yesterday that there would be an increase in the SDA loans from £14,000 to £16,000 and that the eligibility limit would be increased from £7,000 to £8,000.  This is a very significant move and proves that the Government are committed to helping the lower income group.  This budget will ensure that more than 15,000 people who were paying income tax will no longer be eligible.  These are very significant factors.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that agriculture is the backbone of our economy.  I am delighted the Minister made an additional £5.7 million available for the AI and ground limestone subsidy schemes.  He has shown how important these schemes are by making this allocation.  The Minister said EEC schemes were due to expire on 30 April and that an extension was being sought.  I would like to take this opportunity to say that these schemes are very important, particularly to the west, and I urge the Minister and the Government to make every effort to ensure that these schemes are extended.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the boat solved many of our economic ills in the past.  I am delighted that the Minister has recognised all the Irish people who were forced to emigrate, especially those who went to Britain, by increasing the welfare centre contribution to the centres in Britain from £38,000 to £68,000.  This was a very welcome increase and I congratulate the Minister for taking that initiative.</P>
    <P>We have made a major breakthrough as far as tourism is concerned and 1984 will prove to be a tourist bonanza because of the measures introduced in this budget.  There has been a reduction to 18 per cent VAT on the hiring of cars, boats and caravans and, in addition, tourists who purchase in retail outlets will have the VAT on those goods returned when <Col N="1559" /> they are leaving.  That is very important. It will heighten the attraction of Ireland to tourists from North America and the Continent.  As a western Deputy coming from a county where tourism is very important, I welcome that measure.  I have no doubt it will be of benefit in the forthcoming tourist season.</P>
    <P>A contribution was also made to the sporting sector.  That is very important, particularly for our young people.  Many young people are unemployed and it is absolutely essential that more facilities for sporting and leisure activities should be provided.  I welcome the contribution of £100,000 to the GAA.  Clare is the home county of Michael Cusack.  The Clare GAA asked me to convey their special appreciation of this contribution to the Government.</P>
    <P>Many Opposition speakers referred to a lack of confidence or a no confidence factor in the Government.  There is every confidence in the Government.  The people of Ireland have confidence in the Government.  The poll published by <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning shows specifically that the people have confidence in the Government and the line of action taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister.  His actions will enable the Government to achieve the goals set out when they took office. This budget will prove to be a very good budget for the economy, and next year our economy will be in a healthier state and we will be in a position to make real inroads into the problem of unemployment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The budget presented by the Minister last week highlights further the Government's retreat from the Irish agricultural industry.  The Government have abdicated their responsibility to the farming sector.  In the booklet published recently entitled <i>Economic Background to the Budget 1984</i> it is stated that agricultural growth in 1984 will be dependent on the outcome of the EEC negotiations particularly with regard to the restructuring of the Common Agricultural Policy and the outcome of the proposed super-levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This signifies clearly the Government's <Col N="1560" /> neglect of the agricultural sector and the handing over of their total responsibility to the EEC bureaucrats.  The budget provided no incentive for agricultural development. This incentive is a prerequisite for total recovery.  We know that real farm incomes declined by 1 per cent in 1983 and the indications are that there will be a further decline of 5 per cent in real terms in 1984 as a result of Government inactivity.  This significant drop in farmers' income is the Government's legacy to rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>This budget was the least significant in terms of changes actually made for many years.  It has been referred to as a neutral budget cobbled together for the sake of expediency because no clear cut decisions could be made by the combination of parties now forming the Government. There was a lack of activity and a lack of decision in the Minister's budget speech. There were no cuts of any consequence in current expenditure.  The burden of taxation, which is far too great, will continue to be felt in 1984.  Some very minor reliefs were given in personal taxation and this was done within the existing structures.</P>
    <P>The tax bands which apply to most taxpayers were not index-linked.  An insignificant allowance is being given to lower income taxpayers and it tends to complicate the present income tax system. We have many areas of taxation: income tax, PRSI, health and related charges, the youth employment levy and the special income levy.  All these tend to complicate our taxation system.  We set up the Commission on Taxation.  No recognition has been given to their report issued some 16 or 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the thinking behind this budget.  We were told that the programme prepared by the two parties now forming the Government would have as a priority the reduction of the budget deficit.  Last year in his budget the Minister introduced severe taxation for that purpose.  We all know what the story was at the end of the year: no significant reduction was made.  Therefore one questions the integrity and the approach by the Government to getting the State's finances under control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> While we were in Government this party were blamed by the present Government for the size of the national debt.  As pointed out by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party this morning, the main problems occurred in the 1973-77 period of Government.  Borrowings during that period were far greater than in the period from 1977 to 1981.  It is important to realise fully that the fault lies with this Government's complete lack of capacity to tackle the serious problems of increased current expenditure. Their approach is to decrease capital expenditure.  These measures are not geared to the expansion of the economy and no effort is made in the budget to provide any hope of employment, particularly for our young people who see no hope for the future.  The Government go along their merry way moving from one crisis to another and not sorting out any of the serious problems affecting us.</P>
    <P>This negative budget has accelerated the Government's retreat from rural Ireland which commenced on 14 December 1982 when they took office.  No budget speech since the foundation of the State has devoted so little attention to agriculture, our major industry.  The Minister mentioned only the continuation of the relief given two years ago by Fianna Fáil in regard to the transfer of farms to young trained farmers.  There is also to be a continuation of the lime and AI subsidies.  There has been no new thinking from the Government in regard to agricultural development.  They have abdicated their responsibilities to the bureaucrats of Europe.  I wonder whether this is a reflection of the lack of muscle of the Minister for Agriculture at the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>The budget is a non-event for all sections of the community.  It provides no new incentives for the expansion of agriculture. Thousands of millions have been invested in the farm sector during the past decade but there is a Government unwillingness to provide the necessary incentives to increase the breeding herd, thereby increasing output and recreating jobs in the food industry.  There seem to be funds available in many other areas &mdash; for example, Dublin Gas &mdash; but funds <Col N="1562" /> are not available towards increasing life-stock numbers.  By ignoring our major industry the budget will lead to increased job losses in the farm and food industries, resulting in higher unemployment figures. All forecasts agree &mdash; and the Government admit this &mdash; that unemployment figures will again rise this year. This is due to lack of Government activity. The unemployment legacy of the Government will go down in history.</P>
    <P>The lack of a definite farm policy has devastated confidence and destroyed any remaining initiative.  The budget will be remembered as signifying the end of the food industry.  It is totally negative and the Government have been the greatest prophets of doom.  They have done more to undermine confidence than the dreaded super-levy.  Unfortunately they have matched this preaching with higher taxation, higher unemployment and higher current budget deficits.</P>
    <P>The budget can also be criticised because it totally ignores agriculture. That is an indictment of the Government's preception of the part our largest industry has to play in the improvement of the economy.  That is only half the story.  Farmers will justifiably argue that they have had a special budget of their own announced in bits and pieces by the Minister for Agriculture during the past few months.  All the news is bad.  Apart from the dismal EEC outlook, several measures have been announced by the Government which will reduce farm income and stifle any possibility of reinvestment, as well as stifling the optimism which is so necessary at all levels of farming.  The penal levies on beef and milk, the extension of payment for our produce in intervention and the downgrading &mdash; almost non-existence &mdash; of the Farm Modernisation Scheme will hurt farming in both the long and short term.</P>
    <P>What further blows can the Government inflict on our greatest industry? Undoubtedly further blows will be inflicted.  The farming community do not have confidence in the Government to negotiate a worthwhile deal at the summit meeting in Paris.  They have failed dismally in the past and I hope they do better in the future.  The Taoiseach <Col N="1563" /> should again visit the Heads of State and impress on them the importance of the dairy industry to us.  It is basic for future expansion and for a better standard of living for dairy farmers.</P>
    <P>Many of the Minister's pronouncements in Brussels were purely a public relations exercise.  How could he argue with conviction in Europe that Ireland was getting a raw deal when the next day he returned home and dealt a new body blow to farmers?  The Agriculture Ministers of the other EEC countries are aware of what is happening here and will see that the Government's actions are not in line with the Minister's posturing at the Council of Ministers meeting.  This must damage our credibility in the vital negotiations which lie ahead.</P>
    <P>The budget and the Government's performance over the last year bolsters my conviction that they do not have a plan for agriculture.  While it is frustrating to realise that they do not know where the industry is going, what is even more distressing is that they apparently do not care.  I am not alone in saying this.  Many of the editorials in the farming newspapers have stated that the budget does not extend any ray of hope.  There is no hope for the hard pressed food processing sector. There is no provision for future development.  This will hit the whole economy since output and exports cannot increase because farmers do not have a sufficiently high net income to enable them to invest in production.  The Minister has shown a total disregard for the potential of our greatest industry and has left untouched the overall tax structure as it applies to farming.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Their costs are rising and they have been added to by the increase in levies which the Minister has imposed.  There are levies for disease eradication and veterinary inspection.  Many cut-backs have been imposed on agriculture.  The Estimates have been decreased in real terms.  The overall increase for the Department was a miserable £5 million of which £4 million goes on administration charges.  That leaves £1 million for agricultural development. When we take inflation at 8 or 9 per cent it is in effect a major reduction. As was pointed out by Deputy Haughey, the allocation to agriculture is on the downward trend.  This is a clear indication, irrespective of what the Minister says, of the Government's hasty retreat from agricultural development and from the development of rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of £100,000 for the potato market co-operative is a mockery. The Government have come up with laudable schemes but they have not been backed up with finance.  I wonder what the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, thinks about this.  It is a mere pittance.  It shows the Government's total contempt for agriculture and all that it means for the country.  The Minister of State is <Col N="1565" /> being asked to do the impossible.  He has responsibility for reviving this ailing industry which has been given the kiss of death.</P>
    <P>I also want to avail of the opportunity provided by this budget debate to call on the Government for the report of the working group established when we were in Government and I ask them to allow this report to be implemented as soon as possible so that we can have a national plan for agricultural development.  Farmers and those responsible for food processing and marketing have been left without any guidelines or support by an uncaring Government in one of the most difficult farming periods ever experienced.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat now something I have often said in the past.  The growth in the national herd is the key factor in determining agricultural growth in both the short and the medium term.  Fianna Fáil when in office had drawn up sound basic plans with that objective in view.  Over the past 12 months all we have heard is talk of closures and short-time working in our meat factories with consequential serious damage to employment, to the balance of payments and to farming confidence. Here and now I call on this Government for a public declaration of support for this industry at this most critical time.  Many farming incomes will fall again this year despite the industries best efforts.  I strongly urge on the Government the introduction of a capital investment plan at reasonable rates of interest for the development of agriculture.  If that is not done the wherewithal simply will not be there for investment in increased production which not alone the farming community but the whole nation needs so badly.</P>
    <P>The farm rescue scheme was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government.  It is progressing reasonably well.  It may be the survival kit for many progressive farmers experiencing financial difficulties at the moment.  A major concern of our party and of farming organisations is those farmers excluded from the scheme who are currently fighting for survival. The Government must take a new look at the farm rescue package because the <Col N="1566" /> farmers who are now in dire straits were the self-same farmers who pioneered agricultural development during the last decade.  The solution to their problems lies in some financial institution taking out a foreign currency loan in order to take over their debt and substantially reduce the rate of interest to a figure farming can bear.  The loans should be underwritten by the Government thereby ensuring a fixed rate of interest for a period of up to five years.  That would be a positive investment in the future of agriculture and it would yield much greater dividends than many other proposals which are being implemented.  In addition, it would be a measure of the Government's commitment, if there is a commitment, in practical terms to the farming sector as against the talk we have heard recently from both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture.  The time for talking is over and what we now need from the Government is action, action designed to ensure the development of our primary industry.  The high level of interest rates is a clear indication that the world of finance here, including the Central Bank which is an arm of the Government, does not believe that the rate of inflation will continue to decrease.</P>
    <P>Our economy is heavily dependent on agriculture.  This has been the case for centuries.  Despite the increase in the manufacturing and servicing sectors agriculture still has a prime place in the economic and social structure.  Agriculture is more important in Ireland than it is in other EEC countries.  One in five of the work force is employed in farming or in some aspect of agriculture.  Agricultural exports account for upwards of 50 per cent of our total net exports because of their very low import content.  It would be logical in such circumstances for any right thinking Government to ensure agriculture is given top priority.  One would expect &mdash; the groundwork was already there when the Minister assumed office &mdash; that a detailed plan would be devised for the operation of various schemes and incentives, a way forward clearly delineated, the targets set and the means of attainment clearly indicated.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately that is not the case <Col N="1567" /> either because of ignorance or perhaps because people think farming is not as important to the economy as it once was, and so this Government have consigned agricultural development to the waste paper basket.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture seem to envisage a reduced role for agriculture in the future.  Indeed, the Minister was not included in the task force of Ministers with responsibility for getting the economy moving again.  Such an important sector as agriculture with such growth potential should have a central role in taking us out of the present recession and providing extra employment. When we were in office we set up a high powered group to review policy and identify areas with the greatest potential for expansion.  In our programme, <i>The Way Forward,</i> we spelled out the effects of an increase in output, a better income for farmers, greater employment in the food processing and service industries and a reduction in our balance of payments deficit. Increased prosperity would not be confined to those involved directly in agriculture.  It would filter through to many businesses, big and small, in rural areas.  Instead of considering ways to increase agricultural production and to foster investment, one of the first actions of the Government on coming into office was to virtually axe the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  Most of the grants that were available by way of that scheme were either terminated or suspended.</P>
    <P>Let us consider other areas in which the budget makes no contribution to agricultural development.  The Government have created an environment in which increased production in agriculture is not now attainable.  There have been cuts in the advisory services and charges have been introduced in respect of visits to farms by ACOT staff.  There are also restrictions in respect of livestock headage payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Financial saving is minimal and bears no relationship to its discouraging effect on expansion.  The Government have reneged totally on their preelection promise to provide Euro loans at fixed interest rates.  This promise <Col N="1568" /> formed a part of the Labour-Fine Gael Programme for Government and was part also of the earlier Fine Gael programme for agricultural development.</P>
    <P>All of these decisions give the distinct impression that the Government regard agriculture as a declining sector of the economy.  If farmers see the towel being thrown in by those charged with running the country, how can they be expected to have the confidence that would enable them to invest in their farms?  There is no need for me to emphasise the importance of the cattle and sheep enterprises to the economy.  Exports of cattle and sheep account for a substantial amount of our total exports.  It is feasible to increase these exports by at least 20 per cent in volume alone within a very short period. Such an increase would result in an increase in earnings of up to £140 million. Having regard to the relatively low level of imports in agricultural production compared with industry, we would be talking of an increase of upwards of £400 million in industrial exports.  That is a very substantial figure.</P>
    <P>The Government are throwing away the opportunity of vital exports to many Third World countries.  They are downgrading agricultural development and creating a situation in which farmers will not be prepared to consider increasing their production.  This situation is being brought about by reason of the taxation system and of the run down by the Government of agricultural development.</P>
    <P>We are spending millions of pounds in trying to find oil off our coast but even if we find the oil it may not be a viable proposition because of the high cost of extraction and the somewhat depressed state of the market.  On the other hand, we are not providing the wherewithal for the development of our cattle herds and sheep flocks.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> We have the technology and the management skills to enable us to increase production in terms of our cattle herds and sheep flocks.  Markets to cater for increased production are guaranteed within the terms of the Common Agricultural Policy. I am only asking why we do not concentrate all our energies and more of our resources on this type of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider another area to which there is reference in the budget, that is, <Col N="1570" /> the question of new land policy.  We have been hearing the Minister and the Minister of State talk about this subject.  If the Government are in office in 12 months' time, I expect we will be in the position still of having to ask about when the legislation on land policy will be introduced. There are many young farmers and aspiring young farmers who are much in need of land but there is a problem in regard to the underutilisation of land. Conditions which are being supported by the Government are resulting in many more farmers having to get out of farming. This trend will continue so we must ask how best we can avoid the viable farm of today becoming the marginal farm of the future.  It is important to promote land mobility by way of leasing but this presents difficulties.  We have questioned the Minister and his Minister of State as to whether a policy of land leasing will be supported, where necessary, financially and we have been told that the answer is no &mdash; a further indication of the Government's approach to agricultural development. There is need for a comprehensive coherent fiscal policy by the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Lands and the Department of Social Welfare if the land leasing scheme is to get off the ground.  At the moment some of the policies in operation are hostile to the implementation of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>There is need for an attractive retirement scheme for farmers, and this is something that must be considered.  I wish to emphasise the importance of retaining the Land Commission and the powers of the commission.  They have served the country well during the years and they have ensured that land is retained for those trained to work it.  An important matter we must not overlook is that in the past 12 months 50 per cent of the land that came on the market was purchased by non-farmers.  That figure must be considered carefully in the context of the powers of the Land Commission. We must have a land leasing system on a one-to-one basis rather than having land bought by wealthy people who are not farmers.  We must ensure that this matter is supervised and ensure that the <Col N="1571" /> safeguards included in the 1980 White Paper on land policy are maintained.</P>
    <P>The most important economic objective is to reduce our balance of payments deficit.  We can do that by increasing the volume and the value of exports and the quickest way to do that is by raising the output of our greatest industry, namely, agriculture.  In this way the benefits will accrue not merely to the farmers but to the entire nation.  The potential is there provided we have the political will.  Our policies during the years have ensured that the potential exists for expansion of the industry and I appeal to the Government to continue with those policies. They provided the investment needed to build up the infrastructure for Irish agriculture to a level where its full potential could be realised.  In addition, these policies gave hope to the men on the land and to those employed in the food processing industries; but, unfortunately, all these approaches have been belittled by this Government in their policies with regard to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The EEC is having a major impact on our way of life and on our incomes, not only with regard to agriculture but also with regard to the entire economy.  I urge the Government to support the Commission's proposals at the Council of Ministers to increase funds for financing European common policies.  I have in mind particularly the proposal to raise the existing ceiling of 1 per cent VAT in the Community's own resources.  Community expenditure could shortly reach a point that would require a greater percentage of revenue from VAT and if that is not forthcoming some policies may have to be curtailed.  Any curtailment of the Common Agricultural Policy would be particularly damaging to Irish agriculture and to our national economy.  The proposals will require a unanimous decision by the Council of Ministers and I expect the Government to take every initiative to secure a unanimous vote in favour at Council level.  The proposals will also need a three-fifths majority in the European Parliament and I trust the Government will use their influence to secure a favourable outcome there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" /> We have had a special debate here on the proposed milk super-levy and I do not intend to deal with that matter now. I wish to emphasise that the super-levy would penalise unfairly the smaller and weaker Irish industries for problems directly caused by larger and better-off farmers in Europe.  I hope the Minister, supported by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will do everything possible to ensure that we secure a full exemption until the average milk yield here is equal to that of the European average.</P>
    <P>This must be done and, if we do not succeed, the blame can be laid fairly and squarely at the door of this Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture because of their policies at home with regard to agricultural development and their lack of credibility at the negotiating table of the Council of Ministers. We must be seen to give leadership to these councils as we have in the past.  I hope for a co-ordinated approach by the Government, fully supportive of the Minister for Agriculture in the negotiations. If we fail here, we fail not alone agriculture but our economy.  We will fail also to give leadership to our people.  Above all, we shall be ensuring that the legacy being given to us by the present Government will continue.  They have beaten a hasty retreat from agriculture and from rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>1983 was a good year for farming in Ireland.  We had the highest growth in real incomes in the whole of the European Economic Community.  Listening to Deputy Noonan, one would not think that that was the case.  The growth in real incomes in 1983 was 3½ per cent, whereas some countries suffered a serious decline &mdash; West Germany, for instance, suffered a decline of approximately 20 per cent in real farm incomes.  It was a considerable achievement to show a growth in incomes when virtually every other country in Europe was registering a decline, significant in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall reply to a few points made by Deputy Noonan.  He talks about the <Col N="1573" /> imposition of penal levies by this Government. I should like to point out that these levies were originally imposed by a Fianna Fáil Administration in 1979, when farming was in the throes of a dreadful depression.  They were imposed at approximately twice the rate of the current levies.  Therefore, it is not correct to talk about an imposition.  The proper expression would be a reintroduction of levies which have existed for some years from 1979.</P>
    <P>The veterinary inspection fees are not levies; they are fees to cover the cost of inspections at meat factories.  They have been there for a great many years and are not a new imposition.  They cover only 70 per cent of the cost of veterinary inspections in those factories.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan spoke about the dismal failure of this Government in the talks on the proposed milk super-levy.  I should like to point out that the original Commission proposal of July 1983 was that milk production in every member state would be tied to the 1981 level of production, plus 1 per cent.  The latest offer made by the Greek Presidency at the Athens summit meeting early in December was that Ireland be allowed to produce milk at the 1983 level, plus 10 per cent.  Since that Athens meeting I have not met one farmer in the whole of this country who had anything but praise for the Government's negotiating tactics at those talks and I have yet to hear one. That was a startling improvement on the original proposal.  However, as the House knows, we stated that it was not acceptable to us.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, let me point out that a number of countries have vehemently opposed our getting an exemption of any description.  They opposed that final offer made by the Greeks at that Athens summit meeting.  Those talks resume next Monday in the Council of Agricultural Ministers in Brussels.  I want to re-emphasise that there is nothing but praise for the manner in which we have conducted those talks to date.  We intend to continue our resolute stand with regard to our opposition to the Commission's proposal.</P>
    <P>Has Deputy Noonan forgotten that a <Col N="1574" /> Fianna Fáil Government of the 1977-1981 period introduced a resource tax and a 2 per cent levy on farm commodities which was just about the most unpopular move that was made against our farming community and agriculture in modern times. Of course, that 2 per cent levy had to be abandoned.  The Deputy talks about the recent budget having done nothing for agriculture: it has done a lot for agriculture. It certainly did not set out to penalise people producing agricultural commodities, as did the resource tax and the 2 per cent levy.</P>
    <P>We have on our hands at present, where the economy is concerned, a much tougher battle than the Fianna Fáil administration had from 1977 to 1981; but they were the people who imposed the penal taxes and penal levies.  We did not impose any additional capital taxation on agriculture in the recent budget. However, Deputy Noonan has been advocating a land tax, at a time when farmers are extremely sensitive about their whole future because of the attempts by some of our fellow members in the EEC to dismantle the Common Agricultural Policy.  This is not the time to talk about introducing additional capital taxation or land tax.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that Deputy Noonan's Leader, Deputy Haughey, contradicted his agricultural spokesman last week and said that no land tax would be introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government.  He had to do so: the reaction of the farming community and the farming organisations was so intense there had to be a retraction. Politically, it was highly unpopular, economically, it was highly undesirable.  I am glad to note that the Opposition leader has placed the matter in abeyance.</P>
    <P>I do not know from where Deputy Noonan gets his information about disenchantment among the farming community. The farming community are relatively happy in these very tough times.  In 1983 they did quite well.  I noticed in today's opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> that one of the groups most satisfied with the Government's performance was the farming community.  That is the best evidence available to me.  If Deputy Noonan has some other magical secret source as <Col N="1575" /> to the disenchantment or otherwise of the farming community we would all be intrigued to hear about it.  But that opinion poll speaks for itself.  It verifies what I have said about the reasonably good year our farmers had in 1983, about the rise in their real incomes.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the milk super-levy controversy for a moment, I did say that the negotiations recommence next Monday. We hope there will be a successful conclusion to these talks at the March summit. It is essential that we reach a solution at that meeting of Heads of State in March because, as we all know, the Community has run out of money.  Over the past three weeks we have seen the effects of this when the Community has made some very serious proposals regarding cuts in spending in agriculture.  If there is not agreement in March I am afraid the cuts we have seen will constitute the tip of the iceberg only, that there will be considerably more serious and harsher cuts because the money just is not there. However, if we do reach agreement on the super-levy proposal it will mean a cut-back in the amount of milk produced and particularly the amount of milk paid for.  Therefore, we shall not have to have the all-round type of cuts which would follow automatically if that summit collapsed.</P>
    <P>Worst of all, if that summit were to collapse there is a fear that the super-levy proposal might be abandoned completely. I use the word &ldquo;fear&rdquo; in a very deliberate manner because, if the super-levy proposal does not go through, the alternative will be much worse.  The alternative mentioned is a direct cut in prices which would have far more serious repercussions for this country than anything else, far more serious implications. Therefore, we are concerned that the production of milk in Europe be curtailed but we are insistent that we should not suffer as a result.  That has been our stand all along and will continue to be our stand.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful of a satisfactory outcome to that March summit.  I might say that the Athens summit did not collapse just because of disagreement over the milk <Col N="1576" /> super-levy proposal.  There was not agreement on any point at the Athens summit, whether they were financial guidelines, future financing of the Community, the British budgetary refund or the accession of Spain and Portugal &mdash; there was not agreement on any one of those five major points.  Therefore, it is incorrect to say that that summit failed because of disagreement over the milk super-levy proposal.  It was a component only of the overall disagreement.</P>
    <P>Another point on which I want to correct Deputy Noonan is his amazing statement about the Government spending millions of pounds on the extraction of oil off our coasts.  The Government do not involve themselves not alone in extraction but even in exploration for oil. That job is done by oil companies who operate under licence from the Government, but there is no cost to the Government. That was an incredible statement. I could not believe an Opposition spokesman could be so ill-informed.  And we have not even reached the point of extraction; we are still exploring.  Hopefully the find off the Waterford coast will be commercial and, if it is, we shall start thinking about extraction, but even then the Government will not be involved in contributing to its cost.  That is a matter purely for the oil company concerned.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficult economic climate there have been significant and favourable developments in the national economy and finances in 1983.  Inflation fell from over 17 per cent in 1982 to 10½ per cent in 1983.  The high balance of payments deficit was very substantially reduced last year.  Industrial exports grew by some 14 per cent in volume terms, while manufacturing output increased by some 6 per cent.  The overall Exchequer borrowing requirements as a proportion of GNP fell by more than 3 percentage points and, as a result of Government action in the last two budgets, has now been brought back below the 1979 levels.</P>
    <P>These favourable developments have also been evident in the agricultural sector. Gross agricultural output increased by some 3 per cent in volume terms to stand at its highest ever level.  This was facilitated by growth in cattle, milk, <Col N="1577" /> sheep and pig output.  As a result of increased input usage, net agricultural output increased by about 1 per cent. Allowing for other farming expenses and subsidies, total farm incomes increased by over 11 per cent in nominal terms and by about 1 per cent in real terms.  Adjusting for movement in the labour force, <i>per capita</i> real farm incomes increased by some 3½ to 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>1983 represents a second year of growth in gross and net agricultural output while farm incomes have increased each year since 1980 in nominal terms and since 1981 in real terms.</P>
    <P>Despite these improvements in the national economy and finances, we continue to face an uphill battle.  The steps taken to rectify the public finances during the past year were necessitated by the excesses of earlier years and must be followed through by a continuation of greater discipline in public expenditure, reduction in borrowing and the eventual elimination of the current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>After two decades of considerable economic growth, the years since 1980 have seen a virtual standstill in the economy. Our population has grown by almost 4 per cent so that GNP per person in this country has declined by 4 per cent over the past three years.</P>
    <P>In the face of the declining national incomes per head it is not surprising that there has been a sharp and extremely worrying increase in unemployment.  The underlying trend in unemployment is still upward and we must all be seriously concerned at the consequences of this trend unless it can be reversed very soon.  We will, however, only succeed in sustaining our present level of employment and creating new jobs if the growth in production costs is brought down below the level prevailing in competing countries.  The Government's policies are designed to do this.  This means that we must achieve a substantial reduction in the level of annual price increases from the present 10 per cent so far this year to a level of around 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The reduction will have to be achieved in spite of the difficulties we face in reducing our current budget deficit and in the <Col N="1578" /> trends in exchange rates, particularly against the dollar.</P>
    <P>As well as the considerable progress in reducing inflation in the past year we have also made great strides in reducing our balance of payments deficit.  The estimated outturn for 1983 was under £400 million compared with over £1,400 million just two years ago.  While this improvement is most welcome, it has to be accepted that it is due in considerable measure to the present recession, and renewed growth at home could well lead to a substantial disimprovement in the external trade situation.</P>
    <P>At the same time the national Exchequer position continues to give rise to serious concern.  The budget deficits of recent years meant that we had to resort to borrowing from abroad on an extensive scale.  This in turn has created a large commitment to repayments over the coming years.  Between now and the end of this decade we will have to find in excess of £1,000 million a year to finance the repayments of external Government debt without allowing for any addition that may arise from any new debt or refinancing over the intervening years.  I have seen comments that the problems of the Exchequer are only a matter of bookkeeping and that in some way that means they can be ignored.  This attitude is a deliberate and unscrupulous deception. Just as any household or any commercial firm cannot go on running up large debts and expect a continuous subvention from the local bank manager without any regard to meeting his demands for repayment, we cannot as a society go on living way beyond our means and expect foreign bankers to go on supporting us.  The plain fact of the matter is that we will only get their support as long as we can continue to improve the external trade situation and pursue domestic budgetary policies that will reduce further our reliance on external funding.  As the Minister for Finance indicated in his budget speech, borrowing, especially foreign borrowing, has been reduced and the growth in public expenditure, which has been the core of our fiscal problems for a decade, has been curbed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" /> There are in practice two overriding issues which need to be given absolute priority if the economy in general and agriculture in particular is to recover from the very serious financial situation of the past four years.</P>
    <P>The first of these priorities is to reduce inflation to a level that would ensure that we maintain competitiveness on export markets and that the incomes both of farmers and those in other occupations are at least maintained in real terms. After the favourable developments of the mid-seventies many sectors, and especially the agricultural sector, have seen a considerable fall in their income since early 1979.  This has arisen from the ravages of inflation.  In the case of farmers the prices they received for their products over the past four years have been eroded by the rapid increases in the prices they paid both for their production inputs and for the consumer products on which they spend their net family incomes.</P>
    <P>Obviously in the face of such a situation the desired expansion of agricultural output is not attainable.  The reduction of inflation is, therefore, a critical element of any policy measures which are taken to raise farm output.  It is evident that, over the next few years at least, farm price improvements from the normal annual price fixing arrangements of the EEC will be restricted.  In these circumstances the real prices of agricultural products received by farmers can be maintained only if the sharp downward trend in inflation over the past year is sustained.  I might point out, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that as well as speaking about the proposed milk super-levy on Monday next we will also be having initial discussions on 1984 farm price proposals. Those price proposals do not make very happy reading but we could hardly expect otherwise when the financial situation in the community is so difficult. Nevertheless, we will be demanding an increase on the proposals which have been put before us.  There are no increases at all proposed in some sectors such as milk and cereals and very minimal proposals in other areas.  However, I am <Col N="1580" /> sure we will be supported by many other countries who also find the position unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Policies to counter inflation are, however, not easy options.  They can only be achieved if difficult and unpopular fiscal and monetary policies are pursued relentlessly. In this pursuit it is inevitable that all sectors, including agriculture itself, will have to bear the burden.  This burden should not be more onerous on farmers than it is on other sectors, but they cannot escape it altogether.</P>
    <P>The second priority in both our agricultural policy and economic policy generally must be that of improving the economic efficiency of production in Ireland. In the case of agriculture the contribution to the economy and the level of farm incomes enjoyed by farmers and their families are determined to a major extent by the level of efficiency achieved at farm level.</P>
    <P>A major improvement in farm efficiency requires a deliberate and concentrated effort by the farmers themselves and by the Government agencies involved.  In particular the focus must inevitably be on the programme and achievements of ACOT.  It is essential that the advisory and educational work of ACOT be specifically orientated towards securing a substantial improvement in efficiency at farm level.  This objective must be brought to the forefront of the policies pursued by farmers on their own farms.  The aim of the business policies pursued by individual farmers must be to achieve higher net incomes through a more efficient use of the basic resources which are available.  This would secure not only a better income for the farmer and his family but also a greater contribution by the agricultural sector to our national economy.</P>
    <P>An improvement in efficiency will require in many cases the adoption of a suitable development plan.  The adoption of such a plan will not in itself, however, automatically generate greater efficiency. It is the achievement of greater efficiency, where necessary through the adoption of a development plan.  Which is of overriding importance.  This primary objective should never be lost sight of in <Col N="1581" /> the policies pursued in the agricultural sector.  Unless this objective can be realised the contribution of agriculture to the Irish economy will decline, the farm labour force will fall further and the return to the large investments made over the past decade will never be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>If we are to overcome the economic problems that now confront us we must have an honest evaluation of the resources available for new developments. Long lists of demands which have no regard to the availability of resources are a positive handicap to generating the realistic development of our national economy.  There are no difficulties in suggesting programmes and ways in which money can be spent.  The need is to generate the vast amounts of resources required to finance these programmes. Our primary commitment to national development should be a commitment to generating additional resources, not to finding additional ways of dissipating what we have today.</P>
    <P>The argument that we have to have large spending programmes in order to achieve worthwhile national growth is a fallacy.  Unfortunately, that was the policy which was pursued from 1977 to 1981 with such disastrous results.  If large-scale Exchequer expenditure were the way to increased national prosperity, we would not be in our present economic predicament. Digging holes and filling them up again was not a very clever economic policy.  Indeed, given the scale of public expenditure over recent years we would have few economic problems left to resolve.  But sadly that is not the case.</P>
    <P>In the context of the very difficult financial situation facing the Government I am satisfied that the amount allocated this year for agriculture is reasonable. For some Departments the 1984 allocations are at or below the 1983 figure. Others show some increase on the 1983 figure.  Agriculture falls into the latter group.</P>
    <P>The gross allocation for 1984 at almost £370 million is 10 per cent higher than 1983 and the net allocation at £263 million is some 2 per cent above 1983.  That seems to have been missed by Deputy <Col N="1582" /> Noonan.  These figures reflect the fact that all schemes or aids aimed at increasing productivity and at mitigating the effects of the recession on the farming sector have been retained and adequately funded in 1984.  In addition to the sums published in the Estimate, the Government as a budgetary measure are providing an extra £5.8 million for agriculture, £5.7 million of this is for the continuation of the AI and lime subsidy schemes to the end of this year.  These schemes first came into operation in 1981 and have been instrumental in raising inseminations to their present annual level of over 1,300,000 and lime usage to over two million tonnes.  Under existing EEC regulations the schemes are due to expire at the end of April but it is my intention to seek their extension.  The continuation of the subsidies for those schemes comes up for consideration in the context of the discussions on prices in Brussels and we will be seeking their retention.  I am hopeful that we will be successful.  The artificial insemination scheme in particular has been one of the most successful schemes ever introduced here and we are particularly keen that it be retained.</P>
    <P>The balance of £100,000 is being provided as aid for the potato industry.  We are all aware of the difficulties facing the industry and clearly there is a need for improvement in the presentation and marketing of the product if we are to compete effectively with imports.  The object of the aid is to encourage producers to rationalise the industry and in this regard moves are already afoot to establish a national potato co-operative.  There have been major difficulties in the potato industry since 1980 when our status as a plant disease free zone was eliminated by a direction from the EEC and we now have to allow imports of potatoes.  That has caused immense difficulties for our potato industry because the imported potatoes were better presented than the Irish products and our potato growers lost a sizeable proportion of the market. In 1982 the value of potatoes in processed or unprocessed form amounted to £25 million.  I heard Deputy Noonan complaining about £100,000 being inadequate, but this is the first time any <Col N="1583" /> Government have made an attempt to put our potato industry on a sound footing. The protection our potato growers had up to 1980 is gone.  In 1980 and 1981 Deputy Noonan's Government made no attempt to put our potato market on a sound footing.  Therefore, I fail to see how he can complain about the inadequacy of a sum when his own Government did not even provide a penny.</P>
    <P>There is much public disquiet at the level of potato imports and food imports generally.  A figure of £750 million is often quoted as representing the current annual value of foodstuffs imported.  I can go along with that figure but it is important to distinguish between food imports which might be considered absolutely necessary and those which could be substituted by home production.</P>
    <P>It is of interest to examine the composition of the £750 million of imports to which I have referred.  One hundred and fifty million pounds worth is accounted for by live animals, meat and meat preparations, £130 million by cereals and cereal preparations, £120 million by tea, coffee, sugar and sugar preparation, £110 million by feedingstuffs for animals and £90 million by fish, dairy, poultry and other products.  The balance of £150 million relates to vegetable and fruit imports.  Of the total of £750 million an analysis undertaken in my Department estimates that £200 million is substitutable by home production and £50 million of this latter sum would relate to vegetables and fruit.</P>
    <P>The public have the erroneous impression that we import £750 million worth of fruit and vegetables and it is assumed that all this food could be produced at home but that is not the case.  Only about £200 million could be produced here.  I do not mean to be derisory when I say only £200 million could be grown at home because that is a vast amount of money and we must do everything possible to produce as much as possible of that food at home. Setting up the potato co-operative is a step in the right direction and perhaps steps will be taken to set up fruit and vegetables co-operatives to combat these imports.  As I said, the bulk of these items <Col N="1584" /> cannot be produced at home.  I know they have a beautiful climate in west Cork but they cannot grow bananas or oranges and that point is not taken into consideration. Of that £750 million, £550 million could not be produced at home and that point is often ignored or not understood.</P>
    <P>I consider that there are reasons why imports of foodstuffs which might appear capable of substitution by home-produced goods have been taking place. Firstly, our agricultural industry is based to a very high degree on the output of livestock and livestock products and in consequence tillage and other crops are of less importance.  The second factor is the seasonality of supplies from the Irish agricultural sector.  This has tended to hinder the sustained development of a domestic processing sector as well as necessitating the importation of certain out-of-season fresh products.  The third reason is the limited size of the Irish consumer market.  That is a very important point which is very often ignored.  It often happens that continental countries, like France, produce vast quantities of certain commodities and when they have an oversupply it suits them to sell that overproduction to Ireland and other countries at a very low price and that kills the indigenous industries.  I am thinking particularly of the apple industry which has taken a terrible beating in the past ten years, largely because the French are producing a vast quantity of apples which they sell at dirt cheap prices.  It is very difficult to prove a case of dumping in the European Court.</P>
    <P>The size of the Irish consumer market has also tended to discourage the development of a comprehensive food processing sector here, leaving many areas of our consumer market to be supplied as an adjunct to the British market by British or multinational firms.  Fourthly, is the reluctance of Irish food manufacturers, resulting to a considerable extent from the size of the home market, to develop new products to cater for changing consumer tastes and economic circumstances. Fifthly, is the high level in recent years of Irish production costs; and the final factor is the lack of overall strategy among producers, manufacturers <Col N="1585" /> and wholesalers for the regulation of supply and the marketing of their goods on the domestic market.  It is only in the context of such strategy that supply contracts with the retail outlets, particularly supermarkets, can be won and competition from overseas suppliers overcome.</P>
    <P>In considering the total foodstuffs imports of £750 million we must not lose sight of the fact that we are also a large exporter of foodstuffs.  Our current exports exceed £1,500 million per annum.  In other words, we export exactly twice as much food as we import.  The bulk of the imports and exports are with other EEC countries.  Our membership of the EEC involve us in a free trade situation and our food imports must be viewed in that context.  We get this stupid argument from time to time that we should stop importing potatoes, apples and vegetables, but we cannot do that. We hear about the obstructionist tactics of the French and we are asked why we cannot adopt similar tactics.  We are in a very vulnerable position within the EEC because we export twice as much food as we import.  If we were to get involved in a dirty tricks campaign to stop food imports, retaliatory measures could be taken which could decimate our food industry.  It is not a very clever idea for people who are net exporters of food to be tampering with food imports.  The disgraceful episode we saw in Dundalk last year when potatoes were dumped overboard from an importing firm did not do any good for our name in Europe.  We are too dependent on our exports to be fooling around like that.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, unilateral action to limit foodstuffs imports would be impractical and indeed very unwise.  Our ability to substitute for imports with home-produced products is clearly limited, but it would appear to me that there is great potential for increasing our exports of foodstuffs by specialising in those areas where we have a competitive advantage. The success of the Government in reducing inflation will be of benefit in this regard.  Our overall interests might in the long run best be served by concentrating on maximising our exports of feedingstuffs <Col N="1586" /> particularly those which have been processed.</P>
    <P>All of us have already heard and read a great deal about the current debate on the future of the EEC.  That debate is an extremey wide one and goes far beyond the issues most frequently commented on in this country.  In fact, it springs from the growing and deeply felt need to relaunch the Community, to give it a new impetus, a new dynamism and a place in the world commensurate with its real economic weight.</P>
    <P>That was the spirit in which the Heads of State and Government looked at the Community's future when they met in Stuttgart last June.  The outcome of that meeting was that the European Commission was asked to examine the problems facing the Community and to make such proposals as were deemed necessary.  The Commission was to concentrate its work on certain specified areas.  These were the review of existing policies including the Common Agricultural Policy, the development of new policies, the future financing of the Community, the accession of Spain and Portugal and the budgetary contributions of member states.  As Minister for Agriculture, I am primarily concerned with two of these policy areas, namely, the review of the Common Agricultural Policy and the future financing of the Community.  Needless to say, both of these problems are closely linked, since the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy is responsible for almost two-thirds of the entire spending of the Community.</P>
    <P>That is an interesting point that often attracts people's imagination, or their ire, or whatever you wish.  They ask: &ldquo;Why do you spend so much time in Brussels discussing agriculture?  What about other things like health, education, social welfare and industry?&rdquo;  The fact of the matter is that the Common Agricultural Policy is the only fully developed policy the Community has.  We have a regional policy and a social policy, but they are not fully developed.  They are not comprehensive. We spend so much time on agriculture because over two-thirds of all the money in the Community is spent on agriculture.  So it is rather imperative that <Col N="1587" /> we make sure we get as much of that as we can.  Hence the length of time we spend debating agriculture particularly at this time of the year when the price negotiations commence.</P>
    <P>To deal with the financial problem first, it is true to say that for some time past the Community has been very preoccupied with its financial resources and the prospect of an inadequate budget in the fact of ever-increasing costs.  That preoccupation or fear was justified as the recent deterioration in the Community's finances shows.  The fact is that on the basis of current estimates the Community budget for 1984 will be insufficient to meet expenditure on the operation of existing policies, let alone the development of new policies or other unforeseen expenditure.  The Community has, in effect, reached the limit of its current revenue resources.  This is why the Commission has been obliged already this year to introduce certain unpalatable changes in the management of the Common Agricultural Policy in order to cut back expenditure and live within its budget.</P>
    <P>It is clear then that the situation confronting the Community and its future financing is a very serious one, and it would be foolish to ignore that background in considering the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I think this factor is too often overlooked or not fully appreciated.  In fact, it is at the heart of the Community's problems.  Indeed, if the Community is again to regain the momentum of economic development that it enjoyed in its formative years, it is vital that a satisfactory solution is found to its future financing.  Because of the fundamental nature of the issues involved and their implications for the future of the Community and its member states, the current negotiations are the most complex and far-reaching ones for this country since we joined the Community 11 years ago.</P>
    <P>The financing of the Community is rather complex and very often not fully understood.  Some of the finance is obtained from customs duties, but the bulk of the finance is obtained from the <Col N="1588" /> revenue of 1 per cent of the proceeds of VAT in each member state.  That source of revenue proved to be quite sufficient up to last year but, towards the end of 1983, the Community started to run out of money.  The ceiling of the Community's income was reached and expenditure was beginning to outstrip income. That means there must be a restructuring of the Community's financing.  In other words, the contributions to the Community's budget must be increased.</P>
    <P>The proposal put forward by the Commission last July was that the proceeds from VAT should be increased from 1 per cent to 1.4 per cent.  We welcomed that because we are a net beneficiary from the Community.  The more money there is in it, the better it is for us.  The Greeks went a little further than the Commission and proposed that the VAT contribution should be increased to 1.8 per cent.  That was better still for us.  By nature we are a very greedy nation and the more they provide the better we like it.  When I say we are a very greedy nation I mean we are a very greedy race.</P>
    <P>That increase has not been agreed upon because the net contributors to the Community budget have said they will not increase their contributions unless spending is brought under control, and specifically unless spending in the agricultural sector is brought under control, and more specifically still unless surpluses in the agricultural sector are eliminated or significantly reduced.  Hence the proposed milk super-levy.  The British and the Germans in particular who are the main net contributors to the Community's budget are adamant that they will not increase their contributions until such time as there is a restructuring of the Common Agricultural Policy, in other words, that the production of certain commodities is brought under very rigid control.</P>
    <P>The general thrust of the Commission's proposals was to impose stricter controls on the Common Agricultural Policy and in particular to curb the growth of surplus production through a more restrictive market policy and through measures designed to reducing the cost of the Community's agricultural expenditure.  In its <Col N="1589" /> report, the Commission recognised the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy to the development of the Community as well as the special characteristics of agriculture.  It also stressed the need to adapt agricultural policy to the conditions which now prevail and to ensure the most efficient use of the available financial resources.  It pointed out that the problem of over-production of certain products &mdash; notable milk and cereals &mdash; was of critical concern given the limited market outlets available and the burden which the disposal of surplus production places on the Community's budget.</P>
    <P>I think that no one would quibble greatly with the Commission's general assessment of the difficulties confronting the Common Agricultural Policy.  It has to be acknowledged that some changes of the policy are inevitable and that some sacrifices will have to be made to ensure its survival.  It is certainly not in Ireland's interest that the future operation of the Common Agricultural Policy should be jeopardised by the chaos that could develop if the necessary measures are not taken to deal with the current problems. Our apporach to the debate then has been to ensure that the basic elements of the Common Agricultural Policy are preserved, that its principles are maintained, and that any measures to rationalise the policy or solve its problems are non-discriminatory, fair and equitable not only between member states and regions but also between different categories of farmers. This is where we take issue with some of the proposals put forward by the commission, and especially the proposed super-levy on milk.</P>
    <P>Community milk production has been increasing rapidly and this has resulted in a massive build-up of stocks of butter and skim milk powder.  There are now about a million tonnes of skim milk powder and some three quarters of a million tonnes of butter in intervention stocks.  At the same time there has been a marked deterioration in the world market for these products, and there is no real commercial market available for much of them.  The Community is thus faced with major problems in the disposal of its dairy <Col N="1590" /> stocks at the same time as it is faced with a critical financial situation.  The Commission's proposals envisage a fundamental change in the operation of the system for milk by providing for the imposition of a super-levy on the production exceeding the 1981 level plus 1 per cent.  This super-levy would work out at about 70p per gallon in Ireland.  We accept that corrective action is needed to curb the growth in the Community's milk production, but as I have said any such action must be fair and just, and must take account of the level of development of the dairying industry in the different regions of Community.  The super-levy would discriminate against our producers, would freeze our milk production, would impede or halt development in dairying and have extremely serious effects on our whole economy.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is of major importance for our economic and social progress, not only for rural areas but for the entire country.  In this country the milk industry is five times more important to the economy than in the Community generally and average milk yields here are some 20 per cent behind the EEC average. It was for these reasons that the Government have been strongly opposing the Commission super-levy proposal. I have been gratified by the recognition for Ireland's special position, expressed by many of our partners in the lead-up to the Athens Summit.  However, the matter was not resolved at the Summit and we shall be having tough and difficult discussions on it in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the operation of the bovine TB eradication scheme.  This scheme commenced almost 30 years ago and despite all the criticism it has been reasonably successful.  When it started 17 per cent of cattle were affected by TB. The present incidence is 0.2 per cent, a very considerable reduction, and it is incorrect to say that the scheme has been a failure.  However, I am not satisfied with the rate of progress in eliminating the disease.  The level of eradication has barely decreased in recent years.  Considering what we are spending such a massive amount of money, we cannot be satisfied with that.  As announced <Col N="1591" /> recently, I am re-examining the whole strategy involved and I would hope that as a result we would come up with some new ideas to achieve a further decrease.</P>
    <P>I have set a target of reducing the incidence amongst herds to less than 1 per cent in three years' time.  The incidence in animals is 0.2 per cent but the incidence in herds is 2.6 per cent.  I want to reduce the incidence from 2.6 per cent to less than 1 per cent.  That is a reasonable goal and with the co-operation of everybody involved, farmers, veterinarians and the Department of Agriculture, we can achieve that target.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with measures to encourage on-farm investment.  In this regard the Government have provided the sum of £37.6 million to be expended in 1984 on the farm modernisation scheme, the western drainage scheme, the programme for western development and the EEC interest subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>The farm modernisation scheme which implements EEC Directive 72/159 on the modernisation of farms was introduced here in 1974.  The scheme has provided a comprehensive framework of grant aid towards capital expenditure on farm development works.  Since its inception over 105,000 farmers have participated in the scheme and over £255 million has been disbursed in grant aid.</P>
    <P>Following the suspension of grant aid for buildings and fixed assets in February, 1983, a detailed reappraisal of the farm modernisation scheme was undertaken with the object of introducing revised guidelines to ensure that the scheme would operate in the most productive and efficient manner possible.  Submissions were considered from many organisations connected with the Agriculture industry.  In carrying out the review my Department were conscious of the criteria and conditions laid down in EEC directive 73/159 under which investment in farm development may be assisted. Accordingly any proposal for changes in the scheme outside the framework of Directive 72/159 could not be considered.</P>
    <P>In considering the grant levels and scope of the revised scheme it has been necessary to try to balance the need for <Col N="1592" /> agricultural investment with the availability of Exchequer resources at a time of severe financial difficulty.  Accordingly it is necessary to concentrate resources in the most essential forms of investment. The highest priority is the provision of suitable housing for livestock.  As many as 2 million cattle are outwintered in Ireland.  This results in a considerable reduction in the economic return from the national herd.  In some cases also, outwintering causes severe damage to land through poaching &mdash; land which may well have been improved with the aid of Exchequer resources.  In the circumstances the emphasis in the revised scheme is on basic livestock housing.</P>
    <P>The principal feature of the revised scheme introduced on 3 January 1984 are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The standard costings used to determine the level of investment to be grant-aided have been increased substantially.</P>
    <P>(b)  The range of structures and fixed assets eligible for grant-aid has been revised to put the main emphasis on livestock housing.</P>
    <P>(c)  The &ldquo;Other-Low&rdquo; category has been excluded because of the need to channel scarce resources into the most productive areas as well as the desirability of encouraging older farmers to hand over their farms to their heirs.</P>
    <P>(d)  In the case of commercial farmers aid will be by way of interest subsidy, equivalent to a grant rate of 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>(e)  For development and &ldquo;Other High&rdquo; farmers the rates of grant are being reduced by five percentage points in the case of farm buildings and an average of about fifteen percentage points in the case of land improvements.</P>
    <P>Certain elements of the farm modernisation scheme which were discontinued last year are not being reintroduced. These are grants for mobile equipment, guidance premiums, grants for keeping farm accounts, and the group fodder scheme.  Grants for tourists and craft projects and for incremental livestock are also being eliminated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this motion I draw the attention of the House to a number of interesting statements made by the Labour Party, of which the Minister for Health is a member, when they were seeking re-election to the Dáil. In a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 10 December 1982 the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, stated he wished to emphasise the difference between Labour and the two major parties.  He said it was not enough to sit back and allow the poor to be penalised by the policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Labour, he said, represented ordinary working people, not big business, big farmers or land speculators.  He indicated the inherent cowardice of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in failing to broaden the tax base and deal with inherited wealth.  The manifesto also stated that both main parties looked to the health service as a soft target for cuts, hitting basic services while leaving abuses and profiteering unchecked.  Deputy Spring went on to <Col N="1595" /> propose a comprehensive national health service, a phased extension of the GMS service to encourage a real switch from institutional to community care, doctors in the GMS to be paid by capitation rather than on a fee per item basis and also to end the State subsidy for private hospitals.  They estimated this would save in the region of £20 million.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the development of the Coalition policies in relation to health that they have, by and large, abandoned those objectives.  The health services were started on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  They were mainly won as concessions to the less well off.  They have been developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and are now being cut back on the same basis.  The services have been under attack for a number of years. The cut-backs in relation to students will save £2.5 million.  It is denying eligibility to 89,000 young people.  The drugs refund limit has been raised to £28 from £16. The embargo on filling posts in the health services is having a serious effect on services.  Only this week the dental services in the Ballymun area were seriously hit because of the embargo on the replacement of dentists.  It was necessary to send one of the two dentists to Blanchardstown.</P>
      <P>A lot of lip service is paid to young people.  We are told they are our greatest resource.  We are also told that education is essential and that we must have an educated youthful work force.  The Government are erecting barriers for young people going not only to third level education, but also to second level.  VAT was imposed on clothing and this will hit families where two or three young people are going to second level education.  Parents are trying to educate their children out of their weekly wage or perhaps out of social welfare payments.  Fee increases will be a barrier to young people entering third level education.  Now young people will not be eligible for medical cards. These are the barriers being erected against mainly working class children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one family in the Ballymun area where there are seven children.  The father is working but does not have a medical card.  They are trying to keep five <Col N="1596" /> children at school, three at second level and two at third level.  I have been trying for the past year to get the Eastern Health Board to allow this family a medical card but without success.  This cutback will hit them severely.  Probably one or two of them will have to leave school.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the Minister that this cutback will affect only the well off students in third level education.  Most of us are aware that there are many students in third level education living away from home.  In many cases they have to pay their own way to third level education and they try to avoid drawing on the meagre resources of their families.  Students who do not have a medical card will be reluctant to go to the doctor if they become ill because they will be unable to pay him.  The cut-backs will also affect many students in fifth or sixth year in secondary schools.  I urge the Minister to restore eligibility to young people and remind him of the areas where he knows savings can be made.  It is time that he as a member of the Labour Party confronted the private medical interest which has blocked the development of a national and comprehensive service.  He should confront the doctors, the pharmacists, drug companies and private hospitals. He could make savings in those areas.  He should leave young people with some possibility of continuing their education and compete in the job market in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was unable to be present last evening because during the past few days I was a member of an official Government delegation concerned with the export of health services from this country to other countries.  I fulfilled the long-standing invitation from the Ministers for Health in Kuwait and Iraq to visit those countries and meet the large number of Irish people working there.  That is the reason why I was not in the House last night.  I returned to Dublin this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Kuwait I met and saw some millionaires who are engaged in the health services.  Many Irish people work there. Is Deputy De Rossa seriously suggesting that we should provide free general medical <Col N="1597" /> service and free drugs on behalf of the taxpayers to the children of wealthy farmers and wealthy medical consultants, including some who work abroad and whose children attend second and third level education here, people he has frequently berated for not paying their fair share of taxation?  That is the nub of the issue and I must confess I find it cynically exploitative on the part particularly of The Workers' Party who time and time again come in here, pick up soft options, back the winner all the way and then try to ride two horses simultaneously because one can, on the one hand, claim there should be total universality without question and, at the same time, try to exempt people from responsibility for payment.  Effectively that is what is being done.  It is pure bandwagon nonsense.  I say so because I have respect for the intellectual ability of Deputy De Rossa and I am surprised he should descend to that kind of selective socialism, though it is not socialism at all, no more than the kind of nonsense about dentists in Ballymun affected by an embargo.  They are not affected by an embargo and the Deputy knows that.  I do not want to digress&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to the question of the embargo which allegedly will be affected, in the budget statement by the Minister for Finance the health services in terms of specific numbers were excluded from the embargo which makes a total nonsense of Deputy De Rossa's allegation.  We are working on cash limits in health services and these cash limits determine the availability of staff.  I would refer the Deputy to that particular aspect.</P>
      <P>To deal with the issues raised, the basic principle under lying the general medical services scheme and the issue of medical cards is very simple.  The system provides that persons who cannot provide &mdash; this is specific health legislation &mdash; general medical services for themselves and their dependants are provided with such services by the State without charge.  It is also written in that those who can afford to provide services for themselves without hardship will do so.  That is written into the Health Act.  It is my job as Minister to implement the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret I was not here to hear Deputy O'Rourke but, looking at the Official Report, I see a high degree of selectivity on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have looked at my own memoranda and the 1982-1983 estimates are riddled with proposals from the Department of Finance and various observations by the Department of Health and the then Minister on the question of arrangements for the withdrawal of automatic entitlement to medical cards for second and third level students.  But Deputy Dr. Woods, <Col N="1599" /> Deputy Haughey and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, seem to have forgotten that.  It is amazing how forgetful they can become.  I do not propose to elaborate on it but the anomaly of people receiving medical cards outside the income limits has been there for a number of years, and time and time again that has been brought to the attention of the Department of Finance and time and time again different Ministers for Health have had to consider the matter. The selective play to the gallery by Fianna Fáil on this issue frankly does not ring true any more than the selective observation by Deputy De Rossa tonight who would have every wealthy farmer and exceptionally wealthy businessman automatically having their children entitled to medical cards.</P>
    <P>I want now to give some of the facts. The estimated number of students in the 16 to 25 age group is approximately 120,000.  Of these some 35,000 come from families who have medical cards and the rest come from the upper middle and upper income group families who in the normal course of events provide general practitioner services for their families without hardship and have always provided them prior to their children becoming students.  As students in recent years they became entitled to medical cards. That service has now been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>An examination of the usage rate of medical services by young persons &mdash; what one might describe as young entitled adults &mdash; shows the average visiting rate to a general practitioner is only about twice a year on average.  I confess I find it difficult to believe that upper middle income and upper income families would find it an extraordinary hardship if they had to pay for two visits a year for their student children in second and third level education.  That is three times less than the ordinary medical card holder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the point that an examination of the usage rate of the GMS by young entitled adults showed the average visiting rate to a general practitioner to be less than 2.5 visits per year. This compares with an average visiting rate of six visits for the entire medical card population.  On this basis it must be concluded that the cost to a student of providing this service for himself or of having it provided by his parents is not substantial and normally should not involve hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations withdraw free general practitioner services and free drugs from persons in the 16-to-25 age group.  This means that for the future the entitlement of students automatically to these services will depend on their family circumstances and that the criterion of ability <Col N="1601" /> to pay for the service without hardship will apply to the student in the same way as it applies to everybody else in the community.  Of course a student will automatically have full entitlement if the family circumstances are such that they have a medical card.</P>
    <P>Therefore, some 35,000 students will retain their medical cards by virtue of their family circumstances.  In addition, students in receipt of disabled persons maintenance allowance will retain their entitlement to these services.  Some students will retain entitlement under EEC regulations.  Students coming to this country from EEC countries retain the entitlement of the home country while they are here.  We provide the service but it does not cost us any money because we claw back the cost from the other EEC countries.  In terms of EEC regulations we are obliged legally to provide those services.  Likewise, the same applies to students from this country who may be studying in other EEC countries.  We pay those other countries on a reciprocal basis.  Some students retain entitlement by virtue of having cover under EEC regulations.</P>
    <P>I would stress that much of the propagands and hyprocisy being indulged in in regard to this decision of the Government is emanating from USI sources and particularly from the failure of the President of the USI to explain the decision to students.  I have met him and I have met a delegation from the USI.  I have explained the decision in considerable detail but they are far more interested in a general hoo-ha about the issue than in dealing with the facts.  Students whose medical cards are being withdrawn will lose only a minor part of the services, that is, access to a GP on a free basis and access to free drugs.  That is all that is involved.  Students retain full eligibility for free hospital services, both in-patient and out-patient, including the services, free of hospital consultants.  In this regard they are in a particularly beneficial position. In the general population anyone earning more than £11,000 per year is obliged to pay for consultants' services but we have waived that obligation in relation to students.</P>

      <P>That is not so.  I read the report of Deputy O'Hanlon's speech last evening and I considered his contribution to have been measured and responsible unlike the contributions we had from Deputy O'Rourke and a few others whose object was to score political points.  What I am saying is that in-patient, out-patient and free consultancy services are available without charge to every student irrespective of his parents' income.  We are talking about what are the most expensive services within the health services.  Therefore, the question of hardship in respect of a student having to undergo an operation does not arise. Equally, I have made the point repeatedly to the USI whose president, regrettably, is more interested in having his name in the papers or in appearing on television, that where any hardship arises in relation to the delivery of medical health services, there is a clear provision that a medical card can be issued.</P>

    <P>It is not possible nor is it desirable to set out all the criteria for hardship in terms of the way in which income guidelines are expressed.  For example, if a student must attend a doctor on a regular basis and at considerable cost to his family and if he must spend a great deal <Col N="1603" /> of money on drugs and medicines on a regular basis by virtue of the severity of his medical condition, there is provision in the regulations I have signed for the chief executive officer of a health board to issue a medical card.  The CEOs will take account of the circumstances of each student by assessing applications for medical cards.  The general question of means will be considered.  As I have explained in the House and to the USI I have made specific provision in the regulations that where hardship is likely to arise the CEO of the appropriate health board will have power to make these services available without charge.  Unfortunately students are not being told the full facts.</P>
    <P>To sum up, not all students will lose medical cards.  On our estimate, 35,000 students will retain this entitlement.  This figure will include those at greatest risk of having difficulty in paying for GP services &mdash; those from lower-income families, the working class that Deputy De Rossa talks about while at the same time advocating the issuing of medical cards to everyone, irrespective of income.  That is an approach that cannot be sustained by the Government in the future.  It is the approach of selective socialism.  It is hypocrisy.  In the light of the current serious economic climate it is essential to have regard to the cost of our health services.  In the current year I do not have the money available to allow me to provide services without charge to everyone, irrespective of income.  There were many options open to me in that regard.  For instance, I could have imposed charges on those who used medical cards but I decided not to do that.  I could have provided for a charge in respect of prescriptions but I did not do so because those in the lower income group, 38 to 40 per cent of the community, have medical cards. Four out of ten people have medical cards but I decided I would not impose further financial hardship on that sector.</P>
    <P>For example, I could have decided not to increase the income guidelines for medical cards.  I would have saved money by so doing but I decided deliberately to increase the income guidelines by 10.3 <Col N="1604" /> per cent from 1 January.  This is well within the increase in the rate of inflation. I decided to use about £500,000, out of the £2,500,000 I saved on the decision in relation to universal application, to help people over 66 years.  For the first time we have given extra help to them.  They need health services and are the most vulnerable section.</P>
    <P>Instead, I withdrew limited services from a group of persons &mdash; between the ages of 16 and 25 years &mdash; who were low users of the services and who received them without regard to ability to pay.  I believe that less hardship will be caused because of the decision I have taken.  I published the arrangements in the newspapers. In the remaining few minutes I shall deal with points raised by Deputy O'Hanlon.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon pointed out the possibility that problems may arise in deciding on dependency in applications for medical cards.  I agree that problems can arise, but they can be met and I made this perfectly clear to student deputations and to party political deputations I received.  Dependency is a matter to be determined in the circumstances of each individual case.  For example, Deputy O'Hanlon spoke of a student who may be in part-time employment and financing his or her way through third level education. On the basis of that information I would be very surprised if the health board considered that the person in question was a dependant and I have no doubt that most likely the regulations would not apply.  However, it is a matter for the CEO to determine.  I have framed the regulations in as flexible a way as possible. Two students may marry and I would not regard them as being dependent on their parents.  They are a family unit in their own right and the two would apply for a medical card based on their income as a family unit.  Under the regulations I have signed most likely they would receive a medical card.</P>
    <P>I received a responsible representation from the Irish Student Health Association and I will quote one paragraph:</P>
    <P>This submission does not request <Col N="1605" /> that all third level students should automatically get medical cards irrespective of their income.</P>
    <P>That is the issue at stake.  The USI said they must get the cards but I say I cannot give them.  The submission from which I quoted was signed by H.G. Nelson, Secretary of the Irish Student Health Association from the TCD Health Centre dated 27 January, and they support me in this.  With regard to hardship cases, they ask that particular and speedy consideration be given to individual submissions under this heading and of course that will be done.  There has been a tremendous amount of propaganda about this matter and, unfortunately, many students are being misled.</P>
    <P>In the submission they state that the income of many students and their parents can deteriorate dramatically at some stage after the student has begun his or her course.  In particular, unforeseen unemployment is now affecting all socio-economic groups and they ask that health boards make arrangements to deal with students so affected.  Of course, the health boards will make speedy decisions in those cases.</P>
    <P>In the submission it is recommended that problems in the home, such as desertion and alcoholism, be taken into account when assessing the eligibility of third level students.  Of course that is done.  Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy McCarthy are members of health boards and Deputy Ormonde has for long been associated with health board employment. Where there is sudden unemployment in a family the situation with regard to medical cards will be reviewed immediately. I have included in the regulations a provision that the CEO concerned should take care of the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to a situation in Cork.  I checked on that case where a student has been involved in expenditure of £300 in respect of medical attention.  I do not doubt the Deputy's information but I must point out the situation could not have arisen as a result of my decision to withdraw automatic entitlement because no medical card has yet been withdrawn in the Southern Health Board area which covers Cork <Col N="1606" /> and Kerry.  In a hypothetical situation if a student is going to have heavy expenditure, having to visit his doctor on a regular basis and having to spend a considerable amount on drugs, and if his family has not the money to provide the funds, the CEO is empowered to provide that student with a medical card or free access to drugs.  A student will have total access to hospital consultants even if his father is earning £100,000 per year.</P>
    <P>I do not want to impose undue hardship. I am trying to be as helpful as possible. In my constituency the children of very wealthy families are dropped off at a health clinic, they go in with the medical card and get free drugs and free GP services.  There is no country in Europe providing that kind of service without charge.  There is always a qualification in each case and there is a definite controlling element in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon expressed concern about third level students living away from home in flats or digs and who may have difficulty in meeting the cost of a visit to a GP when this is required urgently.  If the circumstances of a student who does not have a medical card are such that he is in any danger of not being able to get the services, the hardship provision will come into operation. I share the concern of the Deputy that some urgent cases may fall outside the safety net.  I have indicated to the CEOs &mdash; and I will take up the matter again at the request of the Deputy &mdash; to make sure that additional safeguards are built into the system to ensure that these cases are catered for adequately.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the points raised.  I received a submission from the Irish Student Health Association on this matter. That submission will be very carefully considered.  I only wish that the representations made to me by the USI had been delivered in a rational form, instead of with stridency and hysterics.  Every time the television camera appeared, the representatives fell to the floor in total hysteria.  That does not rate serious consideration, but the submission I have received now will have my serious consideration and I shall respond to it.</P>
    <P>We must provide the best possible <Col N="1607" /> health services for our people, within the extreme limitation of our resources. These services are being provided on an in-patient and out-patient and free consultancy basis.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Chair and also my party colleague, Deputy McCarthy, for allowing me a few minutes of his time on Private Members' Business on the motion:</P>
      <P>`That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to provide General Medical Services to those between the ages of 16 and 25 years who are dependants of persons who do not have full eligibility for these services.'</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was put down by our party spokesman, Deputy O'Hanlon.  In plain terms, it concerns the decision of the Minister to remove medical cards from students.  As a doctor, I consider this a strange decision of a Minister for Health but when taken by a Labour Minister for Health, it becomes almost unbelievable. The Minister, as a Labour Party member, contested the last general election in November 1982 solely on the basis of the health cuts proposed by the previous administration.  That party's entire strategy in that election campaign was to show a desire to cater and care for the poor, the old, the young and the needy.  Their contributions to the vote of confidence which resulted in that general election were of one voice in relation to the proposed <Col N="1608" /> cuts by the then administration. The Labour Party could not wait to join forces with their Fine Gael colleagues to implement their social policies.  One of their demands for participation in Government was that the responsibility for health and social welfare should rest with the Labour Party, so that they could cater and care for the poor and needy. What was the Minister's first action when elected Minister for Health?  He removed the medical cards from the pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have been forewarned of what was to come, but little did we know that the students, who apparently have no voting potential whatsoever, were the next to be hit.  On that same confidence motion in 1982, the Minister's party and Cabinet colleague, Deputy Quinn, criticised the Government of the day for taking the soft option and removing certain drugs and bandages from the GMS list, on the basis that these people did not contribute to election campaigns.  At least, we left them with their medical cards, which is more than we can say for the Minister or his Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister in that same debate said that we must maintain basic Exchequer moneys and taxation to ensure that the best standards of health care are available to those in need.  He went on to say that we must ensure that taxation moneys are maintained to put greater emphasis on preventive medicine and community health programmes.  Does he believe that the best way to have preventive medicine is not to make it available to anybody?  Is the Minister suggesting that grant-aided students are not in need, that they have money to burn?  We all know the difficulties of these people at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has claimed, and the Book of Estimates confirms, that there will be a saving, mark you, of £2.5 million <Col N="1609" /> by this exercise.  He has not to date explained how this will come about.  As a doctor attached to a general hospital let me give some of the hard facts.  It is well known that students are among the healthiest of our population, rarely going to see their doctor.  To set an average at 2.5 per cent is nonsensical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is taken from the medical claims figures.  It is a computer read-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way that one can average such things out.  Of the small minority who do require medical assistance, what will they do now?  If they are fortunate enough to reside in a town with a general hospital &mdash; and the majority of students will be within easy reach of such a hospital, if one takes into account the regional technical colleges and the universities &mdash; they will go to the casualty department or out-patient department of that hospital.  Where will the saving arise there?  Not only will there not be a saving, but I can assure the Minister that there will be an additional cost factor in all this.</P>
      <P>Let me paint the scenario in relation to my own hospital, Ardkeen General Hospital, Waterford.  Our casualty department at present is staffed by a very junior doctor, in some cases perhaps only a day or two out of medical school.  We have repeatedly appealed to the Minister and his Department for a casualty officer of some years' seniority, but this request has been refused.  That is another example of the cut-backs that you so rigorously opposed in opposition, only to re-introduce them when you returned to power. Such a junior doctor is not in a position to take on too much responsibility.  In order to protect himself or herself this young doctor will send a patient for a battery of tests and x-rays which in most instances are not required at all.  So again I ask you, Minister, where is the saving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Cheann-Comhairle An Leas-Cheann-Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann-Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, through the Chair, where the saving will <Col N="1610" /> arise here?  This young doctor will then most probably refer the patient to the out-patient department to be seen by a more senior doctor, resulting in additional costs.  Not only that, it will put an additional burden on the already overstretched hospital services because of the other cut-backs advocated by the Minister.</P>
      <P>In my own South-Eastern Health Board region we are expected to cut back services this year to the tune of £3.5 million. Among the cut-backs advocated is a reduction in jobs of between 150 and 200.  The Minister well knows that our hospitals are already understaffed and they are now being asked to cater for an additional volume of patients.  All this, mark you, from a Minister who has advocated that the emphasis must be taken off hospital medicine and brought back to the community.  If this is not a catch 22 situation, I do not know what is.  On the one hand he suggests that the medical cards be removed from the people and the students, as a result sending them back into the hospitals, while on the other hand in major policy statements on health he advocates that the emphasis must be placed on community medicine. The Minister cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>If the young people are allowed to see their own GPs the likelihood is that they would deal with the problem on the spot and there would be no additional referral and no additional cost.  I understand that the Minister said again tonight that, although the medical cards will be withdrawn from the students, they will be in a position to avail of free hospital and consultancy service.  In other words, they will be entitled to a hospital services card. Big deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, if their income is below £12,000 they will be entitled to it.  I do not deny that a critical review of the various schemes is not only prudent but a good exercise.  However, in relation to this plan such a review must take into account the special needs of students, the likely consequences of the change and <Col N="1611" /> the cost effectiveness.  I believe that I have shown conclusively that as a cost effective exercise this is a non-starter.  I have no doubt that when the Minister and his officials sit down at the end of the year to review the Department of Health expenditure they will find that they have spent extra money rather than saved. What bothers me about that is that this money may have to be cut off from something else.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this decision, particularly with reference to grant-aided students. There is no way in which they will be able to pay for their medicines right now.</P>

I use the phrase &ldquo;unbelievable situation&rdquo; advisedly because if any degree of logic or common sense prevailed within the Government, if any of its members had any common sense or degree of humanity, they would never have entertained the idea of embarking on this destructive course of what I might describe as economic madness.</P>

      <P>Our biggest asset &mdash; and I would hope the Minister might see this &mdash; is our youth population.  As the House is well aware, we have the highest percentage of population under the age of 25 years of any country within the EEC.  These young people have an absolute right to every possible support from the Government of the day.  They need to be nurtured, supported, educated, <Col N="1613" /> helped and protected in every way possible by the Government but they are not.  Instead, on this occasion, they have been singled out especially by the Minister for Health and his Government to be discriminated against mercilessly.  Perhaps I should be more benign to the Minister and his Government; perhaps they were not specifically selected.  Perhaps the Minister and his Government were engaged in an exercise in which the students had their names pulled out of the economic hat, just as the old age pensioners Deputy Ormonde mentioned a short while ago, or a large percentage of them, had their medical cards removed by the Minister, irrespective of any protests the Minister may make.  We had given a medical card to every single old age pensioner in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps these young people were unlucky in that their names were pulled out of the economic hat.  But that is a very bad excuse and very poor consolation to them.  It is becoming somewhat of a cliché.  But we are beginning to become fed up when we look at the performance of this Government.  That all our children, boys and girls, should be cherished equally and cared for equally and fairly: if we are to follow any kind of a just and moral diktat certainly that is the policy we should have.  But that does <Col N="1614" /> not appear to be the policy of the Minister and his Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in reply to written questions submitted by me last week &mdash; in which I endeavoured to elict some specific information regarding the numbers of students and the cost involved in treating them &mdash; informed me that approximately 120,000 students between the ages of 16 and 25 years were eligible for medical treatment last year under the general medical services and that the estimated cost of treating them was £3,500,000.  He informed me also that this would have involved approximately 275,000 consultations during the year, giving an average consultation per student of just about 2.5 visits to a doctor per student per year.  In answering my questions the Minister did not have precise figures; his Department did not have the precise figures.  Yet he was able to rush along madly and decide he would remove medical cards from students on 1 January last.  He was working on estimates.  Had the Minister taken the trouble to peruse even the estimated figures or statistics available to him before rushing head over heels into removing medical cards from these students he would have seen that all of those students, young boys and girls &mdash; on whose future our country is dependent &mdash; have behaved very responsibly with regard to their free medical treatment.  They did not embark on doctor-visiting sprees. They have used the services judiciously and prudently and showed remarkable responsibility.  Have the Minister and his Government the right to punish them for their careful and responsible use of those services?  I say neither he nor his Government has that right.  Furthermore I contend that two-thirds of our student population who have been stripped of their medical cards by this cruel, inhuman, miserly, uncaring Minister and his Government over there have every reason to feel aggrieved and annoyed. Just in case the Minister does not know &mdash; and I do not believe he does &mdash; they feel not just aggrieved and annoyed but dismayed and despondent because they feel this constitutes one more step by the Minister and his Government in their <Col N="1615" /> anti-youth policy undertaken since they came into power.</P>
    <P>Last week my colleague, Deputy H. Byrne, was informed by the Minister that the estimated cost of treating each student last year was £27.  Surely that is a very small price for the Government to pay in order to ensure that the physical and medical health of our young people is maintained to optimum level?  The Minister, in attempting to explain the reasons for taking this unholy decision, centres his argument on the anomaly that existed in allowing all students to hold medical cards.  Surely the Minister must know that anomalies abound in many other areas.  It would be impossible to correct all of them.  I might give a few examples by way of explanation.  In deciding eligibility of a child for a disabled person's maintenance allowance the assessment is made irrespective of the parents' means.  The Minister must realise also that, say, parents have boys or girls aged 18, these parents not holding medical cards in their own right &mdash; and those boys or girls undertake an AnCO course, those boys or girls are assessed on their means at that time in determining whether or not they should hold medical cards.  Obviously they would be deemed eligible.  However, the other unfortunate boys or girls aged 18 years who wish to pursue third level education will not get a medical card because their parents are over the eligibility limit.  That is discrimination against particular types of students and could even be termed discrimination within a family unit.  The Minister should have looked at all the other anomalies before he concentrated on this anomaly.</P>
    <P>I have pondered the question of the legality of this ministerial order and I hope the Minister will clarify the position.  I should like the Minister to pay attention to what I am saying: he is so uninterested in the students that he is having a chat with his party colleague. Where are the rest of the Labour Party? They are sulking in the background.  Has the Minister the legal right to lower the living standards of students without <Col N="1616" /> recourse to the judgment of Dáil Éireann?  Even if he has the right, he should have sought the advice and views of Members of this House before deciding to strip students of their medical cards.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise the anxiety which his decision is causing for parents who now have to ensure that their children have money in their pockets for standby medical emergencies.  The Minister must also know that young people tend to be indifferent about their health. Young people are usually healthy and think that the pain they may get is something that will go tomorrow or the day after.  They do not rush to see doctors and the figures provided by the Department prove that this is so.  Many young people, even those with medical cards, which were an insurance to prevent neglect, dilly dallied when going to doctors. The Minister has now added an extra obstruction to prevent those young boys and girls from being diagnosed properly and receiving treatment.  He has added a monetary constraint to ensure that those boys and girls could perhaps neglect their health.  If that happens I would not like to be a member of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for parents nowadays to budget for the cost of an emergency. We all know that visiting doctors and paying for drugs on a private basis can be very expensive.  The medical card was a cushion which ensured that they could go to a doctor without costing them or their parents any money.  The Minister must know that 40 per cent of the 8,500 or so students at UCD &mdash; this also applies in all the other third level colleges &mdash; live away from home.  These young boys and girls and their parents have enough stress and strain in relation to their studies, the worry of examinations and their future careers without this added imposition. The Minister seems out of touch with reality just as the Government are.  Living in the quiet security of Dún Laoghaire seems to have made the Minister blind to the inherent dangers which may ensue as a result of his miserly policies.  The Minister must realise that the new poor are the middle income group and these comprise <Col N="1617" /> most of the parents of students in third level colleges.  Most are just above the eligibility limits for medical cards and are struggling to pay mortgages, with car HP repayments, PAYE and attempting to provide the best possible education for their children.</P>

      <P>They are just above the eligibility limit for the general medical service and the Minister is imposing extra costs on them.  The Minister must know every single £1 added on to the cost of the middle income group is an unbearable burden and becoming increasingly so.  If he does not realise this he is living in cloud cuckoo land and the sooner he comes down to earth the better.  Most parents do not live in millionaire's row, they are in the middle income group.  It is particularly sad that a Minister for Health, a member of the so-called socialist group, a trendy leftie, has for the sake of power, sacrificed every principle which they tried to lead the public to believe they had.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was in opposition he spoke about our inferior health service.  He said we would never have a proper health service until medical attention was free to all.  When he took office he said that the health service was far too good and that we must take medical cards away from students.  He also said we must cut back on our hospitals, that nobody can get sick on a Saturday or Sunday and that a woman must have a baby at a stated time.  The Minister should not be proud of the job he has done on the medical service.  It was hypocritical of him to speak the way he did in opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that he objected to the idea that there should be a means test for anybody between the ages of 16 and 25 years.  We are very proud of the fact that people over the age of 16 were means tested in their own right and that those over 16 years of age who had no income got medical cards.  We are very proud of that, that is what we are voting on tonight and that is what Deputy Pattison will vote against.</P>
      <P>He mentioned the cut-backs in the service and blamed them on Fianna Fáil. The year 1983 was the worst case of financial mismanagement in the last decade, and it is because of that mismanagement that the Minister rushed in and made this decision on 16 December to be implemented on 1 January, even though that was not possible in all health board areas. He gave universities and other third level institutions two weeks to make alternative arrangements for their students so that they would have a proper level of health care.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, went back 130 years to 1850 and told us that the State had accepted a responsibility for ensuring that no one was denied access to medical care because of inability to pay.  We believe and we are concerned that as a result of this decision many students and others between the ages of 16 and 25 years will find that they are unable to pay for this service.  Already parents are struggling to keep their children in third level education.  They are struggling mainly as a result of this Government's policies.  Parents with large families received no extra children's allowance last year and this year they are faced with 8 per cent VAT on clothes.</P>
      <P>Tonight the Minister showed us a memorandum he got from the Department of Finance about the removal of medical cards.  I believe the Minister for Health should make his own decisions. He should not be a rubber-stamp for the Minister for Finance or anybody else. Fianna Fáil did not withdraw medical cards from anybody between the ages of 16 and 25 years.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the hospital services are the most expensive of the health services and their availability without charge, irrespective of family circumstances, is a concession which should alleviate any possibility of hardship. In other words, the Minister is encouraging students who get sick in digs or in flats to go to the casualty department of a hospital.  As Deputy Ormonde pointed out, that will cost more at the end of the year.  I fail to understand the philosophy that suggests the son of a millionaire should get free hospitalisation while somebody down the country with £126 per week and three children will be denied the general medical services.

I accept from the Minister that no health cards have been taken away by the Southern Health Board to date under the scheme for the withdrawal <Col N="1625" /> of medical cards.

      <P>This will cause unnecessary hardship for a large number of people, particularly parents who are just above the medical card limit and those in the lower middle income group.  The <Col N="1626" /> Minister referred to people in the upper middle income group as being able to pay for two visits a year, but he did not say anything about those in the lower middle income group who have no medical cards.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that the Minister did not see this problem in the same light as the Taoiseach apparently saw it when it was put to him yesterday in Trinity College.  He promised the students that he would consider their reservations about the plan to withdraw the medical cards.  He promised to pursue their claims and invited them to make a written submission to the Cabinet.  I am surprised the Minister did not endorse that.</P>

      <P>Did the Government consult the Youth Council?  They promised they would consult them on economic and social affairs.  Did they consult them before they made this decision?  The Government's amendment calls on the Dáil to endorse the Government's decision to withdraw certain health services from persons aged between 16 and 25 years.  I am asking Deputies opposite if they do not agree with that decision to come into the lobby with the Fianna Fáil Party who are totally opposed to that decision.  Two years ago in Private Members' Time the Government of the day were defeated on a motion like this.  It did not have any effect on the Government or bring them down.  They were able to carry on and there is no reason why those Deputies who feel for parents and students should not go into the lobby with Fianna Fáil and ensure that this motion is carried and that medical services are restored to persons between the ages of 16 and 25 years.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That amendment No. 1 be made&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the pending closure of the firm referred to.  I understand that this development is due to continuing losses and to depressed market conditions which have resulted in serious overcapacity in the structural steel sector.  Such overcapacity severely constrains the State agencies in taking effective measures to bring about a restructuring of the company.  However, the IDA are taking all possible steps to secure the establishment of a project or projects which will provide alternative employment for the workers affected by the closure.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are currently 62 people employed in this firm.</P>

I am satisfied that, consistent with our EEC obligations and the need to ensure that public money is being spent to the best advantage, the Industrial Development Authority make every effort to maximise the use of Irish goods and services in the construction of advance factories.  About 80 per cent of the cabling used in the advance factory in New Ross was made by an Irish firm.</P>

As indicated in my reply to Question No. 265 put down by the Deputy on 18 January 1984, the original applications submitted by Limerick County Council were the subject of consultations between the Department and the Council.  Arising from these consultations, revised proposals were submitted by the Council on 30 November 1983, which were accompanied by further speed limit proposals.  Outstanding information required for the drafting of revised speed limit regulations was obtained from the council on 27 January and I now expect to be in a position to make the necessary regulations by the end of this month.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 23 November 1983 but his claim was disallowed up to 22 December 1983 on the ground that he lost his employment through circumstances within his own control.  He appealed against the disallowance and an oral hearing of his case has been arranged to take place on 6 February 1984.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, unemployment benefit was authorised at £57.35 weekly from 23 December 1983 and pay-related benefit was authorised at £24.07 weekly from 10 January 1983 being the maximum rates appropriate in his case.</P>
      <P>All benefit due to date has been paid to him and further payments of unemployment benefit and payrelated benefit at the combined weekly rate of £81.42 are continuing as they become due.</P>
